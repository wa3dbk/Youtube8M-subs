 marcelo guards of candle workshops today 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.880
 I 'm going to show you the distribution and 12.4 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:29.500
 here as you can see this is a 2.45 engine 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.390
 this is the distribution in 2.4 has two 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.190
 trees 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.579
 to the head 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:42.480
 what you see here is a problem not of 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:42.480
 I support the belt that is here 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.550
 this one that is here 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:54.550
 it is the green keep and on it 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.550
 distribution belt what is here 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.460
 the water pump 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.510
 can see better 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.489
 what is here 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.369
 and the water pump itself to take out the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.820
 water pump you have to remove all the 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.170
 plastic that is here for the pulleys of 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.310
 the trees because the pump is 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.310
 hidden behind this plastic 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:28.750
 at the time 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.750
 - this is a 2.4 water pump 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.020
 look how the pallets are completely 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.560
 Rusty 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.500
 there are times that these fins eat that 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.320
 they split or sometimes they turn in false 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.810
 turbine and there is no circulating circulation 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.509
 Water 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.630
 is the water pump this is the 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.729
 intense problem 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.039
 of construction 2.4 this is the 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.170
 not original problem nowadays it is no longer 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.570
 get this ruleman an oak is placed 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.460
 alternative sleeve that the support that 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.310
 they come here it 's different you have to change it 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.659
 with full support if you go and 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.700
 they buy they will see that they are not going to 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.679
 offer already to this one they are going to offer you another 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.610
 very similar problem but with different 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.090
 supports that also goes well 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.390
 if these are double seas that go in the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.120
 rulemÃ¡n this is here 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.370
 in the roller this support in this roller 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.900
 of support are placed all the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.049
 Germans respect the same thing I said 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.510
 it's a simple distribution points 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:35.319
 as you will see they are located here only 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.140
 we mark the true points of the of 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:42.060
 the wise in confronted here and in the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.060
 distributed in the stork part 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.350
 It is located here 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.370
 here 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.140
 and here remember whenever you go to 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.150
 change the construction try 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.210
 change yes or yes the water pump like 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.380
 We said that if it is here below 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.730
 prior to taking out the plastic and 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.170
 step you see how are you holding them from 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.170
 spoke of cam and others 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.460
 as you can see 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.650
 it's a simple instruction if you have to 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.040
 disassemble several plastics and a support 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.660
 of engine that is here 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.970
 the live po strap 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.400
 and in this case in this stressed engine 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.560
 by the same alternator has a lehman 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.180
 of support but the strap for free 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.340
 stressed by the slide of the 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.280
 alternator yes 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.200
 good 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.490
 I leave you until next time and remember 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.770

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.060
