of<00:00:11.940> difficult<00:00:12.090> it's<00:00:12.630> looks<00:00:13.590> weird<00:00:13.920> it<00:00:14.160> looks

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
of difficult it's looks weird it looks

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.550 
of difficult it's looks weird it looks
simple<00:00:14.610> but<00:00:14.790> it's<00:00:15.690> not<00:00:15.750> as<00:00:15.929> simple<00:00:16.139> as<00:00:16.350> it

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
simple but it's not as simple as it

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.340 
simple but it's not as simple as it
seems<00:00:17.630> actually<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.690> think<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:18.960> simple

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
seems actually I think it is simple

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.279 
seems actually I think it is simple
nevermind<00:00:20.279> scratch<00:00:20.670> all<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.869> level<00:00:22.050> is

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
nevermind scratch all that this level is

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.759 
nevermind scratch all that this level is
simple<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:22.920> should<00:00:23.820> be<00:00:23.939> beaten<00:00:24.560> the<00:00:25.560> first

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
simple and should be beaten the first

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.950 
simple and should be beaten the first

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
time to try to play just take your time

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.760 
time to try to play just take your time
at<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.660> this<00:00:33.660> if<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.230> too<00:00:34.380> hard<00:00:34.530> for<00:00:34.620> you

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
at it this if it is too hard for you

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.310 
at it this if it is too hard for you
just<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:36.000> know<00:00:36.090> just<00:00:36.300> take<00:00:36.450> your<00:00:36.540> time<00:00:39.320> this

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
just you know just take your time this

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.740 
just you know just take your time this
littles<00:00:40.590> hard<00:00:40.770> though<00:00:41.270> this<00:00:42.270> level<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.860> hard

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
littles hard though this level is hard

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.869 
littles hard though this level is hard
like<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.890> probably<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.399> second<00:00:47.760> hardest

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
like this is probably the second hardest

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.510 
like this is probably the second hardest
level<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.390> aim<00:00:48.680> maybe<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.829> third<00:00:50.070> hardest

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
level in the aim maybe the third hardest

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.729 
level in the aim maybe the third hardest
I'm<00:00:50.670> not<00:00:50.789> sure<00:00:53.629> that's<00:00:54.629> excluding<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.260> Atari

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
I'm not sure that's excluding the Atari

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.350 
I'm not sure that's excluding the Atari
bonus<00:00:56.070> levels<00:00:56.399> which<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.789> haven't<00:00:57.090> even<00:00:57.180> looked

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
bonus levels which I haven't even looked

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.479 
bonus levels which I haven't even looked
at<00:00:57.480> those<00:00:57.600> levels<00:00:57.840> yet<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.320> I'm<00:00:59.070> guessing

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
at those levels yet and I'm guessing

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:11.960 
at those levels yet and I'm guessing
those<00:00:59.609> are<00:00:59.670> going<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.910> be<00:01:00.000> even<00:01:00.210> harder

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.649 

this<00:01:12.540> kind<00:01:12.840> Kali<00:01:13.530> what<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.800> did

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.809 

anyways<00:01:17.409> yeah<00:01:17.619> I<00:01:17.649> slowed<00:01:18.249> this<00:01:18.399> down<00:01:18.609> a<00:01:18.640> little

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:18.819 
anyways yeah I slowed this down a little

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:21.109 
anyways yeah I slowed this down a little
bit<00:01:19.030> just<00:01:19.329> so<00:01:19.420> I<00:01:19.509> could<00:01:19.600> talk<00:01:20.409> more<00:01:20.679> about<00:01:20.770> it

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
bit just so I could talk more about it

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.399 
bit just so I could talk more about it
because<00:01:22.119> some<00:01:22.569> of<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.689> other<00:01:22.780> babies<00:01:23.049> went<00:01:23.259> by

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
because some of the other babies went by

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.249 
because some of the other babies went by
too<00:01:23.469> fast<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:25.450> anyways<00:01:27.810> here<00:01:28.810> what<00:01:28.990> we<00:01:29.049> want<00:01:29.200> to

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
too fast so anyways here what we want to

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.199 
too fast so anyways here what we want to
do<00:01:29.409> is<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.920> this<00:01:33.399> little<00:01:33.609> easier<00:01:34.030> than

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:34.209 
do is just this little easier than

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:35.340 
do is just this little easier than
another<00:01:34.420> level<00:01:34.659> it<00:01:34.719> looks<00:01:34.869> similar<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.319> this

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
another level it looks similar to this

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.010 
another level it looks similar to this
that's<00:01:35.950> earlier<00:01:36.310> in<00:01:36.399> the<00:01:36.490> game<00:01:36.539> so<00:01:37.539> you

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
that's earlier in the game so you

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.209 
that's earlier in the game so you
shouldn't<00:01:38.229> have<00:01:38.409> too<00:01:38.560> much<00:01:38.590> trouble<00:01:38.709> beating

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
shouldn't have too much trouble beating

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:45.209 
shouldn't have too much trouble beating
this<00:01:39.310> level<00:01:39.640> and<00:01:43.380> yes<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.590> music<00:01:44.709> skipping

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
this level and yes the music skipping

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:50.410 
this level and yes the music skipping
again

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.830 

it's<00:01:50.960> my<00:01:51.080> cheap<00:01:51.560> hardware<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.840> cheap

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
it's my cheap hardware and cheap

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:04.690 
it's my cheap hardware and cheap
download<00:01:54.619> software

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.870 

ah<00:02:04.820> this<00:02:05.539> was<00:02:05.930> hard

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
ah this was hard

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.809 
ah this was hard
this<00:02:08.479> it's<00:02:08.959> hard<00:02:09.289> but<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.800> means<00:02:09.950> it's<00:02:10.280> a<00:02:10.489> short

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
this it's hard but it means it's a short

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.670 
this it's hard but it means it's a short
level<00:02:11.209> so<00:02:11.510> it's<00:02:12.200> kind<00:02:12.410> of<00:02:12.440> frustrating

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
level so it's kind of frustrating

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.180 
level so it's kind of frustrating
because<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.370> just<00:02:14.260> like<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.470> keep<00:02:15.800> having<00:02:15.950> do

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
because you just like you keep having do

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.470 
because you just like you keep having do
the<00:02:16.310> same<00:02:16.519> thing<00:02:16.670> over<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:16.910> over<00:02:17.030> again<00:02:17.180> if

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
the same thing over and over again if

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.360 
the same thing over and over again if
you<00:02:17.660> keep<00:02:17.810> dying<00:02:18.110> but<00:02:19.040> it's<00:02:19.160> not<00:02:19.190> as

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
you keep dying but it's not as

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.460 
you keep dying but it's not as
frustrating<00:02:20.000> at<00:02:20.090> some<00:02:20.300> levels<00:02:20.630> since<00:02:21.349> you

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
frustrating at some levels since you

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.860 
frustrating at some levels since you
won't<00:02:21.650> get<00:02:21.769> so<00:02:22.130> far<00:02:22.310> in<00:02:22.430> loveland<00:02:22.849> I<00:02:23.030> don't<00:02:23.599> you

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
we need to hit your head on the ceiling

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.500 
we need to hit your head on the ceiling
to<00:02:32.209> make<00:02:32.420> it<00:02:32.510> through<00:02:32.720> those<00:02:32.900> jumps<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:34.510> your
