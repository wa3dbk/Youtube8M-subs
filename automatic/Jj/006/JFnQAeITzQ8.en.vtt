00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.190 
doesn't show up on finder on on Mac I
tried<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.300> other<00:01:41.450> computers<00:01:41.900> in<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.050> house

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
tried to other computers in the house

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.210

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
and it doesn't work so this is either a

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.090 
and it doesn't work so this is either a

with this phone I didn't want to admit

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.750 
with this phone I didn't want to admit
it<00:02:11.230> because<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.650> phone<00:02:11.800> is<00:02:11.830> was<00:02:12.459> really

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
it because the phone is was really

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.390 
it because the phone is was really
really<00:02:13.270> cool<00:02:13.510> for<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.780> first<00:02:13.810> four<00:02:14.200> months

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
really cool for the first four months

now and I think that it's just it would
just<00:02:19.840> be<00:02:19.930> better<00:02:20.080> just<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.500> have<00:02:21.370> something

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880
