crazy in this 10 gallon tank you can see
where<00:00:16.699> the<00:00:17.699> rotala<00:00:18.060> indica<00:00:18.390> just<00:00:18.750> sprouted<00:00:19.320> up

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
where the rotala indica just sprouted up

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.179 
where the rotala indica just sprouted up
in<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.650> back<00:00:19.920> it's<00:00:20.820> got<00:00:20.939> some<00:00:21.270> nice<00:00:22.189> nice

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
bright and even has red a little bit of

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.029 
bright and even has red a little bit of
reddish<00:00:27.390> in<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.750> at<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> top<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.590> can't<00:00:28.800> see

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
reddish in it at the top you can't see

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:29.330 
reddish in it at the top you can't see
it

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
it

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.609 
it
with<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.670> camera<00:00:29.939> but<00:00:30.289> it's<00:00:31.289> got<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.470> little

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
with this camera but it's got a little

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.750 
with this camera but it's got a little
pink<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.390> it's<00:00:33.390> growing<00:00:33.660> algae<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:34.170> my<00:00:34.290> glass

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
pink you it's growing algae on my glass

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.430 
pink you it's growing algae on my glass
so<00:00:35.760> it's<00:00:35.910> definitely<00:00:36.270> powerful<00:00:37.050> enough<00:00:37.290> to

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
so it's definitely powerful enough to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.100 
so it's definitely powerful enough to
grow<00:00:37.649> low<00:00:38.640> light<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.329> 10<00:00:39.570> gallon<00:00:39.960> tank<00:00:40.969> as

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
grow low light in a 10 gallon tank as

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.340 
grow low light in a 10 gallon tank as
well<00:00:43.110> as<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:44.040> know<00:00:44.160> probably<00:00:44.399> some<00:00:44.960> mid<00:00:45.960> to

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
well as you know probably some mid to

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.889 
well as you know probably some mid to
low<00:00:46.530> light<00:00:46.800> plants<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> 5<00:00:48.329> gallon<00:00:48.539> tank

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
low light plants in like a 5 gallon tank

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.619 
low light plants in like a 5 gallon tank
where<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.320> light<00:00:49.500> can<00:00:49.789> fully<00:00:50.789> extend<00:00:51.360> from

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
where the light can fully extend from

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.240 
where the light can fully extend from
side<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.870> side<00:00:52.020> there's<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.680> gets<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.129> little

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
side to side there's it gets a little

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.189 
side to side there's it gets a little
darker<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.850> corners<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.629> 10<00:00:54.840> gallon

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
darker in the corners on this 10 gallon

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.029 
darker in the corners on this 10 gallon
because<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.500> doesn't<00:00:55.800> fully<00:00:57.770> for<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> light

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
because it doesn't fully for a light

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.099 
because it doesn't fully for a light
from<00:00:59.579> end<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.879> end<00:00:59.969> just<00:01:00.390> because<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.780> like

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
from end to end just because it's like

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.579 
from end to end just because it's like
probably<00:01:02.090> 10<00:01:03.090> inch<00:01:03.270> long<00:01:03.480> light<00:01:03.750> 9<00:01:04.170> inch<00:01:04.379> long

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
probably 10 inch long light 9 inch long

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.880 
probably 10 inch long light 9 inch long
light<00:01:05.659> but<00:01:06.659> yeah<00:01:06.780> it's<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.049> good<00:01:07.170> light<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.680> like

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
light but yeah it's a good light I like

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.410 
light but yeah it's a good light I like
it<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.280> 10<00:01:08.490> gallon<00:01:08.850> I'm<00:01:08.939> gonna<00:01:09.060> keep<00:01:09.299> it

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420
