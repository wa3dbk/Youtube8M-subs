online<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.540> thought<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.590> wasn't<00:01:58.829> gonna

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
online I thought that it wasn't gonna

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.380 
online I thought that it wasn't gonna
have<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.250> base<00:01:59.520> color<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.850> thought<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.180> was<00:02:00.299> just

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
have a base color I thought it was just

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.870

gonna be red glitter onto my nails and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.219 
gonna be red glitter onto my nails and
then<00:02:03.000> I'd<00:02:03.090> have<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.360> paint<00:02:03.659> another<00:02:03.810> base

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
then I'd have to paint another base

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.440 
then I'd have to paint another base
color<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.649> sort<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.549> hands<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.060> look<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:06.390> I

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450
