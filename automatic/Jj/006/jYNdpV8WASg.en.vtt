00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.900 
think because some of the sugar pill
ones<00:04:31.520> I<00:04:31.639> think<00:04:31.850> on<00:04:32.120> that<00:04:32.720> great<00:04:33.290> but<00:04:33.889> they<00:04:34.730> do

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
ones I think on that great but they do

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.360 
ones I think on that great but they do
still<00:04:35.419> look<00:04:35.630> nice<00:04:35.870> while<00:04:36.350> they're<00:04:36.650> looking

still look nice while they're looking
good<00:04:37.400> another<00:04:38.300> thing<00:04:38.510> about<00:04:38.690> these<00:04:38.870> is<00:04:38.930> they

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
good another thing about these is they

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.670
