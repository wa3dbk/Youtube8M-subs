00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589

black one I thought that the white will
just<00:00:56.739> get<00:00:56.859> too<00:00:57.100> dirty<00:00:57.249> for<00:00:57.399> me<00:00:57.609> so<00:00:57.819> I<00:00:57.850> decided

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
just get too dirty for me so I decided

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.139 
just get too dirty for me so I decided

against my original assumption with

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.369 
against my original assumption with
going<00:01:01.359> with<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:01.539> white<00:01:02.369> but<00:01:03.369> i<00:01:03.399> like<00:01:03.579> it<00:01:03.609> i<00:01:04.379> can

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
going with the white but i like it i can

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.610

a<00:05:29.750> bit<00:05:29.960> faster<00:05:30.440> and<00:05:30.680> I<00:05:31.300> think<00:05:32.300> you'll<00:05:32.509> you'll

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
a bit faster and I think you'll you'll

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.219 
a bit faster and I think you'll you'll
you'll<00:05:32.949> agree<00:05:33.949> here<00:05:34.250> but<00:05:34.460> you<00:05:34.789> know<00:05:34.880> obviously

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
you'll agree here but you know obviously

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.439 
you'll agree here but you know obviously
it<00:05:36.229> doesn't<00:05:36.440> play<00:05:36.710> well<00:05:36.889> when<00:05:37.190> I'm<00:05:37.389> when<00:05:38.389> I'm

it doesn't play well when I'm when I'm
demoing<00:05:38.810> for<00:05:39.080> some<00:05:39.229> reason<00:05:39.560> i<00:05:39.710> think<00:05:40.370> the

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
demoing for some reason i think the

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.860 
demoing for some reason i think the
network's<00:05:40.759> about<00:05:41.030> as<00:05:41.150> bad<00:05:41.300> as<00:05:41.479> it<00:05:41.570> was<00:05:41.599> when<00:05:41.810> it
