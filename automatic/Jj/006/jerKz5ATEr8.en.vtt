00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello to you peace of fun and today 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.529
 we have two phones 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.990
 even choose a microphone 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.139
 unpack I think let's start with 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.750
 Kubota immediately recognizes that the parcel 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.869
 let's remove the garbage immediately admit that 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.140
 packages still came before the new year on 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.010
 in about two days and I did not 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.560
 unpack and unpack your 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.849
 after the tenths of January. give already 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.890
 holidays are over 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.070
 but first we digress then 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.370
 they said that with the sound of trouble well yes here 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.940
 on the balcony around plastic and probably 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.610
 so give vibrations some sound and 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.739
 so I’ve got the microphone long ago 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.960
 the thread is still unpacked 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.579
 everything will not be delayed a little unpacking 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.289
 although we were thicker then 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.059
 unhappy that it was delayed 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:01.940
 but today I will make a microphone try with 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.940
 do not know what the sound will be better 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.070
 imagine what the mic is about 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.380
 began ordering a microphone in china with 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.939
 microphones with headphones in China trouble 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.470
 very difficult to find quality 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.049
 looking at the reviews on the microphone and I realized 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.460
 what is easier to buy here and it costs 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:27.950
 this is jenny's famous buttonhole nc worth 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:32.759
 just something in my 150 rubles or something 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.140
 for those who are not from Russia 3 dollars 44 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.780
 the dollar is worth letting 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.369
 roughly 4 dollars worth that's it 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.119
 it is a simple construction 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.009
 Now I will connect it and you will listen as 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.229
 I will not understand the sound with her 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.890
 so I only know when I will be 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.060
 to mount 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.060
 Well, we connect 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.069
 honestly I'm shocked wake up 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.510
 getting ready to do unpacking now 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.400
 prepared a little bit looked 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.630
 characteristics and was ready to do 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.680
 unpacking on cubot p9 and even started 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.020
 talk about him 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.900
 well then let's ak bot if again 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:45.459
 tell him tell you saidiku kubota what 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:48.570
 Meshadi c1 or malsagov generally written 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:55.180
 May I read for some reason mysaga 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:57.430
 processor mtk 6572 w so processor us 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.330
 same but phone and different let's 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.330
 nets this business 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.670
 away from here we drop the book 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.040
 user benefit guide 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.200
 the smartphone is for us Russians 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.470
 buyers are put in cows 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:15.750
 such a box principle pretty 2 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:18.630
 so that we have a decent machine too 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.209
 4 inch diagonal as far as I understand 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.959
 the processor you've already heard the videos themselves 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.640
 accelerator just now I will not say 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:32.250
 let's turn it on then because I 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:36.070
 not prepared and we will just watch 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:40.440
 like you i will see him the first time 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:45.820
 almost without remembering anything about it so 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:49.540
 battery as always was sealed and 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.400
 how much do we have it so food 350 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.190
 milliampere hours well for such a diagonal 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.299
 In principle, that's enough, although I would like to 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.299
 probably all the same more 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.900
 so this phone is so active and not 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.150
 advertised and I bought it purely 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:15.820
 chance if there were probably happy 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:18.380
 Hauer and I just would not even see him 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.500
 the glossy back surface is already visible 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:27.380
 prints 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:29.740
 well let's turn on so may saga let's 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:36.700
 let's see for now in the box 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:40.850
 so firm yusbi what micro yusb here 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:43.610
 beautiful flight so here immediately for our 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.350
 my rosettes so my saga let's so 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.720
 and we will call provided 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.090
 transition 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.700
 Well done, I already like it and 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.270
 headphones we have not seen for a long time 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.400
 also branded atma saga 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:02.930
 give the headphones a little bit 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:05.660
 let's look at the headphones 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:10.100
 it is generally great value now 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:12.230
 virtually no company 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.120
 Chinese smartphone manufacturer 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.010
 now very rarely 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.630
 More precisely not one not puts but and very 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:23.260
 rarely do they put in -channel here 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.850
 headphones up branded 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.720
 lucky so let's go to the very 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.720
 most smartphone 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:36.050
 so don't call us no need we need 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:42.410
 look first in the settings 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:47.120
 what's interesting is so no no we 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:50.240
 not needed and not needed we need about 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.620
 Android phone 4 2 2 principle already 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.430
 not bad when is the last time he 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:59.120
 updated updated our phone 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:01.280
 Last time in September, too bad 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.650
 all see the Russian language last 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.700
 time with russian language is stressful 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.770
 occurs at 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:11.970
 chinese smartphones but that's all because 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:15.630
 what I suppose did not look at last 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:18.450
 I don’t know where the phone is 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:21.300
 here it is on this little phone 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.470
 which I should have removed the review from 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.800
 he has certain problems 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:29.010
 there is no Russian language there 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.970
 I tried to flash and the whole thing is very 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.980
 ended badly 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:38.940
 ok now we don't talk to him 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:42.090
 here the Russian language is so everything is fine 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:45.330
 principle translated play market too with us 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:48.780
 in place youtube true old version but 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:51.060
 in place everything basically translated 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:54.960
 normal let's see in the gallery that 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:58.290
 there is nothing there maybe we are now 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:05.130
 we can immediately and make a picture here 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:10.180
 autofocus unfortunately well let's 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:12.520
 let's see 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.860
 start two touches once so here 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:18.810
 brings this one phone that he 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.810
 so now showed there so does not approach
