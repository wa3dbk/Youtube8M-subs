00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.020
 where 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.960
 Hello everyone and welcome to the test that 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.700
 mobile the application that I love you 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.559
 teaching is a very useful application for 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.340
 all those who like to touch the 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.230
 guitar and that's good, they do not know everything 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.869
 enough to fine-tune the 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.989
 guitar has heard things that really 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.759
 happens to me then this application is 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.350
 pretty good you will find in the 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.750
 google play 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.850
 and come to replace to lie I have it 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.710
 here 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.710
 look substitute this match 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.559
 is the one that I used to fine tune the 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.960
 guitar as you see enchufa I put toco 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.120
 the guitar and I go indicating if it's 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.520
 well tuned I can not assure you that 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.720
 this application is quite better than 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.610
 is tuned let's see what is the 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.750
 application itself and we will connect it to 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.630
 Wifi 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.760
 and we're going to put it in the google play 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.760
 ok let's look 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.300
 shout 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.630
 Tunisia 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.420
 Applications 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.729
 guitart a sorry this is the application 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.729
 what to download 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.130
 As we can see, it has a rating of 5 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.890
 stars 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.619
 48 are very high valuations he 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.409
 guitart a guitar tuner and this 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:45.530
 is the application that we are going to use 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.530
 we got out of here and we looked for it 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.929
 As you can see, it has a very 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.030
 simple and what we are going to do is 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.409
 tuning rope by string and let's see 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.240
 what is the operation is put in 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.770
 auto mode although we could 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.680
 point out which string we want 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.630
 individually tune what 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.000
 me do you are in manual mode that the 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.830
 finalist or auto mode normally in 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.810
 auto mode identify very well the 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.390
 ropes and they do not have any kind of 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.940
 problem let's start with the letter i 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.940
 which is the smallest plastic front 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.819
 as we see is green means that 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.680
 It is very close to parked but 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.129
 you 're not quite at the end we 're going to 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.129
 go squeezing 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.730
 as we see it is very interesting once 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.560
 that the string is tuned here we 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.570
 a little green dot appears that is to say that 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.900
 this rope until end let's move on 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.900
 both 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.890
 another dot appears to say that 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.890
 until the end of the we went to the g 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.549
 from that room 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.960
 also is okay 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.579
 and it's also fine as once 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.660
 we have finished tuning the guitar 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:34.100
 we see that they are all in green 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.100
 and now we can play the guitar 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.750
 and 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.879
 we see that it sounds perfectly in the 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.519
 Good guitar is a very application 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.040
 useful I found it very interesting eye 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:51.160
 to tune any type of guitar 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.099
 it's very simple you do not have many options 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.709
 and really good I think here comes the 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.599
 right hand left good very 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.459
 simple to use and operate 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.380
 very well we see that he has a 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.970
 very high note hopefully you have 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.650
 liked that application and see you in a 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.650
 next chapter until another
