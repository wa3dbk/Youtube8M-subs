00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.700
 so the machine once plugged a 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.530
 once ready to serve how does one do a 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.180
 espresso to this machine then comes 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.650
 like with the saeco big marine early 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.240
 it's very simple to make a coffee and 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.710
 especially a little setting everything is so 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.599
 we have access for example via the key 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.939
 coffee beans to the cape strength and 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.320
 desired and then the via the keys 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.400
 preprogrammed to make a space will have 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.340
 a double an elongated coffee 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.140
 so here we can choose either coffee 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.140
 ground willem very little saw his arms all to 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.310
 does is directly the strength of the coffee 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.750
 the coffee of the airs and so that plays on the 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.100
 amount of coffee boyer basis weight 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.350
 we saw from 5 to 10 grams present 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.079
 there for example is one if the embryo 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.640
 valid via the old boys key has chosen 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.489
 so express it is the coffee and montgueux 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.890
 the demand that the tube is rich in 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.289
 track can be set hand on the firm 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.859
 so looking there the machine is a touch 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.539
 not near infusion too so 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.550
 after the merger allows to develop 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.890
 the whole aromatic palette of the 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.150
 grind injects at low pressure 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.550
 water feast of water things were going 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.790
 proudly says to me there quite and 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.260
 then machine will pass a beautiful 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.000
 extraction enter the stations where 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.590
 the state is recognized in the stations 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.650
 because the bond of the net that clears 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.460
 vice versa failures not 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.920
 once but it will cost briÃ¨re it is 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.660
 a troop of the extraction we will see 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.490
 in the layer of foam that secretes the 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.900
 surface 3 I will go even further as well 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.740
 palamos where I had seen on the cream when 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.940
 even really not his annoyance 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.450
 since it would do I think in the West 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.790
 under the wording agrees or not 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.260
 special needs listen we are 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.680
 in the current bars because I had 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.680
 everything says 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.040
 then also the seiko so great 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.060
 Big Barca does not just make coffee 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.680
 it also makes hot water for 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.880
 health possibly exactly one 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.220
 perversion and hot water so via the 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.450
 hot water nozzle that the 2 will see that more 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.590
 late 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.630
 so it's very simple so just 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.420
 take on his expanded glass company 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.280
 favorite and then access the menu 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.350
 special drink via the touch 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.130
 that attack smaller stars and 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.630
 choose the hot 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.820
 keira hidden menu between the kitchen 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.530
 special actually sees his special 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.730
 so there sir asks to insert the 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.790
 bioune the 2nd party 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.840
 yeah so we just have to validate and you 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.640
 will see that the distribution is very 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.140
 fast there is no tomatoes a time 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.580
 accurate sold directly is not everything 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.930
 wait especially do not give too much 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.890
 would trot things had not 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.510
 burning a lot at the right temperature 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.489
 for the star has a little fed up directly 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.500
 his drink so can not set 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.140
 volume if we can stop it too when 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.709
 we are when you're all 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.090
 configurable 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.530
 this machine the continuous and regular ge 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.090
 otherwise the progress and the 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.950
 pair the water and so the tulle what good 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.540
 choice is stopped we can stop when 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.540
 we want to super ok the post it 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.040
 so a sensitive part and that I like 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.420
 a lot the machine with the machines 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.490
 automatic now it's becoming 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.170
 easier to explain to listen with 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.640
 this one is very very simple 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.380
 take the carafe to fill it with 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.790
 fresh milk that comes out of the entire fridge 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.280
 to love written crime but no matter what 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.800
 it depends on the tastes and so it is enough 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.150
 to correctly insert the carafe with the 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.980
 milk is it a touch of direct access 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.160
 the adema cateau next door I think 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.510
 cappuccino 6 here is the circle 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.470
 so the machine guiding us is part of 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.250
 not to place the butte 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.300
 one can choose will consist agree 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.890
 so the machine at all in fact but 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.709
 just alia follow the directions she has 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.420
 quite so here let's remember the acamac 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.190
 atos and the milk froth and then 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.380
 she that the expression of a song on 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.200
 the measure for present three floors 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.310
 be reborn to the mayor hot the coffee 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.090
 so here we saw it not righteousness 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:47.530
 forget France so it's hot 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.239
 so the foam given first so the 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.440
 machine really does it all alone 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.890
 assured marc are very good 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.700
 temperature of a carousel at 12.1 fast 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.570
 sardaigne abortion is very 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.570
 appreciable 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.870
 so there the machine yes so flows 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.640
 the cafes the milk so the quantities 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.299
 are customizable dinner and can be 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.470
 then 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.790
 then she will automatically go 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.140
 on the reaction of espresso so 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.010
 like that under pressure with a very fusion 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:18.830
 an old man to normal 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.750
 3 propose to you to stick to our 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.430
 cited disappeared just lifted density 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.450
 basically the caf in the middle and the foam of 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.850
 milk that surround parts 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:34.670
 would immediately commit 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:36.410
 perspectives and managed that alone 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.360
 practice we announced quote me a 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.750
 tax but leans on a straight and where 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.540
 especially a blast other games but there 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:51.200
 I have to dream that to impress friends 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:52.540
 palaces so too and that's it 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:58.760
 completed 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:59.960
 he took part then one thing 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.370
 paramount on his machine the one 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.870
 maintenance and cleaning so there all 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.340
 showed how to clean the group from his 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.740
 machine there quite so still a 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.170
 once you access the menu with the key 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.930
 so we choose the category 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:15.470
 maintenance and states where you tut me 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:18.410
 paths what is the valid 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:22.370
 cleaning the group around to confirm 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.240
 confirms so fill with water in 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.140
 my case it's already done 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.590
 so when you lose confidence 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.090
 directly introduced impossible so 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.010
 who gets into the part of his family 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.580
 yeah it's a coat rack 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.020
 indeed we do not need to 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.600
 dissolving or anything normal to 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.490
 the pastilla not so in the report here 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.250
 and after the machine will do this cycle 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.910
 she herself actually and wants that will remove 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.570
 impurities 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.980
 the eight winners these two groups it's 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.060
 very important to properly 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.890
 between nespresso machines 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.260
 it's important for the group as 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.790
 I lived plans to pose so I have 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:56.450
 so inserted into pellets I valid 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:58.070
 okay also that this marathon has so 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.240
 well thought out like the machine machine 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.970
 say everything but then set a story 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.940
 heart under the bubble importance the hero 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.960
 unions make a break 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.220
 simply because there is a small 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.050
 moment said of a single fund 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.760
 so we'll go straight to the 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.050
 end and automatically had nothing to 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.090
 to do tonight at saint aurÃ©lie 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.290
 that's it, it's almost over and 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.020
 machine is ready to use quite 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.880
 conversions came here it's good 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.250
 the first thing is the color the 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:26.480
 cream and we make a cream that is of 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:30.200
 nuts to sink here I am 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.910
 the wait ristretto just like you and the 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.090
 once found the bag to these little ones 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.090
 cakes
