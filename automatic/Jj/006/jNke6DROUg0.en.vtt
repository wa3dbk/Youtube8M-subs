00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
on the event especially for the reason

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.430 
on the event especially for the reason
that<00:03:26.489> if<00:03:26.910> there<00:03:27.150> are<00:03:27.239> any<00:03:27.329> bugs<00:03:27.630> they<00:03:28.019> be<00:03:28.079> able

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
that if there are any bugs they be able

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.229 
that if there are any bugs they be able
to<00:03:28.530> iron<00:03:28.829> them<00:03:29.010> out<00:03:29.160> before<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.820> event<00:03:30.120> and

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
to iron them out before the event and

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.650 
to iron them out before the event and
hopefully<00:03:31.049> this<00:03:31.920> is<00:03:32.190> about<00:03:32.730> hopefully<00:03:33.269> it<00:03:33.480> is

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
maybe I haven't got my technique right

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.170 
maybe I haven't got my technique right
but<00:03:48.570> it's<00:03:49.500> certainly<00:03:49.890> not<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:50.790> kind<00:03:51.060> of

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
but it's certainly not the kind of

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.660 
but it's certainly not the kind of
weapon<00:03:51.510> I<00:03:51.630> want<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:51.900> be<00:03:51.989> facing<00:03:52.670> anybody

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669
