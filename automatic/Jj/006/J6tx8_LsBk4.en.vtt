00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.820
 greet all androidworld.it friends 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.620
 today we want to make a preview 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.390
 obviously all Italian since 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.539
 we realize it I would say it is 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.819
 quite obvious of camigliano which is a 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.739
 lancer a brand new lancer for android 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:26.659
 already available in place tor 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.460
 but in closed beta it means that 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:31.669
 if you have not registered you do not have 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.689
 asked to register for the beta and not 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:38.050
 you were then later 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:40.100
 accepted you cannot try this 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.520
 this new application this new 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.850
 lancer chameleon so it's coming soon 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.760
 it was a project but on kickstart it will come 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.950
 soon we hope on all the tablets and then 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.940
 we'll also see on smartphones 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:58.160
 eventually the idea is precisely a 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.200
 chameleon or a throw that is 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.630
 fits your needs 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.149
 you see that everything has changed below 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:10.270
 we have the list of applications there 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:12.890
 we are trying on our asus nexus 7 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.600
 it's all pretty smooth apart from that 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.509
 rotation but was not, however, very fine 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.030
 then list of applications list 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.630
 we can add font screens 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.630
 other 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.429
 so we added exactly, here it is 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.959
 here one here in the middle but we the 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:41.929
 actually wanted down here 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:43.459
 ok we can avoid the content you see 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:47.719
 that we can for example enable 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:50.469
 this one with a certain screen 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:53.659
 time at another certain time 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:58.759
 in some days 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:02.209
 or for example when we are connected 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:07.279
 to a certain network for example precisely the 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:09.819
 our network or we were wrong 

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:09.819
 sorry 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.620
 this is a bit confusing 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.570
 com problem or when we press puts us 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.460
 a little bit of charging you see is left 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.600
 immediately this phone screen because it has 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.460
 found our wifi 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.650
 the last possible location that 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.540
 of localization therefore there 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.640
 connect the certain wifi this appears 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.130
 with screen we connect another wifi 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.660
 we are in another place 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.270
 or is it a certain time of day or a 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.890
 certain day and instead we use it 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.570
 another we can of course however 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.570
 switch from one to the other by scrolling 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.940
 sideways below we have a dock 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.330
 with four favorite applications 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.850
 but we can add them at will 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:54.140
 we can add google more robots than 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:57.100
 already we put a color you see that the 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.750
 applications are disappearing for that 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.310
 they slide sideways and this one 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.200
 setting obviously also remains 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.650
 in the general screen really 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:12.860
 very nice the effect these are i 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:14.480
 milia widget gmail email prediction 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.330
 of twitter time 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:22.100
 instagram if we go to another page 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:24.110
 hold down we can add 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.940
 other widgets that are however for 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.230
 now only these instagram twitter 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.470
 water news and gmail 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.610
 in the news we can choose a feed 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.040
 for instagram we can use ours 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.080
 twitter account we can add the 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.320
 our account or a search 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.980
 we can do a test 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:48.530
 let's go add twitter we can 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.540
 decide how big it should look 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.100
 let's take a nice look at the page 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.350
 whole that actually right now 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.959
 it serves no purpose 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.790
 add the new feed and instead of 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.140
 add the account we make a 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.370
 search 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:07.660
 let's look for example with android with 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.660
 a lot of imagination 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.750
 ok 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:18.380
 all the latest tweets from the world of 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.380
 android in this screen by pressing 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:27.810
 we can then resize it will become 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.490
 scrollable and how much more 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.320
 pleasant, certainly very pleasant 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.470
 the backgrounds are few but the rest 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.090
 they are all very minimal but in time 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.440
 very beautiful we can for example 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.240
 try another one 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.760
 so here is a project 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.040
 definitely very very much 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.010
 interesting that really struck us 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.450
 we thank as much as ours 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:56.340
 author roberto who allowed us to 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.960
 try it on our nexus 7 is still there 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.169
 so much work to do 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.180
 after all a closed beta then from here 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.070
 when you can install it all 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.930
 the other time will pass in which 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.460
 surely the developers will have 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:13.350
 sorry time repetition for 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.440
 complete this this lancer 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.169
 adds all the missing features 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.169
 a greeting to all the access for 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.169
