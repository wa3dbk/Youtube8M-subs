00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
that if you use your Clarisonic with

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.160 
that if you use your Clarisonic with
acne<00:01:23.390> products<00:01:24.390> then<00:01:24.540> sometimes<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.020> could<00:01:25.110> be

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
acne products then sometimes it could be

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.719 
acne products then sometimes it could be
too<00:01:25.290> harsh<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.680> your<00:01:25.860> skin<00:01:26.100> you'll<00:01:26.340> get<00:01:26.490> really
