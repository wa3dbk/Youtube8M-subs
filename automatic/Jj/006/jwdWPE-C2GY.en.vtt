hands for doing a very large area the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.719 
hands for doing a very large area the
next<00:01:04.530> thing<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.860> don't<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:05.189> them<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.460> now

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
next thing and I don't have them on now

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.370 
next thing and I don't have them on now
but<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.090> you're<00:01:06.240> doing<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.510> large<00:01:06.689> floor<00:01:07.020> area

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
but if you're doing a large floor area

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.469 
but if you're doing a large floor area
like<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.520> usually<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.880> good<00:01:08.970> idea<00:01:09.030> to

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
like this it's usually a good idea to

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.210 
like this it's usually a good idea to
say<00:01:09.659> some<00:01:09.900> wear<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.080> tear<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.500> your<00:01:10.590> knees<00:01:10.799> to

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
say some wear and tear on your knees to

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.719 
say some wear and tear on your knees to
have<00:01:11.400> some<00:01:12.000> knee<00:01:12.180> pads<00:01:12.500> on<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.640> will

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
have some knee pads on and that will

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.840 
have some knee pads on and that will
help<00:01:15.110> save<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.290> lot<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.610> pain<00:01:17.610> and

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
help save you a lot of pain and

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.030 
help save you a lot of pain and
potential<00:01:18.299> trouble<00:01:18.630> from<00:01:18.780> doing<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.200> now

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
potential trouble from doing that now

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.740 
potential trouble from doing that now
when<00:01:20.310> you're<00:01:20.460> using<00:01:20.490> these<00:01:20.880> type<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.150> products

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
when you're using these type of products

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.170 
when you're using these type of products
and<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.200> get<00:01:22.380> down<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.830> here<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:23.759> really<00:01:24.150> a

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and to get down in here it's really a

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.070 
and to get down in here it's really a
good<00:01:24.360> idea<00:01:24.390> as<00:01:24.900> you're<00:01:25.080> mixing<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.530> up<00:01:27.080> as

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
good idea as you're mixing this up as

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.590 
good idea as you're mixing this up as
you<00:01:28.259> dump<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.590> into<00:01:28.829> your<00:01:28.979> water<00:01:29.450> you<00:01:30.450> don't

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
you dump this into your water you don't

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.179 
you dump this into your water you don't
want<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.049> be<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> little<00:01:31.409> liquid<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.009> want

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
want it to be a little liquid you want

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.260 
want it to be a little liquid you want
to<00:01:32.280> get<00:01:32.460> more<00:01:32.990> more<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.259> paste<00:01:34.500> consistency

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
to get more more of a paste consistency

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.090 
to get more more of a paste consistency
so<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.509> actually<00:01:37.229> when<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.710> put<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.040> down

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
so that actually when you put this down

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.999 
so that actually when you put this down
into<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.759> grout<00:01:39.350> you're<00:01:40.350> almost<00:01:40.619> letting<00:01:40.890> it

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
into the grout you're almost letting it

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.960 
into the grout you're almost letting it
sit<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.400> there<00:01:41.750> like<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.380> paste<00:01:43.970> and

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
sit in there like this and it paste and

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.139 
sit in there like this and it paste and

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
now when you sponge mop it's very easy

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.490 
now when you sponge mop it's very easy
it'll<00:02:28.060> keep<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.420> dirt<00:02:28.630> on<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.930> surface<00:02:29.110> and

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
it'll keep that dirt on the surface and

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.140 
it'll keep that dirt on the surface and
keep<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.800> from<00:02:30.010> actually<00:02:30.430> going<00:02:30.580> down<00:02:30.730> into

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
keep it from actually going down into

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.300 
keep it from actually going down into
the<00:02:31.240> grout<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:32.200> I'm<00:02:32.380> Tim<00:02:32.620> Gipson<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:33.220> that's

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
the grout so I'm Tim Gipson and that's

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.660 
the grout so I'm Tim Gipson and that's
how<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.910> clean<00:02:34.330> grout
