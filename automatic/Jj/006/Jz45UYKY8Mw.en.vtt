00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
first mob but kind of got we've kind of

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.210 
first mob but kind of got we've kind of
gotten<00:01:06.750> at<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> s-bahn<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.650> generally<00:01:08.070> don't

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
gotten at the s-bahn I generally don't

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.830 
gotten at the s-bahn I generally don't
like<00:01:08.460> having<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> enemies<00:01:09.180> at<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> air<00:01:09.510> spawn

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
like having the enemies at the air spawn

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.539 
like having the enemies at the air spawn
because<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:10.830> shoot<00:01:11.070> through<00:01:11.310> pretty

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
because you can shoot through pretty

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.980 
because you can shoot through pretty
much<00:01:11.640> everything<00:01:11.850> here<00:01:12.299> all<00:01:12.540> these<00:01:12.689> metal

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
much everything here all these metal

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.690 
much everything here all these metal
objects<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.530> you're<00:01:13.890> able<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.130> shoot<00:01:14.430> for

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
objects that you're able to shoot for

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.640 
objects that you're able to shoot for
them<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.600> don't<00:01:15.780> really<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.290> having<00:01:16.439> them

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
them so I don't really like having them

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.050 
them so I don't really like having them
in<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.799> air<00:01:16.920> spawn<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.369> prefer<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
in the air spawn I prefer to have the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.940 
in the air spawn I prefer to have the
air<00:01:18.299> flag<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.049> beef<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.439> can<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.770> keep

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
air flag and the beef I can just keep

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.590 
air flag and the beef I can just keep
them<00:01:20.100> at<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.340> sea<00:01:20.520> flag<00:01:20.820> as<00:01:21.030> you'll<00:01:21.180> see<00:01:21.360> in

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
them at the sea flag as you'll see in

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.090 
them at the sea flag as you'll see in
the<00:01:21.720> second<00:01:22.110> mob<00:01:22.259> Street<00:01:22.470> that's<00:01:22.740> pretty<00:01:22.950> much

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
the second mob Street that's pretty much

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.910 
the second mob Street that's pretty much
what<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.340> do<00:01:23.780> but<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.170> first<00:01:25.409> week<00:01:25.770> and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
what I do but for this first week and

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.890 
what I do but for this first week and
for<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.130> first<00:01:26.400> half<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.210> second<00:01:27.659> streak

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
for the first half of the second streak

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.429 
for the first half of the second streak
I<00:01:28.020> think<00:01:28.229> we<00:01:28.350> are<00:01:28.470> trapping<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.340> air<00:01:29.460> flag

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
I think we are trapping in the air flag

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.109 
I think we are trapping in the air flag
so<00:01:31.439> what<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.680> like<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.040> try<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.490> do<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.880> when

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
so what I like to try and do is when

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.429 
so what I like to try and do is when
when<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:33.540> are<00:01:33.659> keeping<00:01:33.869> them<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.170> air<00:01:34.259> fine

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
when we are keeping them in the air fine

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.929 
when we are keeping them in the air fine
I<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.710> stay<00:01:34.979> around<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.400> area<00:01:35.579> right

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
I like to stay around this area right

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.929 
I like to stay around this area right
here<00:01:36.829> purely<00:01:37.829> because<00:01:37.979> there's<00:01:38.430> quite<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.729> bit

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
here purely because there's quite a bit

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.789 
here purely because there's quite a bit
cover<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.509> even<00:01:39.960> though<00:01:40.110> they<00:01:40.290> can<00:01:40.500> shoot

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
cover and even though they can shoot

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.350 
cover and even though they can shoot
through<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.130> metal<00:01:41.369> sheeting<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.939> does

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
through this metal sheeting it does

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.480 
through this metal sheeting it does
provide<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.750> bit<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.259> cover<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:44.070> just<00:01:44.310> like

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
provide a bit of cover and I just like

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.760 
provide a bit of cover and I just like
to<00:01:44.610> kind<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.909> stray<00:01:45.780> throughout<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.500> little

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
to kind of stray throughout this little

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.160 
to kind of stray throughout this little
area<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.520> keep<00:01:47.729> myself<00:01:47.939> away<00:01:48.869> from<00:01:48.899> my

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
area and just keep myself away from my

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.810 
area and just keep myself away from my
center<00:01:49.409> area<00:01:49.680> if<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.860> go<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.280> right<00:01:50.520> kind

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
of to the main part where the funnel

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.069 
of to the main part where the funnel
just<00:01:53.159> where<00:01:53.490> SES<00:01:53.880> Rises<00:01:54.390> right<00:01:54.630> down<00:01:54.810> there

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
just where SES Rises right down there

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.959 
just where SES Rises right down there
and<00:01:55.530> that's<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.219> place<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.850> know

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
and that's the place that you know

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.490 
and that's the place that you know
you'll<00:01:57.149> normally<00:01:57.329> see<00:01:57.570> more<00:01:57.899> snipers<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
you'll normally see more snipers and

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.170 
you'll normally see more snipers and
stuff<00:01:58.680> going<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.280> montage<00:01:59.670> clips<00:01:59.939> and

stuff going for the montage clips and

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.580

stuff<00:02:00.329> but<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.540> generally<00:02:00.780> tend<00:02:01.140> not<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.350> go

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
stuff but I generally tend not to go

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.170 
stuff but I generally tend not to go
there<00:02:01.829> because<00:02:01.950> it's<00:02:02.250> really<00:02:02.430> easy<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.729> get<00:02:02.939> C

pretty<00:03:29.160> much<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.490> entirety<00:03:29.820> in<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.090> stream

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
pretty much the entirety in the stream

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.110 
pretty much the entirety in the stream
which<00:03:30.570> is<00:03:30.600> really<00:03:31.530> sat<00:03:31.770> in<00:03:31.920> my<00:03:32.100> opinion<00:03:32.520> and<00:03:32.760> I

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
which is really sat in my opinion and I

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.120 
which is really sat in my opinion and I
know<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:34.020> happens<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.530> lot<00:03:34.590> of<00:03:34.740> people<00:03:35.040> who

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
know it happens to a lot of people who

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.890 
know it happens to a lot of people who
live<00:03:35.310> stream<00:03:35.640> -<00:03:35.970> steena<00:03:36.240> or<00:03:36.750> frags<00:03:37.710> Jay<00:03:38.130> nasty

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
live stream - steena or frags Jay nasty

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.240 
live stream - steena or frags Jay nasty
so<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:39.930> guess<00:03:40.140> it's<00:03:40.320> pretty<00:03:40.500> inevitable<00:03:40.710> is

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
so I guess it's pretty inevitable is

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.010 
so I guess it's pretty inevitable is
gonna<00:03:41.520> happen<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.790> me<00:03:41.940> at<00:03:42.030> some<00:03:42.240> point<00:03:42.270> but<00:03:42.720> and

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
on a solo spawn trapping spree I think I

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.690 
on a solo spawn trapping spree I think I
get<00:04:12.210> like<00:04:12.360> 10<00:04:13.050> assists<00:04:13.680> just<00:04:13.890> from<00:04:14.100> this

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
get like 10 assists just from this

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.220 
get like 10 assists just from this
little<00:04:14.940> ending<00:04:15.360> bit<00:04:15.540> of<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.690> street<00:04:15.990> course

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
little ending bit of the street course

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.920 
little ending bit of the street course
my<00:04:16.440> word<00:04:16.590> is<00:04:16.710> pretty<00:04:16.980> crazy<00:04:17.570> but<00:04:18.570> this<00:04:18.750> is<00:04:18.810> a

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
my word is pretty crazy but this is a

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.050 
my word is pretty crazy but this is a
really<00:04:19.290> good<00:04:19.440> spot<00:04:19.680> on<00:04:19.739> I<00:04:20.190> don't<00:04:20.549> really<00:04:20.880> know

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
really good spot on I don't really know

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.210 
really good spot on I don't really know
how<00:04:21.330> we<00:04:21.810> got<00:04:22.080> them<00:04:22.230> trapped<00:04:22.440> here<00:04:22.740> but<00:04:23.040> I<00:04:23.100> think

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
how we got them trapped here but I think

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.250 
how we got them trapped here but I think
it's<00:04:23.580> cost<00:04:23.880> most<00:04:24.210> of<00:04:24.390> my<00:04:24.510> team<00:04:24.720> were<00:04:24.900> at<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.110> B

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
it's cost most of my team were at the B

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.350 
it's cost most of my team were at the B
flag<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:25.860> left<00:04:26.310> upper<00:04:26.790> left<00:04:27.000> hand

flag and left upper left hand

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.969

I'm<00:04:27.569> not<00:04:27.719> just<00:04:27.930> funneling<00:04:28.349> them<00:04:28.500> into<00:04:28.889> this

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
I'm not just funneling them into this

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.909 
I'm not just funneling them into this
kind<00:04:29.250> of<00:04:29.460> corner<00:04:30.240> area<00:04:30.449> which<00:04:31.319> let<00:04:31.560> me<00:04:31.710> you

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
first mob to last mob it was five

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.050 
first mob to last mob it was five
minutes<00:04:40.139> nineteen<00:04:40.830> if<00:04:41.069> I<00:04:41.219> had<00:04:41.400> a<00:04:41.430> vetted<00:04:41.909> out

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
minutes nineteen if I had a vetted out

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.570 
minutes nineteen if I had a vetted out
there<00:04:42.300> little<00:04:43.020> time<00:04:43.469> between<00:04:43.680> both<00:04:44.159> streets

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
there little time between both streets

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.600 
there little time between both streets
it<00:04:44.849> would<00:04:44.969> have<00:04:45.120> been<00:04:45.740> approximately<00:04:46.740> three

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
it would have been approximately three

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.129 
it would have been approximately three
minutes<00:04:47.789> fifty<00:04:48.240> so<00:04:48.419> I'm<00:04:48.539> pretty<00:04:48.810> sure<00:04:48.930> it's

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
minutes fifty so I'm pretty sure it's

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.749 
minutes fifty so I'm pretty sure it's
the<00:04:49.199> world's<00:04:49.409> fastest<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:50.099> wall<00:04:50.250> mob<00:04:50.460> if<00:04:50.610> it's

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
the world's fastest the wall mob if it's

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:51.980 
the world's fastest the wall mob if it's
not<00:04:50.939> make<00:04:51.120> sure<00:04:51.270> you<00:04:51.360> tell<00:04:51.539> me<00:04:51.689> and<00:04:51.810> I<00:04:51.840> will

up on trying to go off that third mob

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.589

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
hundred and fifteen points of the game

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.999

on a sixteen gun she would it's a pretty
surprising<00:05:25.139> I<00:05:25.379> didn't<00:05:25.650> expect<00:05:25.949> you<00:05:26.099> know

00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:26.279

surprising I didn't expect you know
going<00:05:26.520> any<00:05:26.729> more<00:05:26.819> streaks<00:05:27.300> during<00:05:28.110> this<00:05:28.229> game

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:28.439 
going any more streaks during this game

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:30.679 
going any more streaks during this game
because<00:05:28.800> it<00:05:28.949> kind<00:05:29.310> of<00:05:29.370> lost<00:05:29.520> her<00:05:29.789> after<00:05:30.599> we

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:30.689 
because it kind of lost her after we

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:32.510 
because it kind of lost her after we
started<00:05:30.990> triple<00:05:31.319> captain<00:05:31.620> and<00:05:31.740> I<00:05:31.979> couldn't

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
started triple captain and I couldn't

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.010 
started triple captain and I couldn't
come<00:05:32.729> build<00:05:32.969> upon<00:05:33.180> of<00:05:33.270> a<00:05:33.330> streak<00:05:33.599> but<00:05:33.779> I<00:05:33.839> didn't

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
come build upon of a streak but I didn't

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.360 
come build upon of a streak but I didn't
manage<00:05:34.110> to<00:05:34.259> build<00:05:34.440> up<00:05:34.589> a<00:05:34.680> sixteen<00:05:35.099> and<00:05:35.279> then

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
manage to build up a sixteen and then

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.279 
manage to build up a sixteen and then
the<00:05:35.430> game<00:05:35.639> ended<00:05:36.029> I<00:05:36.210> think<00:05:36.629> we<00:05:36.719> win<00:05:36.870> by<00:05:37.080> like

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
the game ended I think we win by like

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:39.320 
the game ended I think we win by like
two<00:05:37.650> hundred<00:05:37.860> to<00:05:38.279> ninety<00:05:38.639> nine<00:05:38.819> points<00:05:39.210> so

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
two hundred to ninety nine points so

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.969 
two hundred to ninety nine points so
maybe<00:05:39.569> if<00:05:39.719> we<00:05:39.810> let<00:05:40.020> the<00:05:40.169> team<00:05:40.349> you<00:05:40.529> know<00:05:40.560> double

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
maybe if we let the team you know double

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.579 
maybe if we let the team you know double
top<00:05:41.129> or<00:05:41.250> triple<00:05:41.610> caps<00:05:41.849> we<00:05:42.839> might<00:05:43.229> being<00:05:43.500> able

00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:43.589 
top or triple caps we might being able

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:45.140 
top or triple caps we might being able
to<00:05:43.740> drop<00:05:43.979> that<00:05:44.069> third<00:05:44.430> and<00:05:44.639> I<00:05:44.669> think<00:05:44.879> one<00:05:45.000> of<00:05:45.089> my

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
to drop that third and I think one of my

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.879 
to drop that third and I think one of my
teammates<00:05:45.479> in<00:05:45.690> this<00:05:45.779> game<00:05:45.990> was<00:05:46.169> also<00:05:46.379> worn<00:05:46.770> off

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
teammates in this game was also worn off

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.499 
teammates in this game was also worn off
a<00:05:47.009> mob<00:05:47.219> when<00:05:47.430> the<00:05:47.580> game<00:05:47.759> ended<00:05:48.089> I'm<00:05:48.210> not<00:05:48.360> too

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:48.509 
a mob when the game ended I'm not too

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.649 
a mob when the game ended I'm not too
sure<00:05:48.800> so<00:05:49.800> it<00:05:49.889> could<00:05:50.039> have<00:05:50.129> been<00:05:50.250> a<00:05:50.279> quad<00:05:51.060> mob<00:05:51.449> in

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
sure so it could have been a quad mob in

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:53.360 
sure so it could have been a quad mob in
one<00:05:51.839> game<00:05:52.050> if<00:05:52.529> my<00:05:52.680> teammate<00:05:53.039> would<00:05:53.159> have<00:05:53.250> got

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
one game if my teammate would have got

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.119 
one game if my teammate would have got
that<00:05:53.520> one<00:05:53.639> in<00:05:53.759> as<00:05:53.879> well<00:05:54.349> I'm<00:05:55.349> pretty<00:05:55.529> sure<00:05:55.680> if

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:56.129 
that one in as well I'm pretty sure if

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:57.740 
that one in as well I'm pretty sure if
we<00:05:56.550> had<00:05:56.669> a<00:05:56.699> bit<00:05:56.879> more<00:05:57.060> time<00:05:57.330> I<00:05:57.360> would<00:05:57.659> have

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
we had a bit more time I would have

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:58.969 
we had a bit more time I would have
dropped<00:05:57.930> that<00:05:58.050> third<00:05:58.319> one<00:05:58.560> because<00:05:58.710> these

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
dropped that third one because these

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:00.439 
dropped that third one because these
enemies<00:05:59.460> you<00:05:59.639> know<00:05:59.669> there<00:05:59.909> wasn't<00:06:00.029> the<00:06:00.210> best

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
enemies you know there wasn't the best

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:03.079 
enemies you know there wasn't the best
and<00:06:00.750> I<00:06:01.529> was<00:06:01.680> just<00:06:01.889> stomping<00:06:02.580> him<00:06:02.729> and<00:06:02.789> all<00:06:02.969> my

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:03.089 
and I was just stomping him and all my

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:04.610 
and I was just stomping him and all my
teammates<00:06:03.270> really<00:06:03.599> stumped<00:06:03.990> him<00:06:04.199> pretty<00:06:04.469> much

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
teammates really stumped him pretty much

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.079

everything<00:06:06.360> under<00:06:06.599> control<00:06:07.879> but

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:08.879 
everything under control but

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:10.760 
everything under control but
unfortunately<00:06:09.599> I<00:06:09.659> did<00:06:09.810> have<00:06:09.930> that<00:06:10.080> dries<00:06:10.379> free

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770
