00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
each crotchet beat so in the template

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.030 
each crotchet beat so in the template
we're<00:01:35.640> playing<00:01:35.939> quavers<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.530> right<00:01:37.740> hand

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
we're playing quavers in the right hand

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.420 
we're playing quavers in the right hand
that's<00:01:38.340> two<00:01:38.640> notes<00:01:38.909> per<00:01:39.060> beat<00:01:39.479> one<00:01:40.140> two<00:01:40.770> one

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
that's two notes per beat one two one

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.770 
that's two notes per beat one two one
two<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:42.750> two<00:01:45.380> three<00:01:46.380> four<00:01:47.119> playing<00:01:48.119> quavers

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
two one two three four playing quavers

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.249 
two one two three four playing quavers
now<00:01:49.530> we're<00:01:49.979> gonna<00:01:50.130> add<00:01:50.640> one<00:01:51.360> extra<00:01:51.540> note<00:01:51.960> and

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
now we're gonna add one extra note and

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.840 
now we're gonna add one extra note and
that<00:01:52.560> will<00:01:52.680> give<00:01:52.860> us<00:01:52.890> triplets<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> hi-hat

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
that will give us triplets on the hi-hat

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.560 
that will give us triplets on the hi-hat
so<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:55.409> rhythm<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.790> could<00:01:57.000> hear<00:01:57.329> as<00:01:57.509> a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
so this rhythm you could hear as a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.590 
so this rhythm you could hear as a
rhythm<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.799> 12-8<00:01:59.340> time<00:01:59.579> signature<00:02:00.119> because

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
rhythm in a 12-8 time signature because

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.840 
rhythm in a 12-8 time signature because
there<00:02:00.750> will<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:00.869> twelve<00:02:01.200> quavers<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:01.950> each<00:02:02.490> bar

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
there will be twelve quavers in each bar

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.350 
there will be twelve quavers in each bar
okay<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:04.320> I'll<00:02:04.979> cap<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.549> off<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.909> 12<00:02:06.149> eighth

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
okay so I'll cap that off in 12 eighth

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.380 
okay so I'll cap that off in 12 eighth
and<00:02:06.630> I'm<00:02:06.719> sure<00:02:06.960> you'll<00:02:07.170> just<00:02:08.069> grasp<00:02:09.060> this

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
and I'm sure you'll just grasp this

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
okay so to alter the hi-hat part of the

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.880 
okay so to alter the hi-hat part of the
game<00:03:06.110> we'll<00:03:07.040> play<00:03:07.400> some<00:03:08.239> sixteenth<00:03:08.989> notes<00:03:09.349> so

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
game we'll play some sixteenth notes so

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.259 
game we'll play some sixteenth notes so
that's<00:03:10.069> four<00:03:10.610> right-hand<00:03:11.269> notes<00:03:11.680> per<00:03:12.680> beat<00:03:13.340> so

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
that's four right-hand notes per beat so

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.910 
that's four right-hand notes per beat so
what<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:15.019> M<00:03:15.230> 2<00:03:15.799> e<00:03:15.829> and<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:16.549> 3<00:03:16.579> E<00:03:16.850> and<00:03:17.209> a<00:03:17.600> 4<00:03:17.630> p.m.<00:03:18.290> in

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
what the M 2 e and a 3 E and a 4 p.m. in

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.949 
what the M 2 e and a 3 E and a 4 p.m. in
the<00:03:19.310> right<00:03:19.489> hand<00:03:19.819> with<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.239> same<00:03:20.540> kick<00:03:20.810> and

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
snare pattern again so once you've

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.080 
snare pattern again so once you've
learned<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.389> beat<00:03:35.660> again<00:03:36.530> think<00:03:37.190> about<00:03:37.459> where

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
learned the beat again think about where

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.849 
learned the beat again think about where
am<00:03:38.180> I<00:03:38.239> going<00:03:38.359> to<00:03:38.480> hear<00:03:38.780> that<00:03:39.079> kind<00:03:39.350> of<00:03:39.560> sound

ballad records soul ballads that kind of
thing<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:49.459> way<00:03:49.609> that<00:03:49.760> we<00:03:49.850> play<00:03:50.060> the

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
thing and the way that we play the

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.840 
thing and the way that we play the
hi-hat<00:03:50.799> influences<00:03:51.799> the<00:03:52.100> feel<00:03:52.340> of<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.639> beat

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
hi-hat influences the feel of the beat

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.940 
hi-hat influences the feel of the beat
from<00:03:53.209> endlessly<00:03:53.630> so<00:03:54.049> as<00:03:54.170> well<00:03:54.410> as<00:03:54.560> playing<00:03:54.829> the

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
from endlessly so as well as playing the

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.300 
from endlessly so as well as playing the
four<00:03:55.160> notes<00:03:55.489> you<00:03:56.299> might<00:03:56.480> want<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:56.780> consider

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
four notes you might want to consider

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.270 
four notes you might want to consider
accenting<00:03:58.310> in<00:03:58.549> groups<00:03:59.180> of<00:03:59.329> twos<00:03:59.660> so<00:04:00.380> we're

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
accenting in groups of twos so we're

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.780 
accenting in groups of twos so we're
using<00:04:01.489> the<00:04:01.730> same<00:04:02.319> shaft<00:04:03.319> of<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.859> the<00:04:04.340> stick

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
using the same shaft of the the stick

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.530 
using the same shaft of the the stick
going<00:04:05.420> to<00:04:05.569> the<00:04:05.660> tip<00:04:05.930> of<00:04:06.139> the<00:04:06.380> stick<00:04:07.340> method<00:04:08.120> as

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
going to the tip of the stick method as

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.110 
going to the tip of the stick method as
in<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.470> the<00:04:09.919> very<00:04:10.160> first<00:04:10.190> lesson<00:04:10.700> in<00:04:10.970> this

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
in the the very first lesson in this

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.080 
in the the very first lesson in this
series<00:04:11.859> but<00:04:12.859> we're<00:04:13.010> applying<00:04:13.220> it<00:04:13.489> to<00:04:13.760> semi

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
series but we're applying it to semi

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.779 
series but we're applying it to semi
quavers<00:04:14.599> so<00:04:14.810> rather<00:04:15.079> than<00:04:15.410> it<00:04:15.530> being<00:04:15.789> played

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
quavers so rather than it being played

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:22.149 
quavers so rather than it being played
with<00:04:17.030> quavers<00:04:17.859> one<00:04:18.859> and<00:04:19.190> two<00:04:20.090> and<00:04:21.010> we're<00:04:22.010> doing

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:22.159 
with quavers one and two and we're doing

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:24.399 
with quavers one and two and we're doing
it<00:04:22.400> with<00:04:22.520> sixteenth<00:04:23.060> notes<00:04:23.390> so<00:04:23.840> we<00:04:23.870> double<00:04:24.289> the

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:24.409 
it with sixteenth notes so we double the

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:25.029 
it with sixteenth notes so we double the
speed

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
speed

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:32.589 
speed
and<00:04:25.159> it<00:04:25.550> becomes<00:04:25.969> what<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:26.990> am<00:04:27.349> -<00:04:30.969> we<00:04:31.969> hear<00:04:32.330> that

and it becomes what I am - we hear that

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.110 
and it becomes what I am - we hear that
rhythm<00:04:32.990> in<00:04:33.259> the<00:04:33.349> context<00:04:33.889> of<00:04:33.979> the<00:04:34.129> beat<00:04:34.400> we<00:04:34.939> get

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
rhythm in the context of the beat we get

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:45.670 
rhythm in the context of the beat we get
this<00:04:42.099> yeah<00:04:43.180> okay<00:04:44.180> and<00:04:44.389> we<00:04:44.840> can<00:04:44.990> also<00:04:45.139> spice
