00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.420
 that the presentation of the green site 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.419
 on the scene several and various things 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.259

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.259
 to enjoy and click here 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.820
 Do what they call Iranian 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.290
 ohio coiti prosecutor taunts us on twitter 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.290

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.520
 for the record 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.560
 have to talk a few things before as if this procedure 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.630
 that the 20 can not games here says the site 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.470
 because there are several hot games not all work in the county are only 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.770
 some work 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.440
 so we can not do it any game I believe 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.870
 just thinking it over 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.670
 on a very good site what 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.910
 we just got to whoever played with the point with the br 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.280
 I believe that many of you know another gate the covenants you 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.640
 on this site here 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.000
 no you write here 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 in the northeast games 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.000
 that day 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.990
 explore the 307 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.320
 so listen 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.320
 You'll see if this is it. 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.070
 to the next 'you will get q 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.660
 is a consolation and with the compose of the pardon 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.120
 configured to be unsuccessful 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.460
 so it's these blocks he has to be with the ex-lover 9199 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.010
 for those who do not know they're heavy bust, little us 20's stay up 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.880
 easy 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.420
 have to have this one of chubut or higher 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.740
 because that's how it works to the stones of mimimi wide open 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.710
 uncle sam show you the bush system update that 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.690
 preside the cas does not know how to update 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.180
 it is not known if he was detained but because he explains it correctly 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.180
 then you have left the g9 1199 or higher 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.620
 and you will configure your 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.910
 shows me how to remove configured settings because I'm not going to 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.910
 doing with solicito that I was motorcycle and calm 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.619
 verb 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:17.619
 I'm grateful to the source here. 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:24.900
 first process will put a pen drive 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.759
 is formatted and made 32 remembering it 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:29.329
 the sites blocks 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.479
 and we will do it like this 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:32.749
 meg white box 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:35.749
 Now we'll go there settings 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:39.379
 in the configurations né 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.379
 them and then configuration we go memory 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.529
 after memory people chose penta is that in the case of c 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.339
 drive but it does not matter that they left 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.279
 I do not know if your exact name is going to be silent 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:00.459
 but this is something so positive aspects to know 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.959
 then police aside and will have two options that is set up now 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:09.769
 something else that I do not even remember 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.649
 but any of the options you choose right 

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:14.429
 no need to serve 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:16.919
 about setting it up is better 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.000
 because you can choose an amount of 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.189
 of your sin if you can fish and not not completely shackles 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:26.289
 the case on the stone enable 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:30.009
 with the tragedy I only left a gigantic amendment in the next case 

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:32.039
 so if you configure you choose 

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:34.599
 the exact size you want to leave 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.059
 The thermostat, the ones I used to get him have several songs. 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.939
 and it's the same as I feel is that the blocks then you can leave them put 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.559
 for two year giants 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:46.559
 the stuff of the induced and gedo ptc volts has no problem whatsoever 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.150
 so after you have set up celpe age proof 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.349
 is that the blocks 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:52.959
 we do the following 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.399
 do you program here? 

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:56.599
 with the sedec staff explorer 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.130
 For those who do not know, they do not. 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.130
 with the seeds program beijing tutorials 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:05.089
 and there's that 

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:08.269
 as floor and extra knowledge to explore 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.359
 that the program has today shows how 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.139
 looking all over 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.699
 this version is very old but for those purposes I prefer this version 

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:21.289
 run as administrator quintão and dancing in what we have left us 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.740
 and here today give a new version correct version the father who not because it is 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.359
 I need it if I do not like all the versions until the attack on my computer 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:32.349
 only the newest version 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:33.900
 elizabete ferreira 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.469
 saving you 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:37.580
 No, do not come here. 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.159
 I did something else. 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.300
 Come here from the hornets It's a hot game I found 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.020
 I'll usually wonder what the news corp 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.900
 a month 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.169
 there may be spaces that content 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.169
 bet bets with 16 numbers 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:56.379
 sixteen times number 0 the team of shepherd children 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.460
 happy 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.490
 those ciliares of zeros 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.460
 and that code what it is that every game is hot has its games without your college 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:06.370
 so this 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.449
 is the game code 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.449
 and this is code 12 games here 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.210
 so it's not a code in the version but it's a code with that kind of 

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:16.009
 archive 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.439
 and here at last with the game here 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:20.110
 itself 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.929
 this one that this kids folder 58 41 07 of him 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.229
 she will probably teach in downloading your game 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.270
 he is very very rare universe so 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.270
 I lied come complete of this content. 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:37.520
 then it shows that you have 6 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.360
 September bettor akira says 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.360
 so we come here now year the expectation is that we could 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.180
 and had a heart attack buying the country 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.909
 there is nothing on my roof in front of the few haiti 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:52.120
 Tolentino here 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.389
 in case the game already tacna 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.020
 everywhere we come since it was 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.020
 choose the folder in the case of content in the oc 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:05.070
 already finished puerto rico see what type game is locality already 

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:10.699
 and puts on your axn or that if you can play you can facilitate an internal pruning 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:14.039
 skidded by the owner in different 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:17.059
 I particularly prefer mobile to see 

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:20.359
 pet some basic things he who has to talk about it 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.469
 already said that the sites not put type of game we will not bet 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:28.339
 our friend alisson made a video and 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:31.969
 You tricked me last night was the frentista yesterday in the site 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.389
 is to train what is a similar technical procedure 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:39.550
 not really like it but we'll say it here 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.839
 in the same segment 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:45.369
 which is backing up the know that who says ii modifying 

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:48.089
 the ceitec in vespasiano the internet 

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:52.039
 about these rubber tappers downloaded and if we will not post any kind of 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:54.389
 performance that m 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:57.850
 if you want you go in the point gogó with point b also that the people 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:00.849
 find a very good site I think 

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:05.699
 is the tip and personal google dot com old port on the head 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:08.850
 Your job, the game is already there. 

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.389
 this production has fallen 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:12.729
 your sewer lost already was 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:15.739
 and another thing also that not all games are those that work 

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:22.919
 this is 

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:24.699
 and if you did body scheme 

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:27.379
 footprint it will cost 1 an error 

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:29.339
 which is an exclamation mark 

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:32.819
 when it is played it does not work with great advice that does not 

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:35.119
 was low 

00:07:35.119 --> 00:07:38.589
 professions are some games if you do the right procedure 

00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:40.669
 in the game that takes you have to catch it 

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:43.659
 in the case of rice it works already I tested it 

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:47.099
 so I hope you understand that we can not type content 

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:48.879
 people who would not bet 

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:52.439
 ii are not all games that work just what goes on and ask for 

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:54.399
 quip many people like 

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:55.999
 hot games because 

00:07:55.999 --> 00:07:58.839
 There is a game that is fucking fun. 

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:02.369
 as much as we live and in the world of realism in the games with this game 

00:08:02.369 --> 00:08:04.189
 to those who had a lot of fun 

00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:07.520
 and that's what this was more a parish surveyor and 60 

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.940
 I hope you have enjoyed it and av
