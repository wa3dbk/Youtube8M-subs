00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.890
 Hello my name is Evgeny Nikiforov 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.410
 not a restaurant chef 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.880
 This video is for those chefs who 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.980
 set a goal to become 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.570
 chef 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.370
 I am writing now one of these 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.070
 common problems with which you 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.369
 may encounter on your way 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.910
 It happens that either a young cook or 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.800
 the arrival of the cook to in some city 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.740
 enters the kitchen in the team in the restaurant 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.519
 who have long been united and you start 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.050
 work there and for you all the rest 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:37.270
 cooks try to hang as much as possible 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.140
 more work roughly speaking on and you 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.559
 our sit down 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.440
 that is, you do your work still someone else's 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.399
 and for chat jambs there you get 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.500
 there is an absolute feeling 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.760
 injustice arises which 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.289
 prevents you from enjoying 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.850
 work in the kitchen in this situation I 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.399
 I recommend to forget the cost of this 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.170
 injustice when the fuck no more 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.940
 all get exactly the same salary 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.719
 like the rest or maybe even less 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:08.709
 but remember that you have a goal 

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:10.749
 become a chef and pay attention not 

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:13.539
 on colleagues here that these who 

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:14.920
 bastards sit and try to shove 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.469
 because she can work on 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.810
 anatomical is not the essence of his work 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:23.459
 you do and do with pleasure and 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.289
 enjoy that soon 

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:27.880
 soon you will become a chef 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.130
 may be sous-chef at this restaurant 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.119
 can be immediately jump out of u chef in 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.950
 another restaurant or when you become 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.369
 chef you this experience is useful this 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.109
 I guarantee I will say more in my opinion 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.079
 my life situation when for the first time 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:47.049
 I got a restaurant nobody strained me 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.779
 studied hot shop first layer hot nick 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.249
 my memory all the time he rested the 

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:52.779
 he has nothing to do at work because 

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:56.349
 I will have time to do everything I 

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:58.929
 and I did not soar that he was sitting there 

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:00.689
 and I smoked because I knew what I was doing in 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.489
 your weekend limit in the cold shop 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.450
 studied the cold shop olonets doubled two 

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:06.560
 weeks yet 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.290
 can brings coming to work not to 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.220
 I have come to do something which not all 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:15.410
 do the work for this person 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.510
 snaps everything learned shorter after three 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.480
 months here is such a job without days off 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.260
 and for all I was appointed sous-chef 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.360
 the restaurant eventually all had a question 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.680
 how so are we here two years we work from 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.600
 he came some life after three 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.610
 of the month I became sous-chef in three months 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.560
 managed to do as much as these guys 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.459
 for two years they could not catch up 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.780
 experience gained therefore became sous-chef 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.270
 so if you are in now 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.040
 situations when you pile a bunch 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.280
 Doing work and with pleasure not 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.459
 pay attention that people around you 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.020
 who get paid as you are 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.680
 they will receive their own this one 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.540
 salary 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.270
 the same one they get today 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.100

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.140

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:09.950

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.830
 just over a kilometer 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.230
