it almost be ashamed to use these in a
stackable<00:00:45.000> operation<00:00:45.629> now<00:00:46.469> if<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.649> choose<00:00:46.890> to

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
stackable operation now if you choose to

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.970 
stackable operation now if you choose to
use<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.340> they<00:00:47.489> give<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.030> these<00:00:48.180> pieces<00:00:48.980> which

where they show you that and I'll show
you<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.760> because<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.119> don't<00:01:12.299> have<00:01:12.390> three

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
you that because I don't have three

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.880 
you that because I don't have three
amplifiers<00:01:12.840> stacked<00:01:13.320> together<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.710> show<00:01:13.830> you

but that's what two of them will look

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
but that's what two of them will look
like<00:01:16.380> right<00:01:16.590> there<00:01:17.270> not<00:01:18.270> bad<00:01:18.509> right<00:01:19.220> pretty

which<00:04:19.829> is<00:04:19.979> a<00:04:20.009> d-class<00:04:20.539> then<00:04:21.539> you<00:04:22.530> got<00:04:22.680> the

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
which is a d-class then you got the

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.189 
which is a d-class then you got the
two-point<00:04:23.250> 350<00:04:23.759> which<00:04:24.000> is<00:04:24.120> a<00:04:24.150> 350<00:04:24.840> watt<00:04:25.020> model

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
two-point 350 which is a 350 watt model

two-point 350 which is a 350 watt model
the<00:04:25.590> four-point<00:04:26.099> 320<00:04:26.610> which<00:04:26.639> is<00:04:26.880> a<00:04:26.910> 320<00:04:27.539> white

the four-point 320 which is a 320 white
4<00:04:28.020> channel<00:04:28.410> so<00:04:29.130> a<00:04:29.160> little<00:04:29.460> guy<00:04:29.550> then<00:04:30.030> you<00:04:30.150> have

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
4 channel so a little guy then you have

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.870 
4 channel so a little guy then you have
the<00:04:30.389> SEL<00:04:30.750> one-point<00:04:31.229> 600<00:04:31.979> d<00:04:32.069> which<00:04:32.220> is<00:04:32.250> a<00:04:32.430> 600

the SEL one-point 600 d which is a 600
Watts<00:04:33.030> so<00:04:33.840> with<00:04:34.680> that<00:04:34.830> said<00:04:35.569> the<00:04:36.569> six<00:04:36.810> channel

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
Watts so with that said the six channel

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.900 
Watts so with that said the six channel
is<00:04:37.259> just<00:04:37.289> a<00:04:37.590> lot<00:04:37.800> more<00:04:37.830> than<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.250> 6<00:04:38.490> channel<00:04:38.819> I

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
is just a lot more than a 6 channel I

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.820 
is just a lot more than a 6 channel I
mean<00:04:39.090> it's<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.360> 5<00:04:39.599> channel<00:04:39.990> amplifier<00:04:40.440> plus

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
mean it's a 5 channel amplifier plus

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.219 
mean it's a 5 channel amplifier plus
it's<00:04:41.130> just<00:04:41.400> is<00:04:41.849> it's<00:04:42.090> a<00:04:42.180> monster<00:04:42.509> it's<00:04:42.660> a<00:04:42.690> 5.1

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
it's just is it's a monster it's a 5.1

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.559 
it's just is it's a monster it's a 5.1
home<00:04:43.740> theater<00:04:44.099> system<00:04:44.400> really<00:04:44.699> in<00:04:44.849> a<00:04:45.150> box<00:04:45.360> but

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:45.569 
home theater system really in a box but

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:46.580 
home theater system really in a box but
that's<00:04:45.720> going<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:45.900> be<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.110> separate<00:04:46.470> amplifier

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
that's going to be a separate amplifier

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.189 
that's going to be a separate amplifier
I'm<00:04:47.039> not<00:04:47.190> going<00:04:47.310> to<00:04:47.370> really<00:04:47.460> touch<00:04:47.729> on<00:04:47.940> that

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
I'm not going to really touch on that

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.960 
I'm not going to really touch on that
but<00:04:49.199> uh<00:04:49.280> these<00:04:50.280> things<00:04:50.460> are<00:04:50.610> perfect<00:04:50.910> for

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
but uh these things are perfect for

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.399 
but uh these things are perfect for
hiding<00:04:51.120> underneath<00:04:51.449> you<00:04:51.660> see<00:04:51.840> it's<00:04:51.990> stacking

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:52.409 
hiding underneath you see it's stacking

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:53.749 
hiding underneath you see it's stacking
in<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:52.590> corners<00:04:52.919> of<00:04:52.949> your<00:04:53.069> trunk<00:04:53.400> or<00:04:53.550> just

cramming in as much power as you can

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.960

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
into a small place these amplifiers

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.029 
into a small place these amplifiers
allow<00:04:57.720> you<00:04:57.780> to<00:04:57.960> be<00:04:58.110> as<00:04:58.319> stealthy<00:04:58.560> as<00:04:58.800> you<00:04:58.889> need

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
allow you to be as stealthy as you need

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:00.920 
allow you to be as stealthy as you need
to<00:04:59.159> be<00:04:59.310> or<00:04:59.580> as<00:04:59.699> bold<00:04:59.909> as<00:05:00.120> you<00:05:00.240> want<00:05:00.449> to<00:05:00.539> be<00:05:00.659> just

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
to be or as bold as you want to be just

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.360 
to be or as bold as you want to be just
because<00:05:01.229> of<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.500> sheer<00:05:01.770> amount<00:05:01.800> of<00:05:02.159> power

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
because of the sheer amount of power

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.600 
because of the sheer amount of power
these<00:05:02.669> little<00:05:02.909> monsters<00:05:03.409> create<00:05:04.409> and<00:05:04.620> the

these little monsters create and the

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.460 
these little monsters create and the

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
lack of the absence of heat that that

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.140 
lack of the absence of heat that that
will<00:05:07.620> displace<00:05:07.949> which<00:05:08.190> is<00:05:08.340> a<00:05:08.370> very<00:05:08.699> good<00:05:08.819> thing

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
will displace which is a very good thing

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.080 
will displace which is a very good thing
for<00:05:09.360> me<00:05:10.039> big<00:05:11.039> big<00:05:11.430> thing<00:05:11.639> because<00:05:11.789> you<00:05:12.060> don't

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090
