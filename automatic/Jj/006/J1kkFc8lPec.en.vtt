00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
can see it's a very healthy and natural

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.169 
can see it's a very healthy and natural
food<00:00:12.780> source<00:00:13.080> for<00:00:13.170> them<00:00:13.610> but<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.730> does<00:00:14.880> contain

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
food source for them but it does contain

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.689 
food source for them but it does contain
a<00:00:15.389> lot<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.780> waste<00:00:16.470> like<00:00:16.890> phosphates<00:00:17.490> and

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
a lot of waste like phosphates and

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.929 
a lot of waste like phosphates and
nitrates<00:00:18.230> so<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.260> really<00:00:19.920> encourage<00:00:20.100> giving

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
nitrates so I really encourage giving

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.660 
nitrates so I really encourage giving
your<00:00:21.060> fish<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> treat<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:23.000> just<00:00:24.000> sticking<00:00:24.449> the

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
your fish a treat and just sticking the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.349 
your fish a treat and just sticking the
nori<00:00:26.960> onto<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.380> veggie<00:00:28.650> clip<00:00:29.029> and<00:00:30.029> having<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
nori onto a veggie clip and having the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.659 
nori onto a veggie clip and having the
fish<00:00:30.510> come<00:00:30.720> up<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.050> feed<00:00:31.260> from<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.550> do

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
fish come up and feed from it but I do

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.430 
fish come up and feed from it but I do
not<00:00:32.850> encourage<00:00:33.950> using<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.070> as<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.250> staple<00:00:35.700> food

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
not encourage using it as a staple food

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.959 
not encourage using it as a staple food
because<00:00:37.440> it's<00:00:37.800> too<00:00:38.040> messy<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.640> just<00:00:38.820> produces

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
because it's too messy it just produces

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.880 
because it's too messy it just produces
too<00:00:39.450> much<00:00:39.480> nitrate<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.290> phosphate<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.800> my

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
too much nitrate and phosphate in my

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.270 
too much nitrate and phosphate in my
tanks<00:00:41.329> so<00:00:42.329> I'm<00:00:42.450> not<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.629> huge<00:00:42.719> fan<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.590> for

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280

that<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.049> think<00:01:37.259> shouldn't<00:01:37.680> I've<00:01:37.829> seen<00:01:38.430> still

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
that you think shouldn't I've seen still

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.450 
that you think shouldn't I've seen still
eat<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.229> but<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.409> question<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.890> how<00:01:41.070> well<00:01:41.280> can

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
eat it but the question is how well can

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.749 
eat it but the question is how well can
they<00:01:41.579> digest<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.890> there's<00:01:43.890> absolutely<00:01:44.460> no

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
they digest it there's absolutely no

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.670 
they digest it there's absolutely no
point<00:01:45.030> feeding<00:01:45.540> terrestrial<00:01:46.079> plant<00:01:46.320> even<00:01:46.590> if

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
point feeding terrestrial plant even if

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.280 
point feeding terrestrial plant even if
you<00:01:46.799> blanch<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:48.090> lettuce<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:50.810> cabbage<00:01:51.810> and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
you blanch it so lettuce and cabbage and

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.510 
you blanch it so lettuce and cabbage and
all<00:01:52.380> these<00:01:52.470> other<00:01:52.680> stuff<00:01:52.920> people<00:01:53.100> feed<00:01:53.369> to

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
all these other stuff people feed to

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.850 
all these other stuff people feed to
their<00:01:53.670> fish<00:01:53.899> all<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.110> all<00:01:55.229> it's<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.470> waste<00:01:55.680> of

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
their fish all in all it's a waste of

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.319 
their fish all in all it's a waste of
time<00:01:56.040> because<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.549> fish<00:01:56.729> can't<00:01:57.000> actually

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
time because the fish can't actually

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.600 
time because the fish can't actually
digest<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.960> very<00:01:58.170> well<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:59.040> they<00:01:59.159> love<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.430> eat

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
digest it very well so they love to eat

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.069 
digest it very well so they love to eat
it<00:01:59.909> it'll<00:02:00.090> go<00:02:00.210> through<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.479> system<00:02:00.899> maybe

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
it it'll go through the system maybe

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.260 
it it'll go through the system maybe
it's<00:02:01.290> good<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.500> help<00:02:01.619> clean<00:02:01.860> them<00:02:01.979> out<00:02:02.270> but

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
it's good to help clean them out but

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.760 
it's good to help clean them out but
they<00:02:03.659> don't<00:02:03.780> digest<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.290> very<00:02:04.439> well<00:02:04.590> on<00:02:04.710> it

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
they don't digest it very well on it

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.440 
they don't digest it very well on it
definitely<00:02:05.310> ups<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.610> nitrate<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.299> phosphate

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
definitely ups the nitrate and phosphate

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.809 
definitely ups the nitrate and phosphate
in<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.930> tank<00:02:08.959> so<00:02:09.959> as<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.500> make<00:02:11.160> clear<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.550> every

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
in the tank so as I make clear in every

but<00:02:35.560> there's<00:02:35.740> no<00:02:35.950> doubt<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.220> fish<00:02:36.700> love<00:02:37.000> a

but there's no doubt that fish love a
little<00:02:37.270> bit<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.480> variety<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:38.160> they're

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.520 

and<00:02:48.240> notice<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.870> way<00:02:48.960> we've<00:02:49.110> got<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:49.440> many

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
and notice the way we've got so many

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.230 
and notice the way we've got so many
yellow<00:02:49.890> tangs<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.550> tank<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:50.910> they<00:02:51.000> all<00:02:51.120> go

yellow tangs in the tank and they all go

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.280 
yellow tangs in the tank and they all go
along<00:02:51.390> beautifully

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.130

as<00:02:52.590> these<00:02:53.340> numbers<00:02:53.760> thin<00:02:54.000> out<00:02:54.210> they<00:02:54.720> start<00:02:55.020> to

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
as these numbers thin out they start to

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.980 
as these numbers thin out they start to
fight<00:02:55.670> so<00:02:56.670> fighting<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.150> not<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.360> problem<00:02:57.660> in
