00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
online it'll be a little bit different

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.529

felt really really well made so maybe

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.789 
felt really really well made so maybe

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
and repeat call of duty but also it kind

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.210 
and repeat call of duty but also it kind
of<00:01:30.689> makes<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.140> really<00:01:31.350> good<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.829> mean<00:01:31.950> imagine

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
of makes it really good I mean imagine

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.609 
of makes it really good I mean imagine
if<00:01:32.430> they<00:01:32.579> did<00:01:32.880> change<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.659> much<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:33.930> you

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
if they did change it so much that you

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.710 
if they did change it so much that you
know<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.829> weren't<00:01:35.159> sure<00:01:35.430> how<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.670> play<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.600> it

know you weren't sure how to play and it

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.060 
know you weren't sure how to play and it
just<00:01:36.900> felt<00:01:37.110> weird<00:01:37.170> they<00:01:37.500> don't<00:01:37.619> be<00:01:37.710> very<00:01:37.920> good

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
just felt weird they don't be very good

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.010 
just felt weird they don't be very good
what<00:01:38.700> they've<00:01:38.850> done<00:01:39.090> from<00:01:39.509> what<00:01:39.659> I've<00:01:39.750> played

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
of gone back to basics in a way now

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.080 
of gone back to basics in a way now
there<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> lot<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.130> kill<00:01:56.460> streak<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.000> you

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
there is a lot of kill streak so you

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.880 
there is a lot of kill streak so you
might<00:01:57.270> say<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.960> know<00:01:58.079> how<00:01:58.259> can<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.469> be<00:01:58.530> more

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
might say you know how can this be more

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.380 
might say you know how can this be more
of<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.009> basic<00:01:59.399> games<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.670> lot<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.880> killstreaks

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
for the kill streaks are kind of hard to

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.100 
for the kill streaks are kind of hard to
get<00:02:02.240> from<00:02:03.240> what<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.479> have<00:02:03.630> noticed<00:02:03.810> because

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
modern warfare from black ops even not

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.270 
modern warfare from black ops even not
for<00:03:16.269> modern<00:03:16.480> warfare<00:03:16.709> so<00:03:17.709> that<00:03:17.860> was<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.010> really

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
for modern warfare so that was a really

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.670 
for modern warfare so that was a really
fun<00:03:18.640> good<00:03:19.239> all-round<00:03:19.750> gun<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.230> shotguns

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
weren't bad from what I played didn't

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.640 
weren't bad from what I played didn't
get<00:03:22.299> to<00:03:22.390> play<00:03:22.450> too<00:03:22.570> much<00:03:22.720> with<00:03:22.989> him<00:03:23.110> I<00:03:23.260> saw<00:03:23.620> a

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
get to play too much with him I saw a

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.620 
get to play too much with him I saw a
lot<00:03:23.739> of<00:03:23.860> people<00:03:24.310> go<00:03:24.459> straight<00:03:24.850> for<00:03:25.000> that<00:03:25.060> mp7

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
lot of people go straight for that mp7

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.509 
lot of people go straight for that mp7
when<00:03:25.930> they<00:03:26.049> were<00:03:26.110> playing<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:27.100> I<00:03:27.190> noticed

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
when they were playing and I noticed

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:28.949 
when they were playing and I noticed
that<00:03:27.549> seemed<00:03:27.820> to<00:03:27.850> be<00:03:28.030> a<00:03:28.060> bit<00:03:28.120> of<00:03:28.390> a<00:03:28.450> mistake<00:03:28.780> the

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
that seemed to be a bit of a mistake the

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.530 
that seemed to be a bit of a mistake the
mp7<00:03:29.260> in<00:03:29.620> black<00:03:29.769> ops<00:03:29.920> 2<00:03:30.040> it's<00:03:30.489> not<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.180> almighty

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
mp7 in black ops 2 it's not the almighty

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.300 
mp7 in black ops 2 it's not the almighty
gun<00:03:31.840> that<00:03:32.019> is<00:03:32.170> in<00:03:32.320> modern<00:03:32.560> warfare<00:03:32.709> 3<00:03:32.890> from

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
gun that is in modern warfare 3 from

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.160 
gun that is in modern warfare 3 from
what<00:03:33.489> I've<00:03:33.579> played<00:03:33.790> it<00:03:34.209> has<00:03:34.360> a<00:03:34.390> high<00:03:34.630> fire<00:03:35.019> rate

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
what I've played it has a high fire rate

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.110 
what I've played it has a high fire rate
it's<00:03:35.350> more<00:03:35.590> like<00:03:35.739> a<00:03:35.769> scorpion<00:03:36.310> to<00:03:36.760> be<00:03:36.880> able<00:03:36.970> to

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
it's more like a scorpion to be able to

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.270 
it's more like a scorpion to be able to
as<00:03:37.239> that<00:03:37.390> high<00:03:37.600> fire<00:03:37.930> rate<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.890> it<00:03:39.070> looks<00:03:39.220> like

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
as that high fire rate and it looks like

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.340 
as that high fire rate and it looks like
low<00:03:39.549> damage<00:03:39.790> also<00:03:40.209> in<00:03:40.540> black<00:03:40.720> ops<00:03:40.870> 2<00:03:40.989> on<00:03:41.170> things

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
low damage also in black ops 2 on things

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.050 
low damage also in black ops 2 on things
I<00:03:41.440> noticed<00:03:41.799> is<00:03:41.980> that<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:42.549> seem<00:03:42.730> to<00:03:42.760> have<00:03:42.880> to

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
I noticed is that you seem to have to

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.910 
I noticed is that you seem to have to
put<00:03:43.209> one<00:03:43.450> more<00:03:43.660> bullet<00:03:43.870> into<00:03:44.200> people<00:03:44.530> than<00:03:44.680> say

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
put one more bullet into people than say

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.410 
put one more bullet into people than say
modern<00:03:45.280> warfare<00:03:45.430> 3<00:03:45.640> if<00:03:45.970> you're<00:03:46.000> used<00:03:46.299> to

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
modern warfare 3 if you're used to

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.910 
modern warfare 3 if you're used to
playing<00:03:46.510> one<00:03:46.720> or<00:03:46.840> three<00:03:47.140> then<00:03:47.709> you're<00:03:47.829> going

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
playing one or three then you're going

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.350 
playing one or three then you're going
to<00:03:47.980> play<00:03:48.190> black<00:03:48.400> ops<00:03:48.549> 2<00:03:48.820> that's<00:03:49.000> something<00:03:49.329> to

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
to play black ops 2 that's something to

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.670 
to play black ops 2 that's something to
note<00:03:49.600> but<00:03:49.780> i<00:03:49.840> think<00:03:50.079> that<00:03:50.140> encourages

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
note but i think that encourages

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.830 
note but i think that encourages
accuracy<00:03:51.160> so<00:03:51.310> i<00:03:51.340> really<00:03:51.549> enjoyed<00:03:51.910> that<00:03:51.940> so<00:03:52.810> i
