00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
steady growth when it comes to applying

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.000 
steady growth when it comes to applying
time<00:00:09.210> especially<00:00:09.420> Matt<00:00:09.900> Greene<00:00:10.170> how<00:00:10.860> would

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
time especially Matt Greene how would

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.379 
time especially Matt Greene how would
you<00:00:11.130> assess<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.580> way<00:00:11.670> this<00:00:11.880> team<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.210> done

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
you assess the way this team is done

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.089 
you assess the way this team is done
especially<00:00:12.660> considering<00:00:13.469> all<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.769> injuries

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
especially considering all the injuries

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.250 
especially considering all the injuries
on<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.340> blue<00:00:14.490> line<00:00:14.639> it's<00:00:15.480> been<00:00:15.660> tough<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:16.080> think

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
on the blue line it's been tough I think

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.080 
on the blue line it's been tough I think
it's<00:00:16.350> hard<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.250> assess<00:00:17.430> what<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.670> were<00:00:17.760> doing

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
it's hard to assess what we were doing

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.400 
it's hard to assess what we were doing
playing<00:00:18.359> with<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.570> really<00:00:18.779> depleted<00:00:19.020> line<00:00:19.289> up

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
playing with it really depleted line up

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.410 
playing with it really depleted line up
the<00:00:19.500> whole<00:00:19.650> time<00:00:19.830> but<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.820> last<00:00:21.000> few<00:00:21.150> games

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
the whole time but the last few games

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.450 
the whole time but the last few games
doesn't<00:00:22.020> show<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.980> stats<00:00:23.220> when

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
doesn't show it in the the stats when

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.120 
doesn't show it in the the stats when
they<00:00:23.550> couldn't<00:00:23.820> plan<00:00:23.970> really<00:00:24.119> well<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:25.230> say

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
they couldn't plan really well and I say

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.560 
they couldn't plan really well and I say
it's<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.340> matter<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.550> time<00:00:26.640> before<00:00:26.910> before<00:00:27.390> we

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
it's a matter of time before before we

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
it's a matter of time before before we
get<00:00:27.660> these<00:00:27.779> one<00:00:27.990> if<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.170> keep<00:00:28.289> playing<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
get these one if we keep playing the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.050 
get these one if we keep playing the
same<00:00:28.650> way<00:00:28.890> you've<00:00:29.279> been<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.519> three<00:00:29.789> straight

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
same way you've been in three straight

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.669 
same way you've been in three straight
one-goal<00:00:30.330> games<00:00:30.779> which<00:00:31.019> have<00:00:31.170> obviously<00:00:31.470> gone

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
one-goal games which have obviously gone

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.470 
one-goal games which have obviously gone
the<00:00:32.099> wrong<00:00:32.250> way<00:00:32.309> for<00:00:32.700> your<00:00:32.790> team<00:00:33.030> do<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.210> kind

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
the wrong way for your team do you kind

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.240 
the wrong way for your team do you kind
of<00:00:33.540> sense<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.020> you're<00:00:34.140> getting<00:00:34.380> closer<00:00:34.620> to

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
of sense that you're getting closer to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.830 
of sense that you're getting closer to
getting<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.610> big<00:00:35.790> victory<00:00:36.180> only<00:00:36.630> we're

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
getting that big victory only we're

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.880 
getting that big victory only we're
getting<00:00:37.020> closer<00:00:37.230> yeah<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.500> think<00:00:37.710> we're

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
getting closer yeah I think we're

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.920 
getting closer yeah I think we're
playing<00:00:38.010> well<00:00:38.309> we're<00:00:38.969> playing<00:00:39.270> smart<00:00:39.600> lot

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
playing well we're playing smart lot

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.440 
playing well we're playing smart lot
smarter<00:00:40.170> than<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.440> were<00:00:40.590> before<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.210> I<00:00:42.210> think

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
smarter than we were before and I think

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.090 
smarter than we were before and I think
we're<00:00:42.540> realizing<00:00:42.780> what<00:00:43.020> we<00:00:43.140> got<00:00:43.290> we're<00:00:43.590> using
