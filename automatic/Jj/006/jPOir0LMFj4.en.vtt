reasonable um and like I said my opinion

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.970 
reasonable um and like I said my opinion
is<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.240> think<00:03:16.300> DG<00:03:16.750> Hegarty<00:03:17.020> games<00:03:17.260> are<00:03:17.440> good

is I think DG Hegarty games are good
I<00:03:18.010> do<00:03:18.340> think<00:03:18.760> it'll<00:03:19.170> cause<00:03:20.170> some<00:03:21.010> of<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.220> games

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
I do think it'll cause some of the games

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.760 
I do think it'll cause some of the games
to<00:03:21.640> naturally<00:03:22.030> inflate<00:03:22.390> in<00:03:22.540> price<00:03:22.780> just

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
to naturally inflate in price just

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.040 
to naturally inflate in price just
because<00:03:24.040> once<00:03:24.430> things<00:03:24.670> get<00:03:24.910> to<00:03:25.120> be<00:03:25.240> graded<00:03:25.720> you

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
because once things get to be graded you

depending<00:04:25.330> on<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.840> packaging<00:04:26.260> because<00:04:26.320> you

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
depending on the packaging because you

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.670 
depending on the packaging because you
can<00:04:26.590> get<00:04:26.710> different<00:04:26.800> cases<00:04:27.370> some

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
can get different cases some

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.400 
can get different cases some
I've<00:04:27.889> like<00:04:28.070> UV<00:04:28.340> protection<00:04:28.729> cases<00:04:29.229> some<00:04:30.229> of

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
I've like UV protection cases some of

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.200 
I've like UV protection cases some of
them<00:04:30.530> are<00:04:31.070> a<00:04:31.100> little<00:04:31.190> more<00:04:31.340> basic<00:04:31.550> in<00:04:31.940> the

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
them are a little more basic in the

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.029 
them are a little more basic in the
grade<00:04:32.449> but<00:04:33.229> again<00:04:33.470> it<00:04:33.620> depends<00:04:33.889> on<00:04:33.949> the

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
grade but again it depends on the

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.580 
grade but again it depends on the
package<00:04:34.220> you<00:04:34.430> get<00:04:34.729> I<00:04:34.970> do<00:04:35.840> know<00:04:36.110> they<00:04:36.289> grade

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
package you get I do know they grade

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.469 
package you get I do know they grade
based<00:04:36.830> on<00:04:37.039> scale<00:04:37.400> of<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.699> value<00:04:38.030> for<00:04:38.360> my

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
based on scale of the value for my

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.180 
based on scale of the value for my
understanding<00:04:38.750> again<00:04:39.199> this<00:04:39.500> is<00:04:39.650> all<00:04:39.830> from

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
understanding again this is all from

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.279 
understanding again this is all from
what<00:04:40.759> I've<00:04:40.880> read<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.120> things<00:04:41.870> like<00:04:42.050> that<00:04:42.259> I

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
what I've read and things like that I

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.020 
what I've read and things like that I
don't<00:04:42.560> know<00:04:42.680> concrete<00:04:43.250> so<00:04:43.430> you<00:04:43.490> would<00:04:43.759> have<00:04:43.940> to

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
don't know concrete so you would have to

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.050 
don't know concrete so you would have to
go<00:04:44.150> to<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:47.350> VG<00:04:48.350> greater<00:04:48.800> calm<00:04:49.580> eyes

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.570 
go to the the VG greater calm eyes
believe<00:04:50.449> that's<00:04:50.889> it's<00:04:51.889> not<00:04:52.039> gonna<00:04:52.220> say<00:04:52.460> it

the packages they offer I know they have

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
some that are a little more elite that

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.939 
some that are a little more elite that
are<00:05:02.330> a<00:05:02.389> little<00:05:02.479> more<00:05:02.630> expensive<00:05:03.139> and<00:05:03.500> the

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
are a little more expensive and the

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:05.140 
are a little more expensive and the
pricing<00:05:04.340> if<00:05:04.460> you<00:05:04.550> want<00:05:04.699> something<00:05:04.910> that's

pricing if you want something that's

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.230 
pricing if you want something that's
super<00:05:05.449> expensive<00:05:05.840> done<00:05:06.370> they'll<00:05:07.370> do<00:05:07.940> it<00:05:08.090> but

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
super expensive done they'll do it but

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.680 
super expensive done they'll do it but
it'll<00:05:08.389> cost<00:05:08.570> more<00:05:08.780> of<00:05:08.870> a<00:05:08.930> fee<00:05:09.340> and<00:05:10.509> lastly<00:05:11.509> they

it'll cost more of a fee and lastly they

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.420 
it'll cost more of a fee and lastly they
do<00:05:11.750> make<00:05:12.020> custom<00:05:12.440> cases<00:05:12.800> these<00:05:13.070> are<00:05:13.220> hard

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
do make custom cases these are hard

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.050 
do make custom cases these are hard
acrylic<00:05:14.710> cases<00:05:15.710> I<00:05:15.830> mean<00:05:15.979> these<00:05:16.190> are<00:05:16.430> when<00:05:17.000> you

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
acrylic cases I mean these are when you

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.990 
acrylic cases I mean these are when you
can<00:05:17.210> see<00:05:17.389> the<00:05:17.570> space<00:05:18.169> you<00:05:18.380> have<00:05:18.729> you<00:05:19.729> also<00:05:19.849> come

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
can see the space you have you also come

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.730 
can see the space you have you also come
these<00:05:20.240> little<00:05:20.419> baggies<00:05:20.870> and<00:05:20.900> I<00:05:21.080> guess<00:05:21.349> people

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
these little baggies and I guess people

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.320 
these little baggies and I guess people
tend<00:05:22.280> to<00:05:22.340> keep<00:05:22.490> them<00:05:22.639> in<00:05:22.759> the<00:05:22.849> baggie<00:05:23.000> so<00:05:23.150> I

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
tend to keep them in the baggie so I

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.969 
tend to keep them in the baggie so I
didn't<00:05:23.599> take<00:05:23.780> mine<00:05:23.930> off<00:05:23.960> my<00:05:24.410> Ninja<00:05:24.680> Turtles

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
didn't take mine off my Ninja Turtles

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:26.260 
didn't take mine off my Ninja Turtles
one<00:05:25.130> also<00:05:25.340> came<00:05:25.639> in<00:05:25.729> a<00:05:25.789> baggie

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
one also came in a baggie

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.480 
one also came in a baggie
I<00:05:26.300> guess<00:05:27.020> that<00:05:27.229> also<00:05:27.380> kind<00:05:27.680> of<00:05:27.710> legitimizes

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
I guess that also kind of legitimizes

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.550 
I guess that also kind of legitimizes
the<00:05:28.940> casing<00:05:29.360> itself<00:05:29.509> because<00:05:30.259> when<00:05:30.410> it's

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
the casing itself because when it's

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.560 
the casing itself because when it's
displayed<00:05:30.979> front<00:05:31.370> wise<00:05:31.520> you<00:05:31.820> know<00:05:31.849> the<00:05:32.389> baggie

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
displayed front wise you know the baggie

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.939 
displayed front wise you know the baggie
doesn't<00:05:32.870> really<00:05:32.990> show<00:05:33.199> and<00:05:33.440> you<00:05:33.500> can<00:05:33.680> display

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
doesn't really show and you can display

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:37.659 
doesn't really show and you can display
it<00:05:34.039> um<00:05:35.349> which<00:05:36.349> you<00:05:36.500> can<00:05:36.710> see<00:05:36.949> from<00:05:36.979> here<00:05:37.400> I<00:05:37.490> mean

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
it um which you can see from here I mean

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.420
