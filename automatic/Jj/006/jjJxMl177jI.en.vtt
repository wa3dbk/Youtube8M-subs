00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.690
 Welcome and welcome battery 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.480
 we often have this in front of us 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:18.430
 telekom stood on the cebit in hall 4 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:20.500
 d26 the samsung galaxy s 6 samsung 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.509
 galaxy s 6 will be available from the tenth april 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.539
 to be in germany and to be 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.830
 priced from 699 euros for the version with 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.019
 32gb 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.950
 In addition, there are still 64 gigabytes 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:36.070
 for them only 99 euros and 128 gigabytes with 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.020
 899 euro most important innovation opposite 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.820
 the predecessor model in samsung galaxy s 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.739
 5 is certainly the material of the case 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.270
 we have a glass coating 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.770
 no more plastic like the samsung 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.960
 galaxy s 5 was the case 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.940
 We also have a metal frame 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.710
 The samsung galaxy s 6 is the disadvantage 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.410
 Of course that one does not have the battery 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.269
 can remove more manually a short 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.219
 word still to the camera has the main camera 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.850
 a resolution of 16 megapixels and 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.530
 Will support in led flash light and 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.510
 autofocus the second camera on the 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.740
 front Samsung Galaxy S 6 has one 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.210
 resolution of up to 5 megapixels 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.850
 a strong improvement over the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.130
 predecessor is the display we have 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.600
 namely 51 should be with a gigantic 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.659
 resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.399
 equals quad hd resolution 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.860
 besides we have a very high one 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.649
 pixel density of 577 pixels per 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.049
 square inches are not the dimensions 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.049
 overflowing we have 143 4 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:38.130
 millimeter in height 70 5 mm in the 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.560
 wide and only 68 millimeter depth in the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.909
 Contrary to samsung gt s 6 that you 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.590
 look at the cebit here too 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.259
 can the samsung galaxy s 6 have one 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.659
 traditional form of display so 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.090
 no curves on the sides completely 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.250
 normal just front otherwise 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.590
 many technical as identical with that 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.390
 to name the sister model is here 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.619
 All in all, the processor makes you one 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.869
 really good impression we have 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.789
 already a tubandt market test with the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.369
 sister model to the samsung galaxy s 6 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.560
 here are also almost done 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.929
 60,000 points get away from the start 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.850
 samsung galaxy s 6 has that 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.650
 operating system android 5.0 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.750
 one of the most important innovations is here 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.100
 the so-called multi vendor view of 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.049
 ongoing application beyond where 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.260
 of course also security features 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.660
 improved and above all the performance 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.150
 the processor will be at this new 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.450
 android operating system version opposite 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.850
 android 4.4 better maxed out for lte 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.739
 category 6 can be the samsung galaxy s 6 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.079
 theoretically up to 300 meters per second 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.790
 surfing fast here at the cebit booth 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.650
 telekom, of course, we have the lte network 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.060
 was the telecom stock right now 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.350
 time a short speed test 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.569
 as we can see we have one 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.470
 really very high download rate 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.910
 of around 55 million per second 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.090
 Otherwise, of course, the Samsung Galaxy 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.470
 s 6 everything that the heart desires what 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.140
 I still forget together, for example 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.820
 bluetooth 4.1 is the newest 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.870
 version of course the latest wlan 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.320
 version is on board 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.080
 By the way , nfc also comes with nfc 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.510
 soon about the payment system samsung 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.620
 pay at least pay the usa in the 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.960
 second half of the year 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.060
 In addition, this also supports this 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.040
 device can be strong in so-called ps 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.620
 are charged wirelessly according to manufacturer 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.230
 By the way, should we call the samsung galaxy s 6 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.730
 compared to the previous model up to 15 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.730
 times player lay
