00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
we're trying a new error configuration

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.309 
we're trying a new error configuration
for<00:02:26.870> IndyCar<00:02:27.459> so<00:02:28.459> basically<00:02:29.269> if<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:29.900> look<00:02:30.079> at

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
for IndyCar so basically if you look at

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.199 
for IndyCar so basically if you look at
it<00:02:30.349> we<00:02:31.340> have<00:02:31.609> the<00:02:32.769> Indy<00:02:33.769> package<00:02:34.219> now<00:02:34.790> in<00:02:35.090> the

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
it we have the Indy package now in the

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.759 
it we have the Indy package now in the
car<00:02:35.450> basically<00:02:36.049> like<00:02:36.319> looks<00:02:36.590> like<00:02:36.650> the

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
car basically like looks like the

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.429 
car basically like looks like the
Batmobile<00:02:37.069> wing<00:02:37.609> and<00:02:37.909> so<00:02:38.569> that's<00:02:38.749> what<00:02:39.049> the

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:39.439 
Batmobile wing and so that's what the

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:42.520 
Batmobile wing and so that's what the
series<00:02:40.159> is<00:02:40.189> trying<00:02:40.489> to<00:02:40.730> push<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.870> try<00:02:42.079> for<00:02:42.500> next

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
series is trying to push to try for next

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.679 
series is trying to push to try for next
year<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.010> because<00:02:43.760> we're<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.060> first<00:02:44.359> guys<00:02:44.659> to

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
year and because we're the first guys to

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.050 
year and because we're the first guys to
try<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.950> probably<00:02:46.430> is<00:02:46.579> going<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.790> be<00:02:46.939> the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
try that probably is going to be the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.599 
try that probably is going to be the
rule<00:02:47.269> and<00:02:47.439> we<00:02:48.439> tried<00:02:48.739> this<00:02:48.980> morning<00:02:49.219> it<00:02:49.459> was<00:02:49.519> a

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
rule and we tried this morning it was a

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.890 
rule and we tried this morning it was a
lot<00:02:49.849> quicker<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:52.060> think<00:02:53.060> Eddie<00:02:53.239> will<00:02:53.510> be<00:02:53.659> but<00:02:53.870> I

lot quicker I think Eddie will be but I

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.990 
lot quicker I think Eddie will be but I
don't<00:02:54.109> think<00:02:54.200> Eddie<00:02:54.379> will<00:02:54.620> live<00:02:54.769> here<00:02:55.000> you

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.140 

just<00:03:32.530> getting<00:03:32.800> used<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:33.069> the<00:03:33.610> team<00:03:33.790> you<00:03:34.030> know

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
and everything and it's been really good

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.280 
and everything and it's been really good
so<00:03:36.190> far<00:03:36.640> even<00:03:36.819> coming<00:03:37.569> to<00:03:37.660> an<00:03:37.750> oval<00:03:38.050> you<00:03:38.170> know

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
so far even coming to an oval you know

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.500 
so far even coming to an oval you know
with<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.500> Chevy<00:03:38.860> there's<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:39.880> lot<00:03:40.030> of<00:03:40.060> things<00:03:40.360> I

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
with the Chevy there's a lot of things I

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.059 
with the Chevy there's a lot of things I
have<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:40.720> learn<00:03:40.959> from<00:03:41.319> it<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:41.740> it's

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
have to learn from it and it's

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:43.260 
have to learn from it and it's
definitely<00:03:42.310> quicker<00:03:42.640> than<00:03:42.880> what<00:03:43.150> I've

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
definitely quicker than what I've

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.600 
definitely quicker than what I've
experienced<00:03:43.870> before<00:03:44.020> here<00:03:44.470> so<00:03:44.740> it's<00:03:45.459> been

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
experienced before here so it's been

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.030 
experienced before here so it's been
pretty<00:03:45.880> good<00:03:45.940> so<00:03:46.270> far<00:03:46.300> and<00:03:46.690> no<00:03:46.810> cars<00:03:47.140> has<00:03:47.770> been

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
pretty good so far and no cars has been

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.800 
pretty good so far and no cars has been
good<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:48.400> I<00:03:48.730> think<00:03:48.880> Tony<00:03:49.330> just<00:03:49.480> tried<00:03:49.780> a

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
good and I think Tony just tried a

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.080 
good and I think Tony just tried a
different<00:03:50.110> air<00:03:50.740> oak<00:03:50.920> it<00:03:51.130> too<00:03:51.400> so<00:03:51.670> I<00:03:51.700> think

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
different air oak it too so I think

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.510 
different air oak it too so I think
we're<00:03:52.180> just<00:03:52.209> going<00:03:52.480> through<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.780> program<00:03:53.050> and

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
we're just going through the program and

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.000 
we're just going through the program and
get<00:03:54.520> quicker<00:03:54.760> every<00:03:55.030> time<00:03:55.209> go<00:03:55.390> out<00:03:55.510> there

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.619 

I<00:03:58.069> thought<00:03:58.400> last<00:03:58.700> year<00:03:58.909> all<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.209> cars<00:03:59.540> were

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
I thought last year all the cars were

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:01.750 
I thought last year all the cars were
great<00:04:00.049> you<00:04:00.260> know<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:01.250> biggest<00:04:01.549> thing<00:04:01.700> i

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
great you know and the biggest thing i

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.899 
great you know and the biggest thing i
think<00:04:01.790> that<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:02.269> racing<00:04:03.159> was<00:04:04.159> pretty<00:04:04.579> pretty

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
think that the racing was pretty pretty

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:06.699 
think that the racing was pretty pretty
incredible<00:04:05.150> out<00:04:05.629> there<00:04:05.659> in<00:04:05.930> a<00:04:06.019> lot<00:04:06.170> of<00:04:06.290> passing

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
incredible out there in a lot of passing

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.160 
incredible out there in a lot of passing
a<00:04:06.769> lot<00:04:06.920> of<00:04:07.010> lead<00:04:07.159> changes<00:04:07.640> and<00:04:07.870> that's<00:04:08.870> what

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
a lot of lead changes and that's what

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.910 
a lot of lead changes and that's what
that's<00:04:09.769> what<00:04:09.860> makes<00:04:10.159> it<00:04:10.280> really<00:04:10.459> cool

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.320 

it's<00:04:13.160> really<00:04:13.400> exciting<00:04:13.790> for<00:04:13.819> me<00:04:14.000> because<00:04:14.090> uh

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
it's really exciting for me because uh

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.229

yeah I've been three season in indy cars

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.240 
yeah I've been three season in indy cars
and<00:04:17.450> I've<00:04:17.959> always<00:04:18.200> had<00:04:18.380> to<00:04:18.560> figure<00:04:18.769> things<00:04:19.040> out

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
and I've always had to figure things out

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.340 
and I've always had to figure things out
myself<00:04:19.549> and<00:04:20.060> Tony<00:04:20.510> as<00:04:20.720> it<00:04:20.900> has<00:04:21.049> a<00:04:21.079> lot<00:04:21.320> of

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
myself and Tony as it has a lot of

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.250 
myself and Tony as it has a lot of
experience<00:04:21.950> especially<00:04:22.550> on<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.660> ovals<00:04:24.020> too

experience especially on the ovals too
so<00:04:24.560> where<00:04:24.800> I<00:04:24.830> think<00:04:25.250> I've<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:26.090> most<00:04:26.330> to<00:04:26.630> learn

so where I think I've the most to learn
you<00:04:27.110> know<00:04:27.260> I<00:04:27.290> think<00:04:27.440> there's<00:04:28.190> a<00:04:28.250> lot<00:04:28.730> I<00:04:28.760> can
