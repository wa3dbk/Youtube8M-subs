battery<00:01:32.220> comes<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:34.590> know

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
battery comes and this is you know

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.039 
battery comes and this is you know
manufactured<00:01:35.460> by<00:01:35.610> msi<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.689> like<00:01:36.840> the

official msi nine cell batteries all the
other<00:01:39.390> nine<00:01:39.659> cells<00:01:39.960> are<00:01:40.229> kind<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:41.130> know

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
other nine cells are kind of you know

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.880 
other nine cells are kind of you know
OEM<00:01:41.610> third-party<00:01:42.210> kind<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.570> deals<00:01:42.750> see<00:01:43.710> that

OEM third-party kind of deals see that
this<00:01:44.280> kind<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:44.790> maybe<00:01:44.970> doubles<00:01:45.390> as<00:01:45.479> a

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
this kind of like maybe doubles as a

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.520 
this kind of like maybe doubles as a
little<00:01:45.780> handle<00:01:46.579> anyways<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:48.290> know<00:01:49.290> this

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
little handle anyways you know this

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.020 
little handle anyways you know this
one's<00:01:49.770> got<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:49.979> wireless<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.670> bluetooth

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
one's got the wireless and bluetooth

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.179 
one's got the wireless and bluetooth
like<00:01:51.720> i<00:01:51.810> said

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
like i said

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.120 
like i said
it's<00:01:53.189> got<00:01:53.340> pretty<00:01:53.700> much<00:01:53.820> everything<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.360> need

so<00:01:59.130> I'm<00:01:59.220> going<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.369> go<00:01:59.490> ahead<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.700> stick<00:02:00.030> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
so I'm going to go ahead and stick the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.840 
so I'm going to go ahead and stick the
nine<00:02:01.020> cell<00:02:01.350> into<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.310> back<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.729> unit

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
nine cell into the the back of the unit

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.139 
nine cell into the the back of the unit
here<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.470> guys<00:02:04.680> can<00:02:04.890> take<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.159> look<00:02:05.430> at<00:02:05.939> how

here so you guys can take a look at how

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.990 
here so you guys can take a look at how
the<00:02:06.210> scans<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:07.950> basically<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.610> can<00:02:08.759> kind<00:02:08.970> of

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
the scans and basically you can kind of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.440 
the scans and basically you can kind of
