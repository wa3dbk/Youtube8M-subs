number<00:00:05.279> one<00:00:05.430> is<00:00:05.580> minimalism<00:00:06.089> every<00:00:06.569> morning<00:00:06.899> I

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
number one is minimalism every morning I

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.600 
number one is minimalism every morning I
wake<00:00:07.170> up<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.529> unhook<00:00:07.890> my<00:00:08.069> hammock<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.519> I

wake up and unhook my hammock and I

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.669 
wake up and unhook my hammock and I
instantly<00:00:08.849> have<00:00:09.120> 40<00:00:09.480> square<00:00:09.780> feet<00:00:09.809> more<00:00:10.290> free

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.379 
instantly have 40 square feet more free
space<00:00:11.040> there's<00:00:11.519> so<00:00:11.820> much<00:00:12.000> room<00:00:12.360> for

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
space there's so much room for

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.690 
space there's so much room for
activities<00:00:12.769> basically<00:00:13.769> imagine<00:00:14.549> your

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
activities basically imagine your

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.320 
activities basically imagine your
bedroom

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
bedroom

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.510 
bedroom
and<00:00:15.929> now<00:00:16.080> imagine<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.650> without<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.949> bed<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.400> it's

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
and now imagine it without a bed so it's

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.689 
and now imagine it without a bed so it's
kind<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.850> just<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.240> room<00:00:18.600> less<00:00:19.050> bed<00:00:19.470> means<00:00:20.310> more

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
kind of just a room less bed means more

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.029

room<00:00:21.150> my<00:00:21.539> hammock<00:00:21.869> doubles<00:00:22.260> as<00:00:22.380> my<00:00:22.590> work<00:00:22.800> desk

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
room my hammock doubles as my work desk

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.070 
room my hammock doubles as my work desk
which<00:00:23.400> does<00:00:23.670> take<00:00:23.880> up<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.090> lot<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.269> space<00:00:24.689> but

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
which does take up a lot of space but

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.140 
which does take up a lot of space but
it's<00:00:25.320> still<00:00:25.560> more<00:00:25.830> efficient<00:00:26.369> than<00:00:26.730> if<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.970> had

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
it's still more efficient than if I had

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.169 
it's still more efficient than if I had
both<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.539> bed<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.140> desk<00:00:28.410> or<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.920> desk<00:00:29.400> bed<00:00:29.670> this

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
is my desk but it's a bit it's a bit

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.920 
is my desk but it's a bit it's a bit
desk<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.550> like<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.759> bidet<00:00:33.180> four<00:00:33.480> bedrooms

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930

desk it's like a bidet four bedrooms
only<00:00:34.860> they<00:00:35.010> don't<00:00:35.219> do<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.550> same<00:00:35.760> thing<00:00:36.059> number

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
only they don't do the same thing number

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.479 
only they don't do the same thing number
two<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.050> will<00:00:37.230> actually<00:00:37.410> make<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.070> into<00:00:38.460> a

better<00:00:38.790> person<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.660> would<00:00:39.780> probably<00:00:40.140> assume

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
better person you would probably assume

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.959 
better person you would probably assume
that<00:00:40.530> sleeping<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.980> hammock<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.430> bad<00:00:41.670> for

your<00:00:42.030> back<00:00:42.270> well<00:00:42.660> you'd<00:00:42.780> be<00:00:42.899> wrong

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
your back well you'd be wrong

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.500 
your back well you'd be wrong
idiot<00:00:44.399> if<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.730> sleep<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> correct

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
idiot if you sleep in the correct

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.360 
idiot if you sleep in the correct
position<00:00:45.989> your<00:00:46.289> back<00:00:46.469> will<00:00:46.680> actually<00:00:46.950> flatten

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
position your back will actually flatten

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.040 
position your back will actually flatten
out<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.640> you'll<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:47.910> zero<00:00:48.270> pressure<00:00:48.600> points

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
out and you'll have zero pressure points

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.619 
out and you'll have zero pressure points
making<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.620> better<00:00:49.950> than<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> bed<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.300> sleep

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
making it better than a bed I sleep

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
out of my bed it makes it easier for me

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.500 
out of my bed it makes it easier for me
to<00:01:07.710> not<00:01:07.950> fall<00:01:08.220> asleep<00:01:08.310> after<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> turn<00:01:09.090> my<00:01:09.240> alarm

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
to not fall asleep after I turn my alarm

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.730 
to not fall asleep after I turn my alarm
off<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:10.020> am<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:11.159> perfect<00:01:11.369> human<00:01:11.960> almost<00:01:12.960> just

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
off I am the perfect human almost just

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.640 
off I am the perfect human almost just
in<00:01:13.890> regards<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.549> how<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.330> sleep<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.380> last

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
in regards to how I sleep the last

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.980 
in regards to how I sleep the last
reason<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:17.909> cool<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.450> little<00:01:18.840> house

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
reason is that it's cool a little house

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.140 
reason is that it's cool a little house
to<00:01:19.290> put<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.619> I'm<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.920> cooler<00:01:20.369> person<00:01:20.909> you

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
to put it I'm a cooler person you

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.530 
to put it I'm a cooler person you
because<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.110> sleep<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.650> hammock<00:01:23.240> I'm<00:01:24.240> sorry

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
because I sleep in a hammock I'm sorry

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.999 
because I sleep in a hammock I'm sorry
so<00:01:24.900> those<00:01:25.049> are<00:01:25.170> my<00:01:25.290> three<00:01:25.530> reasons<00:01:25.890> for

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
so those are my three reasons for

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.830 
so those are my three reasons for
replacing<00:01:26.340> your<00:01:26.520> bed<00:01:26.729> with<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> hammock<00:01:27.180> if<00:01:27.689> any

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
replacing your bed with a hammock if any

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.210 
replacing your bed with a hammock if any
of<00:01:27.960> my<00:01:28.020> arguments<00:01:28.500> were<00:01:28.619> less<00:01:29.189> than

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
of my arguments were less than

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.740 
of my arguments were less than
convincing<00:01:29.670> that's<00:01:30.119> probably<00:01:30.390> because<00:01:30.540> I

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
convincing that's probably because I

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.060 
convincing that's probably because I
don't<00:01:31.020> actually<00:01:31.140> know<00:01:31.470> what<00:01:31.590> I'm<00:01:31.710> talking

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070
