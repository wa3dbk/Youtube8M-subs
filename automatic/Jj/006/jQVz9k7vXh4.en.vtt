that<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.750> what<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.200> call<00:01:19.590> choose<00:01:20.009> what<00:01:20.909> makes<00:01:21.150> it

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
that is what I call choose what makes it

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.780 
that is what I call choose what makes it
even<00:01:21.450> better<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:22.350> neatly<00:01:22.710> separates<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> hard

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
even better it neatly separates the hard

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.270 
even better it neatly separates the hard
fibers<00:01:24.270> from<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.540> juice<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.830> means<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.250> can

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
fibers from the juice this means you can

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.010 
fibers from the juice this means you can
keep<00:01:26.549> juicing<00:01:27.119> continuously<00:01:27.810> without

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
keep juicing continuously without

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.980 
keep juicing continuously without
stopping<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.520> pulp<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.060> also<00:01:30.479> dry<00:01:30.810> and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
stopping the pulp is also dry and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.060 
stopping the pulp is also dry and
compact<00:01:32.509> it<00:01:33.509> rotates<00:01:33.990> slowly<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> juice

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
compact it rotates slowly so the juice

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.340 
compact it rotates slowly so the juice
doesn't<00:01:35.340> oxidize<00:01:35.640> or<00:01:36.180> lose<00:01:36.689> its<00:01:36.869> nutrients

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
doesn't oxidize or lose its nutrients

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.859 
doesn't oxidize or lose its nutrients
you<00:01:38.159> can<00:01:38.340> keep<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> juice<00:01:38.939> fresh<00:01:39.329> for<00:01:39.600> up<00:01:39.630> to
