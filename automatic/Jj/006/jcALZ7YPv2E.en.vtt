there's nowhere where you can just go

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.059 
there's nowhere where you can just go
and<00:03:23.480> buy<00:03:23.540> a<00:03:23.720> costume<00:03:24.079> off<00:03:24.439> the<00:03:24.620> shelf<00:03:24.890> that

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
and buy a costume off the shelf that

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:26.380 
and buy a costume off the shelf that
will<00:03:25.189> get<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:25.459> as<00:03:25.579> to<00:03:25.700> either<00:03:26.000> one<00:03:26.180> of<00:03:26.209> the

I think some people who see us maybe at

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.190 
I think some people who see us maybe at
conventions<00:03:53.730> or<00:03:54.030> something<00:03:54.480> they<00:03:55.020> might

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
conventions or something they might
