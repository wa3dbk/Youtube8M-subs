hello<00:00:01.050> this<00:00:01.170> is<00:00:01.199> my<00:00:01.500> cue<00:00:01.680> has<00:00:01.770> a<00:00:01.829> case<00:00:02.100> aah<00:00:02.460> I

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
hello this is my cue has a case aah I

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.519 
hello this is my cue has a case aah I
want<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.149> talk<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.360> little<00:00:03.600> bit<00:00:03.870> about<00:00:03.899> how

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
want to talk a little bit about how

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.550 
want to talk a little bit about how
acceleration<00:00:05.430> sensitivity<00:00:06.180> works<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:07.379> what

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
acceleration sensitivity works and what

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.820 
acceleration sensitivity works and what
it<00:00:07.680> does<00:00:07.890> in<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.189> CVT<00:00:08.580> tractor<00:00:09.320> the<00:00:10.320> button<00:00:10.710> is

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
it does in a CVT tractor the button is

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.369 
it does in a CVT tractor the button is
located<00:00:11.010> right<00:00:11.400> here<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:12.019> shows<00:00:13.019> one<00:00:14.150> two<00:00:15.379> or

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
located right here it shows one two or

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.210 
located right here it shows one two or
three<00:00:16.609> green<00:00:17.609> lights<00:00:18.470> what<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.650> means<00:00:19.920> is

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
three green lights what this means is

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.390 
three green lights what this means is
how<00:00:21.119> responsive<00:00:22.080> do<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.320> accelerate<00:00:23.130> and

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
how responsive do I accelerate and

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.259 
how responsive do I accelerate and
decelerate<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.840> tractor<00:00:25.519> so<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.789> test

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
decelerate the tractor so in this test

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.939 
decelerate the tractor so in this test
I've<00:00:27.330> set<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.660> tractor<00:00:28.019> up<00:00:28.050> for<00:00:28.260> 31<00:00:28.619> mile<00:00:28.769> per

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
I've set the tractor up for 31 mile per

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.890 
I've set the tractor up for 31 mile per
hour<00:00:29.010> I've<00:00:29.760> got<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.029> throttles<00:00:30.420> completely

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
hour I've got the throttles completely

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.310 
hour I've got the throttles completely
split<00:00:31.140> I'm<00:00:31.800> gonna<00:00:32.070> use<00:00:32.250> my<00:00:32.399> foot<00:00:32.640> pedal<00:00:33.320> okay

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
split I'm gonna use my foot pedal okay

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.530 
split I'm gonna use my foot pedal okay
to<00:00:34.380> control<00:00:34.860> my<00:00:35.040> ground<00:00:35.340> speed<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.390> we're

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
to control my ground speed and we're

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.450 
to control my ground speed and we're
going<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.690> test<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.320> see<00:00:37.590> how<00:00:37.800> long<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.100> takes

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
going to test and see how long it takes

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.340 
going to test and see how long it takes
to<00:00:38.670> get<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.969> 15<00:00:39.390> miles<00:00:39.690> per<00:00:39.809> hour

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
to get to 15 miles per hour

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.830 
to get to 15 miles per hour
just<00:00:41.190> by<00:00:41.309> using<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.850> acceleration

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
just by using the acceleration

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.350 
just by using the acceleration
sensitivity<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.760> I'm<00:00:44.820> going<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.000> go<00:00:45.090> ahead<00:00:45.149> and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
sensitivity so I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.290 
sensitivity so I'm going to go ahead and
ask<00:00:45.480> for<00:00:45.660> forward

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
ask for forward

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.520 
ask for forward
okay<00:00:47.920> here<00:00:48.920> we<00:00:48.950> go<00:00:49.160> we're<00:00:49.310> gonna<00:00:49.370> go<00:00:49.490> to<00:00:49.670> 15<00:00:50.530> and

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
okay here we go we're gonna go to 15 and

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:00.850 
okay here we go we're gonna go to 15 and
go<00:00:52.120> 1<00:00:53.200> 2<00:00:54.310> 3<00:00:55.510> 4<00:00:56.590> 5<00:00:57.790> 6<00:00:58.900> right<00:00:59.900> there<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:00.710> we've<00:01:00.830> just

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
go 1 2 3 4 5 6 right there so we've just

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.010 
go 1 2 3 4 5 6 right there so we've just
hit<00:01:01.280> 15<00:01:01.820> mile-per-hour<00:01:02.060> so<00:01:02.630> I'm<00:01:02.720> gonna<00:01:02.810> come

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
hit 15 mile-per-hour so I'm gonna come

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.790 
hit 15 mile-per-hour so I'm gonna come
to<00:01:03.110> a<00:01:03.170> stop<00:01:04.239> okay

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
to a stop okay

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.990 
to a stop okay
now<00:01:06.800> what<00:01:07.010> I'm<00:01:07.100> going<00:01:07.220> to<00:01:07.280> do<00:01:07.430> is<00:01:07.550> set<00:01:07.729> it<00:01:07.760> for

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
now what I'm going to do is set it for

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.660 
now what I'm going to do is set it for
three<00:01:08.210> lights<00:01:08.650> see<00:01:09.650> how<00:01:09.710> responsive<00:01:10.130> it<00:01:10.460> is<00:01:10.490> to

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
three lights see how responsive it is to

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.550 
three lights see how responsive it is to
get<00:01:10.790> to<00:01:10.880> 15

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
get to 15

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:20.320 
get to 15
here<00:01:13.070> we<00:01:13.190> go<00:01:14.140> one<00:01:15.140> two<00:01:15.700> three<00:01:17.799> four<00:01:18.940> -<00:01:19.940> Marty

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
here we go one two three four - Marty

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.240 
here we go one two three four - Marty
there

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.180 

so<00:01:25.880> now<00:01:26.060> we<00:01:26.120> can<00:01:26.570> see<00:01:26.810> that<00:01:27.440> it<00:01:27.800> actually<00:01:27.980> takes

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
so now we can see that it actually takes

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.910 
so now we can see that it actually takes
longer<00:01:29.030> with<00:01:29.240> one<00:01:29.510> light<00:01:29.750> than<00:01:30.230> it<00:01:30.380> does<00:01:30.560> three

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
longer with one light than it does three

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.100 
longer with one light than it does three
lights<00:01:31.130> does<00:01:32.030> it<00:01:32.180> mean<00:01:32.330> I<00:01:32.360> will<00:01:32.690> not<00:01:32.840> achieve

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
lights does it mean I will not achieve

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.830 
lights does it mean I will not achieve
my<00:01:33.500> ground<00:01:33.800> speed<00:01:34.130> that<00:01:34.880> I<00:01:34.910> asked<00:01:35.300> for<00:01:35.450> in<00:01:35.660> the

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
my ground speed that I asked for in the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.400 
my ground speed that I asked for in the
in<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.410> display<00:01:36.860> on<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.430> a-pillar

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
in the display on the a-pillar

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.800 
in the display on the a-pillar
no<00:01:39.410> that's<00:01:39.680> not<00:01:39.920> true<00:01:40.520> I'll<00:01:41.060> get<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.570> ground

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
no that's not true I'll get the ground

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.630 
no that's not true I'll get the ground
speed<00:01:42.110> it<00:01:42.290> will<00:01:42.440> just<00:01:42.620> take<00:01:42.860> longer<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:43.490> get

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
speed it will just take longer to get

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.050 
speed it will just take longer to get
there<00:01:44.320> so<00:01:45.320> when<00:01:45.500> would<00:01:45.620> I<00:01:45.680> use<00:01:45.770> one<00:01:46.220> light<00:01:46.430> I'd

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
there so when would I use one light I'd

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.550 
there so when would I use one light I'd
probably<00:01:47.300> use<00:01:47.480> one<00:01:47.600> light<00:01:48.020> when<00:01:48.200> I'm<00:01:48.320> mowing

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
probably use one light when I'm mowing

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.470 
probably use one light when I'm mowing
because<00:01:48.890> I<00:01:49.010> want<00:01:49.190> smooth<00:01:49.520> transitions<00:01:50.240> or<00:01:50.390> if

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
because I want smooth transitions or if

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.200 
because I want smooth transitions or if
I'm<00:01:50.630> bailing<00:01:51.190> too<00:01:52.190> is<00:01:52.430> kind<00:01:52.640> of<00:01:52.730> somewhere<00:01:53.060> in

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
I'm bailing too is kind of somewhere in

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.050 
I'm bailing too is kind of somewhere in
between<00:01:53.330> and<00:01:54.340> three<00:01:55.340> is<00:01:55.460> good<00:01:55.640> for<00:01:55.850> loader

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
between and three is good for loader

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.100 
between and three is good for loader
work<00:01:56.270> because<00:01:56.450> I<00:01:56.570> want<00:01:56.720> to<00:01:56.810> be<00:01:56.900> able<00:01:56.990> to

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
work because I want to be able to

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.620 
work because I want to be able to
shuttle<00:01:57.500> quickly<00:01:57.890> back<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:58.340> forth<00:01:58.630> sometimes

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
shuttle quickly back and forth sometimes

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.480 
shuttle quickly back and forth sometimes
on<00:02:00.050> the<00:02:00.140> road<00:02:00.170> as<00:02:00.470> well<00:02:00.500> I<00:02:00.710> use<00:02:00.979> three<00:02:01.280> lights

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
on the road as well I use three lights

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.280 
on the road as well I use three lights
because<00:02:02.270> I<00:02:02.360> like<00:02:02.540> to<00:02:02.630> be<00:02:02.750> able<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.930> get<00:02:03.110> through

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
because I like to be able to get through

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.010 
because I like to be able to get through
intersections<00:02:03.950> quickly<00:02:04.479> but<00:02:05.479> it's<00:02:05.630> all<00:02:05.810> up<00:02:05.990> to

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
intersections quickly but it's all up to

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.060 
intersections quickly but it's all up to
you<00:02:06.350> it's<00:02:07.280> up<00:02:07.430> to<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.760> operator<00:02:08.240> preference

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
you it's up to the operator preference

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.740 
you it's up to the operator preference
