00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
thinking that it was just going to be

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.709 
thinking that it was just going to be
like<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> few<00:00:50.579> zaps<00:00:50.910> maybe<00:00:51.239> two<00:00:51.539> or<00:00:51.690> three

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
like a few zaps maybe two or three

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.869 
like a few zaps maybe two or three
treatments<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.500> boom<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.250> tattoos<00:00:53.699> were

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
treatments and boom the tattoos were

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.080 
treatments and boom the tattoos were
going<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.239> be<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> distant<00:00:54.780> memory<00:00:54.870> not<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.090> each

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
going to be a distant memory not so each

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.119 
going to be a distant memory not so each
session<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.989> has<00:00:58.260> gotten<00:00:58.500> or<00:00:58.800> they<00:00:58.920> have

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
session it has gotten or they have

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.459 
session it has gotten or they have
gotten<00:00:59.430> lighter<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.120> lighter<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.989> lighter

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
gotten lighter and lighter and lighter

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.229 
gotten lighter and lighter and lighter
but<00:01:01.590> they're<00:01:01.859> still<00:01:02.039> not<00:01:02.250> gone<00:01:02.520> they<00:01:02.969> are<00:01:03.000> gone

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239

but they're still not gone they are gone
to<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> point<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.260> me<00:01:04.439> not<00:01:04.650> really<00:01:04.860> noticing

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
to the point of me not really noticing

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.060 
to the point of me not really noticing
them<00:01:05.670> when<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.450> say<00:01:07.110> pass<00:01:07.350> myself<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
them when I say pass myself in the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.219 
them when I say pass myself in the
mirror<00:01:08.340> or<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.610> actually<00:01:09.060> look<00:01:09.540> there's

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
mirror or I actually look there's

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.170 
mirror or I actually look there's
for<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> most<00:01:10.740> part<00:01:10.890> gone<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:11.729> they're<00:01:11.880> still

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
for the most part gone but they're still

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.270 
for the most part gone but they're still
there<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> little<00:01:12.930> bit<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.770> recently

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
there a little bit and so I recently

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.399 
there a little bit and so I recently
bought<00:01:14.729> another<00:01:15.060> few<00:01:15.360> sessions<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.020> figure

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
bought another few sessions so I figure

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.530 
bought another few sessions so I figure
another<00:01:16.680> two<00:01:16.920> or<00:01:16.950> three<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.520> I'm<00:01:17.880> done<00:01:18.210> like

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
like I'm not buying anymore I figure

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.760

that<00:01:21.420> if<00:01:21.450> they're<00:01:21.689> not<00:01:21.810> going<00:01:22.049> by<00:01:22.259> then<00:01:22.470> then

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
that if they're not going by then then

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.820 
that if they're not going by then then
they're<00:01:23.159> going<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:23.939> stay<00:01:24.240> there<00:01:24.479> because

they're going to just stay there because

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.960 
they're going to just stay there because
there's<00:01:25.830> not<00:01:25.979> going<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.189> be<00:01:26.280> much<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.790> left
