 but do not cut this well here we're going to 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.230
 cut it well 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.230
 to let us open the key 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.360

 it would be the phone as I said it is 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.190
 good pink color let's read here that 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.930
 this comes pink comes with the 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.970
 4-inch display a plant 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.380
 four inches a rear camera of 5 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:27.350
 megapixels a mediatek processor of 11 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.960
 of hertz the dual core we just go 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.490
 take what had been the team 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.030
 let's see what is this that you can see 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.070
 here we go here to remove it as they can 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.200
 see here is a good team the 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.590
 true, it is very well designed 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.290
 let's leave it for the moment here we're going to 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.180
 see what else brings us in the box brings us 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:52.820
 what would be the microusb cable 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:55.190
 a usb let's see what else brings us what 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.210
 that will be 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:02.890
 the hearing aids I think if the hearing aids 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.890
 as you can see here we are going to take them out 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.090
 as you can see are the headphones as 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.819
 also its production to hear well 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.670
 pretty good we're also going to leave them 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.920
 here brings us what would be the 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.440
 battery and the charger to the current 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.340
 to take out the battery as you can see 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.319
 here we are going to leave the box also and for 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.260
 last one brings us what had been the 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:29.200
 adapter to the connecting current 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.180
 here the usb cable we are going to be also 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.920
 leave it on this side and then simply 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.970
 finally brings us what was coming 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.239
 the typical brochures I'm sorry and for the 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.000
 queue all the typical zte brochures 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.860
 of guarantee of all that good because this 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.200
 we are going to leave here here we go to what 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.480
 would be the phone to put the 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.700
 battery as you can see good that is 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.380
 pink color is therefore a plastic 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.989
 pretty well built as a 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.330
 pretty good plastic as you can see 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.940
 well up here being what 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.380
 is there 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:07.410
 already with 5 millimeters 3.5 the usb input 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.900
 micro usb on this side because it brings what 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.000
 come being the volume buttons and 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.680
 on the right side the lock button 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.790
 work then nothing else you will find 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.340
 with the microphone that would be for 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.070
 Well to call and a small opening 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.430
 to uncover what we are going to be is 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.430
 cover it 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.120
 what a hard job it is to uncover what is 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.120
 a little bit hard 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.540
 Well, before uncovering, we're going to 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.540
 take away what will be the 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.540
 decal 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.810
 as you can see there we are going to put this 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.330
 side and now we are going to uncover what 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.250
 would be the phone to see if I already 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.250
 I do not have a hard time uncovering what 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.080
 do not go that's fine 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.660
 and well, I came back here after 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.430
 shoot me to open it well let's see 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.800
 what is a plastic shell like I said 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.090
 well built here tells us the brand 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.350

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.450
 what will be the battery 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.880
 let's open this 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.570
 in such a way to see I think you can 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.570
 open here 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.830
 we are not going to open it 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.199
 although here we are going to put the battery 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.210
 I hope there's a little charge for you 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.900
 to be able to catch it 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.660
 the battery if I continue like this let's put it on 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.750
 and as they see good here is for the chip 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.819
 of what any company saying 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.069

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:54.490

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.759
 let's put the lid 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.780
 As you can see there, there are several insurance 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.009
 the truth why I could not open it there 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.960

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:15.920

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.040
 for the logo of zte 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.440

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.920
