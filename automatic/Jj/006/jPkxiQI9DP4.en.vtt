00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.560
 hello guitarists and future guitarists 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.780
 welcome to the sixth video of the course 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.090
 basic for beginners today I bring you 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.730
 a continuation of the major chords 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.460
 as you will see in the previous video they were 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.309
 my minor the minor and re minor as well 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.670
 today I bring you the minor sun and the minor 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:39.210
 so let's go to it 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.210
 ah 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.120
 we start with the minor sun for the sun 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.300
 lower we have to place the index finger 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.040
 through the whole third fret in 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.050
 other videos from normal tutorials 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.870
 songs many times this type come out 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.870
 of chords but good I keep explaining 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.609
 through the entire third fret and 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.039
 then the ring finger is placed in the 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:14.719
 fifth fifth fret and finger 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.569
 little finger on the fourth fifth string 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:18.870
 fret I recommend that with your finger 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:22.830
 heart 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:25.190
 make more strength by helping the finger 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.190
 index 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.140
 so that there is a clean sound and no no 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.410
 You have to try so hard that it says 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.670
 if being doing so in tension does not 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.670
 relax helping us with him 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.790
 that would be the minor sun worth guitarists 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.369
 come now with the C minor for the do 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.440
 minor we put the index finger through 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.130
 of all the third fret except in the 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.130
 sixth string 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.860
 simple and place the ring finger on 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.140
 the fourth fifth fret string and the finger 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.229
 little finger on the third fifth string 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.479
 fret and also in this if we add the 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.960
 middle finger on the second fourth string 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.960
 fret 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.989
 As you can see they are very simple chords 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.120
 only if you still do not have 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.800
 worked on the subject making capo is with 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.750
 the fingers will cost you a little more 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.130
 of practice but you'll see as if 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.970
 you get it see you in the next 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.970
