or<00:00:35.780> something<00:00:36.260> that<00:00:36.770> will<00:00:36.830> work<00:00:36.980> well<00:00:37.220> with

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
or something that will work well with

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.220 
or something that will work well with
the<00:00:37.520> channels<00:00:37.910> since<00:00:38.780> we're<00:00:38.930> going<00:00:39.050> to<00:00:39.110> be

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
the channels since we're going to be

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.930 
the channels since we're going to be
working<00:00:39.410> on<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:39.710> window<00:00:39.949> in<00:00:40.040> our<00:00:40.129> case<00:00:40.400> I'm

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
working on the window in our case I'm

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.180 
working on the window in our case I'm
also<00:00:41.180> going<00:00:41.449> to<00:00:41.510> remove<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:41.989> switch<00:00:42.230> from

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
also going to remove the switch from

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.550 
also going to remove the switch from
here<00:00:43.540> just<00:00:44.540> so<00:00:44.690> that<00:00:44.840> I<00:00:44.870> can<00:00:45.050> work<00:00:45.320> on<00:00:45.500> it

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
here just so that I can work on it

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.950 
here just so that I can work on it
outside<00:00:45.770> so<00:00:46.040> this<00:00:46.460> should<00:00:46.820> slide<00:00:47.300> right<00:00:47.329> out

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
outside so this should slide right out

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.110 
outside so this should slide right out
so<00:00:48.560> now<00:00:48.680> we'll<00:00:49.010> go<00:00:49.160> ahead<00:00:49.250> and<00:00:49.399> do<00:00:49.640> is<00:00:49.790> place

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
so now we'll go ahead and do is place

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.920 
so now we'll go ahead and do is place
this<00:00:50.360> on<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:51.710> cable<00:00:52.640> making<00:00:53.149> sure<00:00:53.480> you<00:00:53.750> have

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
this on the cable making sure you have

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.959 
this on the cable making sure you have
the<00:00:54.140> clamp<00:00:54.410> in<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:54.649> right<00:00:54.800> direction<00:00:54.980> to

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
the clamp in the right direction to

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.190 
the clamp in the right direction to
start<00:00:56.239> we're<00:00:56.480> going<00:00:56.600> to<00:00:56.660> have<00:00:56.780> to<00:00:56.899> roll<00:00:57.050> the

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
start we're going to have to roll the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.410 
start we're going to have to roll the
window<00:00:57.500> up<00:00:57.530> if<00:00:58.280> your<00:00:58.489> window<00:00:58.790> won't<00:00:58.940> roll<00:00:59.180> down

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
window up if your window won't roll down

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.959 
window up if your window won't roll down
you<00:01:00.050> may<00:01:00.200> have<00:01:00.350> a<00:01:00.380> problem<00:01:00.620> so<00:01:01.520> the<00:01:01.760> first

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
you may have a problem so the first

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.160 
you may have a problem so the first
thing<00:01:02.149> what<00:01:02.300> we're<00:01:02.420> going<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:02.660> want<00:01:02.780> we're

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
thing what we're going to want we're

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.380 
thing what we're going to want we're
going<00:01:03.410> to<00:01:03.530> want<00:01:03.710> to<00:01:03.829> check<00:01:04.040> is<00:01:04.250> to<00:01:04.309> make<00:01:05.180> sure

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
going to want to check is to make sure

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.810 
going to want to check is to make sure
that<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:06.020> channels<00:01:06.619> which<00:01:06.950> are<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.640> edges

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
that the channels which are the edges

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.730 
that the channels which are the edges
where<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.420> window<00:01:08.810> slides<00:01:09.170> through<00:01:09.530> are

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
where the window slides through are

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.340 
where the window slides through are
clean<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:10.910> clear<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:11.810> that<00:01:11.840> nothing<00:01:12.289> is

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
clean and clear so that nothing is

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.719 
clean and clear so that nothing is
jamming<00:01:12.740> it<00:01:12.860> so<00:01:12.979> let's<00:01:13.130> go<00:01:13.220> ahead<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:13.580> check

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
jamming it so let's go ahead and check

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.340 
jamming it so let's go ahead and check
that<00:01:13.759> now<00:01:14.060> you<00:01:14.509> should<00:01:14.690> be<00:01:14.720> able<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:14.990> see<00:01:15.170> it

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
that now you should be able to see it

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.859 
that now you should be able to see it
comes<00:01:15.590> up<00:01:15.830> like<00:01:16.280> this<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:16.880> right<00:01:17.570> here<00:01:17.780> it

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
comes up like this and right here it

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.280 
comes up like this and right here it
starts<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:18.380> fall<00:01:18.830> out<00:01:19.040> so<00:01:19.390> it's<00:01:20.390> clearly<00:01:20.750> it's

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
starts to fall out so it's clearly it's

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.080 
starts to fall out so it's clearly it's
clear<00:01:21.590> that<00:01:21.619> it's<00:01:22.250> falling<00:01:22.549> out<00:01:22.729> of<00:01:22.790> alignment

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
clear that it's falling out of alignment

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.700 
clear that it's falling out of alignment
we're<00:01:23.630> going<00:01:23.750> to<00:01:23.810> roll<00:01:23.930> it<00:01:24.020> all<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.229> way<00:01:24.500> down

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
we're going to roll it all the way down

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.440 
we're going to roll it all the way down
and<00:01:24.920> then<00:01:25.610> we're<00:01:25.760> going<00:01:25.850> to<00:01:25.940> roll<00:01:26.090> it<00:01:26.210> all<00:01:26.330> the

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
and then we're going to roll it all the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.090 
and then we're going to roll it all the
way<00:01:26.570> up<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:27.229> we're<00:01:27.409> going<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.560> try<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.830> line<00:01:28.070> it

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
way up and we're going to try to line it

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.760 
way up and we're going to try to line it
with<00:01:28.310> our<00:01:28.460> hands<00:01:28.670> first<00:01:28.939> I'm<00:01:29.869> gonna<00:01:30.110> try<00:01:30.710> and

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
with our hands first I'm gonna try and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.500 
with our hands first I'm gonna try and
work<00:01:31.159> it<00:01:31.340> down<00:01:31.549> because<00:01:31.970> it<00:01:32.090> kind<00:01:32.330> of<00:01:32.390> gets

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
work it down because it kind of gets

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.330 
work it down because it kind of gets
stuck<00:01:34.510> okay<00:01:35.510> as<00:01:36.320> its<00:01:36.619> rolling<00:01:36.799> up<00:01:37.010> I'm<00:01:37.220> going

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
stuck okay as its rolling up I'm going

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.280 
stuck okay as its rolling up I'm going
to<00:01:37.400> be<00:01:37.520> pulling<00:01:37.790> it<00:01:37.970> that<00:01:38.240> way<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:38.990> that<00:01:39.140> it

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
to be pulling it that way so that it

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.649 
to be pulling it that way so that it
rolls<00:01:39.500> up<00:01:39.710> against<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.430> seam<00:01:40.729> right<00:01:41.330> here<00:01:41.540> the

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
rolls up against the seam right here the

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.109 
rolls up against the seam right here the
channel<00:01:42.020> is<00:01:42.140> what<00:01:42.290> they<00:01:42.409> call<00:01:42.590> them<00:01:42.909> on<00:01:43.909> both

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
channel is what they call them on both

00:01:44.119 --> 00:02:00.040 
channel is what they call them on both
ends

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.300 

so<00:02:01.050> right<00:02:01.229> there<00:02:01.440> it's<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.650> line<00:02:01.830> but<00:02:02.040> it's<00:02:02.159> not

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
so right there it's in line but it's not

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.810 
so right there it's in line but it's not
locked

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
locked

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.640 
locked
we're<00:02:03.479> not<00:02:03.600> going<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.840> take<00:02:04.020> any<00:02:04.200> bolts<00:02:04.530> off

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
we're not going to take any bolts off

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.710 
we're not going to take any bolts off
but<00:02:04.950> we<00:02:05.040> are<00:02:05.159> going<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.550> loosen<00:02:05.729> them<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:06.540> that

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
but we are going to loosen them for that

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.699 
but we are going to loosen them for that
we<00:02:06.930> have<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.380> 10<00:02:07.830> millimeter<00:02:08.280> socket<00:02:09.709> we're

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
we have a 10 millimeter socket we're

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:17.949 
we have a 10 millimeter socket we're
going<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.100> start<00:02:11.489> by<00:02:11.670> loosening<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.270> bolts

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.030 

that's<00:02:18.959> pretty<00:02:19.140> obvious<00:02:19.319> but<00:02:19.680> my<00:02:19.830> doors

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
that's pretty obvious but my doors

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.410 
that's pretty obvious but my doors
missing<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.459> bolt<00:02:21.980> down<00:02:22.980> here<00:02:25.849> but<00:02:26.849> it's<00:02:27.330> all

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
missing a bolt down here but it's all

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.530 
missing a bolt down here but it's all
right<00:02:27.599> I<00:02:27.630> guess<00:02:28.550> let's<00:02:29.550> find<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> way<00:02:29.849> got<00:02:30.239> out

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
right I guess let's find a way got out

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.000 
right I guess let's find a way got out
of<00:02:30.690> alignment<00:02:31.050> in<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.319> first<00:02:31.560> place

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
of alignment in the first place

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.229 
of alignment in the first place
but<00:02:32.190> oh<00:02:32.400> well<00:02:33.120> it's<00:02:33.480> an<00:02:33.569> old<00:02:33.720> car<00:02:33.930> right<00:02:38.239> now

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
but oh well it's an old car right now

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.479 
but oh well it's an old car right now
remember<00:02:39.480> we're<00:02:39.750> loosening<00:02:40.170> we're<00:02:40.470> not<00:02:40.620> we're

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
remember we're loosening we're not we're

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.750 
remember we're loosening we're not we're
not<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.810> taking<00:02:42.810> any<00:02:43.140> bolts<00:02:43.500> out<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:44.519> clip

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
come down though right there they should

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.840 
come down though right there they should
be<00:02:51.930> loose<00:02:52.140> out<00:02:52.920> we're<00:02:53.190> going<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.430> roll<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.640> up

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
be loose out we're going to roll it up

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.309 
be loose out we're going to roll it up
to<00:02:54.120> make<00:02:54.239> sure<00:02:54.269> it's<00:02:54.540> rolled<00:02:54.720> up<00:02:54.840> all<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.110> way

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
to make sure it's rolled up all the way

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.670 
to make sure it's rolled up all the way
and<00:02:55.500> push<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.700> as<00:02:56.940> hard<00:02:57.000> as<00:02:57.299> you<00:02:57.360> can<00:02:57.630> out<00:02:57.870> that

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
and push it as hard as you can out that

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.120 
and push it as hard as you can out that
way

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
way

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.120 
way
you<00:02:59.640> should<00:02:59.819> have<00:02:59.940> felt<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.299> slide<00:03:00.660> if<00:03:01.040> it<00:03:02.040> was

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
you should have felt it slide if it was

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.890 
you should have felt it slide if it was
out<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.340> alignment<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.480> should<00:03:03.660> be<00:03:03.780> all

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
out of alignment and it should be all

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.539 
out of alignment and it should be all
the<00:03:03.930> way<00:03:04.049> up<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:04.290> again<00:03:04.680> make<00:03:05.010> sure<00:03:05.040> it's<00:03:05.220> up

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
the way up so again make sure it's up

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.270 
the way up so again make sure it's up
and<00:03:05.840> push<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:07.380> way<00:03:07.590> if<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:07.860> were<00:03:07.980> doing<00:03:08.100> the

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
and push that way if you were doing the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.530 
and push that way if you were doing the
back<00:03:08.459> window<00:03:08.819> it<00:03:09.030> would<00:03:09.120> be<00:03:09.269> in<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.420> other

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
back window it would be in the other

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.840 
back window it would be in the other
direction<00:03:10.040> but<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.130> has<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.400> be<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.670> one

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
direction but it has to be to the one

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.250 
direction but it has to be to the one
that's<00:03:12.060> flat<00:03:12.330> now<00:03:12.540> at<00:03:12.720> this<00:03:12.870> point<00:03:13.080> we're

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
that's flat now at this point we're

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.850 
that's flat now at this point we're
going<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.470> tighten<00:03:13.680> all<00:03:14.310> six<00:03:15.060> bolts<00:03:15.709> that<00:03:16.709> we

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
going to tighten all six bolts that we

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.550 
going to tighten all six bolts that we
had<00:03:16.980> loosened<00:03:17.340> earlier<00:03:17.989> again<00:03:18.989> making<00:03:19.350> sure

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
had loosened earlier again making sure

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.140 
had loosened earlier again making sure
that<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.890> window<00:03:20.190> has<00:03:20.370> already<00:03:20.700> pushed<00:03:20.910> all

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
that the window has already pushed all

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:29.840 
that the window has already pushed all
the<00:03:21.180> way<00:03:21.299> that<00:03:21.540> way

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.860

now<00:03:32.410> we've<00:03:32.739> got<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.069> window<00:03:33.910> lined<00:03:34.150> up<00:03:34.360> in<00:03:34.569> the

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
now we've got the window lined up in the

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.510 
now we've got the window lined up in the
back<00:03:35.230> direction<00:03:35.770> we<00:03:35.890> got<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.130> line<00:03:36.250> them<00:03:36.400> up

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
back direction we got to line them up

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.059 
back direction we got to line them up
with<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:37.150> front<00:03:37.420> Channel<00:03:37.810> now<00:03:37.930> is<00:03:38.800> we're

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.350 
with the front Channel now is we're
going<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.250> start<00:03:39.430> by<00:03:39.520> loosening<00:03:39.700> this<00:03:40.090> bolt

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
going to start by loosening this bolt

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.839 
going to start by loosening this bolt
way<00:03:40.569> in<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:40.780> corner<00:03:41.370> let's<00:03:42.370> go<00:03:42.520> ahead<00:03:42.640> and

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
way in the corner let's go ahead and

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.570 
way in the corner let's go ahead and
loosen<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.239> now<00:03:46.739> we'll<00:03:47.739> go<00:03:47.890> ahead<00:03:48.040> and<00:03:48.310> start

loosen it now we'll go ahead and start
rolling<00:03:48.940> down<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.209> window<00:03:49.510> we're<00:03:50.019> going<00:03:50.170> to

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
rolling down the window we're going to

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.600 
rolling down the window we're going to
roll<00:03:50.380> it<00:03:50.530> down<00:03:50.680> about<00:03:51.130> 3/4<00:03:51.940> of<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.090> way

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
roll it down about 3/4 of the way

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.250 
roll it down about 3/4 of the way
making<00:03:54.610> sure<00:03:54.640> that<00:03:55.150> we've<00:03:55.599> already<00:03:55.810> tighten

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
making sure that we've already tighten

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.960 
making sure that we've already tighten
all<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:56.410> bolts<00:03:56.590> except<00:03:57.310> this<00:03:57.489> one<00:03:57.670> this<00:03:57.790> one

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
all the bolts except this one this one

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.479 
all the bolts except this one this one
still<00:03:58.209> has<00:03:58.330> to<00:03:58.480> be<00:03:58.510> loose

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.759 

once<00:04:04.489> it's<00:04:04.670> there<00:04:04.840> we'll<00:04:05.840> put<00:04:06.049> a<00:04:06.230> light<00:04:06.530> amount

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
once it's there we'll put a light amount

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:14.080 
once it's there we'll put a light amount
of<00:04:06.890> pressure<00:04:07.099> on<00:04:07.220> it<00:04:07.489> and<00:04:12.159> that's<00:04:13.159> it<00:04:13.370> your

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
of pressure on it and that's it your

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.360 
of pressure on it and that's it your
window<00:04:14.390> should<00:04:14.569> now<00:04:14.689> roll<00:04:14.900> up<00:04:15.079> and<00:04:15.230> down

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
window should now roll up and down

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.969 
window should now roll up and down
smoother<00:04:16.959> at<00:04:17.959> this<00:04:18.199> point<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.590> window<00:04:18.709> is

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
smoother at this point the window is

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.729 
smoother at this point the window is
aligned<00:04:19.310> now<00:04:19.609> but<00:04:20.030> we<00:04:20.780> also<00:04:21.229> need<00:04:21.530> to<00:04:21.560> put

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
aligned now but we also need to put

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.290 
aligned now but we also need to put
grease<00:04:22.010> I<00:04:22.250> didn't<00:04:22.580> show<00:04:22.699> it<00:04:22.820> in<00:04:22.910> the<00:04:23.000> video<00:04:23.270> but

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
grease I didn't show it in the video but

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.830 
grease I didn't show it in the video but
you<00:04:23.870> should<00:04:24.320> put<00:04:24.919> grease<00:04:25.190> on<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.820> rails<00:04:26.180> all

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
you should put grease on the rails all

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.290 
you should put grease on the rails all
around<00:04:27.410> or<00:04:27.650> if<00:04:28.310> you<00:04:28.370> don't<00:04:28.550> have<00:04:28.699> grease<00:04:28.940> put

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
around or if you don't have grease put

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.930 
around or if you don't have grease put
