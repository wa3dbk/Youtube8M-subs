00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.140
 well-known packaging from egger to 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:54.329

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:56.010
 So very quiet actually make 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.190
 Do you have to worry about it now? 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.559
 still a small plastic 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.579
 Of course I have you for a long time 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.410
 before I try each video 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.720
 because then I can only tell 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.980

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.960
 Main course there we come straight to us

 look again in the box what 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.960
 otherwise the packaging materials 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:30.119

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.130

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.689
 on the terrain a bluetooth speaker 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.399
 that's not exactly over 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.869
 make bluetooth but can do it too 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.060
 Do it directly over the cable 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:44.430
 This cable can be charged to the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.450
 plug the bluetooth sig has all 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.219
 normally over the computer or over one 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.799
 possible adapter piece what in the 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.579
 outlet then what about usb 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.490
 the USB cable is connected 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:02.100
 spectacular a normal micro usb 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.439
 Connection and everyone at home everyone 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.789
 That's how carola termes can be used 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.920
 also the device loaded 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.920
 still 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.660
 away with it 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.330
 Favre is reading a bit 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.860
 once your money 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:34.840
 the whole explanation in different ones 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:36.520
 languages ​​and versions is but on 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.650
 dearest self-explanatory only once again 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.730
 just to get on her in short 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.320
 bring form if you where right 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.970
 can apply if you have problems with 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.990
 Products have always opened you 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.660
 Relatively fast for remedy 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.890
 Otherwise there are big bags for us 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.540
 you can from the mobile batteries 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.670
 maybe there you can do the thing then 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.580
 Do it clean and take it with you 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.130
 the beautiful thing and extra rubber now 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.040
 but come to the product itself so that 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.920
 Ralph Spiegler order such a rubber 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.540
 border is there for you that the 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.370
 then he hears something 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.370
 better than if you so through the 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.260
 area and he does not stick on it 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.900
 but it goes without saying, of course 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.480
 if you put it in the grass or something 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.790
 of course start with the page so 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.020
 here's the oggs in that's that 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.330
 I had just brought there could 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.770
 connect the cable and yours 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.310
 respective player then 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:34.750
 here is on the boot board power 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:37.180
 the name and the on and off to 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.090
 further skiclub above we have once 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.870
 play quieter and with little ones 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.000
 LED indicates whether the money is connected 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.239
 is only bluetooth and if that is straight 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.550
 what else is there doing here 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:04:00.910
 make the fans behind speakers and 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:04.239
 We gets the whole maria belongs title 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.100
 Now everything is given and this one 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.310
 Small tips means he is connected with 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.900
 my mobile here is a great s2 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.200
 already connected with easy 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.510
 bluetooth dialed 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.400
 looking for a product to choose what you want 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.440
 already in it as I am already with it 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.870
 connected 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.980
 yes now I could play here what 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.919
 I would like 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.110
 I would like to briefly show that 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.780
 I want to exclude the flight mode I 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:34.310
 Always one for videos and then 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:39.710
 I also show something going on with it again 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:41.120
 Let's do a little video of you 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.460
 me from another channel 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.470
 Nobody can talk to us about the climate 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:50.350
 finger knock 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.350
 the piece of music is gema free 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.310
 yes maybe and I hope you can 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.310
 for one how incredibly good the 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.310
 Quality is the loud and the clear that 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.229
 all over comes a really nice one 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.509
 thing that part I have then mega 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.940
 often had with us when we see one 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.919
 swimming a bit or really cool 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.160
 thing in any case 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:37.300
 and yes you can do it all if 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.620
 is joined her your cell phone 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.090
 everything actually through the 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.330
 loudspeaker comes out here means 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.330
 if your music opens at a youtube 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.820
 video or because that will be already 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.199
 what else is there to say 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.360
 heights and depths are very nice 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:55.990
 little bit I leave that is all 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.360
 but needle for music in her age and 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.090
 ultimately also to 10 21 yes too 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.800
 wanted a bit like that 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:05.349
 And yet the heights can be quite nice 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.380
 through and you have a relatively clear 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:09.370
 picture for such an incredibly small 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:13.169
 I always speak in my hand 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:16.150
 he's really nice when he's small 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.800
 the weight of the hat is vital 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.180
 So you can have a bit 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.060
 just a bit scared about that 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.039
 weight but that's absolutely okay 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:28.680
 I try now I sometimes just to 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:32.020
 show how it is with the 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.909
 different positions for 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.860
 stand whether man if I now times the 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:38.940
 there are so if that is us 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.940
 sound becomes a bit fun 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:53.010
 unfortunately I can not now so I have 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:57.210
 a stable moritz everything and no that 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:59.340
 but not if you are to or in front of you 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.560
 So it is definitely so 90s really nice 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:05.310
 yes, that would be it too 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.780
