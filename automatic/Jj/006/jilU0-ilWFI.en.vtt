00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.530
 I think so 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.420
 obviously hard of the season that has 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.130
 been very good but they are the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.460
 games to go loosening and arriving 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.130
 at the top to start the tournament as 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.770
 you have felt good will have to be done 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.779
 a good group everyone is aware of 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.990
 what we are playing we know that 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.290
 it's tournament past it was difficult but 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.329
 the idea of ​​this tournament this year is 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.430
 put people in the first places 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.040
 you have a team that likes to be 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.110
 offensive he likes to attack then little to 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.640
 little we are grabbing the idea and shaping 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.070
 the truth inside the field of play 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.710
 that I felt good because we still 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.829
 it takes 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.550
 adapt to the speed that we are a 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.260
 bit hard still but still missing 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.140
 20-25 days then we are we are going to 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.969
 time to reach the level well the 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.339
 true that the first game obviously 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.740
 very nice because this first 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.659
 party with the group we did and good 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.330
 we got a nice result but this more 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.090
 that nothing serves to go a softening 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.310
 does the preseason and good to be 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:22.220
 quiet that has been working very 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:26.149
 well, the truth is that I like it a lot 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.340
 very cute is played a lot back there 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:31.190
 a lot of movement then you have many 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.610
 pass options and it 's the truth that is 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.470
 very cute for the starter there's really no 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.869
 to keep working step by step 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.119
 we know that it is for every party that 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.890
 they come are complicated and good and you have to 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.990
 be prepared for each game that is 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.740
 comes and continue so it's coming 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.740
 working very well 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.330
 the truth that every day that goes by I go 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.920
 grabbing rhythm one feels very good 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.980
 today the second time cost a little 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.190
 in the water but it's normal one comes 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.410
 working physically well and very hard 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.840
 so not too soon one is grabbing 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.060
 rhythm and this what is giving you everything 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.220
 giving friendly match rhythm 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.930
 now you know very well that it is 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.480
 important not out pace since 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.630
 already with the ball already in a situation more 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.120
 real then this suits us well 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.850
 obviously it takes more importance 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.430
 always this way it must be this and I felt 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.590
 very good with the team 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.850
 we can grasp that style not that the 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.850
 prof and happy 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.400
 the truth that grateful for the 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.580
 I am very happy 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.459
 really with many illusions I know of the 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.320
 responsibility that is coming here but 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.000
 obviously I come with all the desire with 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.190
 all attitude and especially the 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.580
 mentality of contributing without a doubt without 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.250
 doubt because it is special to the hobby is 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.390
 the most important thing that motivates us 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.220
 give that extra 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.080
