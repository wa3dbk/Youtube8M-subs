 reckless target 50% chance of 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.210
 failure and this is not a 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.860
 acceptable to reach training 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.250
 even the best players of the moment 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.650
 they make mistakes and they risk a lot 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.250

 Cristiano Ronaldo 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.110
