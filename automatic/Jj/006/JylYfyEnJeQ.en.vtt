you how to do a double front flip on a

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.550 
you how to do a double front flip on a
trampoline<00:00:06.109> there's<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.170> lot<00:00:07.290> of<00:00:07.410> tutorials

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
do a front flip of course so and you're

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.299 
do a front flip of course so and you're
going<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.830> need<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.070> tuft<00:00:32.510> um<00:00:33.570> second<00:00:34.380> off<00:00:34.530> try

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
going to need a tuft um second off try

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.049 
going to need a tuft um second off try
to<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:36.140> front<00:00:37.140> flips<00:00:37.469> but<00:00:37.829> in<00:00:38.040> little<00:00:38.550> bounces

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
to do front flips but in little bounces

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.180 
to do front flips but in little bounces
so<00:00:39.270> like<00:00:39.420> I'm<00:00:40.110> going<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.290> understand<00:00:40.800> here<00:00:42.110> so

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
which you can already do a couple if

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.479 
which you can already do a couple if
you're<00:01:01.170> looking<00:01:01.410> at<00:01:01.559> double<00:01:01.890> front<00:01:02.430> flip

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
you're looking at double front flip

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.609 
you're looking at double front flip
tutorial<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:04.159> next<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:06.020> want<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.080> guys<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.290> try

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
tutorial so next I want you guys to try

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.649 
tutorial so next I want you guys to try
to<00:01:07.710> jump<00:01:08.640> up<00:01:08.850> you're<00:01:09.060> going<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> front

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
to jump up you're going to do a front

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.450 
to jump up you're going to do a front
flip<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.049> then<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.260> your<00:01:10.380> back<00:01:10.619> then<00:01:11.340> you're

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
flip and then on your back then you're

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.429 
flip and then on your back then you're
going<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.610> do<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.760> front<00:01:12.030> flip<00:01:12.060> after<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:13.290> on

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
going to do a front flip after going on

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.310 
going to do a front flip after going on
your<00:01:13.560> back<00:01:13.710> off<00:01:14.070> your<00:01:14.549> back<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.200> what

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
your back off your back so this is what

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.350 
your back off your back so this is what
it's<00:01:16.439> going<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.619> look<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:20.000> now<00:01:21.000> I'll<00:01:21.150> show

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
it's going to look like now I'll show

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.719 
it's going to look like now I'll show
you<00:01:21.390> again<00:01:21.799> I'll<00:01:22.799> try<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> win<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.490> time

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
you again I'll try to win it this time

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.899 
you again I'll try to win it this time
Oh<00:01:23.759> No

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.560 

so<00:01:28.909> better<00:01:29.270> than<00:01:29.450> landed<00:01:29.780> that<00:01:29.900> but<00:01:30.790> you<00:01:31.790> do

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
so better than landed that but you do

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:41.340 
so better than landed that but you do
that<00:01:32.720> you'll<00:01:33.430> that's<00:01:34.430> like<00:01:34.670> over<00:01:34.970> rotating

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.920 

sits<00:01:42.350> out<00:01:42.500> of<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.680> way<00:01:42.800> all<00:01:43.190> right<00:01:43.220> now<00:01:43.840> try<00:01:44.840> to

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
sits out of the way all right now try to

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.630 
sits out of the way all right now try to
do<00:01:45.080> it<00:01:45.170> off<00:01:45.290> your<00:01:45.440> back<00:01:45.650> it's<00:01:46.040> just<00:01:46.340> is<00:01:46.430> pretty

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
do it off your back it's just is pretty

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.249 
do it off your back it's just is pretty
much<00:01:46.790> like<00:01:46.970> doing<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.300> second<00:01:47.660> front<00:01:47.840> flip<00:01:48.080> on

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
much like doing the second front flip on

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.560 
much like doing the second front flip on
your<00:01:48.470> double<00:01:48.680> front<00:01:48.890> flip<00:01:48.950> so<00:01:49.340> this<00:01:50.270> will<00:01:50.450> get

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
your double front flip so this will get

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.469 
your double front flip so this will get
you<00:01:51.340> this<00:01:52.340> will<00:01:52.550> be<00:01:52.580> warmed<00:01:53.030> up<00:01:53.150> for<00:01:53.360> like

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
you this will be warmed up for like

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.120 
you this will be warmed up for like
doing<00:01:53.720> it<00:01:53.810> on<00:01:53.930> purpose<00:01:54.110> it's<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:54.590> same<00:01:54.830> thing

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
doing it on purpose it's the same thing

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.399 
doing it on purpose it's the same thing
but<00:01:55.580> this<00:01:56.330> is<00:01:56.390> probably<00:01:56.600> actually<00:01:57.050> harder

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
but this is probably actually harder

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.200 
but this is probably actually harder
than<00:01:57.440> a<00:01:57.619> double<00:01:57.979> front<00:01:58.159> flip<00:01:58.220> jump<00:01:58.550> here<00:01:59.180> jump

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
than a double front flip jump here jump

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.370 
than a double front flip jump here jump
back<00:01:59.570> and<00:02:00.080> on<00:02:00.259> your<00:02:00.380> back

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
back and on your back

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.279 
back and on your back
I<00:02:03.700> took<00:02:04.700> under<00:02:05.180> my<00:02:05.300> legs<00:02:05.509> when<00:02:05.690> I<00:02:05.720> do<00:02:05.780> that<00:02:06.080> but

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
I took under my legs when I do that but

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.380 
I took under my legs when I do that but
I<00:02:06.320> mean<00:02:06.530> you'll<00:02:06.710> have<00:02:06.920> two<00:02:07.160> and<00:02:07.430> a<00:02:07.610> double

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
I mean you'll have two and a double

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.430 
I mean you'll have two and a double
front<00:02:08.570> flip<00:02:08.630> you're<00:02:08.899> not<00:02:09.019> gonna<00:02:09.140> be<00:02:09.259> talking

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
front flip you're not gonna be talking

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.990

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.890 
going here so I know how fast I spin
he'll<00:04:01.319> jump<00:04:01.530> how<00:04:01.950> high<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.250> jump<00:04:02.849> is<00:04:03.359> where<00:04:03.690> it's

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
he'll jump how high I jump is where it's

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.270 
he'll jump how high I jump is where it's
going<00:04:04.019> to<00:04:04.079> put<00:04:04.140> me<00:04:04.319> in<00:04:04.620> my<00:04:04.739> double<00:04:05.010> front<00:04:05.190> flip

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
going to put me in my double front flip

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.099 
going to put me in my double front flip
at<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:05.940> end<00:04:06.209> of<00:04:06.299> it<00:04:06.390> so<00:04:07.069> now<00:04:08.540> I'm<00:04:09.540> going<00:04:09.690> to<00:04:09.780> get

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
at the end of it so now I'm going to get

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.509 
at the end of it so now I'm going to get
high<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:10.560> I'm<00:04:10.709> going<00:04:10.950> to<00:04:10.980> try<00:04:11.129> to<00:04:11.190> land<00:04:11.370> I

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
high and I'm going to try to land I

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:12.949 
high and I'm going to try to land I
don't<00:04:11.700> circle<00:04:12.030> if<00:04:12.090> I<00:04:12.180> than<00:04:12.359> anyone<00:04:12.690> in<00:04:12.780> a<00:04:12.810> while

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
don't circle if I than anyone in a while

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:26.060 
don't circle if I than anyone in a while
so<00:04:23.900> that's<00:04:24.900> a<00:04:25.020> landing<00:04:25.229> double<00:04:25.620> front<00:04:25.800> flips

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
so that's a landing double front flips

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.659 
so that's a landing double front flips
just<00:04:26.370> land<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.539> you<00:04:28.440> just<00:04:28.590> gotta<00:04:28.860> do<00:04:29.520> your

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
just land it you just gotta do your

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.879 
just land it you just gotta do your
double<00:04:29.820> front<00:04:30.150> flip<00:04:30.210> like<00:04:30.539> this<00:04:30.810> like<00:04:33.889> but

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
double front flip like this like but

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.460 
double front flip like this like but
you're<00:04:35.039> gonna<00:04:35.160> keep<00:04:35.789> going<00:04:36.050> not<00:04:37.050> to<00:04:37.229> the<00:04:37.320> point

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
you're gonna keep going not to the point

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.790 
you're gonna keep going not to the point
that<00:04:37.620> you<00:04:37.710> go<00:04:37.860> over<00:04:38.270> but<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.419> where<00:04:39.599> you<00:04:40.590> know

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
that you go over but to where you know

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.320 
that you go over but to where you know
that<00:04:41.039> you<00:04:41.130> have<00:04:41.250> done<00:04:41.400> a<00:04:41.610> second<00:04:42.000> front<00:04:42.150> flip

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
that you have done a second front flip

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.670 
that you have done a second front flip
and<00:04:42.510> you<00:04:42.570> are<00:04:42.690> going<00:04:42.870> to<00:04:43.050> land<00:04:43.200> on<00:04:43.320> your<00:04:43.380> feet

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
now your first times you're not going to

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.260 
now your first times you're not going to
land<00:04:47.220> stayed<00:04:47.460> on<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.669> streets<00:04:47.910> it's<00:04:48.090> just

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
land stayed on the streets it's just

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.450 
land stayed on the streets it's just
it's<00:04:48.750> not<00:04:48.870> going<00:04:49.020> to<00:04:49.110> do<00:04:49.200> it<00:04:49.320> if<00:04:49.950> you<00:04:50.130> have<00:04:50.310> to

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
adjust the landing so so you land on

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.879 
adjust the landing so so you land on
your<00:04:52.860> feet<00:04:53.070> and<00:04:53.550> your<00:04:53.970> to<00:04:54.150> fall<00:04:54.389> back<00:04:54.889> it's
