00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.979 
again if we open this up flip it around
to<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.670> back<00:03:19.820> side<00:03:20.090> that's<00:03:20.450> what<00:03:20.690> it<00:03:20.810> looks

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
to the back side that's what it looks

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.960 
to the back side that's what it looks
like<00:03:21.110> in<00:03:21.350> book<00:03:21.530> mode<00:03:21.769> it<00:03:22.250> is<00:03:22.430> not<00:03:22.580> going<00:03:22.850> to

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
like in book mode it is not going to

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.030 
like in book mode it is not going to
stay<00:03:23.360> there's<00:03:23.810> no<00:03:23.989> magnet<00:03:24.410> to<00:03:24.500> keep<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:24.860> open

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
stay there's no magnet to keep it open

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.220 
stay there's no magnet to keep it open
but<00:03:25.880> you're<00:03:26.269> going<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.540> have<00:03:26.600> to<00:03:26.810> kind<00:03:26.989> of<00:03:27.049> hold

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
but you're going to have to kind of hold

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.340 
but you're going to have to kind of hold
it<00:03:27.380> there<00:03:27.620> but<00:03:27.830> it<00:03:27.950> is<00:03:28.100> very<00:03:28.280> slim<00:03:29.269> still<00:03:30.080> in

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
it there but it is very slim still in

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.500 
it there but it is very slim still in
that<00:03:30.560> mode<00:03:30.830> and<00:03:31.100> it<00:03:31.519> doesn't<00:03:31.820> put<00:03:31.940> your<00:03:32.120> iPad

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
that mode and it doesn't put your iPad

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.300 
that mode and it doesn't put your iPad
to<00:03:32.720> sleep<00:03:33.080> so<00:03:33.320> they<00:03:33.350> got<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.650> magnets<00:03:34.070> right

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
to sleep so they got the magnets right

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.150 
to sleep so they got the magnets right
there<00:03:34.640> it's<00:03:35.540> a<00:03:35.690> border<00:03:36.049> design<00:03:36.440> so<00:03:36.980> what<00:03:37.130> that

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
there it's a border design so what that

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.240 
there it's a border design so what that
means<00:03:38.080> some<00:03:39.080> of<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.260> other<00:03:39.410> cases<00:03:39.680> kind<00:03:40.160> of

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
means some of the other cases kind of

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.310 
means some of the other cases kind of
end<00:03:40.430> right<00:03:40.880> around<00:03:41.120> here<00:03:41.600> where<00:03:41.810> my<00:03:41.959> finger<00:03:42.019> is

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
end right around here where my finger is

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.500 
end right around here where my finger is
and<00:03:42.799> you<00:03:43.040> get<00:03:43.130> a<00:03:43.160> borderless<00:03:43.640> design<00:03:44.030> with

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
and you get a borderless design with

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.120 
and you get a borderless design with
this<00:03:44.840> when<00:03:45.170> you're<00:03:45.320> swiping<00:03:45.560> yeah<00:03:45.980> you're

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
this when you're swiping yeah you're

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.770 
this when you're swiping yeah you're
going<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:46.310> hit<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.459> border<00:03:46.940> I'm<00:03:47.450> kind<00:03:47.690> of

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
going to hit the border I'm kind of

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.120 
going to hit the border I'm kind of
indifferent<00:03:48.019> on<00:03:48.350> that<00:03:48.530> it's<00:03:48.709> not<00:03:48.860> a<00:03:48.890> big<00:03:49.100> deal

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
indifferent on that it's not a big deal

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.520 
indifferent on that it's not a big deal
to<00:03:49.370> me<00:03:49.549> but<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.269> thing<00:03:50.299> I<00:03:50.630> will<00:03:50.870> call<00:03:51.140> out<00:03:51.170> with

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
to me but the thing I will call out with

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.100 
to me but the thing I will call out with
border<00:03:51.890> design<00:03:52.250> cases<00:03:52.820> is<00:03:53.030> sometimes<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:53.959> can

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
border design cases is sometimes you can

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.310 
border design cases is sometimes you can
get<00:03:54.200> debris<00:03:54.680> trapped<00:03:55.010> in<00:03:55.280> here<00:03:55.810> it's<00:03:56.810> going<00:03:57.290> to

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
get debris trapped in here it's going to

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.830 
get debris trapped in here it's going to
be<00:03:57.650> necessary<00:03:57.829> I<00:03:58.579> would<00:03:58.910> say<00:03:59.180> there's<00:03:59.570> a<00:03:59.660> good

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
be necessary I would say there's a good

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.810 
be necessary I would say there's a good
practice<00:04:00.470> from<00:04:00.769> time<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:01.190> time<00:04:01.220> take<00:04:01.790> your

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
practice from time to time take your

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.789 
practice from time to time take your
iPad<00:04:02.269> out<00:04:02.450> of<00:04:02.570> this<00:04:02.660> case<00:04:02.959> clean<00:04:03.470> it<00:04:03.620> out<00:04:03.739> and

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
iPad out of this case clean it out and

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.039 
iPad out of this case clean it out and
then<00:04:04.040> pop<00:04:04.700> it<00:04:04.730> back<00:04:04.910> in<00:04:05.329> because<00:04:05.690> if<00:04:05.810> you<00:04:05.870> get

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
then pop it back in because if you get

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.080 
then pop it back in because if you get
debris<00:04:06.410> collecting<00:04:06.950> in<00:04:07.070> here<00:04:07.370> it<00:04:07.519> could

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
debris collecting in here it could

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.120 
debris collecting in here it could
scratch<00:04:08.360> your<00:04:08.600> screen<00:04:08.870> so<00:04:09.049> keep<00:04:09.230> that<00:04:09.260> in<00:04:09.620> mind

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
scratch your screen so keep that in mind

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.009 
scratch your screen so keep that in mind
let's<00:04:11.090> go<00:04:11.209> ahead<00:04:11.299> and<00:04:11.390> look<00:04:11.600> at<00:04:11.750> how<00:04:11.840> that

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
let's go ahead and look at how that

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.750 
let's go ahead and look at how that
kickstand<00:04:12.560> on<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:12.890> back<00:04:13.040> side<00:04:13.280> works<00:04:13.549> you

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
kickstand on the back side works you

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.300 
kickstand on the back side works you
flip<00:04:14.000> it<00:04:14.090> open<00:04:14.239> like<00:04:14.480> this<00:04:14.829> tuck<00:04:15.829> it<00:04:16.010> in<00:04:16.160> and

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
flip it open like this tuck it in and

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.250 
flip it open like this tuck it in and
you<00:04:16.850> get<00:04:16.970> a<00:04:17.000> couple<00:04:17.269> of<00:04:17.359> stands<00:04:17.600> here<00:04:17.900> so<00:04:18.079> that

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
you get a couple of stands here so that

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.529 
you get a couple of stands here so that
is<00:04:18.410> one<00:04:18.829> stand<00:04:19.700> that<00:04:19.850> you<00:04:19.940> get<00:04:20.120> for<00:04:20.359> maybe

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
is one stand that you get for maybe

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.230 
is one stand that you get for maybe
viewing<00:04:21.190> you<00:04:22.190> could<00:04:22.430> play<00:04:22.610> games<00:04:22.849> on<00:04:23.060> that

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
viewing you could play games on that

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.810 
viewing you could play games on that
although<00:04:23.599> it's<00:04:23.810> not<00:04:23.930> incredibly<00:04:24.500> comfortable

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
although it's not incredibly comfortable

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
although it's not incredibly comfortable
and<00:04:25.940> then<00:04:26.540> there's<00:04:26.750> another<00:04:26.840> stand<00:04:27.500> like<00:04:28.370> this

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
and then there's another stand like this

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.390 
and then there's another stand like this
now<00:04:29.840> i<00:04:29.870> will<00:04:30.110> mention<00:04:30.290> in<00:04:30.620> these<00:04:30.770> stand<00:04:31.130> modes

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
now i will mention in these stand modes

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.550 
now i will mention in these stand modes
because<00:04:31.670> they<00:04:32.240> kind<00:04:32.720> of<00:04:32.810> latch<00:04:33.020> into<00:04:33.350> that

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
because they kind of latch into that

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.410 
because they kind of latch into that
kickstand<00:04:34.130> on<00:04:34.280> the<00:04:34.430> back<00:04:34.610> side<00:04:34.880> they're<00:04:35.150> very

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
kickstand on the back side they're very

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.780 
kickstand on the back side they're very
stable<00:04:35.840> you<00:04:36.410> can<00:04:36.560> use<00:04:36.770> this<00:04:36.980> on<00:04:37.160> your<00:04:37.310> lap<00:04:37.550> you

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
stable you can use this on your lap you

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.060 
stable you can use this on your lap you
can<00:04:37.940> use<00:04:38.090> it<00:04:38.120> in<00:04:38.300> bed<00:04:38.540> on<00:04:38.750> a<00:04:38.780> sofa<00:04:39.080> whatever<00:04:39.590> and

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
can use it in bed on a sofa whatever and

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
can use it in bed on a sofa whatever and
you're<00:04:40.160> not<00:04:40.310> going<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:40.490> worry<00:04:40.670> about<00:04:40.730> these

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
you're not going to worry about these

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.410 
you're not going to worry about these
coming<00:04:41.600> out<00:04:41.780> of<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:42.620> stand<00:04:43.190> positioning<00:04:44.120> so

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
coming out of the stand positioning so

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.180 
coming out of the stand positioning so
it's<00:04:44.840> a<00:04:44.900> nice<00:04:45.110> feature<00:04:45.380> that<00:04:45.530> you<00:04:45.740> get<00:04:45.980> with

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
it's a nice feature that you get with

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.340 
it's a nice feature that you get with
this<00:04:46.430> case<00:04:46.760> and<00:04:47.030> both<00:04:47.480> of<00:04:47.510> those<00:04:47.780> angles<00:04:48.170> work

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
this case and both of those angles work

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.440 
this case and both of those angles work
pretty<00:04:48.620> well<00:04:48.740> for<00:04:48.920> their<00:04:49.310> intended<00:04:49.640> purposes

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
pretty well for their intended purposes

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.650 
pretty well for their intended purposes
close<00:04:51.440> it<00:04:51.590> up<00:04:51.710> and<00:04:51.890> that's<00:04:52.820> all<00:04:53.030> there<00:04:53.180> is<00:04:53.240> to

close it up and that's all there is to

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.140 
close it up and that's all there is to
it<00:04:53.690> you're<00:04:53.960> ready<00:04:54.110> to<00:04:54.320> go<00:04:54.530> overall<00:04:55.490> i<00:04:55.730> am<00:04:55.940> going

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
like that it is slim and that it is very

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.390 
like that it is slim and that it is very
lightweight<00:05:08.170> if<00:05:09.170> we're<00:05:09.710> to<00:05:09.800> call<00:05:09.980> anything

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
lightweight if we're to call anything

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.770 
lightweight if we're to call anything
out<00:05:10.520> that<00:05:10.550> could<00:05:10.850> be<00:05:10.940> improved<00:05:11.240> and<00:05:11.480> it's<00:05:11.630> not

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
out that could be improved and it's not

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.630 
out that could be improved and it's not
so<00:05:11.930> much<00:05:11.990> a<00:05:12.140> negative<00:05:12.680> as<00:05:12.860> improvements<00:05:13.310> i

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
so much a negative as improvements i

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.750 
so much a negative as improvements i
would<00:05:13.790> say<00:05:14.140> you're<00:05:15.140> not<00:05:15.470> going<00:05:16.130> to<00:05:16.370> get<00:05:16.550> a

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
would say you're not going to get a

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.390 
would say you're not going to get a
whole<00:05:17.060> lot<00:05:17.090> of<00:05:17.570> drop<00:05:18.320> protection<00:05:18.620> with<00:05:19.160> this

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
whole lot of drop protection with this

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.190 
whole lot of drop protection with this
and<00:05:19.670> I<00:05:19.880> mean<00:05:20.060> that's<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.450> nature<00:05:20.690> of<00:05:20.870> this

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
and I mean that's the nature of this

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.350 
and I mean that's the nature of this
case<00:05:21.500> you<00:05:22.040> can<00:05:22.250> see<00:05:22.310> if<00:05:22.670> you<00:05:22.850> want<00:05:23.060> it<00:05:23.180> to<00:05:23.330> be

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
case you can see if you want it to be

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.840 
case you can see if you want it to be
slim<00:05:23.840> you're<00:05:24.620> going<00:05:24.740> to<00:05:24.800> sacrifice<00:05:25.220> somewhere

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
slim you're going to sacrifice somewhere

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.730 
slim you're going to sacrifice somewhere
so<00:05:26.180> it<00:05:26.540> will<00:05:26.930> give<00:05:27.050> you<00:05:27.140> good<00:05:27.410> scratch

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
so it will give you good scratch

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.100 
so it will give you good scratch
protection<00:05:28.240> not<00:05:29.240> so<00:05:29.510> much<00:05:29.660> in<00:05:29.810> the<00:05:29.900> drop

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
protection not so much in the drop

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.930 
protection not so much in the drop
protection<00:05:30.470> area<00:05:31.220> but<00:05:31.430> again<00:05:31.670> if<00:05:31.820> you're

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
protection area but again if you're

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.280 
protection area but again if you're
buying<00:05:32.150> this<00:05:32.360> case<00:05:32.600> I<00:05:32.750> think<00:05:32.960> you<00:05:33.080> maybe

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
buying this case I think you maybe

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.500 
buying this case I think you maybe
already<00:05:33.410> know<00:05:33.890> that<00:05:34.100> the<00:05:34.610> only<00:05:34.760> other<00:05:35.120> area

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
already know that the only other area

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.660 
already know that the only other area
that<00:05:35.540> I<00:05:35.690> would<00:05:35.870> say<00:05:36.110> is<00:05:36.350> an<00:05:36.830> improvement<00:05:37.220> and

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
that I would say is an improvement and

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.610 
that I would say is an improvement and
the<00:05:38.330> drop<00:05:38.540> protection<00:05:38.750> is<00:05:39.140> really<00:05:39.380> not<00:05:39.470> an

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
the drop protection is really not an

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.080 
the drop protection is really not an
improvement<00:05:39.920> it's<00:05:40.250> just<00:05:40.430> kind<00:05:40.580> of<00:05:40.610> a<00:05:40.700> call<00:05:40.910> out

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
improvement it's just kind of a call out

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.360 
improvement it's just kind of a call out
is<00:05:41.300> that<00:05:41.600> headphone<00:05:42.020> jack<00:05:42.320> area<00:05:42.710> remember<00:05:43.280> how

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370
