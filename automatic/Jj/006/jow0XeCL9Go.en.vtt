00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.100
 1 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.670
 and 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.780
 no 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.670
 Yes 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:20.150
 for us it went well considering that we have 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:21.590
 won by 6-4 win against longwy 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.850
 so here we try to set up 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.280
 something good with showing 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.740
 that they can to access this 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.550
 Round of 16 which makes us 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.670
 a lot of pleasure 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.740
 and I my goal to we had said 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.030
 hangs from the start it was from me 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.890
 to please and to be able to go 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.690
 further away and that it will be a 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.790
 challenge for him between players and 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.360
 it's just deserved we've been solid 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.920
 from beginning to end and 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.760
 apart from the half-time the beginning of the 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.620
 inhabitants who were a bit more 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.080
 difficult but otherwise we knew how to fit 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.420
 managed things well and I hope that 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.640
 when I turn we pull to maybe a 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.620
 team pretty big enough for karim's 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.200
 first division I hope is we 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.030
 can make him a futsal flower at 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.890
 in the greenhouse gym by enzo for 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.790
 show a little bit to people that the 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.790
 social in its place in Alsace 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.950
 what 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.950
 m 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.450
 very disappointed first of all that she did 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.310
 very complicated beginning of the game we have 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.800
 does a lot of opponents gifts on 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.790
 redo the first three goals 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.640
 then we knew how to get into 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.300
 leave at the end of the first half 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.400
 after that it's true that on a few 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.400
 Arbitrator decisions were complicated 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.050
 friends half time we came back very 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.720
 very well we read very little 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.770
 a lot of opportunities and on our times 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.080
 strong and then 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.250
 hu at the end 3 4 me of the end it was necessary 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.350
 that we push to try to come back 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.460
 but strasbourg managed to meet at 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.720
 break but good overall 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.760
 we are very disappointed with our service 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.500
 already collective even if he reaches mid 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.760
 time was better 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.300
 then the decisions of the decisions that 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.260
 is discussed it's not easy we're disappointed 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.240
 to lose today while we 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.680
 could have largely passed 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.060
 then it's fucked go we'll try 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.460
 to bounce very quickly achopper enrolled 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.300
 next now it's very hard to 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.300
 accept today at parties 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.940
 at 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.599
 only 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.970
 and 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.410
 the 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.349
 and 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.349
 There you go 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.580

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.580
