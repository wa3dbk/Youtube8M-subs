I've actually got I think I've just got
fast<00:00:39.100> mag<00:00:42.749> so<00:00:43.749> that<00:00:43.899> didn't<00:00:44.230> really<00:00:44.409> go<00:00:44.530> too

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
fast mag so that didn't really go too

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.239 
fast mag so that didn't really go too
well<00:00:45.039> did<00:00:45.370> it<00:00:45.749> anyway<00:00:46.749> fast<00:00:47.079> mag<00:00:47.379> and<00:00:47.679> I'd<00:00:48.010> say

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:48.249 
well did it anyway fast mag and I'd say

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:50.669 
well did it anyway fast mag and I'd say
put<00:00:48.489> laser<00:00:48.730> sight<00:00:49.149> on<00:00:49.179> it<00:00:49.449> if<00:00:50.199> you<00:00:50.319> don't<00:00:50.499> want

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:50.679 
put laser sight on it if you don't want

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:52.559 
put laser sight on it if you don't want
to<00:00:50.739> use<00:00:50.859> laser<00:00:51.159> sight<00:00:51.519> go<00:00:51.670> to<00:00:51.850> red<00:00:52.089> dot<00:00:52.300> sight

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:52.569 
to use laser sight go to red dot sight

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:55.229 
to use laser sight go to red dot sight
because<00:00:52.749> that's<00:00:53.019> also<00:00:53.199> pretty<00:00:53.559> good<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:55.030> can

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
because that's also pretty good you can

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.119 
because that's also pretty good you can
improve<00:00:55.510> your<00:00:55.569> accuracy<00:00:55.929> a<00:00:56.170> bit<00:00:56.379> more<00:00:56.589> but

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
improve your accuracy a bit more but

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
obviously not they're really going to

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.779 
obviously not they're really going to

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
thing if you knew I do do most of the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.640 
thing if you knew I do do most of the
most<00:02:22.640> of<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:22.970> diamond<00:02:23.540> gun<00:02:23.750> like<00:02:24.730> reviews<00:02:25.730> and

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
most of the diamond gun like reviews and

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.320 
most of the diamond gun like reviews and
like<00:02:27.650> game<00:02:27.950> plays<00:02:28.280> on<00:02:28.520> free<00:02:28.850> for<00:02:29.090> all<00:02:29.150> when<00:02:29.300> I

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
like game plays on free for all when I

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.020 
like game plays on free for all when I
do<00:02:29.450> them<00:02:29.720> it's<00:02:30.710> just<00:02:30.950> better<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.490> see<00:02:32.000> a

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
do them it's just better to see a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.510 
do them it's just better to see a
one-on-one<00:02:32.390> situation<00:02:32.950> with<00:02:33.950> that<00:02:34.160> gun<00:02:34.370> and

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
one-on-one situation with that gun and

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.760 
one-on-one situation with that gun and
how<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.790> performs<00:02:35.240> in<00:02:35.570> one-on-one<00:02:35.870> situations

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
how it performs in one-on-one situations

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.620 
how it performs in one-on-one situations
instead<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.580> running<00:02:37.880> round<00:02:38.090> like<00:02:38.360> going

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
instead of running round like going

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.560 
instead of running round like going
crazy<00:02:38.870> on<00:02:39.400> domination<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.580> stuff<00:02:41.360> like<00:02:41.510> that

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
crazy on domination and stuff like that

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.510 
crazy on domination and stuff like that
so<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:42.080> just<00:02:42.500> gives<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:42.800> a<00:02:42.830> better<00:02:43.070> view<00:02:43.190> of

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
so it just gives you a better view of

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.580 
so it just gives you a better view of
how<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.880> works<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:44.630> they<00:02:44.780> are<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.020> attachments

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
how it works so they are the attachments

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.770 
how it works so they are the attachments
that<00:02:45.620> I've<00:02:45.800> used<00:02:46.010> laser<00:02:46.760> sight<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:47.300> fast<00:02:47.540> mag

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
that I've used laser sight and fast mag

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.570 
that I've used laser sight and fast mag
I'm<00:02:47.990> not<00:02:48.110> sure<00:02:48.170> why<00:02:48.590> I<00:02:48.620> haven't<00:02:48.920> got<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.310> on<00:02:49.430> it

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
I'm not sure why I haven't got it on it

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.540 
I'm not sure why I haven't got it on it
and<00:02:49.820> I<00:02:49.940> may<00:02:50.209> have<00:02:50.300> prestige<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.930> gun<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.550> been

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
and I may have prestige the gun and been

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.790 
and I may have prestige the gun and been
on<00:02:52.700> low<00:02:53.000> low<00:02:53.480> attachment<00:02:54.080> still<00:02:54.320> not<00:02:54.590> had<00:02:54.770> a

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
on low low attachment still not had a

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.800 
on low low attachment still not had a
lot<00:02:55.010> of<00:02:55.070> attachments<00:02:55.420> actually<00:02:56.420> I<00:02:56.450> tell<00:02:56.690> you

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
lot of attachments actually I tell you

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.900 
lot of attachments actually I tell you
what<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:56.990> had<00:02:57.200> I<00:02:57.350> had<00:02:57.410> long<00:02:57.800> barrel<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.459> I<00:02:58.790> had

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
what I had I had long barrel and I had

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.990 
what I had I had long barrel and I had
fast<00:02:59.209> mag<00:02:59.510> long<00:03:00.230> barrel<00:03:00.680> increases<00:03:01.490> range<00:03:01.760> i

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
fast mag long barrel increases range i

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.760 
fast mag long barrel increases range i
think<00:03:02.240> which<00:03:02.450> is<00:03:02.480> also<00:03:02.900> another<00:03:03.110> good<00:03:03.380> one<00:03:03.560> for

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
think which is also another good one for

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.300 
think which is also another good one for
this<00:03:04.690> because<00:03:05.690> of<00:03:05.840> fly<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:06.560> since<00:03:06.890> they<00:03:07.070> are

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
this because of fly it since they are

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.890 
this because of fly it since they are
since<00:03:07.820> they<00:03:07.910> did<00:03:08.090> that<00:03:08.240> update<00:03:08.630> where<00:03:08.810> they

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
since they did that update where they

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.430 
since they did that update where they
changed<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.380> a<00:03:09.470> little<00:03:09.560> bit<00:03:10.989> it's<00:03:11.989> not<00:03:12.290> as

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
changed it a little bit it's not as

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.920 
changed it a little bit it's not as
powerful<00:03:12.800> as<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:13.370> was<00:03:13.550> so<00:03:14.209> i'll<00:03:14.450> actually<00:03:14.630> got

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
powerful as it was so i'll actually got

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.560 
powerful as it was so i'll actually got
long<00:03:15.140> barrel<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:15.769> fast<00:03:16.340> bag<00:03:16.580> on<00:03:16.730> this<00:03:16.910> but<00:03:17.540> i

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
long barrel and fast bag on this but i

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.520 
long barrel and fast bag on this but i
would<00:03:17.840> say<00:03:18.050> even<00:03:18.350> long<00:03:18.709> barrel<00:03:19.130> fast<00:03:19.489> mag<00:03:20.530> fast

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
would say even long barrel fast mag fast

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.070 
would say even long barrel fast mag fast
mag<00:03:21.769> and<00:03:21.950> laser<00:03:22.160> sight<00:03:22.580> or<00:03:24.100> wells<00:03:25.100> could<00:03:25.370> we<00:03:25.489> go

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
mag and laser sight or wells could we go

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.410 
mag and laser sight or wells could we go
the<00:03:27.080> red<00:03:27.290> dot<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.100> fast<00:03:28.370> mag<00:03:28.640> or<00:03:28.910> red<00:03:29.120> dot

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
the red dot and the fast mag or red dot

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.360 
the red dot and the fast mag or red dot
and<00:03:29.570> long<00:03:30.200> barrel<00:03:30.590> which<00:03:30.739> would<00:03:30.980> be<00:03:31.130> another

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
and long barrel which would be another

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.930 
and long barrel which would be another
good<00:03:31.580> one<00:03:31.900> fast<00:03:32.900> mags<00:03:33.140> not<00:03:33.410> really<00:03:33.830> it's<00:03:34.820> not

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
good one fast mags not really it's not

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.960 
good one fast mags not really it's not
really<00:03:35.200> something<00:03:36.200> that<00:03:36.380> is<00:03:36.890> compulsory<00:03:37.880> on

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
really something that is compulsory on

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.430 
really something that is compulsory on
this<00:03:38.150> gun<00:03:38.330> I'd<00:03:38.450> say<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:38.750> be<00:03:39.080> honest<00:03:39.350> you

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
this gun I'd say to be honest you

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.290 
this gun I'd say to be honest you
wouldn't<00:03:39.680> actually<00:03:39.830> really<00:03:40.280> need<00:03:40.459> it<00:03:40.610> so<00:03:40.790> you

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
wouldn't actually really need it so you

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.160 
wouldn't actually really need it so you
could<00:03:41.480> go<00:03:41.600> long<00:03:41.840> barrel<00:03:42.350> red<00:03:42.950> dot<00:03:43.870> if<00:03:44.870> you<00:03:44.989> like

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
could go long barrel red dot if you like

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.890 
could go long barrel red dot if you like
aiming<00:03:45.620> down<00:03:45.739> sights<00:03:45.800> or<00:03:46.340> or<00:03:47.209> you<00:03:47.269> could<00:03:47.810> go

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
aiming down sights or or you could go

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.539 
aiming down sights or or you could go
long<00:03:48.170> barrel<00:03:48.500> and<00:03:48.590> laser<00:03:48.830> which<00:03:49.220> is<00:03:49.370> going<00:03:49.489> to

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
long barrel and laser which is going to

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.120 
long barrel and laser which is going to
be<00:03:49.640> longer<00:03:50.269> range<00:03:50.630> from<00:03:51.110> the<00:03:51.260> hip<00:03:51.470> which<00:03:51.980> is

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
be longer range from the hip which is

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.550 
be longer range from the hip which is
also<00:03:52.430> another<00:03:52.610> good<00:03:52.820> one<00:03:53.000> and<00:03:53.390> I<00:03:53.630> should

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
also another good one and I should

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.259 
also another good one and I should
imagine<00:03:54.650> most<00:03:55.160> people<00:03:55.310> use<00:03:55.790> this<00:03:55.940> from<00:03:56.150> the

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
imagine most people use this from the

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.180 
imagine most people use this from the
hip<00:03:56.420> anyway<00:03:56.750> it's<00:03:56.959> not<00:03:57.080> really<00:03:57.440> i<00:03:57.650> don't

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
hip anyway it's not really i don't

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.650 
hip anyway it's not really i don't
really<00:03:58.310> like<00:03:58.400> aiming<00:03:58.850> down<00:03:58.940> sights<00:03:59.000> too<00:03:59.450> much

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
really like aiming down sights too much

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
really like aiming down sights too much
with<00:03:59.870> it

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
with it

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.590 
with it
but<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:02.250> old<00:04:02.400> time<00:04:02.610> you<00:04:02.790> do<00:04:02.940> like<00:04:03.150> like<00:04:03.420> that's

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
but the old time you do like like that's

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.420 
but the old time you do like like that's
all<00:04:03.900> sort<00:04:04.740> of<00:04:04.770> thing<00:04:04.920> they<00:04:05.010> actually<00:04:05.220> on<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.370> be

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
all sort of thing they actually on to be

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.220 
all sort of thing they actually on to be
a<00:04:05.460> little<00:04:05.640> bit<00:04:05.820> more<00:04:06.000> accurate<00:04:06.480> with<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:06.690> but

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
a little bit more accurate with it but

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.170 
a little bit more accurate with it but
you<00:04:07.290> can<00:04:07.380> see<00:04:07.620> here<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:07.950> person<00:04:08.310> was<00:04:08.460> on<00:04:08.580> 24

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
you can see here the person was on 24

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.740 
you can see here the person was on 24
and<00:04:09.830> 25<00:04:10.830> now<00:04:11.130> and<00:04:11.430> then<00:04:11.700> I<00:04:11.910> sort<00:04:12.150> of<00:04:12.240> a<00:04:12.420> sort<00:04:12.720> of

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
and 25 now and then I sort of a sort of

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.590 
and 25 now and then I sort of a sort of
picked<00:04:12.960> up<00:04:13.080> a<00:04:13.140> lot<00:04:13.380> of<00:04:13.470> killstreaks<00:04:13.950> quick<00:04:14.280> and

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
picked up a lot of killstreaks quick and

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.670 
picked up a lot of killstreaks quick and
I<00:04:15.600> think<00:04:15.900> it<00:04:15.960> was<00:04:16.050> just<00:04:16.170> the<00:04:16.290> heat<00:04:16.380> of<00:04:16.620> the

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
I think it was just the heat of the

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.260 
I think it was just the heat of the
moment<00:04:16.709> thing<00:04:17.160> I<00:04:17.310> just<00:04:17.550> I<00:04:17.670> just<00:04:17.730> went<00:04:18.120> on<00:04:18.239> a

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
moment thing I just I just went on a

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.910 
moment thing I just I just went on a
little<00:04:18.420> rampage<00:04:19.020> as<00:04:19.260> opposed<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.620> put<00:04:19.800> it

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
little rampage as opposed to put it
