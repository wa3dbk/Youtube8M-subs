00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
this video okay so pretty much all

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.579 
this video okay so pretty much all
you're<00:01:03.180> gonna<00:01:03.270> do<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:04.110> really<00:01:04.320> not<00:01:04.530> that

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
you're gonna do it's really not that

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.450 
you're gonna do it's really not that
hard<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.580> look<00:01:05.790> closely<00:01:06.180> right<00:01:06.900> here

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
hard is if you look closely right here

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.590 
hard is if you look closely right here
or<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.580> might<00:01:08.700> not<00:01:08.850> see<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.180> camera<00:01:09.420> but

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
or you might not see it on camera but

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.789 
or you might not see it on camera but
there's<00:01:10.439> two<00:01:10.710> ends<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:12.150> little<00:01:12.390> punch<00:01:12.799> one

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
there's two ends of a little punch one

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.770 
there's two ends of a little punch one
end<00:01:14.189> will<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.400> bigger<00:01:14.790> than<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.210> others<00:01:15.540> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
end will be bigger than the others and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.679 
end will be bigger than the others and
that<00:01:15.869> means<00:01:16.080> that's<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.350> head<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.689> that

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
that means that's the head and that

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.649 
that means that's the head and that
means<00:01:18.869> you're<00:01:18.960> gonna<00:01:19.290> go<00:01:20.159> ahead<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.790> punch

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
means you're gonna go ahead and punch

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.109 
means you're gonna go ahead and punch
out<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.960> opposite<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.610> pretty<00:01:23.820> hard

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
out the opposite in this is pretty hard

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.310 
out the opposite in this is pretty hard
to<00:01:24.210> do<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.659> it's<00:01:24.780> kind<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.110> time-consuming

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
to do and it's kind of time-consuming

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.940 
to do and it's kind of time-consuming
because<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.729> hard<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.270> grip<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.950> right

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
because it's hard to grip this right

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.760 
because it's hard to grip this right
there<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.460> Hammer<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.530> it<00:01:31.530> usually

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
there and Hammer it and it usually

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.160 
there and Hammer it and it usually
slipping<00:01:32.340> slides<00:01:32.670> around<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.049> be

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
slipping slides around and it can be

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.550 
slipping slides around and it can be
trouble<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.780> I'm<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:36.990> going<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.200> do<00:01:37.380> that

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
trouble so I'm just going to do that

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.200 
trouble so I'm just going to do that
right<00:01:38.009> now<00:01:38.220> I'm<00:01:38.460> not<00:01:38.549> probably<00:01:38.850> gonna<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.180> to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
right now I'm not probably gonna have to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:49.899 
right now I'm not probably gonna have to
end<00:01:39.450> up<00:01:39.770> fast-forwarding<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.070> footage

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.429 

I'll<00:01:50.909> just<00:01:51.119> show<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.450> what<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.990> do<00:01:52.140> I'm

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
I'll just show you what to do I'm

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.880 
I'll just show you what to do I'm
probably<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.130> do<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.490> off<00:01:53.700> camera<00:01:53.840> actually

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
probably to do this off camera actually

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.359 
probably to do this off camera actually
so<00:01:55.890> here's<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.909> end<00:01:57.090> that's<00:01:57.420> smaller<00:01:58.369> and

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
so here's the end that's smaller and

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.950 
so here's the end that's smaller and
you're<00:01:59.640> gonna<00:01:59.729> line<00:01:59.969> up<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.210> small<00:02:00.360> end<00:02:00.780> of

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
you're gonna line up the small end of

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.410 
you're gonna line up the small end of
the<00:02:01.079> punch<00:02:01.380> on<00:02:02.000> that<00:02:04.399> and<00:02:05.399> then<00:02:06.060> you're<00:02:06.270> gonna

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
the punch on that and then you're gonna

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.650 
the punch on that and then you're gonna
get<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.840> hammer

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
get the hammer

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.250 
get the hammer
and<00:02:09.660> you're<00:02:09.810> gonna<00:02:11.060> tap<00:02:12.060> as<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.780> can<00:02:12.900> see<00:02:13.080> the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
and you're gonna tap as you can see the

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.080 
and you're gonna tap as you can see the
slipping<00:02:13.620> slides<00:02:13.890> around<00:02:14.160> because<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.940> is

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
slipping slides around because it is

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.809 
slipping slides around because it is
rounded<00:02:15.569> on<00:02:15.750> here<00:02:16.049> so<00:02:16.739> I'll<00:02:17.340> just<00:02:17.459> give<00:02:17.790> you

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
rounded on here so I'll just give you

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.000 
rounded on here so I'll just give you
the<00:02:18.090> idea<00:02:18.540> I'm<00:02:19.290> going<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.530> move<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.799> camera

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
the idea I'm going to move the camera

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.589 
the idea I'm going to move the camera
position<00:02:20.549> and<00:02:20.760> I'm<00:02:20.849> gonna<00:02:20.940> prop<00:02:21.209> this<00:02:21.420> up

right here there is no more the wood
it's<00:05:14.970> now<00:05:15.120> off<00:05:15.360> it<00:05:16.010> and<00:05:17.010> it<00:05:17.220> was<00:05:17.370> really<00:05:17.520> simple

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
it's now off it and it was really simple

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.180 
it's now off it and it was really simple
um<00:05:18.240> like<00:05:18.840> I<00:05:18.990> said<00:05:19.020> that<00:05:19.380> came<00:05:19.560> out<00:05:19.740> a<00:05:19.770> lot

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
um like I said that came out a lot

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.910 
um like I said that came out a lot
smoother<00:05:20.700> and<00:05:20.910> I<00:05:21.180> thought<00:05:21.390> it<00:05:21.540> would<00:05:21.920> usually

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
smoother and I thought it would usually

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.590 
smoother and I thought it would usually
it<00:05:23.250> took<00:05:23.430> me<00:05:23.550> about<00:05:23.670> 20<00:05:24.000> minutes<00:05:24.270> the<00:05:24.360> first

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
it took me about 20 minutes the first

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.930 
it took me about 20 minutes the first
time<00:05:24.870> but<00:05:25.530> it's<00:05:25.710> just<00:05:25.890> um<00:05:26.160> this<00:05:26.550> video<00:05:26.700> is<00:05:26.910> just

time but it's just um this video is just
to<00:05:27.240> prove<00:05:27.600> that<00:05:27.660> it's<00:05:28.470> really<00:05:29.010> not<00:05:29.220> hard<00:05:29.610> to

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
to prove that it's really not hard to

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.210 
to prove that it's really not hard to
get<00:05:30.330> this<00:05:30.480> off<00:05:30.750> and<00:05:30.780> you<00:05:31.140> shouldn't<00:05:31.710> spend<00:05:31.980> the

get this off and you shouldn't spend the
