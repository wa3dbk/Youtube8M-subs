and stuff in it too so by dumping it in
the<00:01:17.970> ditch<00:01:18.150> we<00:01:18.479> don't<00:01:18.630> have<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.810> worry<00:01:18.960> about

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
the ditch we don't have to worry about

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.679 
the ditch we don't have to worry about
running<00:01:20.460> over<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.790> nails<00:01:21.000> because<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.570> know

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
running over the nails because we know

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.420 
running over the nails because we know
that<00:01:21.869> we'll<00:01:21.990> never<00:01:22.020> farm<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.560> down<00:01:22.680> down<00:01:23.189> the

that we'll never farm it down down the
ditch<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.110> once<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.259> go<00:01:25.770> through<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.130> burn<00:01:26.250> it

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
ditch and once we go through and burn it

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.910 
ditch and once we go through and burn it
we<00:01:26.909> can<00:01:27.030> go<00:01:27.149> through<00:01:27.359> and<00:01:27.539> cover<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.319> up<00:01:28.380> if<00:01:28.679> we

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
we can go through and cover it up if we

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.459 
we can go through and cover it up if we
want<00:01:29.069> to<00:01:29.340> or<00:01:29.520> if<00:01:29.869> it<00:01:30.869> comes<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.170> that

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
in that mess it's like right in there

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.759 
in that mess it's like right in there
there's<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.180> well<00:03:42.359> over<00:03:42.569> there<00:03:42.720> what<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:43.620> does

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
there's a well over there what it does

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.170 
there's a well over there what it does
is<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.599> sucks<00:03:45.599> the<00:03:45.720> water<00:03:45.840> out<00:03:46.079> of<00:03:46.109> the<00:03:46.230> ground

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
is it sucks the water out of the ground

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.670 
is it sucks the water out of the ground
brings<00:03:48.180> it<00:03:48.359> dumps<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:48.870> over<00:03:49.049> into<00:03:49.199> the<00:03:49.319> cistern

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
brings it dumps it over into the cistern

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.220 
brings it dumps it over into the cistern
then<00:03:50.519> from<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.819> cistern<00:03:51.209> it<00:03:51.660> goes<00:03:51.870> over<00:03:52.109> to

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
then from the cistern it goes over to

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.110 
then from the cistern it goes over to
the<00:03:52.470> cattle<00:03:52.889> water<00:03:53.069> right<00:03:53.730> outside<00:03:54.000> this

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
the cattle water right outside this

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.789 
the cattle water right outside this
window<00:03:54.329> here<00:03:54.629> and<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:55.319> goes<00:03:55.440> over<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.709> the

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
window here and it goes over to the

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.069 
window here and it goes over to the
house<00:03:56.239> now<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.269> reason<00:03:57.660> they<00:03:57.720> don't<00:03:57.840> do<00:03:57.989> it

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
house now the reason they don't do it

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.569 
house now the reason they don't do it
like<00:03:58.169> this<00:03:58.379> anymore<00:03:58.590> is<00:03:58.799> because<00:03:58.829> government

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
like this anymore is because government

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.770 
like this anymore is because government
regulations<00:04:00.150> say<00:04:00.569> that<00:04:02.120> wells<00:04:03.120> have<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.629> be

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
regulations say that wells have to be

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.869 
regulations say that wells have to be
pressurized<00:04:04.590> systems<00:04:05.040> now<00:04:05.250> pressurized

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
pressurized systems now pressurized

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.659 
pressurized systems now pressurized
closed<00:04:06.239> systems<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:07.400> therefore<00:04:08.400> they<00:04:08.519> don't

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
closed systems and therefore they don't

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.180 
closed systems and therefore they don't
really<00:04:08.790> put<00:04:09.030> cisterns<00:04:09.389> in<00:04:09.510> it<00:04:09.660> anymore<00:04:10.190> I

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
really put cisterns in it anymore I

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.309 
really put cisterns in it anymore I
still<00:04:11.489> have<00:04:11.730> one<00:04:11.879> and<00:04:12.030> out<00:04:12.150> of<00:04:12.239> my<00:04:12.389> place<00:04:12.660> the

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
still have one and out of my place the

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.680 
still have one and out of my place the
one<00:04:13.470> down<00:04:13.620> in<00:04:13.650> Travis's<00:04:14.250> place<00:04:14.519> was<00:04:14.879> filled<00:04:15.540> in

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
one down in Travis's place was filled in

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.270 
one down in Travis's place was filled in
way<00:04:16.349> back<00:04:16.530> when<00:04:16.680> I<00:04:16.739> was<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:16.949> kid<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:17.370> I<00:04:18.269> believe

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
way back when I was a kid and I believe

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.589 
way back when I was a kid and I believe
there<00:04:20.280> might<00:04:20.579> still<00:04:20.760> be<00:04:20.909> an<00:04:21.120> intact<00:04:21.419> without

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
there might still be an intact without

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.510 
there might still be an intact without
in<00:04:21.810> my<00:04:21.930> place<00:04:22.199> I<00:04:22.409> think<00:04:22.530> I<00:04:22.889> can't<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.280> can't

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
in my place I think I can't I can't

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.779 
in my place I think I can't I can't
really<00:04:23.639> remember<00:04:23.820> but<00:04:25.220> that<00:04:26.220> is<00:04:26.610> what

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
really remember but that is what

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.219 
really remember but that is what
cisterns<00:04:27.120> were<00:04:27.240> for<00:04:27.449> the<00:04:27.570> whole<00:04:27.720> basically

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
cisterns were for the whole basically

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.260 
cisterns were for the whole basically
just<00:04:28.349> a<00:04:28.470> holding<00:04:28.650> bed<00:04:28.889> for<00:04:29.099> the<00:04:29.159> water<00:04:29.370> when

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
just a holding bed for the water when

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.330 
just a holding bed for the water when
the<00:04:30.360> water<00:04:30.539> came<00:04:30.750> out<00:04:30.900> of<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.050> well<00:04:31.229> and<00:04:31.650> they

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
the water came out of the well and they

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.010 
the water came out of the well and they
used<00:04:32.490> to<00:04:32.520> use<00:04:32.699> cisterns<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.389> guess<00:04:33.630> back<00:04:33.870> when

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
used to use cisterns I guess back when

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.700 
used to use cisterns I guess back when
they<00:04:34.110> still<00:04:34.320> used<00:04:35.630> windmills<00:04:36.630> the<00:04:37.169> windmills

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
they still used windmills the windmills

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.310 
they still used windmills the windmills
would<00:04:37.860> turn<00:04:38.039> a<00:04:38.070> crank<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.669> crank<00:04:38.940> would

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
would turn a crank and the crank would

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.750 
would turn a crank and the crank would
put<00:04:40.320> pressure<00:04:40.470> down<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:41.070> well<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.639> well

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
put pressure down the well and the well

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.020 
put pressure down the well and the well
would<00:04:42.229> dump<00:04:43.229> into<00:04:43.500> a<00:04:43.530> cistern<00:04:43.950> then<00:04:44.700> once<00:04:44.880> the

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
would dump into a cistern then once the

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.339 
would dump into a cistern then once the
cistern<00:04:45.330> got<00:04:45.539> to<00:04:45.659> a<00:04:45.690> certain<00:04:45.870> level<00:04:46.020> of

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
cistern got to a certain level of

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:47.090 
cistern got to a certain level of

valve<00:04:47.460> that<00:04:47.700> would<00:04:47.820> keep<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.090> water<00:04:48.270> from

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
valve that would keep the water from

valve that would keep the water from
overflowing<00:04:49.580> so<00:04:50.580> fun<00:04:50.940> little<00:04:51.060> fact<00:04:51.330> about

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
overflowing so fun little fact about

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.570 
overflowing so fun little fact about
that<00:04:51.860> now<00:04:52.860> they've<00:04:53.040> got<00:04:53.220> all<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:55.580> this

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
that now they've got all the this

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.670 
that now they've got all the this
building<00:04:56.970> old<00:04:57.210> grain<00:04:57.510> granary<00:04:58.200> cleaned<00:04:58.500> up

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
building old grain granary cleaned up

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.260 
building old grain granary cleaned up
this<00:04:58.800> is<00:04:58.920> where<00:04:59.070> they<00:04:59.190> kept<00:04:59.880> all<00:04:59.970> their<00:05:00.090> grain

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
this is where they kept all their grain

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.630 
this is where they kept all their grain
for<00:05:00.420> the<00:05:00.480> cattle<00:05:00.810> in<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:00.990> dairy<00:05:01.140> barn<00:05:01.320> over

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
for the cattle in the dairy barn over

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.510 
for the cattle in the dairy barn over
behind<00:05:02.640> this<00:05:02.760> building<00:05:03.120> over<00:05:03.210> there<00:05:03.920> but<00:05:04.920> it

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
behind this building over there but it

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.520 
behind this building over there but it
been<00:05:05.700> falling<00:05:05.970> in<00:05:06.090> for<00:05:06.240> a<00:05:06.330> few<00:05:06.450> years<00:05:06.720> and<00:05:06.930> we

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
been falling in for a few years and we

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.380 
been falling in for a few years and we
never<00:05:07.710> use<00:05:07.890> it<00:05:07.920> for<00:05:08.190> anything<00:05:08.490> that<00:05:08.970> I<00:05:09.210> think

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
never use it for anything that I think

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.990 
never use it for anything that I think
it<00:05:09.450> was<00:05:09.540> just<00:05:09.660> holding<00:05:09.960> a<00:05:10.020> couple<00:05:10.290> steaks<00:05:10.590> and

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
it was just holding a couple steaks and

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.980 
it was just holding a couple steaks and
whatnot<00:05:12.000> at<00:05:12.270> one<00:05:12.390> point<00:05:12.570> there<00:05:12.780> had<00:05:12.870> been

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
whatnot at one point there had been

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.320 
whatnot at one point there had been
dynamite<00:05:13.680> blasting<00:05:14.190> caps<00:05:14.430> stored<00:05:15.060> in<00:05:15.180> there

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
dynamite blasting caps stored in there

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.180 
dynamite blasting caps stored in there
but<00:05:15.510> they've<00:05:15.900> been<00:05:16.080> long<00:05:16.290> since<00:05:16.530> disposed<00:05:16.980> of

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
but they've been long since disposed of

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.180 
but they've been long since disposed of
so<00:05:19.250> yeah<00:05:20.250> that<00:05:21.090> should<00:05:21.240> be<00:05:21.300> about<00:05:21.480> it<00:05:22.190> think

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
so yeah that should be about it think

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.730 
so yeah that should be about it think
from<00:05:23.340> here<00:05:23.930> I'm<00:05:24.930> going<00:05:25.020> to<00:05:25.110> smooth<00:05:25.350> this<00:05:25.500> off<00:05:25.710> a

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
from here I'm going to smooth this off a

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.010 
from here I'm going to smooth this off a
little<00:05:25.920> bit<00:05:26.070> more<00:05:26.150> and<00:05:27.150> you<00:05:27.600> actually<00:05:27.840> clean

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
little bit more and you actually clean

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.930 
little bit more and you actually clean
this<00:05:28.170> up<00:05:28.320> this<00:05:28.530> looks<00:05:29.190> a<00:05:29.310> lot<00:05:29.580> better<00:05:29.850> than

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
this up this looks a lot better than

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.580 
this up this looks a lot better than
what<00:05:30.420> was<00:05:30.600> he<00:05:30.720> built<00:05:30.930> that<00:05:31.050> building<00:05:31.200> in<00:05:31.440> there

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
what was he built that building in there

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.700 
what was he built that building in there
so<00:05:32.930> probably<00:05:33.930> flatten<00:05:34.320> this<00:05:34.410> out<00:05:34.530> a<00:05:34.590> little

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
so probably flatten this out a little

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.940 
so probably flatten this out a little
bit<00:05:34.860> more<00:05:35.120> call<00:05:36.120> her<00:05:36.210> a<00:05:36.270> day<00:05:36.510> so<00:05:37.350> thanks<00:05:37.890> for

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
bit more call her a day so thanks for

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:38.600 
bit more call her a day so thanks for
