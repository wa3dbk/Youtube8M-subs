00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.080
 one of the wonders that make 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.930
 android such a powerful system is its 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.840
 ability to personalize some 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.000
 they enjoy changing the wallpaper 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.609
 others changing the day but there is something 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.590
 that at least fascinates me and is the 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.260
 possibility of changing the keyboard and 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.689
 experience new ways of writing 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.149
 on a touch screen and dimensions 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.630
 contained for fingers as big as 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.630
 mine 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.629
 well we just know that minion 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.730
 keyboard has been updated to the version 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.950
 2.0 we had not tried before this 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.350
 minimalist keyboard so it has 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.449
 seemed good time for it to say 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.370
 what a minimum is a keyboard that mixes 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.160
 several technologies that we have already seen 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.109
 that is to say it takes advantage of an excellent 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.210
 recognition engine to be able 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.060
 offer what in my opinion does 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.939
 unique a keyboard style that only 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.759
 one line in the minimum system for 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:16.310
 Android is smart its appearance we 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.640
 reports to the idea that they have taken a 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.899
 normal keyboard and have it compacted 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.570
 pushing the letters sideways 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.600
 so that instead of four lines only 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.610
 there is a line when you start 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.189
 writing in my new one is like no 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.409
 will accept any publication but 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.960
 surprisingly the predictive engine 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.060
 does an excellent job and corrects for 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.220
 general rule correctly what 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.959
 we want to put if we can not always 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.649
 choose the word from the bar 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.649
 predictions 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.590
 besides minimum keyboard integrates others 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.570
 input methods keeping two fingers 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.430
 pressed on an instant we can 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.130
 transform the keyboard into one 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.619
 traditional and if we hold a finger 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.500
 We can use the voice engine of 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.569
 google to introduce a string perhaps 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.979
 it's a matter of adapting myself but even though 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.470
 there were moments that in me not a 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.940
 correctly answered most 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.130
 of tickets I've made has given me 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.739
 failures will be because I have fingers 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.930
 great I do not know but the basics so that a 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:25.720
 keyboard is good is to be efficient 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.720
 with any profile of hand you do not believe
