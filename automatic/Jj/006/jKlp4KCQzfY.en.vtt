00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.950
 hello guitar nauta then today we see of 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.019
 understand how to set scalar work 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.299
 in general therefore this video serves 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.279
 basically to make you understand what the 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.849
 path of construction of your work 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:25.780
 scale multi-function scalar work 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:28.780
 multiple reasons of interest ie on one side 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.070
 is gym for hands gym for the 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.660
 left hand gym for the hand 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.789
 right and great job of 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.920
 coordination on the other is also a 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:37.180
 knowledge work on the scales then 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.550
 you will need them for your example 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.559
 solos for your improvisations then 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.719
 work for an electric guitarist 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.069
 scalar is absolutely fundamental not 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.679
 you can do without it 

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:49.629
 the ideal would be to really do a lot of 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.519
 this work within the limits of the 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.019
 proper of its own tolerance in the 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.489
 sense that I personally enjoy a 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.219
 do these things other people do it 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.449
 find a little bit more boring 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.979
 first the scalar work must 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.670
 to balance the knowledge of some 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:01.929
 stairs 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.699
 I normally start from the stairs 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.750
 pentatonic because they are the most 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.430
 used 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.470
 agree therefore the work of knowledge 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.450
 on the pentatonic after that the work 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.440
 of knowledge also on other scales 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.970
 typically the major and minor scales 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.730
 relative subsequently it can be 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.230
 then introduce after other concepts such as 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.330
 minor harmonic stopovers smaller ports 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.610
 melodic eventually later after 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.850
 study of modal scales derived from 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.840
 these other stairs we saw one 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.060
 once a job has been done 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.470
 knowledge therefore this requires a lot 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.150
 time and that is what I said 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.940
 now in 30 seconds it is a job that can 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.980
 take even years when you are though 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.780
 thus accumulated the right level of 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.730
 knowledge of position scales 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.160
 of connection of the positions one can 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.430
 also introduce a technical work with 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.870
 of the so-called progressions in reality 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.909
 the professions can and can be 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.830
 also introduce immediately as soon as I have 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.530
 for example learned the pentatonic 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.270
 indeed I can immediately introduce the 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.650
 progressions this one of the 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.440
 professions are sequences 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.990
 rather mathematical and geometric e 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.670
 repetitive on the scale that allow you to 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.259
 do technical work 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.489
 the classic one is good 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.800
 progression could be on 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:16.709
 pentatonic for example this forward of 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.709
 6 back notes of three kind so 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.030
 if I call you something repetitive e 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.010
 as if when I grasped the meaning I 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.780
 knew he already knew how to predict what 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.640
 it was happen later and must be 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.720
 so then be tech never at the level 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.250
 technical manual than at the level of 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.409
 ear right to understand what is the 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.120
 mechanism of that progression e 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.790
 know how to reproduce it so much that when me 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.129
 I learned a progression on the scale 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.750
 or on a position I can often do it 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.459
 directly also on other positions 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.379
 because my hands have learned 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.180
 execute that kind of mechanism e 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.510
 then they can easily reproduce it 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.189
 also on these other high progressions 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.629
 positions sorry this is the reason for 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:02.090
 which is important because when then 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.939
 they only get my hands in one and already 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.400
 they will have learned to move that way 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.169
 if you take the solos of any 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.450
 rock guitarist of any group 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:13.609
 rock inside in the midst of the various 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.620
 bending etc. there are also portions 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.480
 of professions therefore important for 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.510
 that's okay now explains us which 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.650
 are we say three professions 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.870
 fundamental from my point of view 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.970
 the one I always give him a yes 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.129
 call third party jumps 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.239
 now we'll see them quickly, I'm not 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.979
 explaining how to get dark 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.900
 profession I'm just doing one 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:34.579
 overview of what should be the 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.620
 exercises will have to face on each 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.129
 type of staircase to third sauces 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.129
 soil like that 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.549
 so they are practically pairs of notes 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:53.379
 who skip the note in between 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:55.180
 type do me ok then i'll repeat each one 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.950
 projection will be the subject of a video el 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.269
 we will analyze in detail it interests me 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.549
 make you understand what the job is in 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:03.579
 general the second typical progression 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.500
 they are not the quatrains groups of four 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:08.349
 notes that always go up one degree 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:20.440
 on the scale then do re me make me re 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:22.000
 sol and so on and so on and so on 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.000
 third type of important progression 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.639
 are the triplets groups of three notes that 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.639
 rise each time by one degree and so 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.970
 here is depending on the type of progression it is 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.190
 easier or more difficult to perform 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.380
 on certain types of stairs I do 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.970
 an example is the triplets for example solo 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.970
 rather simple on the pentatonic 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.760
 they are also quite natural 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.830
 but if we take the third jumps on the 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.470
 pentatonic become very complex 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.470
 because they are all full of minibars 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.289
 same thing applies to parts or to 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.729
 pentatonic is attention because the 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.070
 pentatonic is the first scale that 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.380
 we will learn but as for the 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.750
 progressions can be rather 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.460
 tricky with some progressions is fine 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.979
 here in the end I tell you when you get 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:19.990
 so developed the ability to play 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:21.789
 these progressions on all scales 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.160
 it may be useful to introduce other types 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:26.080
 more complex more advanced professions 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.300
 which also include for example use 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.760
 it depends on you to empty therefore movement 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.320
 continuous of the hand but not all 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.240
 pennate will have to touch the strings but there 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.400
 they will be breaks 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.860
 let's call them treads in a vacuum from 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.229
 insert in the loop, however, is therefore yes 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.930
 they systematically repeat one last thing 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.160
 what I tell you is that on all scales 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.900
 so both with regard to the 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.570
 pentatonic the major scales but all 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.400
 they should always be learned all over the handle 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.479
 but also in the first position I tell you the 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.950
 vacuum ropes 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:55.720
 the same applies to progressions 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.580
 let's not take an example on the scale of 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.620
 When I'm older I should learn it further 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:04.570
 that on all the handle also in first 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:07.980
 position and my progressions I had to 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.980
 also learn about this position 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:15.280
 this presented by professor a 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.570
 quatrains is good then learn the 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.520
 scales positions for the work of 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.790
 structure progression knowledge 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.260
 which are jumps of the third quartine triplets 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.620
 on all the stairs and if all 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.910
 positions via then separate videos e 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.160
 dedicated 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:34.080
 we will analyze each of these exercises 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.080
 hello and good work on the stairs
