00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.160 
enough to go on the site and buy him of
our<00:01:18.050> rescue<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:19.610> Buddy<00:01:20.180> started<00:01:20.570> coming<00:01:21.020> to

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
walking I think his back was really

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.800

hurting<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:26.090> you<00:01:26.330> know<00:01:26.479> when<00:01:26.660> you're

back mechanics and body mechanics they

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.640 
back mechanics and body mechanics they
tend<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.090> completely<00:01:41.600> especially<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:42.440> for

me and one the dog that pendulum at
beauties<00:01:47.830> but<00:01:48.830> they<00:01:48.979> tend<00:01:49.160> to<00:01:49.220> really<00:01:49.490> throw

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
beauties but they tend to really throw

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.760 
beauties but they tend to really throw
their<00:01:49.910> balance<00:01:50.240> off<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.570> what<00:01:50.720> they<00:01:50.899> do<00:01:50.960> is

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
their balance off and what they do is

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.529 
their balance off and what they do is
instead<00:01:52.250> of<00:01:52.310> having<00:01:52.429> both<00:01:52.910> their<00:01:53.149> front<00:01:53.390> legs

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.749 
instead of having both their front legs
like<00:01:53.720> this<00:01:53.960> they<00:01:54.289> do<00:01:54.350> this<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.220> so<00:01:55.429> they<00:01:55.550> put

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
like this they do this and so they put

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.190 
like this they do this and so they put
their<00:01:55.970> forelimb<00:01:56.420> in<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:56.660> center<00:01:57.020> of<00:01:57.050> their

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
their forelimb in the center of their

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.290 
their forelimb in the center of their
body<00:01:57.229> which<00:01:57.890> complete<00:01:58.340> completely<00:01:58.789> torques

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
body which complete completely torques

body which complete completely torques
the<00:01:59.479> back<00:01:59.690> so<00:02:00.619> I'll<00:02:01.009> never<00:02:01.220> forget<00:02:01.670> I<00:02:01.729> think<00:02:01.970> it

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
the back so I'll never forget I think it

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.760

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
want to use the kind of deep pressure

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.600 
want to use the kind of deep pressure
that<00:03:14.670> we<00:03:14.820> use<00:03:15.060> on<00:03:15.300> humans<00:03:16.010> it's<00:03:17.010> just<00:03:17.310> too<00:03:17.460> much

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
that we use on humans it's just too much

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.300 
that we use on humans it's just too much
for<00:03:17.850> her<00:03:17.940> daughter<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:19.620> he's<00:03:19.830> just<00:03:19.980> got<00:03:20.160> his

really so much lactic acid into their

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.560 
really so much lactic acid into their
muscles<00:03:52.800> so<00:03:53.370> they<00:03:53.490> could<00:03:53.670> be<00:03:53.760> really<00:03:54.270> stiff

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570

know three or four or sometimes even
more<00:04:57.300> times<00:04:57.600> it'll<00:04:57.870> flatten<00:04:58.290> out<00:04:58.620> so<00:04:59.250> they're

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
more times it'll flatten out so they're

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.280 
more times it'll flatten out so they're
always<00:04:59.580> gonna<00:04:59.910> be<00:05:00.150> sore<00:05:00.390> and<00:05:00.840> and
