00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
uncharted tues multi-player and changing

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.990 
uncharted tues multi-player and changing
around<00:01:08.390> first<00:01:08.720> this<00:01:09.560> way<00:01:09.710> I<00:01:09.979> think<00:01:10.460> I<00:01:10.580> tried<00:01:10.820> to

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
around first this way I think I tried to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.760 
around first this way I think I tried to
was<00:01:11.420> a<00:01:11.450> pretty<00:01:11.690> good<00:01:11.900> success<00:01:12.050> for<00:01:12.470> us<00:01:12.500> I<00:01:12.740> mean

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
was a pretty good success for us I mean

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.430 
was a pretty good success for us I mean
we<00:01:12.979> are<00:01:13.070> in<00:01:13.490> 10<00:01:13.670> min<00:01:13.880> bears<00:01:14.210> which<00:01:14.540> was<00:01:14.840> common

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
we are in 10 min bears which was common

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.160 
we are in 10 min bears which was common
unexpected<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:16.600> we<00:01:17.600> had<00:01:17.720> a<00:01:17.750> lot<00:01:17.930> of<00:01:17.960> good

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
unexpected and we had a lot of good

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.960 
unexpected and we had a lot of good
foundations<00:01:18.830> and<00:01:19.130> so<00:01:19.460> I<00:01:19.490> think<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.880> biggest

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
foundations and so I think the biggest

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.249 
foundations and so I think the biggest
thing<00:01:20.149> we're<00:01:20.330> trying<00:01:20.420> to<00:01:20.630> decide<00:01:20.810> just<00:01:21.170> to

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
thing we're trying to decide just to

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.770 
thing we're trying to decide just to
bring<00:01:21.560> that<00:01:21.740> cinematic<00:01:22.310> experience<00:01:22.630> we<00:01:23.630> had<00:01:23.750> a

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
bring that cinematic experience we had a

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.490 
bring that cinematic experience we had a
single<00:01:24.470> carrier<00:01:24.649> into<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.280> multiplayer<00:01:25.729> so

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
single carrier into the multiplayer so

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.190 
single carrier into the multiplayer so
that's<00:01:27.500> one<00:01:28.160> of<00:01:28.280> our<00:01:28.429> biggest<00:01:28.580> goals<00:01:29.060> we<00:01:29.869> have

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.210 
finally you are the thing is that
whispering<00:04:04.120> 3d<00:04:04.660> and<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:04.990> way<00:04:05.110> you<00:04:05.170> you<00:04:05.830> do<00:04:05.950> 3d

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
whispering 3d and the way you you do 3d

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.100 
whispering 3d and the way you you do 3d
it's<00:04:06.370> like<00:04:06.610> you<00:04:06.760> render<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.270> left<00:04:07.570> and<00:04:08.050> the

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
it's like you render the left and the

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.540 
it's like you render the left and the
right<00:04:08.170> I<00:04:08.380> so<00:04:08.740> it<00:04:08.860> means<00:04:09.010> you<00:04:09.160> have<00:04:09.250> to<00:04:09.310> weather

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
right I so it means you have to weather

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.760 
right I so it means you have to weather
the<00:04:09.730> spring<00:04:09.970> twice<00:04:10.240> ok<00:04:10.660> so<00:04:11.200> split<00:04:11.470> screen<00:04:11.680> is

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
the spring twice ok so split screen is

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.840 
the spring twice ok so split screen is
the<00:04:11.890> same<00:04:12.070> thing<00:04:12.100> you<00:04:12.370> have<00:04:12.490> to<00:04:12.550> render<00:04:12.760> the

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
the same thing you have to render the

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.640 
the same thing you have to render the
sprint<00:04:13.180> right<00:04:13.330> so<00:04:13.630> by<00:04:13.810> doing<00:04:13.870> 3d<00:04:14.290> we've<00:04:14.530> got

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
sprint right so by doing 3d we've got

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.960 
sprint right so by doing 3d we've got
split<00:04:14.890> screen<00:04:15.100> or<00:04:15.310> by<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.490> split<00:04:15.850> screen

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
split screen or by the split screen

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.110 
split screen or by the split screen
without<00:04:16.210> 3d<00:04:16.510> so<00:04:17.200> it<00:04:17.920> was<00:04:18.130> like<00:04:18.310> a<00:04:18.610> win-win<00:04:18.910> for
