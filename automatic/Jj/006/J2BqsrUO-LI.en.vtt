that's been drilled out and plugged with

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.180 
that's been drilled out and plugged with
cork<00:00:36.329> now<00:00:36.630> I'm<00:00:36.989> not<00:00:37.290> looking<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.590> get<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> bait

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
cork now I'm not looking to get the bait

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.700 
cork now I'm not looking to get the bait
critically<00:00:38.700> balanced<00:00:39.120> all<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.390> want<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.290> do<00:00:40.469> is

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
critically balanced all I want to do is

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.350 
critically balanced all I want to do is
to<00:00:41.070> simply<00:00:41.370> take<00:00:41.610> out<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.850> weight<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.300> that

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
to simply take out the weight of that

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.790 
to simply take out the weight of that
hook<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.600> make<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.989> out<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> freebie<00:00:44.450> then

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
hook and make it out like a freebie then

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.900 
hook and make it out like a freebie then
you'll<00:00:46.800> notice<00:00:47.010> there's<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.399> little<00:00:47.550> bit<00:00:47.789> of

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
you'll notice there's a little bit of

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.000 
you'll notice there's a little bit of
peeled<00:00:48.570> back<00:00:48.840> coating<00:00:49.289> just<00:00:49.500> below<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> bait

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
peeled back coating just below the bait

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.340 
peeled back coating just below the bait
perhaps<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.399> centimeter<00:00:50.879> or<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.090> before<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:52.199> hit

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
perhaps a centimeter or so before we hit

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.010 
perhaps a centimeter or so before we hit
the<00:00:52.410> rig<00:00:53.010> ring<00:00:53.219> now<00:00:53.789> below<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.270> rig<00:00:54.420> ring<00:00:54.660> is

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the rig ring now below the rig ring is

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.420 
the rig ring now below the rig ring is
coated<00:00:56.300> now<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.510> helps<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.530> ring<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.920> reset

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
coated now this helps that ring to reset

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.189 
coated now this helps that ring to reset
itself<00:00:59.730> if<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.090> ejected<00:01:00.210> by<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> fish<00:01:01.020> or

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
itself if it's ejected by a fish or

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.020 
itself if it's ejected by a fish or
blown<00:01:01.440> about<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.890> ring<00:01:02.100> can't<00:01:02.460> end<00:01:02.699> up<00:01:02.850> down

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
blown about the ring can't end up down

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.579 
blown about the ring can't end up down
by<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.270> knot<00:01:03.510> let's<00:01:03.660> not<00:01:03.840> can't<00:01:04.080> become<00:01:04.320> stuck

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
by the knot let's not can't become stuck

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.410 
by the knot let's not can't become stuck
or<00:01:04.769> whatever<00:01:05.010> it's<00:01:05.519> always<00:01:06.000> positioned

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
or whatever it's always positioned

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.940 
or whatever it's always positioned
exactly<00:01:06.900> where<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.320> want<00:01:07.560> it

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
exactly where I want it

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.270 
exactly where I want it
now<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:09.210> resetting<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.020> because<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.590> coated

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
now that resetting is because the coated

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.710 
now that resetting is because the coated
section<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> little<00:01:11.939> bit<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.180> stiffness<00:01:12.570> to

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
section is a little bit of stiffness to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.210 
section is a little bit of stiffness to
it<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.140> it'll<00:01:13.290> always<00:01:13.380> spring<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> ring<00:01:14.010> back

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
it so it'll always spring the ring back

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.580 
it so it'll always spring the ring back
into<00:01:14.430> position

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
into position

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.410 
into position
moving<00:01:16.590> down<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.860> link<00:01:17.220> you'll<00:01:18.060> see<00:01:18.150> that

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
moving down the link you'll see that

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.730 
moving down the link you'll see that
it's<00:01:18.570> completely<00:01:18.720> coated<00:01:19.259> from<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> eye

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
it's completely coated from the eye

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.429 
it's completely coated from the eye
right<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.400> way<00:01:20.490> down<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> lead<00:01:21.290> now<00:01:22.290> what

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
right the way down to the lead now what

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.679 
right the way down to the lead now what
that<00:01:22.470> does<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:23.490> creates<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.880> nice<00:01:24.090> little<00:01:24.330> angle

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
that does it creates a nice little angle

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.810 
that does it creates a nice little angle
coming<00:01:24.869> out<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> hook<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.520> flips<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.640> hook

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
coming out the hook I flips that hook

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.969 
coming out the hook I flips that hook
round<00:01:27.060> let<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.049> take<00:01:28.200> hold<00:01:28.439> exactly<00:01:28.590> where<00:01:28.950> I

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
round let it take hold exactly where I

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.190 
round let it take hold exactly where I
want<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.450> there's<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> couple<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.840> blobs<00:01:31.049> of

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
want it there's a couple of blobs of

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.200 
want it there's a couple of blobs of
putty<00:01:31.460> as<00:01:32.460> we<00:01:32.610> move<00:01:32.759> down

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
putty as we move down

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.350 
putty as we move down
I<00:01:33.470> like<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.770> pins<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.880> hook<00:01:36.030> link<00:01:36.150> down

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
I like that just pins the hook link down

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.030 
I like that just pins the hook link down
nice<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.600> flat<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.259> out<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.590> way<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.860> feeding

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
nice and flat is out the way of feeding

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.399 
nice and flat is out the way of feeding
fish<00:01:38.430> okay<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.479> you'll<00:01:39.689> notice<00:01:39.869> at<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.200> end

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
fish okay so you'll notice at this end

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.200 
fish okay so you'll notice at this end
of<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.560> link<00:01:40.740> there's<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.549> doubled<00:01:41.850> over<00:01:42.030> loop

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
of the link there's a doubled over loop

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.850 
of the link there's a doubled over loop
which<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.780> helps<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.079> kick<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.590> hook<00:01:43.710> link

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
which just helps to kick the hook link

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.370 
which just helps to kick the hook link
