finally<00:00:01.050> I<00:00:01.079> want<00:00:01.260> to<00:00:01.319> talk<00:00:01.500> about<00:00:01.650> the<00:00:02.129> left

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
finally I want to talk about the left

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.809 
finally I want to talk about the left
main<00:00:03.300> coronary<00:00:03.689> artery<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.770> led<00:00:05.640> in<00:00:05.759> the

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
main coronary artery and the led in the

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.330 
main coronary artery and the led in the
circumflex<00:00:06.240> artery<00:00:06.960> so<00:00:07.589> left<00:00:07.830> main<00:00:07.980> coronary

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
circumflex artery so left main coronary

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.120 
circumflex artery so left main coronary
artery<00:00:08.670> as<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:08.880> talked<00:00:09.150> about<00:00:09.300> before<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:10.679> very

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
artery as I talked about before is very

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.009 
artery as I talked about before is very
short<00:00:11.849> vessel<00:00:12.269> we<00:00:12.360> don't<00:00:12.540> see<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.870> here

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
short vessel we don't see it here

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.660 
short vessel we don't see it here
actually<00:00:13.259> but<00:00:13.910> it<00:00:14.910> very<00:00:15.420> rapidly<00:00:16.670> bifurcates

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
actually but it very rapidly bifurcates

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.310 
actually but it very rapidly bifurcates
into<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.420> left<00:00:18.779> anterior<00:00:18.990> descending

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
into the left anterior descending

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.929 
into the left anterior descending
coronary<00:00:20.130> artery<00:00:20.520> or<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.760> led<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
coronary artery or the led and the

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.660 
coronary artery or the led and the
circumflex<00:00:23.939> artery<00:00:24.510> which<00:00:25.130> travels<00:00:26.130> along<00:00:26.340> AV

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
circumflex artery which travels along AV

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.849 
circumflex artery which travels along AV
Sophos<00:00:27.210> on<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.480> left<00:00:27.660> hand<00:00:27.900> side<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.560> let's

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
Sophos on the left hand side so let's

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.380 
Sophos on the left hand side so let's
look<00:00:28.980> at<00:00:29.130> these<00:00:29.279> two<00:00:29.340> vessels<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:30.150> particular

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
look at these two vessels in particular

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.959 
look at these two vessels in particular
so<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.769> left<00:00:31.949> entry<00:00:32.250> descending<00:00:32.669> coronary

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
so the left entry descending coronary

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.459 
so the left entry descending coronary
artery<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.450> that's<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.870> finger<00:00:34.110> pointing

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
artery that that's the finger pointing

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.510 
artery that that's the finger pointing
out<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.590> here<00:00:34.950> that's<00:00:35.280> traveled<00:00:36.059> along<00:00:36.270> here

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
out of here that's traveled along here

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.090 
out of here that's traveled along here
it<00:00:38.520> supplies<00:00:39.030> blood<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.750> anterior<00:00:40.440> septal

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
it supplies blood to the anterior septal

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.940 
it supplies blood to the anterior septal
left<00:00:41.520> ventricle<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.510> septal<00:00:43.320> referring<00:00:43.829> to

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
left ventricle this septal referring to

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.010 
left ventricle this septal referring to
the<00:00:44.100> intraventricular<00:00:44.700> septum<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.690> divides

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the intraventricular septum that divides

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.560 
the intraventricular septum that divides
the<00:00:46.320> right<00:00:46.550> ventricle<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.910> central<00:00:48.329> part

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
the right ventricle so that central part

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.150 
the right ventricle so that central part
in<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.870> inferior<00:00:49.289> surface<00:00:49.440> left<00:00:49.770> ventricle

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
in the inferior surface left ventricle

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.090 
in the inferior surface left ventricle
and<00:00:50.520> occlusion<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.270> led<00:00:51.690> results<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.829> an

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
and occlusion the led results in in an

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.689 
and occlusion the led results in in an
anterior<00:00:53.699> wall<00:00:54.059> MI<00:00:54.510> or<00:00:54.840> an<00:00:55.590> anterior<00:00:56.070> septal

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
anterior wall MI or an anterior septal

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.349 
anterior wall MI or an anterior septal
wall<00:00:57.180> MI<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.670> that<00:00:59.670> would<00:00:59.820> just<00:00:59.850> depend<00:01:00.210> on

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
wall MI and that would just depend on

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.569 
wall MI and that would just depend on
how<00:01:00.629> proximal<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.469> occlusion<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
how proximal the occlusion is the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.789 
how proximal the occlusion is the
circumflex<00:01:03.030> artery<00:01:03.539> as<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.690> mentioned<00:01:04.049> travels

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
circumflex artery as I mentioned travels

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.679 
circumflex artery as I mentioned travels
along<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.339> atrial<00:01:05.909> ventricular<00:01:05.970> sulcus

recall<00:01:15.090> from<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:16.049> slide<00:01:16.409> presentation

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
recall from the slide presentation

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.910 
recall from the slide presentation
before<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:18.540> indicated<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
before this that I indicated that the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.950 
before this that I indicated that the
right<00:01:20.280> coronary<00:01:20.580> artery<00:01:20.880> supplies<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
right coronary artery supplies the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.950 
right coronary artery supplies the
inferior<00:01:22.530> wall<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.100> left<00:01:23.310> ventricle<00:01:23.960> most

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
inferior wall of the left ventricle most

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.100 
inferior wall of the left ventricle most
humans<00:01:25.530> but<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.460> small<00:01:26.759> percentage<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
humans but in a small percentage of the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.350 
humans but in a small percentage of the
population<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.829> circumflex<00:01:29.360> artery

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
population the circumflex artery

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.910 
population the circumflex artery
supplies<00:01:30.810> inferior<00:01:31.409> wall<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.799> left

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
supplies inferior wall of the left

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.630 
supplies inferior wall of the left
ventricle<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.420> when<00:01:33.990> when<00:01:34.860> patients<00:01:35.520> are

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
ventricle and so when when patients are

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.700 
ventricle and so when when patients are
left<00:01:35.939> dominant<00:01:36.600> or<00:01:36.750> said<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:36.990> be<00:01:37.140> left<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.530> it

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
left dominant or said to be left on it

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.100 
left dominant or said to be left on it
meaning<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.100> circumflex<00:01:38.900> feeds<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
meaning the circumflex feeds the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.800 
meaning the circumflex feeds the
inferior<00:01:40.470> wall<00:01:40.979> mi<00:01:41.150> what<00:01:42.150> you'll<00:01:42.329> see<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.689> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
inferior wall mi what you'll see on the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.800 
inferior wall mi what you'll see on the
cardiogram<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.799> an<00:01:44.009> inferior<00:01:44.520> latter<00:01:44.909> wall<00:01:45.299> mi

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
cardiogram is an inferior latter wall mi

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.170 
cardiogram is an inferior latter wall mi
again<00:01:46.470> because<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.369> inferior<00:01:47.759> wall<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.000> that

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
again because the inferior wall is that

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.810 
again because the inferior wall is that
the<00:01:48.299> circumflex<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.140> obviously<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.220> too<00:01:50.280> is

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
the circumflex and obviously so too is

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.460 
the circumflex and obviously so too is
the<00:01:51.229> lateral<00:01:52.229> left<00:01:53.009> ventricle<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.320> we'll<00:01:55.320> see

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
the lateral left ventricle so we'll see

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.889 
the lateral left ventricle so we'll see
that<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:56.060> small<00:01:57.060> percentage<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
that in a small percentage of the

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.020 
that in a small percentage of the
population<00:01:58.939> so<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.299> summary<00:02:00.780> then<00:02:00.990> from

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
population so in summary then from
