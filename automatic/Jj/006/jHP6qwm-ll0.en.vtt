00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.569
 but average as they are hungry I hope that 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.570
 well to the southeast with this face 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.000
 washed and stable I bring you a video in 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.610
 where I want to show you how you 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.220
 They can cleanse their face deeply 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.489
 removing his black spots so so 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.529
 filters that do not come out in our skin and 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:25.829
 so good for this like exfoliating 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.319
 first with this olive oil 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:31.019
 with sugar 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:33.000
 as I showed you in the secret video 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.379
 above but you can use the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.600
 exfoliant that you want but 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:40.019
 I really recommend this to you 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.350
 I hope you like it and we are going to 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.350
 start 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.330
 we are going to be using some bug 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.600
 and we're also going to use a pair of tweezers 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.940
 with which we depilate this we 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.730
 will help to remove those black dots 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.410
 we are also going to use sugar on 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.590
 olive oil a container 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:10.229
 to mix it 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.229
 also an exfoliant for lips 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.810
 alcohol to disinfect our pieces 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.149
 and also a dining bag I do not have in 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.549
 this case looks like the clamp and brings 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.830
 little things on the sides of the sides 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.400
 to remove pimples and pimples and what 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:34.350
 we are disinfecting with alcohol 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.350
 hot water a vaporizer 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.200
 and what to close the pores 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.130
 and we started to issue all of our 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.490
 face on three of its sides where more 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.600
 we get these impurities all these 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.070
 black dots this in the area of 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.490
 nose of the forehead 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:01.479
 you know of you better be with 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.789
 you see that they have and many others 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.270
 they have many black spots there is where 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.280
 they will try to exfoliate well with 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.690
 Careful also because there are skins that 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.970
 are sensitive so with careful and 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.720
 let's seize shipped to the lips 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.430
 they were no more than we do this and 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.030
 remember that this is something that I 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.520
 I learned studying 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.470
 and now let's wash it well with water 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.470
 warm to remove everything 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.210
 and we're going to start opening the pores 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:40.170
 boil the water but if you have a 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.690
 vaporizer you do it with that and then 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.750
 good so that steam does not escape me 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:51.060
 I put a towel like that the thing since 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:53.220
 let's open up well pore wind and we 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.920
 makes skin like sweat as something 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.320
 it has to be well wide open of 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.620
 the pores where we're going to get all those 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.750
 impurities and then the beauty in tow and 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.970
 it burns a little bit to receive the doctor like this 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:11.630
 hot but you will give it according to 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.630
 you feel your skin sorry ok 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.270
 We are going to prepare ourselves with our 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.720
 tongs our cotton and of course 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:26.670
 our alcohol because we're going to start 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:29.340
 remove all your unwanted points and then 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.209
 good hands we will have 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.540
 Extremely clean to be able to touch 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.640
 our skin and so good can be given 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.180
 mind I have a few thorns 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.450
 around and then we will be 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.030
 is taking out all those impurities 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.740
 it's a bit difficult to be recording and 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.320
 doing this girls 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.580
 and good with the cottons we are going to 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.680
 start to press on our nose 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:03.040
 as in all areas where 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.100
 find those dots then it comes out as 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.610
 a white greasy something like that I love you 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.520
 comment that I'm clean my 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.040
 face once a week deeply 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.989
 but now leave fifteen days to be able 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.330
 undo this video and that you can 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:23.770
 really see all the impurities that 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:26.860
 there is maybe if you see a little bit the 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.290
 disgusting so to speak but then I 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.920
 I wanted to show you in a video 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:35.320
 just as the skin really is like 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.830
 everything that comes out as we owe it to 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.200
 do so a thousand apologies for that 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.180
 We were going to take it out with the clamp because 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.380
 they are like kind of hairs all those 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:50.210
 points are like little hairs like that since 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.520
 we are going to take them out 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.009
 and well, if we 're going to be like 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.129
 gutting the areas so that 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.889
 come out all that impurity 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.900
 this 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.479
 as I said with my hands well 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.069
 clean and we help with the clamp 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.069
 to get it out 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:13.649
 as you can see there then that is 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:16.789
 coming out I recommend this 

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:20.039
 procedure once a week as 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:22.139
 minimum and little by little they will see that it 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.539
 they will be reducing all these 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:27.029
 black dots does not mean that you do not 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:29.369
 come back out but good if you're going to 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:32.309
 help a lot to have more skin 

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:35.399
 clear as you can see here I have some 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:38.999
 pimples and then I will be 

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:42.389
 taking out with the cotton and then also 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:45.680
 with the help of the tweezers and remember 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:48.050
 always go disinfecting with alcohol 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.539
 and this 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:55.789
 this is like who says the procedure 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:59.300
 so deep of a facial and with a this 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:02.750
 cotton with alcohol let's go putting 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:05.419
 over those sweeps of those areas 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.780
 where we were is taking out the 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:10.780
 impurities to leave 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.780
 disinfecting 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:21.419
 and then when I recommend you have 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.580
 at hand a mirror of its magnifying 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:26.089
 I do not have but that will help them 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.089
 much 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.919
 and well, since we did all that 

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:38.259
 let's start to close the pores the 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:40.330
 boiling water the steam is that helps us 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:42.969
 to open them and now we are going to close them 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:46.060
 because if we leave them open we are 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:50.259
 they mess up again or they go back to 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:51.909
 fill those holes with those spaces and 

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:54.969
 the ice is the one that will help us 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:59.620
 not only to refresh but also to 

00:06:54.969 --> 00:07:03.969
 close all those pores so let's 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:07.629
 go rubbing them all over our skin and 

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:10.930
 let's feel this very rich and the skin 

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:13.449
 How else do I know how to explain them 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:17.379
 you're going to feel when they do 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:20.590
 and then we're going to dry all of that 

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:24.960
 ice water 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.960
 little by little our uncut face 

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:31.489
 and well then finally in this 

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:34.029
 our homemade facial we are going to put 

00:07:31.489 --> 00:07:36.799
 our moisturizer that is 

00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:38.899
 moisturizer and try not to put on makeup 

00:07:36.799 --> 00:07:42.199
 us this day better if we do it for the 

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:44.839
 just late to breathe our 

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:47.899
 cutis so the hundred we give thanks 

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:50.919
 to see I hope it helps them in something that 

00:07:47.899 --> 00:07:54.529
 do it and any questions or comments 

00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:57.199
 leave it at the bottom and I'll 

00:07:54.529 --> 00:08:00.499
 I will be responding and it has been a pleasure 

00:07:57.199 --> 00:08:03.319
 can you give this little secret my little trick 

00:08:00.499 --> 00:08:05.749
 of beauty to clean and remove these 

00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:09.249
 black points I love you so much god 

00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:09.249
