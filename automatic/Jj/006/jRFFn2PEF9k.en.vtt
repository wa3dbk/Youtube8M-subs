think that most curvy women would

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.940 
think that most curvy women would
probably<00:02:08.060> agree<00:02:08.270> is<00:02:08.810> with<00:02:09.410> kind<00:02:09.800> of<00:02:09.830> the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
probably agree is with kind of the

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.300 
probably agree is with kind of the
top-heavy<00:02:10.540> area<00:02:11.540> yeah<00:02:11.810> so<00:02:12.470> how<00:02:12.740> do<00:02:12.800> you<00:02:13.010> cater

top-heavy area yeah so how do you cater

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.280 
top-heavy area yeah so how do you cater
to<00:02:13.610> that<00:02:13.640> because<00:02:14.330> that<00:02:14.510> kind<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:14.840> just<00:02:15.050> comes

personally I just had a baby so you know
getting<00:03:04.970> down<00:03:05.239> in<00:03:05.510> those<00:03:05.630> crazy<00:03:05.989> shapes<00:03:06.410> and

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
getting down in those crazy shapes and

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.440 
getting down in those crazy shapes and
stuff<00:03:06.800> I'm<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:07.220> little<00:03:07.610> uncomfortable<00:03:07.880> with<00:03:08.239> my

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
stuff I'm a little uncomfortable with my

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.330 
stuff I'm a little uncomfortable with my
stomach<00:03:08.870> so<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.320> baby<00:03:09.500> doll<00:03:09.680> allows<00:03:10.010> you<00:03:10.220> to

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
stomach so the baby doll allows you to

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.949 
stomach so the baby doll allows you to
have<00:03:10.459> that<00:03:10.640> flexibility<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.300> where<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:11.780> can

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
have that flexibility to where you can

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.240 
have that flexibility to where you can
adjust<00:03:12.320> and<00:03:12.470> make<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:12.769> a<00:03:12.800> little<00:03:12.920> bit<00:03:13.040> tighter

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
adjust and make it a little bit tighter

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.009 
adjust and make it a little bit tighter
when<00:03:13.580> you're<00:03:13.700> doing<00:03:13.940> those<00:03:14.060> moves<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:14.570> also

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
when you're doing those moves and also

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.630 
when you're doing those moves and also
it<00:03:15.380> just<00:03:15.410> makes<00:03:15.709> you<00:03:15.830> feel<00:03:15.890> comfortable<00:03:16.220> in

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
it just makes you feel comfortable in

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.000 
it just makes you feel comfortable in

about me Capri it's like this base tank
this<00:04:22.850> provides<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.510> ability<00:04:23.540> for<00:04:24.050> us<00:04:24.200> to<00:04:24.230> be

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
this provides the ability for us to be

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.760 
this provides the ability for us to be
able<00:04:24.620> to<00:04:25.540> incorporate<00:04:26.540> like<00:04:26.900> a<00:04:26.930> shorter<00:04:27.470> pant

in this pottery the things that you're

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.610 
in this pottery the things that you're
using<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.750> construction<00:04:39.140> of<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:39.320> actual

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
using the construction of the actual

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.800 
using the construction of the actual
material<00:04:40.070> we're<00:04:40.850> seeing<00:04:41.120> kind<00:04:41.360> of<00:04:41.450> kind<00:04:41.780> of

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
material we're seeing kind of kind of

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.540 
material we're seeing kind of kind of
compression<00:04:42.260> and<00:04:42.650> you<00:04:42.800> know<00:04:42.919> but<00:04:43.370> it's

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
compression and you know but it's

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.310 
compression and you know but it's
comfortable<00:04:44.240> comfort<00:04:44.660> actually<00:04:44.960> it's<00:04:45.140> not

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
comfortable comfort actually it's not

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.200 
comfortable comfort actually it's not
crazy<00:04:45.640> compression<00:04:46.640> to<00:04:46.790> where<00:04:46.910> you<00:04:46.970> can't

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
crazy compression to where you can't

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.659
