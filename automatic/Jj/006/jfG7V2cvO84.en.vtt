00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.840
 because you record the topic in the performance levels relatively simple photographic 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.269
 you can easily like six months 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.329
 so the thing even the simplified jam four power levels 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:17.099
 at the first measurement stage which simply ensures different percentage in this 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.210
 or no one can be keen on than 30 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.050
 the second direction Schurter 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.280
 there we have the 95 octane version 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.250
 and Thomas was reasonably priced they were only sparsely traveling long ago 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.140
 So that we live only with serial production 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.170
 the second performance level 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.780
 Nat 98 octane commercial fuel 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.070
 there we are at x 4 Corp 320 hp 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.250
 the smoker who oaks for the normal consumer 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.920
 by now we are even the fourth power level 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.020
 can use 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.969
 the filter power level is called 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.969
 currently driving with 182 worker stuff 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.810
 what allows me by the modified version with the fuel pump 385 hp 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.860
 the bodywork were 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.760
 how the whole thing works 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.760
 if you set the same time to look 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.320
 «We want the Thuringian Rhön 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.300
 therefore failure is building up 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.860
 These are somehow pressed until the engine electronics light begins 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.840
 flash 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.370
 they stayed five times each 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.320
 in this case, five times a May 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.500
 We continue to hold the cash register 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.500
 after that she brings twice five times 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.230
 while that pressed over, they stayed five times three times 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.500
 and now 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.500
 five times four times then let go 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.579
 Now we have a position for level 4 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.579
 we do not just open up once 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.520
 if you would just start a new company 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.829
 like the engines the new settings just warm air 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.089
 and we see a successful play suggesting 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:15.759
 that he updates now 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:27.819
 so worried 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.749
 now he wants to look at performance level many riders at Turner we create 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:34.749
 the first time in a while 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:40.709
 a problem and normal 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.889
 that's the way to study it 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.269
 you have to say that recently this would not have been possible 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:52.529
 I tried out with a hundred faucet like Power Shell Fuels 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:56.029
 there it was not possible to handle himself says screws 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.349
 but since about two octaves fuel types are possible as me 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.310
 get the last one out of the Rosso that's the racing version that's the one 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.049
 Performance level 4 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.289
 think that's enough for this first time
