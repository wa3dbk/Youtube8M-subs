00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
cific hole in the bottom of the 5d mark

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.679 
cific hole in the bottom of the 5d mark
two<00:02:20.860> again<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:21.980> had<00:02:22.189> a<00:02:22.220> seven<00:02:22.700> deflate<00:02:23.180> but<00:02:23.569> I'm

two again I had a seven deflate but I'm

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.300 
two again I had a seven deflate but I'm
not<00:02:23.870> using<00:02:24.049> that<00:02:24.200> because<00:02:24.530> i<00:02:24.620> don't<00:02:24.799> have<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:24.980> 70

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
not using that because i don't have a 70

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.920 
not using that because i don't have a 70
and<00:02:25.959> this<00:02:26.959> is<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.829> tightener<00:02:28.310> for<00:02:28.849> to<00:02:29.299> lock

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
and this is the tightener for to lock

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.140 
and this is the tightener for to lock
the<00:02:30.170> viewfinder<00:02:30.739> in<00:02:30.890> which<00:02:31.099> goes<00:02:31.370> in<00:02:31.640> that

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
the viewfinder in which goes in that

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.740 
the viewfinder in which goes in that
slot<00:02:32.540> it's<00:02:32.900> going<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.200> match<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:35.360> big<00:02:35.540> red

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
slot it's going to match the big red

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.630 
slot it's going to match the big red
plate<00:02:36.170> goes<00:02:36.470> in<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.769> slot<00:02:37.069> so<00:02:37.340> it's<00:02:37.459> going<00:02:37.579> to

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
plate goes in the slot so it's going to

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.440 
plate goes in the slot so it's going to
go<00:02:37.790> in<00:02:37.970> like<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:39.700> I've<00:02:40.700> got<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.090> thing<00:02:41.269> too

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
go in like that I've got the thing too

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.690 
go in like that I've got the thing too
tight<00:02:41.780> so<00:02:42.019> it<00:02:42.170> couldn't<00:02:42.590> go<00:02:42.680> in<00:02:42.799> but<00:02:43.159> so<00:02:43.640> you

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
tight so it couldn't go in but so you

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.899 
tight so it couldn't go in but so you
take<00:02:44.390> your<00:02:44.569> camera<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:46.280> mount<00:02:46.519> it<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.730> the

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
bottom of the camera just like you

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.399 
bottom of the camera just like you
normally<00:02:48.709> would<00:02:49.010> any<00:02:49.400> plate<00:02:50.180> it's<00:02:50.510> got<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.260> nice

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409

pretty easily and you simply take your

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.009 
pretty easily and you simply take your
pro<00:02:56.480> finder<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:58.359> put<00:02:59.359> it<00:02:59.450> right<00:02:59.480> in<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.900> slot

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
pro finder and put it right in the slot

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.920 
pro finder and put it right in the slot
and<00:03:01.569> then<00:03:02.569> you<00:03:02.810> twist<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.769> screw<00:03:04.069> to<00:03:04.099> tighten

let me to the camera back on you can see

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.159 
let me to the camera back on you can see
down<00:04:43.330> through<00:04:43.990> there<00:04:45.419> you<00:04:46.419> should<00:04:46.630> be<00:04:46.780> able<00:04:46.900> to

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
down through there you should be able to

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.689 
down through there you should be able to
see<00:04:47.380> of<00:04:47.650> course<00:04:47.889> I'm<00:04:48.039> doing<00:04:48.340> it<00:04:48.430> sideways<00:04:50.699> okay

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
see of course I'm doing it sideways okay

see of course I'm doing it sideways okay
so<00:04:52.539> a<00:04:52.569> couple<00:04:52.960> of<00:04:53.110> different<00:04:53.500> features<00:04:53.860> the

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
so a couple of different features the

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.430 
so a couple of different features the
eyecup<00:04:54.759> is<00:04:54.970> very<00:04:55.180> large<00:04:55.449> like<00:04:55.780> I<00:04:55.930> mentioned

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
eyecup is very large like I mentioned

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.760 
eyecup is very large like I mentioned
before<00:04:57.000> it<00:04:58.000> does<00:04:58.270> swivel<00:04:58.720> although<00:04:59.259> it's<00:04:59.440> it's

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
before it does swivel although it's it's

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.920 
before it does swivel although it's it's
kind<00:05:00.220> of<00:05:00.310> difficult<00:05:00.610> to<00:05:00.970> move<00:05:01.240> it's<00:05:01.479> not<00:05:01.660> a

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
kind of difficult to move it's not a

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.230 
kind of difficult to move it's not a
simple<00:05:02.620> thing<00:05:02.800> to<00:05:03.009> change<00:05:03.430> it<00:05:03.580> from<00:05:03.729> side<00:05:04.000> to

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
simple thing to change it from side to

focus what you're seeing through there

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.230 
focus what you're seeing through there
and<00:05:16.500> you<00:05:17.500> do<00:05:17.710> have<00:05:17.860> access<00:05:18.130> to<00:05:18.669> all<00:05:18.699> of<00:05:19.120> the

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
and you do have access to all of the

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
buttons on the sides of the camera it is

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.999 
buttons on the sides of the camera it is
a<00:05:21.220> wide<00:05:21.639> unit<00:05:22.210> it's<00:05:22.479> not<00:05:22.750> it's<00:05:23.289> a<00:05:23.440> bit<00:05:23.680> wider

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:24.009 
a wide unit it's not it's a bit wider

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:26.490 
a wide unit it's not it's a bit wider
because<00:05:24.370> of<00:05:24.759> the<00:05:24.880> mirror<00:05:25.349> functionality<00:05:26.349> that

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
because of the mirror functionality that

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.480 
because of the mirror functionality that
you<00:05:26.560> have<00:05:26.889> on<00:05:27.130> the<00:05:27.250> inside<00:05:30.599> but<00:05:31.599> it's<00:05:31.900> it's

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
you have on the inside but it's it's

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.730 
you have on the inside but it's it's
still<00:05:33.509> narrow<00:05:34.509> enough<00:05:34.840> that<00:05:35.050> you<00:05:35.169> have<00:05:35.320> access

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
still narrow enough that you have access

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.089 
still narrow enough that you have access
to<00:05:35.770> all<00:05:35.919> of<00:05:36.190> the<00:05:36.340> buttons<00:05:37.349> it's<00:05:38.349> quite<00:05:38.740> sturdy

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
to all of the buttons it's quite sturdy

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:43.830 
to all of the buttons it's quite sturdy
I<00:05:39.310> think<00:05:39.699> it<00:05:40.449> should<00:05:40.930> have<00:05:42.210> its<00:05:43.210> it's<00:05:43.630> not

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
I think it should have its it's not

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.640 
I think it should have its it's not
plastic<00:05:44.169> this<00:05:44.710> is<00:05:44.889> a<00:05:44.919> metal<00:05:45.580> case<00:05:46.210> it<00:05:46.599> is<00:05:46.719> seems

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
plastic this is a metal case it is seems

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.499 
plastic this is a metal case it is seems
to<00:05:47.830> be<00:05:47.919> very<00:05:47.949> sturdy<00:05:48.580> well<00:05:49.060> manufactured

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:51.509 
to be very sturdy well manufactured

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:54.270 
to be very sturdy well manufactured
probably<00:05:52.509> will<00:05:52.690> be<00:05:52.840> a<00:05:52.870> dust<00:05:53.380> magnet<00:05:53.680> with<00:05:54.099> that

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
probably will be a dust magnet with that

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.870 
probably will be a dust magnet with that
extra<00:05:54.550> mirror<00:05:54.940> in<00:05:55.210> there<00:05:55.860> you<00:05:56.860> will<00:05:57.009> probably

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
extra mirror in there you will probably

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.550 
extra mirror in there you will probably
can<00:05:58.180> see<00:05:58.419> might<00:05:58.719> be<00:05:58.930> able<00:05:58.990> to<00:05:59.110> see<00:05:59.320> that<00:05:59.469> I've

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
can see might be able to see that I've

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.689 
can see might be able to see that I've
got<00:05:59.590> a<00:05:59.740> little<00:05:59.919> bit<00:06:00.099> of<00:06:00.190> dust<00:06:00.370> in<00:06:00.520> there

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:00.699 
got a little bit of dust in there

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.740 
got a little bit of dust in there
already<00:06:01.380> but<00:06:02.380> a<00:06:02.440> quick<00:06:02.710> swipe<00:06:03.099> of<00:06:03.400> a<00:06:03.580> brush<00:06:04.389> or

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
already but a quick swipe of a brush or

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.459 
already but a quick swipe of a brush or
a<00:06:04.780> blower<00:06:05.110> should<00:06:05.500> take<00:06:05.710> care<00:06:05.919> of<00:06:05.979> that<00:06:06.069> and

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:07.469 
a blower should take care of that and

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:10.170 
a blower should take care of that and
you<00:06:08.469> know<00:06:08.560> the<00:06:08.680> mounting<00:06:09.039> screws<00:06:09.400> seem<00:06:09.940> to<00:06:10.060> be

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
you know the mounting screws seem to be

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.080 
you know the mounting screws seem to be
pretty<00:06:10.389> good<00:06:11.009> construction<00:06:12.009> seems<00:06:12.460> pretty

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
pretty good construction seems pretty

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.909 
pretty good construction seems pretty
firm<00:06:13.740> it's<00:06:14.740> not<00:06:14.889> plastic<00:06:15.430> feeling<00:06:16.270> or<00:06:16.919> feeling

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
firm it's not plastic feeling or feeling

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:23.070 
firm it's not plastic feeling or feeling
like<00:06:18.310> it's<00:06:18.490> going<00:06:18.639> to<00:06:18.669> be<00:06:18.819> easily<00:06:19.389> damaged<00:06:22.080> so

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
like it's going to be easily damaged so

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.550 
like it's going to be easily damaged so
there<00:06:23.289> you<00:06:23.409> go

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.730 

I<00:06:27.419> discovered<00:06:28.419> another<00:06:28.600> cool<00:06:29.110> function<00:06:29.620> of

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
I discovered another cool function of

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.270 
I discovered another cool function of
the<00:06:29.830> pro<00:06:30.010> viewfinder<00:06:30.610> the<00:06:30.820> loop<00:06:32.040> portion<00:06:33.040> can

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
the pro viewfinder the loop portion can

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.090 
the pro viewfinder the loop portion can
be<00:06:33.340> removed<00:06:33.900> so<00:06:34.900> that<00:06:34.930> you<00:06:35.169> can<00:06:35.350> use<00:06:35.590> this<00:06:35.860> you

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 
be removed so that you can use this you

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.570 
be removed so that you can use this you
just<00:06:36.430> a<00:06:36.580> little<00:06:36.790> wiggle<00:06:37.169> it<00:06:38.169> will<00:06:38.500> snap<00:06:39.340> right

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
just a little wiggle it will snap right

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.000 
just a little wiggle it will snap right
off<00:06:39.639> it<00:06:40.210> has<00:06:40.419> two<00:06:40.870> attachment<00:06:41.680> hooks<00:06:41.889> right

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
off it has two attachment hooks right

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.450 
off it has two attachment hooks right
there<00:06:42.400> just<00:06:42.730> goes<00:06:42.940> on<00:06:43.060> and<00:06:43.120> off<00:06:43.980> and<00:06:44.980> so<00:06:45.370> you

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
there just goes on and off and so you

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.800 
there just goes on and off and so you
can<00:06:45.700> actually<00:06:45.910> use<00:06:46.300> this<00:06:46.600> as<00:06:47.790> a<00:06:48.790> as<00:06:49.030> a<00:06:49.090> sunshade

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:49.810 
can actually use this as a as a sunshade

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.110 
can actually use this as a as a sunshade
for<00:06:50.550> outdoor<00:06:51.550> usage<00:06:52.120> if<00:06:52.450> you're<00:06:53.970> needing<00:06:54.970> that

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 
for outdoor usage if you're needing that

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.270 
for outdoor usage if you're needing that
kind<00:06:55.419> of<00:06:55.510> clump<00:06:55.720> ality<00:06:56.230> so<00:06:56.500> it's<00:06:56.650> got<00:06:56.800> that

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
kind of clump ality so it's got that

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.370 
kind of clump ality so it's got that
third<00:06:57.580> option<00:06:57.850> you<00:06:58.180> can<00:06:58.360> snap<00:06:58.870> it<00:06:58.900> right<00:06:59.050> in

00:06:59.370 --> 00:06:59.380 
third option you can snap it right in

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.070 
third option you can snap it right in
there<00:06:59.530> and<00:06:59.760> then<00:07:00.760> you<00:07:01.000> have<00:07:01.270> an<00:07:01.690> outdoor

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 
there and then you have an outdoor

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.000 
there and then you have an outdoor
sunshade<00:07:02.910> so<00:07:03.910> you<00:07:03.970> can<00:07:04.210> use<00:07:04.240> it<00:07:04.450> purely<00:07:05.110> like

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.010 
sunshade so you can use it purely like

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:11.490 
sunshade so you can use it purely like
that<00:07:07.860> so<00:07:08.860> that's<00:07:09.400> the<00:07:09.790> way<00:07:10.510> it<00:07:10.630> works<00:07:10.870> when<00:07:11.320> you

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:11.500 
that so that's the way it works when you

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.280 
that so that's the way it works when you
you<00:07:12.430> can<00:07:12.610> either<00:07:12.729> you<00:07:13.570> know<00:07:13.660> use<00:07:13.930> it<00:07:14.080> as<00:07:14.229> a

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:14.290 
you can either you know use it as a

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.670 
you can either you know use it as a
traditional<00:07:14.800> viewfinder<00:07:15.760> or<00:07:16.139> when<00:07:17.139> you<00:07:17.350> want

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 
traditional viewfinder or when you want

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.270 
traditional viewfinder or when you want
to<00:07:18.070> have<00:07:18.610> a<00:07:18.639> low<00:07:19.000> angle<00:07:19.270> shot<00:07:19.860> you<00:07:20.860> can<00:07:21.010> flip

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 
to have a low angle shot you can flip

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.469 
to have a low angle shot you can flip
this<00:07:21.460> up<00:07:21.700> and<00:07:23.550> it's<00:07:24.550> still<00:07:24.880> a<00:07:24.940> little<00:07:25.150> stiff

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:25.479 
this up and it's still a little stiff

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:28.950 
this up and it's still a little stiff
for<00:07:25.750> me<00:07:25.870> but<00:07:26.080> you<00:07:26.200> can<00:07:26.380> use<00:07:26.560> it<00:07:26.590> to<00:07:27.570> look<00:07:28.570> down

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 
for me but you can use it to look down

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.460 
for me but you can use it to look down
in<00:07:29.350> your<00:07:29.470> camera<00:07:29.919> and<00:07:30.360> see<00:07:31.360> what's<00:07:31.900> going<00:07:32.229> on

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:32.470 
in your camera and see what's going on

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.500 
in your camera and see what's going on
in<00:07:32.740> your<00:07:32.950> viewfinder<00:07:33.190> from<00:07:33.910> a<00:07:34.030> completely

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:34.510 
in your viewfinder from a completely

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.930 
in your viewfinder from a completely
different<00:07:34.600> angle
