00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.769
 yes hello here it is and I have today 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.330
 still class a consequence 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.369
 Specializations and today we want 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.970
 Give us a ground attack class 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.289
 watch or 2 ground attack classes and 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.550
 I'm just going to class 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.320
 Editor is currently my own 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.720
 games because I free not all 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.849
 switched in the private or in the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.840
 public game 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.009
 yes and I have the same already 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.800
 First class I already have it 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.610
 set as was primary for we have 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.210
 the pdw 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.309
 and that's because they are the ptb 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.500
 for me as a relatively strong weapon in the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.289
 ground attack has exposed because 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.180
 she also has a big magazine with 50 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.010
 shot and straight with one 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.140
 silencer we have on it too 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.410
 and the muffler we need 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.239
 also because yes are attacking the ground 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.789
 a lot of people on the way and if you are 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.250
 there is recognized so to speak on the map 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.660
 then five people bavaria on you 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.040
 on it and want to know you and that 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.960
 will eventually become too much and you 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.430
 they can not take everyone away and 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.220
 That's why I like to come here 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.490
 silencer then attacked in the ground 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.330
 and yes, I have the laser on it too 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.670
 simply because he just europe that 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.970
 explains itself as parks 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.110
 have here now spirit and hardliner in it 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.850
 Spirit is such a thing so it comes 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.250
 always on the lobby on it 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.420
 I also like to change spirit compassion 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.310
 way because I am naturally 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.409
 makes it faster and easier 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.780
 some of the good advantage you 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.020
 but that's the way it is 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.240
 strong because you just can not sit on the throne 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.630
 it is clear that this is such a point 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.710
 You can also change parties have 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.420
 I still just because series 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.270
 simply very strong are eg the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.060
 lightning in a domination can he 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.860
 you easily bring 6 kills and that's why 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.280
 is to achieve more convincing faster 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.040
 hartley of course great 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.099
 then I have toughness yes 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.690
 that's simply because skills 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.300
 with distance the best work in it 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.550
 you need nimble hands in here 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.620
 Not 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.440
 change really so many weapons do 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.860
 I do not and grenades actually throw 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.260
 also not and therefore tenacity there 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.720
 her if you get hit i will 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.540
 not so strong back in the aim and here 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.050
 then in the fight then very 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.120
 advantageous then natural agility 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.900
 aim faster or after the sprint 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.180
 aim faster 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.250
 I have no war so it is 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.530
 really very important and also fast 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.320
 climbing is also very strong 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.330
 all a mp class c4 still around the 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.400
 opponents from kemper sports rauszuholen and 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.190
 another grenade around me 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.540
 fight maybe a little bit 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.960
 secure 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.240
 yes this is the offensive class 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.040
 which is played very aggressively and 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.020
 Now we come to the second class and 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.420
 the sea ​​is such a defensive class as 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.460
 I realize that there is a lot there 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.170
 gives what agrees so I have 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.620
 I was now primarily for take away 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.680
 because I have taken quickdrop 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.110
 simply because of that dreifuss 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.700
 the poor just way too slow in the 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.810
 ironside and since you need easy 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.180
 quick drop 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.950
 I have that silencer too 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.420
 again as before and just fast 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.220
 the magazine because that's the type 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.780
 really important is because the fast 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.450
 empty is I have taken one too 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.190
 that's pretty quick fire 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.890
 because of it and a small one 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.060
 recoil has simply because many too 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.340
 of course I want to come and they want me 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.520
 I can also get away quickly 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.459
 lightweight also because of the 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.160
 doubt there it is even more useful 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.350
 Light weight and toughness again 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.300
 like before and how everything works 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.700
 had here on the right side and 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.270
 this class is actually rather 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.070
 played defensively that is defensive 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.300
 not combed so I fight with 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.080
 the class does not stay sunny anymore 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.900
 restrained that not quickly 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.060
 directly in opponent's series but me 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.459
 wait first I read the opponents come 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.340
 kiel sid specify next step 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:19.180
 and children there the opponents again 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.220
 and yes, I play the class and that 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.840
 was now actually so from the ground 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.580
 Of course, there are still plenty of attacks 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.300
 more classes how to attack in the ground 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.530
 also 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.199
 but it can be like that 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.810
 principles speak silencer is 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.879
 I think it's important, too 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.900
 Agility is also very important in 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:40.270
 Ground attack and yes that's mine 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.340
 classify that for me as being very 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.729
 well, and yes me 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.770
 Hope you liked it 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.900
 if not then write ask 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.759
 comment below or you can also such a 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:57.340
 sign commentator and forget 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:58.750
 not the thing to like here yes then until 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.020
 the next new items 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.020
 ciao
