00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
and let's see how it works we can

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.510 
and let's see how it works we can
actually<00:01:19.439> grab<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.770> think<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.340> only<00:01:20.460> thing

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
actually grab I think the only thing

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.980 
actually grab I think the only thing
else<00:01:20.759> we're<00:01:20.909> gonna<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.149> able<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.299> grab<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.750> just

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
else we're gonna be able to grab is just

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.560 
else we're gonna be able to grab is just
glass<00:01:22.320> then<00:01:23.100> we'll<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> rest<00:01:23.579> of<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.180> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
glass then we'll do the rest of it in a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.270 
glass then we'll do the rest of it in a
kind<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.780> detail<00:01:25.079> stage<00:01:25.290> I'll<00:01:25.890> probably<00:01:26.100> be

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
kind of detail stage I'll probably be

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.530 
kind of detail stage I'll probably be
changing<00:01:26.670> little<00:01:26.939> bits<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.420> is

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
changing little bits this this is

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.999 
changing little bits this this is
actually<00:01:27.630> got<00:01:27.899> black<00:01:28.110> core<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.500> inside<00:01:28.920> as

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
actually got black core on the inside as

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.069 
actually got black core on the inside as
you<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.159> see<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.430> kind<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.640> blank<00:01:29.880> out<00:01:30.060> I'll<00:01:30.840> be

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
you can see to kind of blank out I'll be

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.840 
you can see to kind of blank out I'll be
probably<00:01:31.590> putting<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.369> little<00:01:32.549> bit<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.790> an

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
probably putting in a little bit of an

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.670 
probably putting in a little bit of an
interior<00:01:33.030> not<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.689> an<00:01:33.750> interior<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.290> you
