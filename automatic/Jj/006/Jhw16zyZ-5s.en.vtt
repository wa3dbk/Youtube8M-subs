all<00:00:01.140> right<00:00:01.350> so<00:00:01.589> now<00:00:01.709> for<00:00:02.159> the<00:00:02.280> rhythm<00:00:02.669> guitar

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
all right so now for the rhythm guitar

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:21.700 
all right so now for the rhythm guitar
that<00:00:04.230> goes<00:00:04.410> onto<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.890> solo<00:00:05.130> sounds<00:00:06.060> like<00:00:06.180> this

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.109 

and<00:00:22.710> just<00:00:22.950> repeat<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.280> twice<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.910> what<00:00:24.000> that

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
and just repeat that twice and what that

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.380 
and just repeat that twice and what that
is<00:00:24.300> it's<00:00:24.480> four<00:00:25.350> counts<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.740> four<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> B<00:00:26.580> four

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
is it's four counts of four on a B four

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.780 
is it's four counts of four on a B four
counts<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.779> four<00:00:28.020> on<00:00:28.140> an<00:00:28.289> E<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.740> four<00:00:29.460> counts

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:29.790 
counts of four on an E and four counts

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.220 
counts of four on an E and four counts
of<00:00:29.849> four<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.420> an<00:00:30.930> f-sharp<00:00:31.489> all<00:00:32.489> right<00:00:33.020> so<00:00:34.020> after

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
of four on an f-sharp all right so after

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.729 
of four on an f-sharp all right so after
that<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.559> get<00:00:34.890> into<00:00:35.129> the<00:00:35.250> final<00:00:36.030> chorus<00:00:36.739> which

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
that you get into the final chorus which

00:00:37.739 --> 00:01:06.510 
that you get into the final chorus which
for<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.190> lead<00:00:38.370> guitar<00:00:38.730> sounds<00:00:39.269> like<00:00:39.390> this

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.610 

all<00:01:07.520> right<00:01:09.460> so<00:01:10.460> that's<00:01:11.300> very<00:01:11.660> similar<00:01:12.080> to<00:01:12.260> the

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
all right so that's very similar to the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.290 
all right so that's very similar to the
beginning<00:01:13.130> course<00:01:13.370> except<00:01:13.760> for<00:01:13.910> one<00:01:14.060> little

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
beginning course except for one little

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.070 
beginning course except for one little
part<00:01:14.770> so<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.920> beginning<00:01:16.040> of<00:01:16.370> that<00:01:16.520> is<00:01:16.820> uh<00:01:17.080> just

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
part so the beginning of that is uh just

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.210 
part so the beginning of that is uh just
like<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.380> beginning<00:01:18.710> of<00:01:18.800> the<00:01:18.890> other<00:01:19.010> one

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
like the beginning of the other one

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:29.030 
like the beginning of the other one
sounds<00:01:19.580> like

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.600 

and<00:01:29.970> it's<00:01:30.570> after<00:01:30.870> that<00:01:31.050> where<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.410> changes<00:01:31.890> so

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
and it's after that where it changes so

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.880 
and it's after that where it changes so
after<00:01:32.940> you<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.180> beginning<00:01:33.510> part<00:01:33.740> then<00:01:34.740> you

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
after you that beginning part then you

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.300 
after you that beginning part then you
do<00:01:35.070> four<00:01:35.520> counts<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.470> two<00:01:37.470> counts<00:01:37.620> of<00:01:37.800> four<00:01:38.070> on

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
do four counts of two counts of four on

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.420 
do four counts of two counts of four on
the<00:01:38.880> 1416<00:01:41.960> then<00:01:42.960> down<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.260> the<00:01:43.320> 1214<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.370> do

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
the 1416 then down to the 1214 and do

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.200 
the 1416 then down to the 1214 and do
two<00:01:44.640> counts<00:01:44.940> of<00:01:45.000> flow<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:48.110> and<00:01:49.280> then<00:01:50.280> do

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
two counts of flow on that and then do

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.990 
two counts of flow on that and then do
two<00:01:51.390> counts<00:01:51.690> of<00:01:51.750> four<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.230> the<00:01:52.470> eleven<00:01:52.920> nine

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.190 

and<00:01:57.000> then<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.360> go<00:01:57.450> up<00:01:57.480> to<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.780> thirteen

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
and then you go up to the thirteen

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.560 
and then you go up to the thirteen
fifteen<00:01:58.800> and<00:01:59.520> do<00:01:59.670> four<00:01:59.970> counts<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.270> four<00:02:00.480> on

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
fifteen and do four counts of four on

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.150 
fifteen and do four counts of four on
that<00:02:02.180> and<00:02:03.180> then<00:02:03.870> after<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.170> do<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.320> it's<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
that and then after you do that it's the

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.520 
that and then after you do that it's the
you<00:02:05.820> pretty<00:02:06.540> much<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.690> redo<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.260> course

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
you pretty much just redo the course

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:18.290 
you pretty much just redo the course
thing

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.750 

ah<00:02:18.530> all<00:02:19.530> right<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:19.950> let<00:02:20.100> me<00:02:20.160> play<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.430> all<00:02:20.580> for

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
ah all right so let me play that all for

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
ah all right so let me play that all for
you<00:02:20.790> all<00:02:21.690> together

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.380 

ah<00:02:49.220> right<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.400> after<00:02:50.460> that<00:02:50.760> then<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:51.210> go

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
ah right and after that then you just go

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.750 
ah right and after that then you just go
back

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.290 

all<00:02:56.760> right<00:02:57.349> so<00:02:58.349> after<00:02:58.709> you<00:02:59.010> do<00:02:59.489> that<00:02:59.519> part<00:03:00.060> that

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
all right so after you do that part that

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.180 
all right so after you do that part that
would<00:03:01.260> that's<00:03:01.590> pretty<00:03:01.769> much<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.950> end<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.129> the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
would that's pretty much the end of the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.640 
would that's pretty much the end of the
song<00:03:02.370> but<00:03:02.700> for<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.330> rhythm<00:03:04.019> guitar<00:03:04.319> that

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
song but for the the rhythm guitar that

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.390 
song but for the the rhythm guitar that
goes<00:03:04.800> onto<00:03:05.099> that<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:06.739> very<00:03:07.739> similar<00:03:08.069> to<00:03:08.220> the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
goes onto that is a very similar to the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.339 
goes onto that is a very similar to the
chorus<00:03:08.580> it's<00:03:09.060> pretty<00:03:09.239> much<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.480> same<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:10.200> do

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
chorus it's pretty much the same you do

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.780 
chorus it's pretty much the same you do
a<00:03:11.360> so<00:03:12.360> two<00:03:12.840> counts<00:03:13.140> of<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.470> four<00:03:13.980> on<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.430> regular

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
a so two counts of a four on the regular

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:25.060 
a so two counts of a four on the regular
B<00:03:16.459> then<00:03:17.459> a<00:03:17.489> b7<00:03:19.430> then<00:03:20.430> ii<00:03:20.580> ii<00:03:20.610> ii<00:03:22.310> minor

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
B then a b7 then ii ii ii minor

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.410 
B then a b7 then ii ii ii minor
then<00:03:26.070> be

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.990 

than<00:03:30.170> to<00:03:30.290> be<00:03:30.410> seven

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
than to be seven

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.210 
than to be seven
then<00:03:32.690> down<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:33.050> f-sharp

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.820 

so<00:03:37.850> in<00:03:37.940> that<00:03:38.030> f-sharp<00:03:38.240> you<00:03:38.810> do<00:03:38.990> four<00:03:39.500> counts<00:03:39.770> of

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
so in that f-sharp you do four counts of

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:52.280 
so in that f-sharp you do four counts of
four<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.250> then<00:03:40.910> repeat

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.220 

except<00:03:53.010> at<00:03:53.129> the<00:03:53.220> end<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.519> do<00:03:53.930> two<00:03:54.930> counts<00:03:55.170> of

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
except at the end you do two counts of

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.750 
except at the end you do two counts of
bean<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.709> then<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:55.980> half<00:03:56.129> and<00:03:56.430> then<00:03:56.550> you<00:03:56.640> do

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
bean and then to half and then you do

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.930 
bean and then to half and then you do
that<00:03:58.640> that<00:03:59.640> whole<00:03:59.819> part<00:04:00.650> um<00:04:01.790> so<00:04:02.790> basically

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
that that whole part um so basically

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.880 
that that whole part um so basically
that's<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.569> whole<00:04:03.900> song<00:04:04.200> I<00:04:04.530> pretty<00:04:04.709> much

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
that's the whole song I pretty much

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.059 
that's the whole song I pretty much
covered<00:04:05.129> everything<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.790> like<00:04:06.000> I<00:04:06.120> said<00:04:06.180> it

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
covered everything and like I said it

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.490 
covered everything and like I said it
the<00:04:08.069> choruses<00:04:08.610> you<00:04:09.540> just<00:04:09.959> need<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.200> decide

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
the choruses you just need to decide
