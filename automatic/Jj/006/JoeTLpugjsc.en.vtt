00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.200 
I'm going to give myself a little bit of
space<00:02:36.620> here<00:02:37.010> but<00:02:37.160> more<00:02:37.400> importantly<00:02:37.970> I'm

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
space here but more importantly I'm

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.870 
space here but more importantly I'm
going<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.480> give<00:02:38.750> some<00:02:39.080> thread<00:02:40.040> there<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:40.700> when

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
going to give some thread there so when

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.970 
going to give some thread there so when
I<00:02:40.910> pick<00:02:41.270> up<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.540> next<00:02:41.840> edge<00:02:42.110> it'll<00:02:42.530> know<00:02:42.770> where

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
I pick up the next edge it'll know where

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.940 
I pick up the next edge it'll know where
to<00:02:43.070> cut<00:02:43.310> in<00:02:45.400> okay<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:47.200> all<00:02:48.200> I'm<00:02:48.500> going<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:48.740> do

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
to cut in okay and all I'm going to do

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.250 
to cut in okay and all I'm going to do
is<00:02:49.280> I'm<00:02:49.850> going<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.090> lift<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.510> foot<00:02:50.540> again

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
is I'm going to lift the foot again

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.990 
is I'm going to lift the foot again
and<00:02:52.600> because<00:02:53.600> this<00:02:54.320> edge<00:02:54.800> is<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.520> salvage

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
and because this edge is the salvage

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.080 
and because this edge is the salvage
edge<00:02:56.300> I<00:02:56.690> might<00:02:57.500> cut<00:02:57.890> in<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.070> little<00:02:58.520> bit<00:02:58.670> further

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
edge I might cut in a little bit further

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.060 
edge I might cut in a little bit further
than<00:02:59.660> that<00:02:59.960> line<00:03:00.290> I<00:03:02.260> got<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.410> get<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:03.770> stay

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
than that line I got to get it to stay

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.580 
than that line I got to get it to stay
on<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.880> table<00:03:05.090> first<00:03:05.570> okay<00:03:06.020> I<00:03:06.050> put<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.380> foot

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
on the table first okay I put the foot

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:14.320 
on the table first okay I put the foot
down<00:03:11.980> let's<00:03:12.980> see<00:03:13.160> hum<00:03:13.400> a<00:03:13.430> little<00:03:13.580> bit<00:03:14.000> further

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
down let's see hum a little bit further

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.619 
down let's see hum a little bit further
over<00:03:14.600> this<00:03:14.960> time

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.380

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
edge that edge is so nice compared to

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.330 
edge that edge is so nice compared to
that<00:03:55.760> edge<00:03:56.650> but<00:03:57.650> I'm<00:03:57.769> going<00:03:57.950> to<00:03:58.010> bring<00:03:58.219> them
