like a normal desert biome just a few

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.879 
like a normal desert biome just a few
trees<00:01:31.600> you<00:01:31.810> can<00:01:31.929> make<00:01:32.079> them<00:01:32.229> really<00:01:32.409> big<00:01:32.709> but<00:01:32.829> I

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:32.889 
trees you can make them really big but I

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:34.469

them as high as the actual world i mean

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.830 
them as high as the actual world i mean
that's<00:02:21.490> cool<00:02:21.790> but<00:02:22.000> just<00:02:22.210> got<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.450> keep<00:02:22.630> in<00:02:22.810> mind

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
that's cool but just got to keep in mind

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.230 
that's cool but just got to keep in mind
that<00:02:23.500> if<00:02:24.130> you<00:02:24.220> do<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.550> as<00:02:24.640> high<00:02:24.790> as<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.030> actual

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
that if you do it as high as the actual

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.620 
that if you do it as high as the actual
world

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
world

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.300 
world
you're<00:02:25.780> gonna<00:02:25.870> have<00:02:25.990> to<00:02:26.050> grow<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.320> lot<00:02:26.770> of<00:02:26.920> trees

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
you're gonna have to grow a lot of trees

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.490 
you're gonna have to grow a lot of trees
so<00:02:27.970> I<00:02:28.030> might<00:02:28.180> keep<00:02:28.420> mine<00:02:28.630> about<00:02:28.900> maybe<00:02:29.200> three

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
so I might keep mine about maybe three

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.820 
so I might keep mine about maybe three
or<00:02:29.890> four<00:02:30.310> trees<00:02:30.700> high<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.360> just<00:02:31.990> try<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.290> grow

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
or four trees high and just try to grow

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.830 
or four trees high and just try to grow
off<00:02:32.950> that<00:02:33.310> because<00:02:33.730> I<00:02:33.940> don't<00:02:34.240> want<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.540> be

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
off that because I don't want to be

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.500 
off that because I don't want to be
sitting<00:02:35.650> here<00:02:35.980> all<00:02:36.100> day<00:02:36.580> just<00:02:36.850> growing<00:02:37.210> one

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
sitting here all day just growing one

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.500 
sitting here all day just growing one
single<00:02:37.990> tree<00:02:38.230> as<00:02:38.380> tall<00:02:38.620> as<00:02:38.740> I<00:02:38.860> can<00:02:39.010> make<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.510> but

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
single tree as tall as I can make it but

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.470 
single tree as tall as I can make it but
as<00:02:41.610> you<00:02:42.610> see<00:02:42.990> some<00:02:43.990> of<00:02:44.020> them<00:02:44.290> might<00:02:44.830> not<00:02:44.890> grow

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
as you see some of them might not grow

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.760 
as you see some of them might not grow
now<00:02:46.480> this<00:02:46.690> one's<00:02:46.930> not<00:02:47.050> growing<00:02:47.320> because<00:02:47.530> of

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
now this one's not growing because of

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.710 
now this one's not growing because of
how<00:02:47.860> close<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:48.460> another<00:02:48.880> one<00:02:49.090> what<00:02:49.690> I

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
how close it is to another one what I

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.970 
how close it is to another one what I
like<00:02:49.930> doing<00:02:50.110> is<00:02:50.260> though<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.410> still<00:02:50.740> want<00:02:50.920> to

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
like doing is though I still want to

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.650 
like doing is though I still want to
extend<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.460> so<00:02:51.580> i<00:02:51.610> might<00:02:51.790> scoot<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.300> over<00:02:52.390> and

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
extend it so i might scoot it over and

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.600 
extend it so i might scoot it over and
try<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.900> grow<00:02:53.170> it<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.440> then<00:02:54.100> that<00:02:54.310> will<00:02:54.460> work

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
try to grow it and then that will work

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.600 
try to grow it and then that will work
which<00:02:55.300> is<00:02:55.480> good<00:02:55.690> glad<00:02:55.990> that<00:02:56.200> worked<00:02:56.440> grow<00:02:57.400> that

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
which is good glad that worked grow that

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.480 
which is good glad that worked grow that
one<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:57.970> then<00:02:58.750> grow<00:02:58.930> these<00:02:59.080> two<00:02:59.320> so<00:02:59.980> as<00:03:00.250> you

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
one and then grow these two so as you

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.430 
one and then grow these two so as you
see<00:03:00.730> within<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.300> first<00:03:01.570> what<00:03:01.930> is<00:03:02.050> this<00:03:02.170> three

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
see within the first what is this three

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.830 
see within the first what is this three
minutes<00:03:02.800> well<00:03:03.580> then<00:03:03.760> just<00:03:03.940> me<00:03:04.240> doing<00:03:04.270> it<00:03:04.660> for

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
minutes well then just me doing it for

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.190 
minutes well then just me doing it for
three<00:03:05.050> minutes<00:03:05.310> we<00:03:06.310> already<00:03:06.760> have<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.450> decent<00:03:07.810> a

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
three minutes we already have a decent a

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.650 
three minutes we already have a decent a
little<00:03:08.230> bit<00:03:08.710> of<00:03:08.860> a<00:03:08.950> decent<00:03:09.250> establishment<00:03:09.700> on

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
little bit of a decent establishment on

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.960 
little bit of a decent establishment on
these<00:03:11.470> trees<00:03:11.770> as<00:03:12.040> you<00:03:12.280> see<00:03:12.460> they're<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:12.670> lot

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
these trees as you see they're a lot

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.280 
these trees as you see they're a lot
bigger<00:03:13.180> than<00:03:13.600> all<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.870> other<00:03:14.020> ones<00:03:14.170> around

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
bigger than all the other ones around

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.560 
bigger than all the other ones around
here<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:14.890> I<00:03:15.270> think<00:03:16.270> they<00:03:16.390> look<00:03:16.510> pretty

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
here and I think they look pretty

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.350 
here and I think they look pretty
awesome<00:03:17.350> so<00:03:17.410> I'm<00:03:17.470> gonna<00:03:17.560> do<00:03:17.680> a<00:03:17.710> couple<00:03:18.100> more

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.190 
i'm gonna do maybe I'm like three or
four<00:03:26.350> trees<00:03:27.250> high<00:03:27.550> on<00:03:27.730> each<00:03:27.880> other<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.300> then

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
four trees high on each other and then

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.040 
four trees high on each other and then
all<00:03:29.350> I'll<00:03:29.740> come<00:03:30.070> back<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:30.720> show<00:03:31.720> you<00:03:31.780> guys<00:03:31.990> how

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
all I'll come back and show you guys how

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.540 
all I'll come back and show you guys how
it<00:03:32.350> looks<00:03:32.560> because<00:03:32.770> it<00:03:32.920> will<00:03:33.040> take<00:03:33.310> a<00:03:33.490> few

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
it looks because it will take a few

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.850 
it looks because it will take a few
minutes<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.150> do<00:03:34.300> this<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.750> I<00:03:35.530> don't<00:03:35.680> want<00:03:35.800> to

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
minutes to do this and I don't want to

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.560 
minutes to do this and I don't want to
waste<00:03:35.890> your<00:03:36.070> guys<00:03:36.280> time<00:03:36.580> but<00:03:36.970> let<00:03:37.150> me<00:03:37.180> go<00:03:37.420> ahead

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
waste your guys time but let me go ahead

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.340 
waste your guys time but let me go ahead
and<00:03:37.840> just<00:03:38.670> just<00:03:39.670> higher<00:03:40.060> up<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.900> ones<00:03:41.170> that

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
and just just higher up the ones that

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.410 
and just just higher up the ones that
I've<00:03:41.470> already<00:03:41.740> done<00:03:42.070> just<00:03:42.610> this<00:03:42.790> one<00:03:43.090> that<00:03:43.300> I'm

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
I've already done just this one that I'm

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.660 
I've already done just this one that I'm
looking<00:03:43.870> at<00:03:44.110> right<00:03:44.170> now<00:03:44.350> let<00:03:45.190> me<00:03:45.310> get<00:03:45.460> these<00:03:45.610> a

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
looking at right now let me get these a

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.460 
looking at right now let me get these a
little<00:03:46.000> bit<00:03:46.150> higher<00:03:46.420> let<00:03:46.690> me<00:03:46.750> do<00:03:46.900> about<00:03:47.110> three

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
little bit higher let me do about three

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.110 
little bit higher let me do about three
or<00:03:47.500> four<00:03:47.620> more<00:03:48.010> trees<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:48.580> get<00:03:48.670> these<00:03:48.820> to<00:03:48.970> the

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
or four more trees and get these to the

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.600 
or four more trees and get these to the
sky<00:03:49.570> and<00:03:50.170> i'll<00:03:50.290> show<00:03:50.320> you<00:03:50.530> how<00:03:50.590> big<00:03:51.040> these<00:03:51.220> tree

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
sky and i'll show you how big these tree

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.700 
sky and i'll show you how big these tree
bonds<00:03:51.820> could<00:03:52.240> actually<00:03:52.510> get<00:03:53.080> so<00:03:53.320> give<00:03:53.470> me<00:03:53.500> one

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
bonds could actually get so give me one

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.150 
bonds could actually get so give me one
second<00:03:54.100> guys<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:54.959> we<00:03:55.959> are<00:03:56.200> back<00:03:56.230> it<00:03:57.040> is

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
second guys and we are back it is

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.250 
second guys and we are back it is
getting<00:03:57.340> to<00:03:57.640> be<00:03:57.670> nighttime<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.600> I<00:03:58.959> pretty

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
getting to be nighttime and I pretty

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.930 
getting to be nighttime and I pretty
much<00:03:59.380> did<00:03:59.830> a<00:03:59.860> couple<00:04:00.070> more<00:04:00.280> trees<00:04:00.580> and<00:04:00.760> this<00:04:00.850> is

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
much did a couple more trees and this is

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.360 
much did a couple more trees and this is
what<00:04:01.060> we<00:04:01.090> came<00:04:01.150> out<00:04:01.420> with<00:04:01.680> so<00:04:02.680> as<00:04:02.950> you<00:04:03.160> see<00:04:03.340> I

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
what we came out with so as you see I

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.000 
what we came out with so as you see I
did<00:04:03.640> about<00:04:03.760> a<00:04:04.270> bit<00:04:04.900> about<00:04:05.080> I<00:04:05.140> think<00:04:05.380> of<00:04:05.530> one

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
did about a bit about I think of one

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.190 
did about a bit about I think of one
more<00:04:06.250> on<00:04:06.370> each<00:04:06.490> tree<00:04:06.820> you<00:04:07.390> could<00:04:07.630> do<00:04:07.720> two<00:04:07.930> more

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
more on each tree you could do two more

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.900 
more on each tree you could do two more
but<00:04:08.410> this<00:04:08.560> is<00:04:08.680> around<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.130> high<00:04:09.310> limit<00:04:09.490> I<00:04:09.670> want

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
but this is around the high limit I want

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.070 
but this is around the high limit I want
I<00:04:10.060> don't<00:04:10.120> want<00:04:10.270> to<00:04:10.450> be<00:04:10.540> in<00:04:10.630> higher<00:04:10.840> than<00:04:11.020> this

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
I don't want to be in higher than this

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.080 
I don't want to be in higher than this
because<00:04:11.260> there's<00:04:11.470> a<00:04:11.530> lot<00:04:11.680> of<00:04:11.709> work<00:04:11.950> to<00:04:12.100> do<00:04:12.250> so

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
because there's a lot of work to do so

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.370 
because there's a lot of work to do so
what<00:04:13.360> I<00:04:13.390> would<00:04:13.600> like<00:04:13.660> to<00:04:13.930> do<00:04:14.020> you<00:04:14.140> can<00:04:14.260> go

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
what I would like to do you can go

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.080 
what I would like to do you can go
around<00:04:14.620> and<00:04:14.800> just<00:04:14.980> you<00:04:15.130> can<00:04:15.250> place<00:04:15.430> torches

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
around and just you can place torches

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.199 
around and just you can place torches
you<00:04:16.359> can<00:04:16.510> play<00:04:16.720> some<00:04:16.920> glowstone<00:04:17.920> just<00:04:18.880> keep<00:04:19.060> in

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
you can play some glowstone just keep in

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.060 
you can play some glowstone just keep in
mind<00:04:19.239> that<00:04:19.540> I<00:04:19.630> know<00:04:19.780> it's<00:04:20.170> a<00:04:20.260> lot<00:04:20.440> of<00:04:20.470> work<00:04:20.739> to

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
mind that I know it's a lot of work to

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.430 
mind that I know it's a lot of work to
turn<00:04:21.280> your<00:04:21.730> biomes<00:04:22.270> into<00:04:22.600> jungle<00:04:22.960> biomes<00:04:23.290> I

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
turn your biomes into jungle biomes I

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.220 
turn your biomes into jungle biomes I
know<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:23.680> takes<00:04:23.860> a<00:04:24.010> while<00:04:24.280> putting<00:04:25.230> each

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
know it takes a while putting each

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.850 
know it takes a while putting each
little<00:04:27.480> beach<00:04:28.480> little<00:04:28.930> sapling<00:04:29.470> on<00:04:29.680> each

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
little beach little sapling on each

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.460 
little beach little sapling on each
little<00:04:30.100> piece<00:04:30.160> of<00:04:30.430> dirt<00:04:30.640> I<00:04:30.880> know<00:04:30.970> it's<00:04:31.240> very<00:04:31.480> it

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
little piece of dirt I know it's very it

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.840 
little piece of dirt I know it's very it
could<00:04:32.620> become<00:04:32.890> very<00:04:33.130> tedious<00:04:33.400> and<00:04:33.790> very

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
could become very tedious and very

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.520 
could become very tedious and very
annoying<00:04:34.300> but<00:04:34.540> to<00:04:34.630> be<00:04:34.720> honest<00:04:35.110> like<00:04:35.140> a<00:04:35.229> little

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
annoying but to be honest like a little

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.740 
annoying but to be honest like a little
biome<00:04:35.830> like<00:04:35.979> this<00:04:36.250> though<00:04:36.580> I<00:04:36.850> mean<00:04:37.540> it<00:04:37.600> might

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
biome like this though I mean it might

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.510 
biome like this though I mean it might
take<00:04:37.930> a<00:04:37.960> few<00:04:38.050> hours<00:04:38.260> it<00:04:38.620> might<00:04:38.740> take<00:04:38.979> a<00:04:39.010> few

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
take a few hours it might take a few

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.369 
take a few hours it might take a few
temps<00:04:40.000> you<00:04:40.240> know<00:04:40.389> but<00:04:40.690> if<00:04:40.780> you<00:04:40.900> just<00:04:41.110> start

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:41.379 
temps you know but if you just start

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:43.800 
temps you know but if you just start
this<00:04:41.590> with<00:04:41.740> some<00:04:41.919> friends<00:04:42.460> like<00:04:43.270> before<00:04:43.509> you

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
this with some friends like before you

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.570 
this with some friends like before you
know<00:04:44.020> it<00:04:44.169> you<00:04:44.259> could<00:04:44.410> have<00:04:44.530> an<00:04:44.680> entire<00:04:44.830> volume

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
know it you could have an entire volume

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.510 
know it you could have an entire volume
made<00:04:46.449> up<00:04:46.750> big<00:04:47.050> an<00:04:47.229> entire<00:04:47.560> jungle<00:04:47.889> biome<00:04:48.340> and

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
made up big an entire jungle biome and

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.309 
made up big an entire jungle biome and
you'd<00:04:49.270> be<00:04:49.330> like<00:04:49.389> wow<00:04:49.720> that<00:04:49.960> didn't<00:04:50.169> take<00:04:50.229> too

long at all so just you know keep in
mind<00:04:53.530> this<00:04:53.770> is<00:04:53.830> very<00:04:54.190> tedious<00:04:54.490> but<00:04:55.360> it<00:04:55.599> depends

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
mind this is very tedious but it depends

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.629 
mind this is very tedious but it depends
