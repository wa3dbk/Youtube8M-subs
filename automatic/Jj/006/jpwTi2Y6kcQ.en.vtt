00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:37.410
 so first of all it's a stereo headset 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:42.750
 compatible with the playstation 3 and their 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.250

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.660

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.980
 little foam yes that's good 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.379
 and there it is very comfortable 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.610
 ears and it does not transpire at all 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.920
 swiss is very flexible 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.000

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.480
 hold your head because you can 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.790

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.740
 case here is this case there is here 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.670
 the sound of the game during the sound of the pussy 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.180
