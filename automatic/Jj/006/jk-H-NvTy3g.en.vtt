 it means you don't understand well 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.580
 how servers are created we download ready 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.439
 server and set up and for themselves but we will 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.199
 how to do like normal people 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.800
 make an offer go to the site were able to 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.560
 min. py only to be under the video too 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.880
 here is the ready server and I would download 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.000
 first here but since I have already downloaded the water 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:43.290
 then I'll just go 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.239
 folder so on me and here you are 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.660
 this will allow you to have an archive 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.660
 There will be such a daddy in the general tab a100 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.620
 as here we all downloaded our server except 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.320
 here you are aware of it from the rar archive in 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.910
 in general, then you will have this 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.980
 here is bullshit 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.350
 turn on the series is the same as start 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.900
 bat that is when you click on it we will 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.850
 i series 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:14.100
 I suggest you first set up a name 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:20.330
 a series of this go here you have a folder with 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:26.970
 server to strike gvg hesitate rtg 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:30.990
 add it to the archive and so here so here 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.340
 we came here open it swap 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.340
 cfg on dexter 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:43.520
 on opening night look 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.150
 host name is your server name 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.140
 enter your 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.110
 he password is sometimes uncle heavier 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.619
 so as not to break the server that is 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:58.410
 I crack such a check Ursula 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.150
 password all password this here if you 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.770
 want to make someone a server if not 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.770
 want no one to come to him 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.530
 we do not leave and password 1234 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.250
 in this case , you will be asked for 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.590
 entering the server, keep that password and on 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.980
 already coming you will understand owl will not catch 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.000
 settings, look in the inter means 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.610
 then as you return the jpg file again 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:31.260
 file 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:35.360
 config and then replace it in short but 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.360
 no test 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.890
 remove this garbage 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.930
 now as for how to start the server 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:48.000
 I already told you yes but we offer 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:53.519
 add also to the archive to show that 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.170
 there infa is there anything you need an example 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.510
 if you want to change yes and quantity 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.540
 players as much as you can 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.160
 go north here you have to do here 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.650
 so here we opened it just like that 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.430
 file means that there is someone we do not 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.780
 do not change anything 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.370
 tickrate is server speed 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.650
 if you don't know what that is 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.519
 look online options for 3 hair cut 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.130
 6 then for weakly computers choose either 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.200
 3 shooting is now six hundred too this 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.290
 too much for strong computers 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.850
 there is if your computer is rather weak 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:33.610
 then 6 goes next port 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:38.320
 Serbka this he exage no setconfig 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:40.000
 in which we entered the server name if 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.750
 they called me too don't change it 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.060
 max player 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.860
 Ie Moscow number of players 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.310
 who can just go to the server 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.690
 situation 1 is there probably 1311 it 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.210
 how much do you want to go a 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.490
 why the site is better than an odd number because 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.310
 that everything works here 42 did not become it 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.620
 did not disconnect means map here this apa that 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.610
 card to which the night hearts will 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.200
 there is a main 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.820
 among my up to 100th fps max is vps 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.010
 server also look inter 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.390
 Makeevsky does not know what the options 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.170
 500 1000 for weak computers 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.790
 choose 500c shuttlecocks already 100 if you 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.799
 wish there was to go with 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.760
 local network if you want from the Internet 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:24.970
 then put the set but after that all 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:30.760
 that changed also rename the file as 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:33.070
 tanks look there was a bat here's the supply 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:39.370
 renamed too replace this file then 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:42.460
 that is, all replacements mean as far as 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:46.090
 there as ports open see 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.550
 Internet if you are closed so hit 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.900
 nothing else wanted to say sheet look 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:57.400
 I suggest to look at this site 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:05:00.370
 your . will show everyone worship on for 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.820
 friends throw them what they still wanted 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.870
 to tell 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:07.360
 Powder 1 for cleaning ip address as a box 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.919
 he was always the same so they 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.560
 both dynamic ie constantly 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:14.040
 work and did not change the product and immediately 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.750
 you need to contact the provider 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.350
 held for you for this service will take 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.490
 some amount of money may not take 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.940
 that is, you too, how would you be it 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.710
 rent this ip address but if you want 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.630
 make public hearts to you of course 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.550
 the service needs to get you on the walls is fine 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.340
 also the 7th ip address 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.130
 and if x 10 grade mouth principle you 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.840
 can get along and dynamic 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.229
 ip-address that is constantly looking 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.110
 throw off to play in a pile of gray and all is well 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:46.740
 In general, here is such a video lesson 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:49.050
 dishes are not a series then I will show you in 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.810
 next video tutorial how to prescribe 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:55.040
 yourself admin mani admin plugin 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.040
