00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.709 
the first thing we should do guys the
easiest<00:02:02.130> thing<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.610> create<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:03.000> check<00:02:03.390> for

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
easiest thing is to create a check for

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.870 
easiest thing is to create a check for
it<00:02:03.840> make<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.649> true<00:02:04.890> or<00:02:04.950> false<00:02:05.159> variable<00:02:05.729> that

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
it make a true or false variable that

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.700 
it make a true or false variable that
checks<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.390> see<00:02:06.630> if<00:02:06.659> we're<00:02:06.899> pause<00:02:07.110> there<00:02:07.350> it's

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
checks to see if we're pause there it's

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.580 
checks to see if we're pause there it's
called<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.009> boolean<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.819> private<00:02:09.330> bull<00:02:09.590> is

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
called a boolean so private bull is

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.360 
called a boolean so private bull is
pause<00:02:10.950> right<00:02:11.310> here<00:02:11.340> this

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
pause right here this

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.460 
pause right here this
as<00:02:12.430> private<00:02:13.030> ball<00:02:13.330> is<00:02:13.510> paused<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:14.080> currently

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
as private ball is paused so currently

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.949 
as private ball is paused so currently
by<00:02:14.680> default<00:02:15.099> set<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.549> false<00:02:15.819> but<00:02:16.420> in<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.690> start

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
by default set to false but in the start

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.220 
by default set to false but in the start
function<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.530> said<00:02:17.799> it<00:02:17.950> again<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:19.030> clarify<00:02:19.750> and

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
function I said it again to clarify and

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.619 
function I said it again to clarify and
confirm<00:02:21.069> that<00:02:21.099> toss<00:02:21.549> so<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:21.940> pause<00:02:22.150> is<00:02:22.360> equal

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
confirm that toss so is pause is equal

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.720 
confirm that toss so is pause is equal
to<00:02:22.690> false<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.140> what<00:02:23.260> this<00:02:23.409> says<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:23.830> that<00:02:23.860> if<00:02:24.310> is

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
to false so what this says is that if is

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.520 
to false so what this says is that if is
the<00:02:24.940> game<00:02:25.090> paused<00:02:25.420> true<00:02:25.930> or<00:02:26.049> false

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
the game paused true or false

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.330 
the game paused true or false
no<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.819> game<00:02:28.030> is<00:02:28.060> currently<00:02:28.769> not<00:02:29.769> paused<00:02:30.099> so

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
no the game is currently not paused so

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.890 
no the game is currently not paused so
it's<00:02:30.489> set<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.670> false<00:02:30.970> if<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.269> was<00:02:31.360> paused<00:02:31.629> it

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
it's set to false if it was paused it

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.250 
it's set to false if it was paused it
set<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.379> set<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.799> true<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:34.690> now<00:02:34.810> what<00:02:34.959> we<00:02:35.049> need<00:02:35.170> to

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
set a set to true so now what we need to

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.589 
set a set to true so now what we need to
do<00:02:35.349> that<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.709> do<00:02:35.860> our<00:02:36.040> GUI<00:02:36.400> stuff<00:02:36.790> for<00:02:37.510> this

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
do that to do our GUI stuff for this

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.390 
do that to do our GUI stuff for this
video<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:37.959> should<00:02:38.170> have<00:02:38.680> already<00:02:38.890> watched

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.920 
show when we pause the game so how do
you<00:03:09.579> check<00:03:09.730> that<00:03:09.790> what<00:03:10.450> did<00:03:10.540> we<00:03:10.599> just<00:03:10.780> talk

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
you check that what did we just talk

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.740 
you check that what did we just talk
about<00:03:11.079> our<00:03:11.319> boss<00:03:11.650> says<00:03:12.040> if<00:03:12.310> it's<00:03:12.849> pause<00:03:13.090> set<00:03:13.659> it

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
about our boss says if it's pause set it

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.740 
about our boss says if it's pause set it
to<00:03:13.840> true<00:03:14.019> if<00:03:14.319> it's<00:03:14.650> if<00:03:15.519> it's<00:03:15.730> not<00:03:16.150> pause<00:03:16.450> since

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
to true if it's if it's not pause since

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.339 
to true if it's if it's not pause since
the<00:03:16.900> false

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
the false

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:18.780 
the false
so<00:03:17.799> obviously<00:03:18.069> you<00:03:18.160> need<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.340> make<00:03:18.459> a<00:03:18.489> check

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
so obviously you need to make a check

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.599 
so obviously you need to make a check
and<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.150> check<00:03:19.359> is<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.540> simple<00:03:19.959> if<00:03:20.049> statement

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
and a check is a simple if statement

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.309 
and a check is a simple if statement
okay<00:03:21.639> inside<00:03:22.450> here<00:03:22.660> you're<00:03:22.810> gonna<00:03:22.900> check<00:03:23.260> to

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
okay inside here you're gonna check to

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.699 
okay inside here you're gonna check to
see<00:03:23.620> if<00:03:23.739> your<00:03:23.889> bowl<00:03:24.099> is<00:03:24.190> true<00:03:24.400> or<00:03:24.519> false<00:03:25.709> so

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
see if your bowl is true or false so

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.080 
see if your bowl is true or false so
obviously<00:03:27.280> you're<00:03:27.400> gonna<00:03:27.519> put<00:03:27.700> your<00:03:27.819> ball<00:03:27.970> in

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
obviously you're gonna put your ball in

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.270 
obviously you're gonna put your ball in
there<00:03:28.269> if<00:03:28.480> it's<00:03:28.660> true<00:03:29.019> then<00:03:29.379> do<00:03:29.680> this<00:03:29.859> so<00:03:30.099> do<00:03:30.220> a

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
there if it's true then do this so do a

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.610 
there if it's true then do this so do a
check<00:03:30.519> to<00:03:30.669> see<00:03:30.790> if<00:03:30.879> it's<00:03:31.000> true<00:03:31.060> or<00:03:31.239> false<00:03:31.620> then

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
check to see if it's true or false then

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.720 
check to see if it's true or false then
what<00:03:33.010> do<00:03:33.069> you<00:03:33.129> want<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:33.340> do<00:03:33.459> your<00:03:33.819> GUI<00:03:34.239> code<00:03:35.730> GUI

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
what do you want to do your GUI code GUI

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.189 
what do you want to do your GUI code GUI
code<00:03:38.099> you<00:03:39.099> put<00:03:39.129> a<00:03:39.310> GUI<00:03:39.609> box<00:03:39.940> don't<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:41.019> then

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:41.199 
code you put a GUI box don't and then

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.229 
code you put a GUI box don't and then
you<00:03:41.530> can<00:03:41.680> add<00:03:41.829> a<00:03:41.859> button<00:03:42.160> so<00:03:42.760> you<00:03:42.849> have<00:03:42.940> a<00:03:42.970> GOI

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
you can add a button so you have a GOI

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.479 
you can add a button so you have a GOI
box<00:03:43.480> that<00:03:43.660> pops<00:03:43.810> up<00:03:44.049> then<00:03:44.620> under<00:03:45.129> that<00:03:45.280> you

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
box that pops up then under that you

guys
two<00:04:16.419> things<00:04:16.599> I<00:04:16.900> want<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.500> menu<00:04:17.709> screen<00:04:17.889> to

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
two things I want the menu screen to

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.069 
two things I want the menu screen to
close<00:04:18.280> and<00:04:18.609> I<00:04:18.669> want<00:04:18.849> the<00:04:18.940> game<00:04:19.090> to<00:04:19.269> start<00:04:19.539> so

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
close and I want the game to start so

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.330 
close and I want the game to start so
obviously<00:04:20.469> I'm<00:04:20.590> going<00:04:20.680> to<00:04:20.829> set<00:04:21.010> what<00:04:21.219> I'm

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
obviously I'm going to set what I'm

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.880 
obviously I'm going to set what I'm
gonna<00:04:21.459> sit<00:04:21.729> my<00:04:21.760> is<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.780> game<00:04:22.930> pause<00:04:23.200> bool<00:04:23.590> to

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
gonna sit my is the game pause bool to

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:24.940 
gonna sit my is the game pause bool to
false

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
false

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.540 
false
so<00:04:25.070> is<00:04:25.250> paused<00:04:25.610> equals<00:04:26.480> to<00:04:26.660> false<00:04:26.960> and<00:04:27.550> then

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
so is paused equals to false and then

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.610 
so is paused equals to false and then
what<00:04:28.730> we<00:04:28.910> want<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.210> unbalance<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.110> game<00:04:30.320> so<00:04:30.530> we

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
what we want to unbalance the game so we

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.660 
what we want to unbalance the game so we
need<00:04:30.770> to<00:04:30.950> parse<00:04:31.670> our<00:04:32.180> pause<00:04:32.870> function<00:04:33.670> all

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
need to parse our pause function all

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.250 
need to parse our pause function all
right<00:04:34.760> and<00:04:34.940> what<00:04:35.030> that<00:04:35.210> does<00:04:35.420> is<00:04:35.690> if<00:04:36.110> the

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
right and what that does is if the

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.020 
right and what that does is if the
buttons<00:04:36.500> clicked<00:04:36.800> is<00:04:37.040> policy<00:04:37.400> was<00:04:37.670> the<00:04:37.700> false

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
buttons clicked is policy was the false

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.000 
buttons clicked is policy was the false
which<00:04:38.300> means<00:04:38.600> the<00:04:39.110> menu<00:04:39.380> screen<00:04:39.500> will<00:04:39.740> close

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
which means the menu screen will close

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.100 
which means the menu screen will close
on<00:04:40.400> top<00:04:41.060> of<00:04:41.240> that<00:04:41.330> it's<00:04:41.570> going<00:04:41.690> to<00:04:41.750> run<00:04:41.960> through

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
on top of that it's going to run through

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.870 
on top of that it's going to run through
our<00:04:42.140> pause<00:04:42.410> function<00:04:42.680> and<00:04:43.070> see<00:04:43.250> if<00:04:43.400> timescale

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
our pause function and see if timescale

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.350 
our pause function and see if timescale
is<00:04:43.910> zero<00:04:44.270> and<00:04:44.540> if<00:04:44.900> it's<00:04:45.050> not<00:04:45.230> zero<00:04:45.530> set<00:04:45.830> it<00:04:45.950> to<00:04:46.100> 1

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
is zero and if it's not zero set it to 1

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.640 
is zero and if it's not zero set it to 1
so<00:04:47.360> that<00:04:47.390> means<00:04:47.510> gonna<00:04:47.780> unpause<00:04:48.140> and<00:04:48.440> then<00:04:48.530> you

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
so that means gonna unpause and then you

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.520 
so that means gonna unpause and then you
can<00:04:48.800> also<00:04:48.920> add<00:04:49.100> in<00:04:49.250> a<00:04:49.400> debug<00:04:49.670> log<00:04:50.480> here<00:04:50.810> and

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
can also add in a debug log here and

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.880 
can also add in a debug log here and
what<00:04:51.740> that<00:04:51.920> would<00:04:52.070> do<00:04:52.220> is<00:04:52.430> that<00:04:52.700> what<00:04:53.150> say<00:04:53.890> you

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
what that would do is that what say you

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.090 
what that would do is that what say you
have<00:04:55.160> clicked<00:04:55.880> in<00:04:56.240> the<00:04:56.780> pot<00:04:57.080> the<00:04:57.410> unpause
