00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
by now I like briefly explain this and

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.560 
by now I like briefly explain this and
attribute<00:01:47.280> oh<00:01:47.399> great<00:01:47.640> it's<00:01:48.210> one<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.509> these

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
attribute oh great it's one of these

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.620 
attribute oh great it's one of these
little<00:01:48.930> bars<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:50.070> achieve<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.700> every

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
little bars and you achieve this every

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.719 
little bars and you achieve this every
seven<00:01:51.990> games<00:01:52.229> playing<00:01:52.710> my<00:01:52.860> career<00:01:53.159> games<00:01:53.399> only
