difference<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.570> notice<00:00:31.170> with<00:00:31.529> cutting

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
difference that I notice with cutting

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.100 
difference that I notice with cutting
dry<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.910> it's<00:00:33.329> kind<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.600> instant

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
dry is it's kind of instant

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.500 
dry is it's kind of instant
gratification<00:00:34.399> because<00:00:35.399> once<00:00:35.790> it's<00:00:35.969> wet<00:00:36.300> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
gratification because once it's wet and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.600 
gratification because once it's wet and
then<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.050> dries<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.530> usually<00:00:37.920> comes<00:00:38.250> up<00:00:38.520> a

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
then it dries it usually comes up a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.520 
then it dries it usually comes up a
couple<00:00:38.820> inches<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.300> like<00:00:39.450> when<00:00:39.629> it's<00:00:39.780> wet<00:00:40.350> it

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
couple inches so like when it's wet it

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.990 
couple inches so like when it's wet it
might<00:00:40.770> be<00:00:40.920> here<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.399> then<00:00:41.489> when<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.700> dry<00:00:41.940> it

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
might be here and then when you dry it

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.150 
might be here and then when you dry it
might<00:00:42.329> be<00:00:42.450> like<00:00:42.570> about<00:00:42.780> an<00:00:42.870> inch<00:00:43.020> shorter<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.950> I

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
might be like about an inch shorter so I

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.430 
might be like about an inch shorter so I
like<00:00:44.370> dry<00:00:44.700> just<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.539> fact<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.230> know

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
like dry just for the fact that you know

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.770 
like dry just for the fact that you know
what<00:00:46.620> you're<00:00:46.860> getting<00:00:47.039> but<00:00:47.789> either<00:00:48.239> way<00:00:48.570> it's

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
what you're getting but either way it's

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.299 
what you're getting but either way it's
fences<00:00:49.200> they've<00:00:49.320> been<00:00:49.469> cutting<00:00:49.680> hair<00:00:49.800> wet<00:00:50.100> for

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
fences they've been cutting hair wet for

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.720 
fences they've been cutting hair wet for
years<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:50.879> fine<00:00:51.320> so<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.649> cut<00:00:52.890> hair<00:00:53.160> or

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
years so it's fine so it's a cut hair or

this does is it kind of like detangles
the<00:01:13.470> hair<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.979> creates<00:01:14.490> tension<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.030> pulls

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the hair and creates tension and pulls

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.600 
the hair and creates tension and pulls
everything<00:01:15.540> down<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.890> you're<00:01:17.130> gonna<00:01:17.310> get

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
everything down so that you're gonna get

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.359 
a nice smooth piece of hair to cut and
once<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.570> smooth<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.140> down<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:23.040> could<00:01:23.250> do<00:01:23.340> a

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
once you smooth it down you could do a

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.280 
once you smooth it down you could do a
couple<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.820> things<00:01:24.000> some<00:01:24.390> people<00:01:24.720> use<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.110> as

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
couple of things some people use this as

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.380 
couple of things some people use this as
the<00:01:25.530> guide<00:01:25.710> some<00:01:26.280> people<00:01:26.580> say<00:01:26.790> ok<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.150> know

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the guide some people say ok you know

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.630 
the guide some people say ok you know
what<00:01:27.570> they'll<00:01:28.409> bring<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.860> here<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.250> then

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
what they'll bring it here and then

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.550 
what they'll bring it here and then
they'll<00:01:29.820> cut<00:01:30.090> right<00:01:30.600> underneath<00:01:31.049> where<00:01:31.200> this

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
they'll cut right underneath where this

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.289 
they'll cut right underneath where this
is<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.860> if<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.009> say<00:01:32.310> ok<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.700> want<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.939> trim<00:01:33.150> off

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
is that if you say ok I want to trim off

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.780 
is that if you say ok I want to trim off
this<00:01:33.479> much<00:01:33.750> they'll<00:01:34.409> use<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.009> comb<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.670> that

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
this much they'll use the comb so that

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.609 
this much they'll use the comb so that
they<00:01:35.909> get<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.090> nice<00:01:36.329> even<00:01:36.780> line<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.290> don't<00:01:37.380> have

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
they get a nice even line you don't have

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.350 
they get a nice even line you don't have
to<00:01:37.799> do<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.579> can<00:01:38.759> if<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.030> want<00:01:39.210> to

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
to do that but you can if you want to

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.560 
to do that but you can if you want to
but<00:01:40.170> my<00:01:40.860> recommendation<00:01:41.220> would<00:01:41.790> be<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:42.420> you

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
but my recommendation would be if you

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.910 
but my recommendation would be if you
just<00:01:42.600> want<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.930> trim<00:01:43.110> off<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.290> little<00:01:43.530> bit<00:01:43.740> you

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
just want to trim off a little bit you

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.069 
just want to trim off a little bit you
trim<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.280> off<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.790> straight<00:01:45.030> line<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.570> then

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
trim it off in a straight line and then

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.870 
trim it off in a straight line and then
you<00:01:46.200> go<00:01:46.320> back<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.950> point<00:01:47.250> cut<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.640> if

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
you go back in and you point cut it if

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.630 
you go back in and you point cut it if
you<00:01:48.750> don't<00:01:49.320> want<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.770> point<00:01:49.979> cut<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.399> hair

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
you don't want to point cut the hair

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.730 
you don't want to point cut the hair
it's<00:01:51.270> gonna<00:01:51.479> be<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.720> little<00:01:51.930> bit<00:01:52.110> more<00:01:52.229> bulky<00:01:52.649> at

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
it's gonna be a little bit more bulky at

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.380 
it's gonna be a little bit more bulky at
the<00:01:52.860> ends<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.250> sometimes<00:01:53.700> people<00:01:54.149> with

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
the ends and sometimes people with

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.359 
the ends and sometimes people with
thinner<00:01:54.689> hair<00:01:55.049> they<00:01:55.560> don't<00:01:55.890> want<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.159> point

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
thinner hair they don't want to point

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.039 
thinner hair they don't want to point
cut<00:01:56.579> or<00:01:56.790> thin<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.119> out<00:01:57.210> because<00:01:57.420> they<00:01:57.689> want<00:01:57.899> it

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
cut or thin it out because they want it

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.959 
cut or thin it out because they want it
to<00:01:58.110> look<00:01:58.320> like<00:01:58.590> they<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.040> more<00:01:59.250> hair<00:01:59.490> but<00:01:59.880> if

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
to look like they have more hair but if

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.880

you have curly hair or if you have a lot

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.319 
you have curly hair or if you have a lot
of<00:02:01.920> hair<00:02:02.219> it's<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:02.729> going<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.909> be<00:02:03.060> really

of hair it's just going to be really
really<00:02:03.570> bulky<00:02:03.960> if<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.170> don't<00:02:04.320> break<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.710> up

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
really bulky if you don't break it up

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.109 
really bulky if you don't break it up
with<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> little<00:02:05.219> bit<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.460> point<00:02:05.670> cutting<00:02:05.880> on

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
with a little bit of point cutting on

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.999 
with a little bit of point cutting on
your<00:02:06.299> trim<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.899> if<00:02:07.320> you're<00:02:07.469> not<00:02:07.649> just<00:02:07.890> trying

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009

want to take off a couple of inches you

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.920

would<00:02:12.120> section<00:02:12.720> out

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
would section out

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.349 
would section out
the<00:02:13.019> hair<00:02:13.260> use<00:02:14.069> your<00:02:14.250> hair<00:02:14.430> cutting<00:02:14.670> comb<00:02:14.969> comb

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:15.359 
the hair use your hair cutting comb comb

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:17.509 
the hair use your hair cutting comb comb
through<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.079> decide<00:02:16.439> where<00:02:17.069> it<00:02:17.219> is<00:02:17.310> that

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
through it and decide where it is that

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.339 
through it and decide where it is that
she<00:02:17.700> wants<00:02:17.969> your<00:02:18.090> shortest<00:02:18.629> length<00:02:18.989> of<00:02:19.200> hair

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
she wants your shortest length of hair

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.920 
she wants your shortest length of hair
to<00:02:19.560> fall<00:02:19.739> so<00:02:20.340> like<00:02:20.519> say<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.760> wanted<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.299> cut<00:02:21.840> it

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
to fall so like say you wanted to cut it

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.059 
to fall so like say you wanted to cut it
up<00:02:22.079> to<00:02:22.260> like<00:02:22.409> right<00:02:22.620> here

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
up to like right here

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.539 
up to like right here
you'd<00:02:24.060> bring<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.450> comb<00:02:24.629> up<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.959> there<00:02:25.549> then

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
you'd bring the comb up to there then

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.190 
you'd bring the comb up to there then
you'd<00:02:26.730> pretty<00:02:26.939> much<00:02:27.180> cut<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.900> straight<00:02:28.109> across

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
you'd pretty much cut it straight across

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.830 
you'd pretty much cut it straight across
and<00:02:28.799> again<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:29.879> gives<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.269> nice<00:02:30.510> straight

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
and again this gives you a nice straight

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.869 
and again this gives you a nice straight
line<00:02:31.079> and<00:02:31.349> then<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.219> can<00:02:32.370> go<00:02:32.489> back<00:02:32.700> in<00:02:32.849> and

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
line and then you can go back in and

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.699 
line and then you can go back in and
either<00:02:33.150> point<00:02:33.480> cut<00:02:33.689> it<00:02:33.840> or<00:02:33.989> leave<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.200> blunt<00:02:34.560> if

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
either point cut it or leave it blunt if

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:35.780 
either point cut it or leave it blunt if
that's<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.069> way<00:02:35.159> you<00:02:35.219> like<00:02:35.459> it

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790
