00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.199
 is 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.540
 the 2014-2015 season is a season 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.400
 very special for only goalkeepers because 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.320
 thanks to iago herrerín and athletic club 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.930
 it is very likely that we will finally debute 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.700
 with our gloves in champions league 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.290
 a goalkeeper who debuts champions has 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.600
 to be as comfortable as possible and for 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.360
 we talked to James and we have 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.760
 created a glove totally adapted to 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.800
 your needs both in needs 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.170
 functional in terms of characteristics 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.950
 of the glove as to your preferences of 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.660
 color in the athletic club they like the 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.610
 Sober doormen dress sober and for 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.920
 that we have made a glove totally 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.680
 black both the palm and the back with 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.110
 a very striking yellow color the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.030
 value base 309 is the glove that 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.670
 he has always used reding in his those 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.110
 years in the athletic modified with all 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.649
 the tastes of arrived that we're going to move to 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.649
 detail below 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.220
 the back of the glove is the standard back 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.860
 that we see in the other models of the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.990
 line value is made up of a piece that 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.720
 protects the knuckles to help us 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.460
 clear a cut that separates the four 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.080
 fingers of the knuckle area creating 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.090
 a point of flexion and that is going to 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.300
 allow all four fingers to work 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.090
 in block a central part of textile mp 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.640
 efe to give flexibility to the glove 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.109
 and transpiration inside a piece 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.820
 special that protects the thumb that is the 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.740
 great difference of the value models of 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.450
 years gone the thumb was too much 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.969
 free and in this case we have wanted 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.950
 reinforce it and a piece of latex that's 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.960
 at the base of the back and extending 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.170
 up to the wrist area as we will see 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.170
 later 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.950
 up to here the parts that I already do not 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.600
 modify the current value 309 if we pass 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.640
 the palm and so we find 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.950
 very important differences and I do 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.869
 approved the muse model liked the 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.640
 back of the value convinced him more for that 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.680
 we have adapted the musée court to 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.290
 hybrid cut with roll finger in the 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.700
 side fingers and negative cut of two 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.130
 central ie the roll cut 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.480
 negative for this value model with 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.700
 which we already got a feeling 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.769
 totally different and something asks us to 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.810
 we are always talking about 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.040
 that we play in the Basque country and it rains 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.200
 a lot we're going to play champions 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.510
 we need a latex that gives us maximum 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.160
 grip in water there is something you love 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.910
 armed gloves until the point of the year 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.680
 past 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.510
 wore gloves with protections to which 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.879
 I removed the protection for 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.280
 to write down more more latex roses for 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.159
 that what we have done on this occasion 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.040
 is to put duo duo with many already know 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.450
 it is latex inside the glove if 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.799
 let's go back to glove we found 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.780
 in the part that comes in contact with the 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.000
 palm of our hand is also latex 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.670
 in this way we are going to get a 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.890
 Extra thick latex and a perfect 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.890
 fit between the glove and our hand 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:11.519
 we ended up doing the analysis as 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.109
 always with the wristband and the closure and 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.690
 this is the last of the aspects that already 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:18.299
 I change the back is a model 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.920
 value the palm is that of the muse model and 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.720
 for closing choose the new model 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.550
 something 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.410
 as we can see the closing strip is 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.030
 an elastic closure strip that gives two 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.640
 turns as we have been using in the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.350
 nowa models of recent years that what 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.010
 which will allow is to adjust the tension 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.630
 of the closure to our liking 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.850
 as we had said previously 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.990
 the latex piece on the back we can see 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.120
 that extends into the area the 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.240
 wristband so when we adjust the 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.280
 elastic closure of two laps we are going to 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.860
 get besides getting the tension 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.360
 that we want for the adjustment that 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.070
 when we move the doll 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.860
 This piece serves as a support between 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:59.750
 between the part of the body of the hand with 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:02.100
 the joint and where the arm starts 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.450
 therefore iago herrerín is going to have his 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.440
 exclusive model model with which he goes 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.990
 dispute the champions league the 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.130
 2014-2015 season with all the 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.860
 modifications that you have requested and 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:15.500
 resulting to be a hybrid glove between 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.500
 the value of the muse and the closing of the walnut
