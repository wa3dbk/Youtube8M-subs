00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.360
 hello i am robert grants welcome 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.860
 to the norm shot dot com and 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.219
 today we will experiment with what 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.379
 called while I call it 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.660
 a blur in the spotlight 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.330
 the world of zone of sharpness is the Japanese word 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.880
 to achieve this we have prepared 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.029
 playground reflective background material 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.230
 divided on the blackboard the subject will be 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:35.059
 serve crayons which is good 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.890
 fit to illustrate this technique 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.110
 still let's take a look at the highlight as 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.980
 it is to highlight a small constant light 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.670
 and let's start well, well, this is 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.620
 backlight that shines on the left 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.239
 used a simple lamp on the clamp one hundred 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.399
 cotton power through this parchment 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.960
 it is the main light and always better 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.520
 start installing fixtures 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.940
 alternately make it easier 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.979
 adjust the balance so this one 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.369
 light fixture will help us install 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.369
 exposure 

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:13.759
 as you can see, I have already sketched some 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:17.210
 composition here to make it look 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.609
 interesting scattered pieces and so 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.170
 we have a camera lens set to 70 200 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:25.969
 millimeters zoom lens and after 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.149
 experiments set the following 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:32.119
 exposure ass 100 two-second 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:35.299
 shutter speed f 18 aperture may seem 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.880
 that the f-18 will expand too focus but because 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.310
 the fact that it is a long focal lens 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:47.840
 will be enough to erode forming 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:50.329
 beech tree and so here is our first shot 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.879
 looks pretty good now let's 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:58.969
 let's take a god and now i'm behind 

00:01:55.879 --> 00:02:01.399
 playgrounds are hanging invisible black 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:03.920
 paper stretched to the floor two 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:08.509
 lamp behind the paper aimed 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:12.470
 on paper and straight on the table which is 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.630
 it is a 200 watt lamp and now i'm 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:20.209
 go around to the front and show you how 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.049
 create god and well here I am again 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.450
 in front 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.340
 this is the front side of the paper you do not 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.290
 such a huge piece of paper is required 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.599
 can use card 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.750
 smaller size it should be black 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.549
 and now I am making a hole I decided 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.410
 use ordinary pencil and 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:41.230
 wooden stick from the grocery 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:44.269
 store we need to punch holes 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.940
 towards the camera so they 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.980
 turned out to be straight behind the crayons so 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.340
 making sure the direction is doing 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.340
 hole 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:58.090
 i use two different sizes because 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.549
 that it creates a feeling of different 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:11.170
 remoteness 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:14.790
 forming a bouquet continue to perforate and you 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.790
 do it there at your discretion 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.980
 well now we have a background with 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.769
 paper holes 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.319
 through which light breaks from two 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.260
 lamps forming points of light now we 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.900
 will refocus to the foreground and 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.319
 see how about the effect 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.319
 bokeh 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.459
 the background out of focus forms this 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.709
 baggage is not a sparkling effect now 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:51.670
 take a picture of the camera and see 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.440
 that we will turn out great we 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.199
 got a bug with small stellar 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.060
 rays 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:04:01.770
 let's see the placement 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.480
 now you can see the placement completely 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.240
 the camera is foreground 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.700
 which is the table and the bokeh effect on 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.340
 background side light left 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.819
 three lamps on the terminals with a total capacity of 3 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.340
 has become 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.890
 one piece of parchment provide us 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.900
 this effect is not the only way 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.959
 creating bp but it's a good way 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.350
 achieve the effect here is now I 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.570
 I will do one last thing to add 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:32.850
 colors securing the red light filter with 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:36.720
 right side and blue light filter with 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.750
 left side and in the middle of a small 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.610
 a segment without a filter will add variety 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.410
 also see that a brighter area 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:49.130
 formed closer paper lamp a 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:52.530
 the area of ​​the illuminated lamp is darker 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.410
 therefore, a darker ce is formed. 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.180
 and here is a bright book so you can 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.550
 adjust the intensity to your 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.770
 discretion 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.770
 well now let's get the pictures 

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:10.119
 Well, the year the result looks great 

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:16.599
 bokeh effect of different colors in a pleasant 

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:18.839
 frame here you liked this video about 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:22.589
 creating a book in the studio 

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:25.659
 a pair of lamps on the clips a piece of parchment 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:27.909
 is achieved easily and just try 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:30.839
 yourself and send pictures to our site we 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:34.239
 with pleasure we will see them and see you on 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:38.219
 our dot com translation is done 

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:38.219
 specifically for company photo 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.010
