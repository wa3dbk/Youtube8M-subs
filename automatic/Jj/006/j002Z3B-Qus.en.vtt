movies<00:06:57.439> just<00:06:57.800> a<00:06:57.979> little<00:06:58.219> bit<00:06:58.340> more<00:06:58.550> I<00:06:59.319> think<00:07:00.319> I

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:00.409 
movies just a little bit more I think I

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:02.830 
movies just a little bit more I think I
would<00:07:00.530> go<00:07:00.680> for<00:07:00.710> it<00:07:01.039> I<00:07:01.189> think<00:07:01.879> that<00:07:02.330> complete

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:02.840 
would go for it I think that complete

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.119 
would go for it I think that complete
package<00:07:03.259> of<00:07:03.439> services<00:07:03.650> is<00:07:04.400> is<00:07:05.180> not<00:07:05.479> bad<00:07:05.750> at<00:07:05.960> all

00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:06.129 
package of services is is not bad at all

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:10.779 
package of services is is not bad at all
so<00:07:07.129> just<00:07:07.520> just<00:07:07.879> a<00:07:08.029> little<00:07:08.240> tip<00:07:08.360> later
