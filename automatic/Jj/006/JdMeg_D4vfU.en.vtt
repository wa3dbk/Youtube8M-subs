00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.369
 hello today we are starting the series 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.949
 video about clan ratings a before 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.930
 I want to begin to report that we have appeared 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.340
 VKontakte group which will be 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.500
 publish all videos 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.099
 as well as some news link to 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.650
 group in the description so today you 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.170
 learn about the clan's rating from the site's reservation 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.540
 find out the rating value for your 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.710
 clan you can directly on the armor 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.690
 site link in the description go to 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.610
 formula 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.390
 where g is the number of players in the clan 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.449
 m and diana rating his players m median 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.520
 calculated in the following ranking order 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.789
 clan players are ranked descending 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.190
 ascending for an odd number of players 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.649
 the median is equal to 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.390
 the middle of the list for an even number 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.159
 players median is equal to average 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.950
 arithmetic of two values 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.080
 being in the middle of the formula list 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.439
 simply enough therefore 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.409
 given many special cases 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:18.600
 consider a few examples 1 let's say 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.210
 99 people are in the clan 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.159
 then the median will be equal to 50 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.409
 player example 1302 is valid in 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.049
 clan 100 people then the median will be 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.549
 equal to arithmetic average ratings 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:40.400
 50 and 51 players in this case 1300 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.780
 plus 1,400 divided by 2 equals 1,350 a 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.320
 now consider a few extreme 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.399
 cases 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:51.119
 1 let's say the clan consists of 99 people 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:54.450
 50 of them have a rating of 1000 a 49 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.000
 players rating equal to 8 thousand them in this 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.970
 case the median is 1000 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.840
 2 in the opposite case when in the clan for 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.030
 worth 50 people with a rating of 8000 and 49 with 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.240
 a rating of 1000 the median will be equal to 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.820
 eight thousand and so the players 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.770
 rated higher by site reservation or 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.840
 lower medians do not render direct 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.310
 impact on the final rating 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.660
 but affect the location of the median 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.010
 consider an example when the contribution of a hundred 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.410
 human median will be calculated as 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.980
 arithmetic average rating of 50 and 51 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.770
 player on the screen you see three tables in 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.260
 first case 51 clan player has 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.709
 ranking a thousand and median for this clan 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:45.060
 equal to 1000 in the second case 50 player 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.050
 has a rating of 1051 8000 median is equal to 4 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.400
 and a half thousand 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:53.430
 in the third case both 50 and 51 players have 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.220
 rating of 8000 respectively median 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.930
 equal to 8 thousand this example to us 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.120
 shows that for the clan in which 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.070
 even number of players influence on 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.830
 already two players have median 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.840
 Now let's see what happens with 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.560
 median clan when it enters 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.769
 new player 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.370
 you see five plates on the first 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.370
 table 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.850
 the initial state of the clan is ten 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.080
 fighters 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:21.810
 median is equal to 1550 on the second table in 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.299
 clan accept a player with a rating of 2000 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.450
 median shifts and increase its 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.290
 value 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.950
 on 3 tables he is his brother's rating is 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.959
 1600 which is also higher than the previous Diana 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.970
 comparing 2 and 3 tables makes 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.489
 conclude that taking a player with 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.440
 rated above the median the club raises 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.440
 our clan and we see no matter 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.450
 how cool is the player from table 4 we 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.030
 we see that the reception of a player with a rating 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.480
 equal media don't see table 1 not 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.959
 changes the median it is 5 the table shows 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.880
 how not to do so 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.650
 recruiting weak players to the clan 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.200
 rather players below rated 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.019
 clan's current median you lower 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.890
 ranking of clans and gaining players with 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.540
 rated higher than the median increase 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.480
 This rule can be applied to 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:21.549
 player exclusions remove weak 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:23.770
 scream and raise the rating it but there is 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.770
 one feature if the number of players 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.479
 your clan is equal to 50 one and each 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.820
 of which are about equal good 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.440
 indicators then it makes sense to you 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.590
 dial 49 days 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.600
 twinks like them why but because 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.880
 besides the median there is a second 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.169
 factor 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.150
 decimal logarithm of the number 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.490
 clan players 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.580
 if the clan is the one person 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.310
 this multiplier is zero if in clan 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.310
 10 people then logarithm is one 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.310
 if the clan is packed to capacity, the median 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.590
 will be multiplied by 2 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.930
 it follows that if you increase 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.479
 clan personnel rated players 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.820
 slightly less than the median it can turn 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.800
 so that the overall rating of clans will grow 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.160
 despite the decrease in median 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.620
 since the graph is nonlinear the more 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.380
 clan fighters the less will be increase 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.330
 from increasing their number of recruits 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.610
 and now back to one of 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.250
 considered cases but we will take into account 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.040
 decimal logarithm as you can see 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.190
 adding 11 fighters to this clan 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.200
 Anyway increase the third clan 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:36.280
 And finally, consider an example 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:39.460
 real calculation of the rating of the clan e25 on 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.120
 the moment of creating the video in the clan consisted of 71 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.640
 person 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.270
 hence after sorting the median 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:49.920
 equal to the player's 36 rating value 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:53.320
 In this case, it is 4 1184 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.590
 the decimal logarithm of 71 is approximately equal to 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.910
 1 whole eighty five hundredths 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.250
 multiply the logarithm by the median and 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:04.570
 we get 1 point eighty five 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:08.320
 multiply by 4000 184 equals 7 thousand 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:10.870
 seven hundred and forty-five point 83 acres 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.750
 E25 clan rating at the time of creation 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.400
 video would also like to note that 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.030
 clan rating is calculated separately 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.830
 for occasional fight and fighting on gk 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.940
 the case if the player did not participate special 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.090
 fights his rating gk is equal to one 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.010
 parameter 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.710
 command level is calculated as 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.990
 rank at z to divide into place 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.150
 in the ranking by random is enough 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.460
 conditional and not accurate indicator more 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:39.790
 explained the author as a reason for conversation 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.290
 ratings worth noting a few more 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.930
 moments first 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.270
 in the top 500 are allowed clans in which 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.400
 more than ten players 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.710
 2 if for half and more players 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.840
 clan rating is missing then rating 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.030
 clan is zero 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:58.540
 3 clan rating is updated when 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:01.000
 viewing the clan page go to 

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.950
 tips on how to increase your clan rating from 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.960
 reservation site 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:06.030
 tip 1 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.460
 the more players are in the clan 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:12.210
 above his rating of 100 units of personal 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:14.639
 composition will increase the medians together advice 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.979
 second try to recruit players with 

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:19.229
 rated higher than the median each such 

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:22.699
 the player will raise the bar and median 

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:25.020
 hence clan rating board 3 

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:27.030
 exclude players at the lowest 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.889
 rating indicators it also 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:31.919
 a positive impact on the situation 

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:34.620
 medians and its value in general all 

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:36.630
 trite enough for every clan 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.289
 have their own nuances most of 

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:42.539
 which we reviewed earlier 

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:44.310
