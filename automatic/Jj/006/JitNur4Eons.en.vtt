 very good girls very good guys and 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.200
 tight and we are in a new news 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.259
 with the reasons and the reasons for the casualties 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.409
 playstation 4 sales japan 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:17.300
 disappointing sales I would say and they are not 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:20.570
 and an area not the low sales of 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.610
 playstation 4 japan argues with the 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.210
 lack of Japanese developments and the 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.570
 controversy of streaming the reality to 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.689
 today is that playstation 4 is not 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.780
 selling anything right or as expected 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.760
 in japan in fact some weeks has 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.819
 been widely surpassed by 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.559
 playstation vita or nintendo wii and this 

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:45.350
 it is a reality and with our reality 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.329
 you have to tell it has nothing that the 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.269
 sales the super sales that are 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.460
 taking the rest of the world with japan 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.210
 and it is something that very much hits the 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.200
 attention not 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.690
 It must be said that this has been shocked 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.570
 with the unstoppable success that is having 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.450
 precision 4 in the west are and ensures 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.479
 that the current lack of interest of the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.970
 Japanese studies will end up happening what 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.920
 that will motivate sales as soon as 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.590
 start to get more started 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.869
 development of Japanese games 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.229
 the truth and the conclusion to which it arrives 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.960
 they are is that there are no games of this draft 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.000
 for this market and then 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.670
 andrews goes responsible for sony 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.490
 computer entertainment has said what 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.069
 following the streaming function of 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.189
 games in a simple and direct way is 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:39.689
 more complicated to establish in Japan 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.399
 this does not comment in relation to 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.799
 cultural difficulties of the 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.140
 orientals to open up to issues 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.450
 cybernetics that go against the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.390
 privacy of the network or contents 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.220
 uncensored audiences are and estimates that 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.380
 in the next two years the figures for 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.739
 Precision sales 4 until the good in 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.119
 this in this territory something that they have 

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:02.400
 done from the first day on the rest 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.770
 of the world but not 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.470
 territory and how are things that 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.290
 I want to tell them and the truth is that 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.860
 nothing is going well for them and let's see 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.840
 how to solve this lack of catalog 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.230
 not without the rest of the world the rest 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.090
 West since we complain about 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.890
 missing fire not from the lack of 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.950
 catalogs imagined in a territory 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.250
 as the Japanese that 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.250
 I want games like yakuza or a 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.260
 game so call attention but not 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.090
 there is none of this yet you already know 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.220
 I want you to always tell me 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.989

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.420
