reading more than math so a few years
ago<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.310> decided<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.939> pursue<00:00:24.359> my<00:00:24.570> master's

ago I decided to pursue my master's

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.080 
ago I decided to pursue my master's
degree<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:25.560> reading<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.099> hopes<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.609> becoming<00:00:26.730> a

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090

degree in reading in hopes of becoming a
reading<00:00:27.390> specialist<00:00:28.369> unfortunately<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.609> have

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
reading specialist unfortunately I have

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.540 
reading specialist unfortunately I have
just<00:00:30.539> moved<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> new<00:00:31.289> area<00:00:31.560> where<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.279> was

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
just moved to a new area where I was

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.880 
just moved to a new area where I was
hired<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> math<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.270> science<00:00:33.480> teacher<00:00:33.890> so

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
hired as a math and science teacher so

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.639 
hired as a math and science teacher so
my<00:00:35.040> worlds<00:00:35.460> weren't<00:00:35.730> exactly<00:00:36.210> cooperating<00:00:36.649> or

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
my worlds weren't exactly cooperating or

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.180 
my worlds weren't exactly cooperating or
so<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:37.950> thought<00:00:38.280> as<00:00:39.050> I<00:00:40.050> studied<00:00:40.410> new<00:00:40.620> strategies

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
so I thought as I studied new strategies

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.010 
so I thought as I studied new strategies
for<00:00:41.219> reading<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.910> came<00:00:42.149> across<00:00:42.300> one<00:00:42.780> with<00:00:42.989> a

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
for reading I came across one with a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.990 
for reading I came across one with a
fancy<00:00:43.500> name<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:43.980> thought<00:00:44.309> I'd<00:00:44.460> never<00:00:44.670> seen

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
fancy name that I thought I'd never seen

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.610 
fancy name that I thought I'd never seen
before

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
before

before

reciprocal teaching including all of
these<00:00:48.030> wonderful<00:00:48.329> qualities<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.289> promote

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
these wonderful qualities that promote

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.979 
these wonderful qualities that promote
engagement<00:00:49.860> foster<00:00:50.820> individuality<00:00:51.390> and

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
engagement foster individuality and

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.600

provides students with a voice in their

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.939 
provides students with a voice in their
education<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:55.050> seemed<00:00:55.289> just<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
education and it seemed just like the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.529 
education and it seemed just like the
literature<00:00:56.399> circles<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.149> had<00:00:57.360> been<00:00:57.510> using

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
literature circles that I had been using

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.979 
literature circles that I had been using
for<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:57.989> past<00:00:58.230> eight<00:00:58.559> years<00:00:59.449> so<00:01:00.449> when<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.690> had

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
for the past eight years so when I had

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.810 
for the past eight years so when I had
to<00:01:01.109> write<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.320> paper<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:01.770> how<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> reciprocal

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
to write a paper on how a reciprocal

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.520 
to write a paper on how a reciprocal
teaching<00:01:03.000> could<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.539> used<00:01:03.780> as<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> strategy<00:01:04.290> for

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
teaching could be used as a strategy for

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.260 
teaching could be used as a strategy for
problem<00:01:05.070> solving<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.549> math<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:06.060> thought

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
problem solving in math I thought

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.750 
problem solving in math I thought
finally<00:01:06.720> something<00:01:07.500> relevant<00:01:07.799> being

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
finally something relevant being

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.030 
finally something relevant being
comfortable<00:01:09.330> with<00:01:09.510> literature<00:01:09.840> circles<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
comfortable with literature circles the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.039 
comfortable with literature circles the
more<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.280> read<00:01:11.549> about<00:01:11.700> how<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.119> strategy<00:01:12.750> fit

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
more I read about how the strategy fit

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.320 
more I read about how the strategy fit
into<00:01:13.260> any<00:01:13.590> math<00:01:13.860> classroom<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:15.060> more<00:01:15.299> I

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
into any math classroom the more I

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.030 
into any math classroom the more I
realized<00:01:15.840> how<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.200> could<00:01:16.409> fit<00:01:16.590> into<00:01:16.770> my

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
realized how this could fit into my

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.160 
realized how this could fit into my
classroom<00:01:19.610> up<00:01:20.610> until<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.210> point<00:01:21.330> most<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.049> my

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.679 
too much whole group instruction
not<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.610> discredit<00:01:30.240> whole<00:01:30.479> group

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
not that I discredit whole group

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.020 
not that I discredit whole group
instruction<00:01:31.040> but<00:01:32.040> I'm<00:01:32.159> pretty<00:01:32.400> sure<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.790> was

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
instruction but I'm pretty sure I was

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.060 
instruction but I'm pretty sure I was
only<00:01:33.210> reaching<00:01:33.659> about<00:01:33.900> 20%<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.680> my<00:01:34.770> class

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
only reaching about 20% of my class

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.890 
only reaching about 20% of my class
which<00:01:35.790> happened<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> ones<00:01:36.750> that

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
which happened to be the ones that

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.399 
which happened to be the ones that
already<00:01:37.170> knew<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.740> answers<00:01:39.380> so<00:01:40.380> I

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
already knew the answers so I

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.499 
already knew the answers so I
restructured<00:01:41.250> my<00:01:41.400> classroom<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.150> slid

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
restructured my classroom and slid

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.420 
restructured my classroom and slid
