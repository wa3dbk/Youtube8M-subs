creating these green jobs and why it's

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.380 
creating these green jobs and why it's
so<00:00:19.740> important<00:00:20.310> right<00:00:20.670> now<00:00:22.820> this<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.000> one

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
and clean sector the one resources that

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.479 
and clean sector the one resources that
were<00:00:39.930> not<00:00:40.079> challenged<00:00:40.590> with<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.460> fact

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
were not challenged with is the fact

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.280 
were not challenged with is the fact
that<00:00:41.700> we<00:00:41.820> have<00:00:41.940> 7<00:00:42.420> billion<00:00:42.600> people<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.229 
that we have 7 billion people on the
planet<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.040> think<00:00:44.340> we<00:00:44.430> should<00:00:44.460> not<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:44.850> so

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
solar panels on low-income houses we are

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.170 
solar panels on low-income houses we are
again<00:01:14.939> live<00:01:15.330> from<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:17.220> ports<00:01:17.520> here<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.970> Los

Angeles for the last 30 years the port's
have<00:01:20.490> been<00:01:20.670> known<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.330> place<00:01:21.570> where<00:01:21.600> old

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
have been known as the place where old

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.859 
have been known as the place where old
dirty<00:01:22.229> trucks<00:01:22.560> go<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.860> die<00:01:23.130> because<00:01:23.729> all<00:01:24.270> truck

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
dirty trucks go to die because all truck

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.510 
dirty trucks go to die because all truck
drivers<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:25.320> afford<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.979> low<00:01:26.100> wages<00:01:26.310> that

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
drivers can afford on the low wages that

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.130 
drivers can afford on the low wages that
they<00:01:26.580> make<00:01:26.880> are<00:01:27.090> very<00:01:27.330> old<00:01:27.570> polluting

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
they make are very old polluting

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.890 
they make are very old polluting
machines<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.460> unwittingly<00:01:30.450> they're

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
machines and so unwittingly they're

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.600 
machines and so unwittingly they're
contributing<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.950> pollution<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.460> their

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
contributing to the pollution of their

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.850 
contributing to the pollution of their
own<00:01:32.759> communities<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.110> what<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.439> want<00:01:34.680> to

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
own communities and so what we want to

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.800 
own communities and so what we want to
see<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.310> want<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.670> see<00:01:35.820> big<00:01:36.060> industry<00:01:36.600> players

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
