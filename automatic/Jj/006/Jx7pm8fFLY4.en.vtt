hammer<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.149> China<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.920> try<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.980> use<00:00:59.160> mainly<00:00:59.640> the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300

K<00:01:00.690> series<00:01:01.020> symbols<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:01.949> think<00:01:02.129> they<00:01:02.219> have

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
K series symbols I just think they have

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.779 
K series symbols I just think they have
a<00:01:02.460> really<00:01:03.300> warm<00:01:03.780> tone<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:05.009> lot<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.399> attack

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:05.789 
a really warm tone but a lot of attack

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:07.820 
a really warm tone but a lot of attack
in<00:01:06.030> them<00:01:06.149> which<00:01:06.600> i<00:01:06.720> think<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:07.020> really<00:01:07.200> helpful

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
in them which i think is really helpful

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.160 
in them which i think is really helpful
with<00:01:08.429> you<00:01:09.179> know<00:01:09.300> if<00:01:09.390> you're<00:01:09.509> playing<00:01:09.720> metal

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
with you know if you're playing metal

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.559 
with you know if you're playing metal
things<00:01:10.830> like<00:01:11.039> that<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.280> feel<00:01:11.670> like<00:01:11.910> attack<00:01:12.330> is

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:12.569 
things like that I feel like attack is

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:15.680 
things like that I feel like attack is
really<00:01:12.599> necessary<00:01:13.130> but<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.910> warm<00:01:15.179> tones<00:01:15.420> are

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
really necessary but the warm tones are

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.230 
really necessary but the warm tones are
