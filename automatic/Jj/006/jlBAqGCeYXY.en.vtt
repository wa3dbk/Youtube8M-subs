the chest
but<00:03:29.660> just<00:03:29.990> because<00:03:30.110> it'd<00:03:30.290> be<00:03:30.320> so<00:03:30.500> difficult<00:03:30.770> to

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
but just because it'd be so difficult to

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.100 
but just because it'd be so difficult to
animate<00:03:31.190> they<00:03:31.370> scrapped<00:03:31.790> it<00:03:32.000> but<00:03:32.240> you<00:03:32.930> want<00:03:33.080> to

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110

keep<00:03:33.230> it<00:03:33.380> original<00:03:33.590> to<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.150> original<00:03:35.150> design

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
keep it original to the original design

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.900 
keep it original to the original design
then<00:03:36.800> you<00:03:36.830> can<00:03:37.040> put<00:03:37.160> that<00:03:37.280> white<00:03:37.520> piece<00:03:37.730> in

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
then you can put that white piece in

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.400 
then you can put that white piece in
there<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:39.560> get<00:03:39.740> a<00:03:39.800> rifle<00:03:40.780> on<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:41.810> weirder<00:03:42.200> we're

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.100 
there you get a rifle on a weirder we're
looking<00:03:42.680> rifles<00:03:43.070> you<00:03:43.910> can<00:03:44.120> extend<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.930> back

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
looking rifles you can extend the back

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.960 
looking rifles you can extend the back
part<00:03:45.470> so<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.709> opens<00:03:45.920> up<00:03:46.040> a<00:03:46.100> secondary<00:03:46.459> handle

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
part so it opens up a secondary handle

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.030 
part so it opens up a secondary handle
if<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:47.180> twist<00:03:47.480> that<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:47.870> locks<00:03:48.050> into<00:03:48.290> place

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.970 

and<00:03:52.040> close<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.430> back<00:03:52.550> up<00:03:53.140> it's<00:03:54.140> a<00:03:54.230> little<00:03:54.410> all

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
and close it back up it's a little all

and close it back up it's a little all
these<00:03:55.190> weapons<00:03:55.459> are<00:03:55.550> a<00:03:55.580> little<00:03:55.970> difficult<00:03:56.420> to

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
these weapons are a little difficult to

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.630 
these weapons are a little difficult to
get<00:03:56.630> the<00:03:56.750> gun<00:03:56.900> to<00:03:57.110> hold<00:03:57.860> on<00:03:58.070> to<00:03:58.250> but<00:03:58.370> once<00:03:58.520> you

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
get the gun to hold on to but once you

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.979 
get the gun to hold on to but once you
have<00:03:58.730> it<00:03:58.820> locked<00:03:58.970> in<00:03:59.209> and<00:03:59.420> then<00:03:59.600> there<00:03:59.750> it's

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
have it locked in and then there it's

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.520 
have it locked in and then there it's
really<00:04:00.709> solid<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.370> no<00:04:01.489> problems<00:04:02.230> like<00:04:03.230> I<00:04:03.350> said

I love how you can bend the foot down
so<00:05:21.639> it<00:05:21.759> lines<00:05:22.030> up<00:05:22.210> with<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.389> leg<00:05:22.539> perfectly

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
so it lines up with the leg perfectly

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.439 
so it lines up with the leg perfectly
looks<00:05:23.979> really<00:05:24.490> really<00:05:24.699> nice<00:05:24.880> especially<00:05:25.090> on

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
looks really really nice especially on

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.570 
looks really really nice especially on
an<00:05:25.539> action<00:05:25.810> base<00:05:26.020> you<00:05:26.680> don't<00:05:26.800> have<00:05:27.070> to<00:05:27.310> have<00:05:27.460> an

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
an action base you don't have to have an

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
action base with this kit because looks

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.800 
action base with this kit because looks
fine<00:05:29.800> without<00:05:29.979> it<00:05:30.130> but<00:05:30.400> having<00:05:31.240> one<00:05:31.389> really

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
fine without it but having one really

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.520 
fine without it but having one really
makes<00:05:32.259> this<00:05:32.440> kit<00:05:32.830> stand<00:05:33.190> out<00:05:33.370> even<00:05:33.400> more<00:05:34.530> and

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
makes this kit stand out even more and

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.469
