 You know about the appearance of video reviews 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.630
 With special pleasure and this video review 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.450

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.670
 me on video review 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.830
 perhaps the most technologically screwed 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.010
 and the column that I surveyed for 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.560
 last two and a half years she has 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.619
 so cool electronic stuffing that 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.359
 it has weighing mince which only 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.090
 can you imagine that he was in 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.829
 portable speakers in addition burrow 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.899
 You think that this is such a feature at the bottom of the well 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.030
 this is actually friends mounts on 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.579
 handlebar or scooter 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.890
 that is, it is a column except 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.899

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.969
 the stuffing is still attached to the steering wheel 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.530

 The main cool chips are not well 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.390
 firstly it reproduces during 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.210
 how she plays music she 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.040
 shows the name of the files in Russian 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.409
 language, that is, if you have music recorded 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.100
 Russian then it shows the name hitting 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.890
 folders in Russian, it shows the name 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.310
 folders in Russian and shows the name 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.500
 files in Russian while it has 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.460
 built-in radio 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:32.880
 it has a built-in alarm clock 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.700
 she can rewind 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.299
 inside the track while doing it 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.119
 turned off and turned on again then she will 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.220
 play right from the same place from which 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.530

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.340

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.259
