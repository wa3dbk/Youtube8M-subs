00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.850
 hello very good next I come to 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:07.950
 present is a game 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.530
 totally automatic very easy in this 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.049
 first video I do the realization and in 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.920
 next I will make the revelation 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.539
 you will show your audience a deck 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.740
 perfectly mixed really not 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.910
 I have twisted the perfect tripod 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.350
 once done, divide the deck in two 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.440
 mounds 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.390
 a point so that another amount for what 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.090
 you tell other spectators who are going 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.030
 to make a mix and they are going to riot 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.489
 all the cards in a lot way to 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.410
 a lot you see tell a spectator 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.930
 to extract 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.120
 an undetermined number of letters 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.580
 approximately half that oscillates 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.210
 between 5 and 10 but it is not does not have to do 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:59.840
 an exact number that extracts the letters 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:05.449
 of the first heap from half a turn and 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:08.720
 make a mixture mix I think 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.240
 they call it a game of de lennar game 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.250
 book that calls you the mixture of 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.460
 castle I'm not too sure I'll say 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:21.560
 in his revelation it because I've done this 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:23.720
 the letters mix with each other 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.000
 to a second viewer or if you did not have 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.130
 more or that the same path will be chosen 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.149
 borrowed you ask him to extract a lot 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.789
 of letters from the bunch that hit 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.740
 so they are then we will have 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:40.820
 letters face up letter face down and 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.340
 the mix with a lot of the same 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.470
 way and that this operation makes it 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.100
 as many times as they want they come back from 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.200
 new to extract a bunch of letters 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.220
 there may be 10 15 57 da exactly 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.020
 same and enter them in the heap sees and 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.520
 to finish the pile see we extract 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.860
 another pile of letters and we mix them 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.750
 with the a 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.590
 done this there is no doubt that 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:13.900
 we have a huge card boot 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:18.310
 so in this way together the two 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:21.400
 you order them a little bit 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.020
 and by 27 to get a piece of paper I now 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.020
 I do not do it so I do not waste a lot of time 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.060
 and you write down you make a first entry or 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.830
 you do all four annotations together 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.870
 exactly the same but also doing 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.660
 appear a person and you tell the 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.110
 spectators I have four predictions 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.110
 a 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:47.470
 there are 23 letters of 22 of these 23 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:55.580
 12 are red 3 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.970
 blacks are all numbers is to say that 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.650
 there is no figure 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.470
 and 4 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.269
 they are all pairs ie the 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.879
 black but you'll have a fifth that 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.459
 then I will indicate you and you will put it 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:16.879
 as a final lace good we proceed to 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:27.189
 count the cards and extract 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:32.940
 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:35.250
 21 22 and 23 first prediction do each 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.110
 second we said that twelve of them were 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:42.630
 blacks that were red sorry 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:45.910
 we count one two three four five six 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:50.550
 seven eight nine ten 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:52.040
 11 and 12 he released her 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.970
 and what 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.850
 of the black women were all even 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.740
 and all numbers plus the fifth that 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.620
 annotated already I say with you will keep up 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.570
 the end all this without any doubt that 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.450
 mixtures makes public the 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.160
 letters are chosen by the public you the only thing 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.020
 that you limit yourself to separating the two 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.580
 heaps and everything that has been done 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:18.970
 makes the public so accounts 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.090
 all odd numbers to give everything 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:25.750
 couple until the end but someone will 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.030
 will say except 7 of clubs and you in your 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.370
 fifth 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.310
 prediction you will have scored in a 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.820
 little piece of paper except the 7 of clubs 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.400
 I have already said as final lace to the game 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.790
 but each and every one of the 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:46.240
 predictions will have been full reality 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.280
 having mixed the audience in full 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.850
 I hope you liked it as I said 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.080
 in a next video its many relationship 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.080
 thank you and until then
