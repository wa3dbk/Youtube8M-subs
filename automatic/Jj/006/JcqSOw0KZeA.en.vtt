also of Korean action games where you

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.580 
also of Korean action games where you
start<00:02:18.030> with<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.180> small<00:02:18.450> closed<00:02:18.690> beta<00:02:18.959> you<00:02:19.380> add

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
start with a small closed beta you add

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.080 
start with a small closed beta you add
more<00:02:19.829> people<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.400> closed<00:02:20.610> beta<00:02:20.849> and
