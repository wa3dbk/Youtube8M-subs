if<00:04:53.229> you<00:04:53.350> recall<00:04:54.600> their<00:04:55.600> ships<00:04:55.960> I<00:04:56.229> don't<00:04:57.190> think

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
if you recall their ships I don't think

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.260 
if you recall their ships I don't think
so<00:04:57.370> pal<00:04:57.490> their<00:04:58.390> ships<00:04:58.720> have<00:04:59.910> very<00:05:00.910> thick

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.020 
so pal their ships have very thick
shields<00:05:01.750> but<00:05:02.080> they<00:05:02.200> move<00:05:02.350> very<00:05:02.380> slowly<00:05:03.040> if<00:05:03.940> you

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
shields but they move very slowly if you

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.700 
shields but they move very slowly if you
just<00:05:04.060> stay<00:05:04.360> with<00:05:04.540> it<00:05:04.690> kind<00:05:05.320> of<00:05:05.350> track<00:05:05.590> them
