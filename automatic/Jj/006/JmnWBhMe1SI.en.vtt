00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.380
 today I bring you a very simple dish 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.290
 to do is a white rice that I do in 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.090
 the express pot and it is in its point not 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.550
 it is passed nor is it hard because the 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.890
 amount of water is accurate 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.120
 I hope you like to make rice 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:22.900
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:24.610
 they are round grain rice salt water and I 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.640
 I have put a clove of garlic because to me 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.410
 I like to sautÃ© rice with garlic if not 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.520
 you want is not necessary you just put 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.710
 oil and you're done 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.710
 the proportions that must be saved are 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.780
 for every cup of rice a cup and a half 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.690
 of water so how do I put two of 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.310
 rice three cups of water this is for 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.140
 round grain rice that is the one 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.570
 I use if you use another one 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.400
 you will have to calculate the amount of 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.260
 water and rice that take longer to cook 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.120
 to others who absorb more water other than 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.620
 absorb less you will have to go 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.230
 doing semis tests that the rice that 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.840
 I like it is the round grain we put 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.140
 to boil the water we take a little 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.140
 of salt 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.900
 and we can also fix the garlic and 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.710
 we have the doradito garlic so we're going to 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.710
 add the rice 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.180
 I see them, let's go a little bit 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.070
 as the water is already boiling we're going 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.070
 to dump on rice 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.010
 we cover the pot and we will have five 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.110
 minutes topping at moderate heat 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.660
 the 5 minutes are now gone 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.070
 we simply remove it from the fire but 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.070
 we do not open the lid 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.520
 we leave it here 5 more minutes have passed 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.340
 5 minutes with the lid closed 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.520
 and now let's open now we 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.680
 than leave it another five minutes more 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.500
 resting with the cover stay 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.760
 5 minutes of rest have passed and 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.760
 this is the appearance of rice 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.629
 Well, I hope that this way of 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.510
 Do the rice has turned out 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.510
 practice see you soon goodbye
