00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.410
 hello that we so many of you one 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.790
 new leak wanted in the video 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.889
 I've turned that off now and that 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.240
 suitable for summer and I think it works 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.770
 most so that you are very hot 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.750
 summer days not necessarily special 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.180
 It's easy to eat hard because you're tired 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.680
 is and just depend on that and that 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.210
 Nobody really wants that and that's why 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.710
 Today I have four snails for 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.630
 you the most easily tolerated 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.250
 are super fast go mega delicious 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.019
 are and still healthy and me 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.140
 I think this combination can not 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.610
 knock off and go to Japan for a kitchen 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.610
 and how to do it alone again 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.570
 Of course church peas one cucumber 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.039
 paprika antipasti we still had it 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.550
 from the day before because we bought the on 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.129
 had 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.120
 besides, we need feta cheese and as 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.120
 last a lime 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.440
 and that's how I 'm going 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.910
 my cucumber i have cut myself now 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.290
 so decided for small dice 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.090
 I just always do it that way 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.410
 Someday you have to be mouth-friendly 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.300
 Let's see what's best for you 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.310
 fits and then I give mine 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.420
 chickpeas fit a big bowl 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.560
 that she is not such a small one 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.050
 bowl because it comes naturally 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.520
 after that the whole salad is pure and then 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.020
 I add my cucumber and then 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.620
 I also climb in my paprika 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.620
 little pieces 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.730
 under 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.049
 I will do the same 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.610
 my antipasti are left over 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.040
 that was a few in now 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.690
 zucchini peppers and a few more mushrooms 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.460
 and then I also divorce my 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.229
 dried tomatoes i love 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.360
 Dried tomatoes really over everything 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.610
 I could feed myself with that because 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.750
 that are just so delicious and have 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.190
 I just so very small pieces 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.020
 cut it so well in the 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.060
 distribute salad and then I switch 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.619
 still my fathers in such small cubes 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.030
 That can always be quite good then 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.979
 are not too big the pieces though 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.360
 just not too small and then give 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.200
 I give the whole in one shot I give 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.030
 then just a bit 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.920
 lime juice over it because that's easy 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.840
 as the whole gives a sparkling touch 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.729
 and I just love that 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.800
 and then all this a bit 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.540
 and wash it in bowls and 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.160
 The salad is also relatively full 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.750
 I noticed the chickpeas 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.400
 and that's just perfect there 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.630
 summer days or even general and her 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.630
 you have to try it 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.010
 red 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.230
 old me 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:33.890
 the brand image watermelon 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.299
 balsamic vinegar some oil feta cheese 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.590
 basil and some salt and then catch 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.579
 I'm already on and cuts 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.140
 my watermelon 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.640
 Incidentally, I googled whether you have the 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.200
 I can eat kernels with them because I have the first 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.519
 Everyone wanted to get out but you can 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.860
 But eating with it is no problem 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.030
 they are even relatively healthy and 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.250
 That's why I cut one first 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.319
 watermelon in such small pieces easy 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.159
 again so bite-sized bits as well 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.159
 it fits you 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.840
 the 4th 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.610
 and then I just take mine 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.709
 feta cheese and acrylic that a bit 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.150
 over the watermelon and then you can 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.879
 namely already for the dressing for that 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.560
 we put the ball on i co the oil salt and a 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.970
 need a bit of basil and as 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.769
 First I give a little bit by sat micro 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.810
 in my cup and would give about the 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.610
 the same proportion of oil you have to 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.170
 look what's best for you 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.670
 then i have my basil bit 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.860
 cut small and are available 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.390
 and then the whole thing and still 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.370
 then that would have to be a bit slim 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.360
 So not that it is such a way you can 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.610
 even with a bit of water 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.890
 extend or a little honey to 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.690
 give and then I give no 30 namely 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.049
 about my salad and for the whole good 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.049
 under 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.740
 minute 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.440
 this is a typical childhood recipe 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.180
 for me I have known since then 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.350
 am quite small and the existence, made 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.880
 I like a watermelon 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.530
 but I have it again this summer 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.819
 discovered me and you have that way 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:16.590
 try that is super refreshing 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:19.680
 just mega mega delicious honey - if 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:23.160
 you want this grissini basil cream 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.090
 cream tirano ham and some cheese me 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.680
 I have now decided for just 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.180
 because we did not have parmesan anymore and 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.160
 that's when I start and that is 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.470
 really a bit of this cerano 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.930
 never just donate to this crisis 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.450
 as a deco and also because it is easy 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.520
 is and that's pretty easy and yes 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.129
 I think that mister looks so good 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.820
 out 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:45.350
 out there at big 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.000
 I just put a little something there 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.980
 braked iran also send my 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.300
 By the way, I'll stop the honey melon by the way 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.280
 have cut in a bit if you 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.060
 afterwards it is easier to eat and give 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.070
 I kind of like mine 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.990
 balsamic cream over it has by the way 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.090
 no matter how light raspberry taste 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.290
 is delicious and then I give 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.000
 a little bit of my cheese over it 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.050
 and I have to admit that it is one 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.330
 parmesan just a little bit more 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.580
 Delicious is but less money goes 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.290
 Just open and I'll find it easy 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.610
 already very delicious from that one could 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.350
 just put it perfectly on the table 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.330
 for a barbecue party or evening is or 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.500
 like that and I'm pretty sure everyone 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.500
 people will arrive very well 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.040
 small cut tomatoes zucchini and 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.760
 paprika if you want a bit 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:32.780
 pretzel or ketchup ketchup 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.280
 bit tomatenmark the whole 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.480
 actually so easy that you almost completely 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.820
 but definitely had to explain 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.410
 no longer taken and opened up 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.300
 just a little something 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.980
 of chicken zucchini and paprika 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.090
 impaled just so the 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.790
 order as I kind of like it 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.710
 found and wanted and do that 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:53.480
 I then point with two so that 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:55.010
 just everything consumed is small 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.510
 You can just skewer with a bit 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.400
 oil in the pan and then I leave 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.650
 fry and in time I take care of it 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.330
 I just give myself my time 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.370
 my very small cuts saved 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.650
 another banner goes to mine 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.510
 onions or tomatoes 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.890
 a bit cheesy and I know cap 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.510
 is not so healthy now because so much 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.640
 sugar is in it but i thought it was 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.090
 so little is it that I can do it all 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.230
 Just simmer a bit 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.940
 because the skewers are done then it is 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.320
 definitely not ready and then 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.640
 can you do that? 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.810
 and I think it's almost to 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.070
 main course that's no longer 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.600
 otherwise I realize but I wanted to 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.550
 necessarily show and I'm obsessed 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.360
 from the salsa and that is really too 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.360
 delicious 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.730
 yes there are ideas you see is both 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.350
 military as well as non-vegetarian 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.970
 but of course you can do it all 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.100
 individualize his taste so 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.440
 to do something you like 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.940
 like or just omit and find that 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.800
 I really cool and me 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.030
 Of course I hope that the video will be nice 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.620
 has and that maybe I will 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.660
 what could you have inspired one? 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.280
 to eat hot summer days right now 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.350
 can do and I need of course 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.700
 as always, little about your photos if you 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.040
 do something like that because the 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.600
 just always look so good 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.490
 sent me on twitter or on 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.840
 instagram and then I would say 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.840
 Let's just say we're back
