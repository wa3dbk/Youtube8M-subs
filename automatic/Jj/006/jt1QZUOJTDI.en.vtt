not I am Not sure but it's pretty much
what<00:02:34.080> everyone's<00:02:34.530> saying<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:35.250> if<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:35.430> guys<00:02:35.520> go

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
what everyone's saying so if you guys go

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.309 
what everyone's saying so if you guys go
watch<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.150> video<00:02:36.420> look<00:02:36.630> at<00:02:36.750> Jim<00:02:36.989> Ross<00:02:37.170> his

watch the video look at Jim Ross his

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.530 
watch the video look at Jim Ross his
behavior<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:37.800> mean<00:02:37.950> he<00:02:38.069> is<00:02:38.190> cussing<00:02:38.489> a<00:02:38.670> lot<00:02:38.880> his

behavior I mean he is cussing a lot his
saito<00:02:39.989> I<00:02:40.110> think<00:02:40.440> he<00:02:40.530> shouldn't<00:02:40.860> say<00:02:41.690> he's

saito I think he shouldn't say he's
letting<00:02:43.019> people<00:02:43.470> say<00:02:43.680> they<00:02:43.920> letting<00:02:44.250> Ric

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
letting people say they letting Ric

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.270 
letting people say they letting Ric
Flair<00:02:44.700> go<00:02:44.910> on<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.239> on<00:02:45.620> you<00:02:46.620> tell<00:02:46.890> me<00:02:47.069> if<00:02:47.220> you
