okay<00:00:02.590> we're<00:00:02.710> going<00:00:02.830> to<00:00:02.889> look<00:00:02.980> at<00:00:03.070> some

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:03.250 
okay we're going to look at some

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.920 
okay we're going to look at some
harmonic<00:00:03.759> things<00:00:04.029> now<00:00:04.240> I'm<00:00:04.390> going<00:00:04.509> to<00:00:04.569> I'm

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:04.930 
harmonic things now I'm going to I'm

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.860 
harmonic things now I'm going to I'm
going<00:00:05.080> to<00:00:05.140> start<00:00:05.470> with<00:00:05.740> some<00:00:05.980> basic<00:00:06.870> harmonic

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:07.870 
going to start with some basic harmonic

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.959 
going to start with some basic harmonic
passages<00:00:08.440> this<00:00:09.129> would<00:00:09.280> be<00:00:09.370> the<00:00:09.490> sort<00:00:09.700> of<00:00:09.759> thing

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:09.969 
passages this would be the sort of thing

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.980 
passages this would be the sort of thing
that<00:00:09.999> would<00:00:10.240> work<00:00:10.419> in<00:00:10.719> the<00:00:11.049> key<00:00:11.200> of<00:00:11.230> iron

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.880 

it's<00:00:14.990> kind<00:00:15.259> of<00:00:15.290> a<00:00:15.379> like<00:00:15.500> an<00:00:15.620> a<00:00:15.679> minor<00:00:17.140> thing<00:00:18.140> and

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
it's kind of a like an a minor thing and

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.050 
it's kind of a like an a minor thing and
basically<00:00:19.369> what<00:00:19.550> we're<00:00:19.640> going<00:00:19.730> to<00:00:19.789> do<00:00:19.910> is

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
basically what we're going to do is

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.820 
basically what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:20.210> going<00:00:20.240> to<00:00:20.360> play<00:00:20.570> an<00:00:20.840> open<00:00:21.020> harmonic<00:00:21.650> on

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
we're going to play an open harmonic on

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.800 
we're going to play an open harmonic on
the<00:00:22.160> twelfth<00:00:22.730> fret<00:00:22.820> B<00:00:23.060> string<00:00:24.130> followed<00:00:25.130> by<00:00:25.810> an

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
the twelfth fret B string followed by an

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.420 
the twelfth fret B string followed by an
open<00:00:26.960> harmonic<00:00:27.500> on<00:00:27.619> the<00:00:27.680> twelve<00:00:27.980> high<00:00:28.400> E

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
open harmonic on the twelve high E

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.019 
open harmonic on the twelve high E
string<00:00:30.340> then<00:00:31.340> we're<00:00:31.460> going<00:00:31.580> to<00:00:31.640> do<00:00:31.730> the<00:00:31.849> same

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
string then we're going to do the same

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.420 
string then we're going to do the same
down<00:00:32.269> on<00:00:32.360> the<00:00:32.449> seventh<00:00:32.720> fret<00:00:32.809> and<00:00:36.190> then<00:00:37.190> add

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
down on the seventh fret and then add

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.470 
down on the seventh fret and then add
that<00:00:37.699> fifth<00:00:38.030> fret<00:00:38.559> note<00:00:39.559> there<00:00:40.150> now<00:00:41.150> Eddie<00:00:41.360> Van

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
that fifth fret note there now Eddie Van

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.950 
that fifth fret note there now Eddie Van
Halen<00:00:41.809> uses<00:00:42.199> these<00:00:42.699> three<00:00:43.699> threats<00:00:44.030> all<00:00:44.660> the

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
Halen uses these three threats all the

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.590 
Halen uses these three threats all the
time<00:00:45.170> for<00:00:45.470> this<00:00:45.559> type<00:00:45.860> of<00:00:45.890> thing<00:00:46.070> and<00:00:46.969> you<00:00:47.450> can

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
time for this type of thing and you can

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.270 
time for this type of thing and you can
muck<00:00:47.750> around<00:00:47.870> and<00:00:48.320> find<00:00:48.500> out<00:00:48.649> what<00:00:48.829> works<00:00:49.010> in

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
muck around and find out what works in

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.889 
muck around and find out what works in
in<00:00:49.520> different<00:00:49.640> keys<00:00:50.059> but<00:00:50.600> this<00:00:50.750> will

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
in different keys but this will

00:00:50.899 --> 00:01:01.410 
in different keys but this will
definitely<00:00:51.050> work<00:00:51.440> in<00:00:51.680> a<00:00:51.710> minor<00:00:52.399> thing

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.970 

and<00:01:02.080> you<00:01:02.170> if<00:01:02.350> you<00:01:02.470> don't<00:01:02.590> want<00:01:02.710> to<00:01:02.770> run<00:01:02.890> them

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
and you if you don't want to run them

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.979 
and you if you don't want to run them
together<00:01:03.130> you<00:01:03.460> can<00:01:03.490> damp<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.540> ones<00:01:04.750> that<00:01:04.900> are

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
together you can damp the ones that are

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:12.960 
together you can damp the ones that are
ring<00:01:05.140> with<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.410> finger<00:01:05.740> and<00:01:11.700> tremolo<00:01:12.700> for

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
would be to play 12 on the D on the G 12

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.160 
would be to play 12 on the D on the G 12
on<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.110> B<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.729> then<00:01:24.970> same<00:01:25.540> on<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:25.840> seventh

00:01:43.270 --> 00:02:04.429 

and<00:01:43.960> these<00:01:44.110> go<00:01:44.320> they're<00:01:44.890> just<00:01:45.100> nice<00:01:45.310> with<00:01:45.610> you

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.469 

we<00:02:05.250> just<00:02:05.460> mix<00:02:05.670> them<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.909> with<00:02:05.939> those<00:02:06.149> kind<00:02:06.390> of

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
we just mix them in with those kind of

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.749 
we just mix them in with those kind of
chord<00:02:06.659> progressions<00:02:07.340> for<00:02:08.340> just<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.580> nice

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759

little embellishment using open

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.089 
little embellishment using open
harmonics<00:02:11.099> okay<00:02:12.650> next<00:02:13.650> one<00:02:13.800> we're<00:02:13.920> going<00:02:14.040> to

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
harmonics okay next one we're going to

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.120 
harmonics okay next one we're going to
look<00:02:14.190> at<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.940> way<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.660> using<00:02:16.319> what<00:02:16.860> we<00:02:16.950> call

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
look at is a way of using what we call

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.309 
look at is a way of using what we call
pinched<00:02:17.550> harmonics<00:02:18.019> we're<00:02:19.019> going<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.200> do

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
pinched harmonics we're going to do

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.410 
pinched harmonics we're going to do
these<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.680> context<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.400> run<00:02:20.610> now<00:02:20.640> for

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
these in a context of a run now for

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.550 
these in a context of a run now for
those<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:21.780> don't<00:02:21.930> know<00:02:22.050> what<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.230> pinched

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
those of you don't know what a pinched

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.229 
those of you don't know what a pinched
harmonic<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.099> basically<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.730> dig<00:02:23.940> into<00:02:24.120> the

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
harmonic is basically you dig into the

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.130 
harmonic is basically you dig into the
string<00:02:24.599> and<00:02:24.750> as<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:26.390> play<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.420> string<00:02:27.840> the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
string and as you play the string the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.199 
string and as you play the string the
back<00:02:28.380> side<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.680> your<00:02:28.980> thumb<00:02:31.970> such<00:02:32.970> as<00:02:33.120> the

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
back side of your thumb such as the

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.740 
back side of your thumb such as the
string<00:02:33.420> as<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.569> come<00:02:33.810> through<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
string as you come through and the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.539 
string as you come through and the
typical<00:02:36.959> run<00:02:37.319> that<00:02:37.560> anyone<00:02:37.920> home<00:02:38.130> interviews

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
typical run that anyone home interviews

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:44.450 
typical run that anyone home interviews
will<00:02:38.730> be<00:02:38.819> chopped

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.680 

which<00:02:45.460> is<00:02:45.580> kind<00:02:45.820> of<00:02:45.850> like<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.060> sort<00:02:46.330> of<00:02:46.390> blues

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
which is kind of like a sort of blues

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.260 
which is kind of like a sort of blues
scale<00:02:47.080> major<00:02:48.070> kind<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.520> pentatonic<00:02:49.090> thing

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
scale major kind of pentatonic thing

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.330 
scale major kind of pentatonic thing
we've<00:02:49.390> seen<00:02:49.420> chromatics<00:02:50.080> added<00:02:50.560> used<00:02:51.100> in<00:02:51.250> a

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
we've seen chromatics added used in a

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.670 
we've seen chromatics added used in a

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:14.890 

Oh

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:30.330 

we<00:04:15.900> have<00:04:16.019> to<00:04:16.169> really<00:04:16.350> dig

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.220 

there's<00:04:30.970> another<00:04:31.180> one<00:04:31.450> that<00:04:31.480> it<00:04:31.720> would<00:04:31.900> would

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
there's another one that it would would

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.680 
there's another one that it would would
use<00:04:32.470> which<00:04:33.190> is<00:04:33.280> a<00:04:33.310> combination<00:04:33.940> of<00:04:34.060> an

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
use which is a combination of an

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.320 
use which is a combination of an
arpeggio<00:04:35.250> and<00:04:36.250> also<00:04:36.550> a<00:04:36.580> pinched<00:04:36.910> harmonic

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
arpeggio and also a pinched harmonic

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:44.580 
arpeggio and also a pinched harmonic
where<00:04:37.900> who<00:04:42.960> this<00:04:43.960> is<00:04:44.169> we're<00:04:44.470> basically

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
where who this is we're basically

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.800 
where who this is we're basically
playing<00:04:44.950> a<00:04:45.310> seven<00:04:45.730> arpeggio<00:04:46.120> here<00:04:46.510> so<00:04:46.690> we've

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
playing a seven arpeggio here so we've

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.890 
playing a seven arpeggio here so we've
been<00:04:46.960> in<00:04:47.110> this<00:04:47.230> a<00:04:47.410> e<00:04:47.530> which<00:04:48.220> is<00:04:48.250> the<00:04:48.370> 5th<00:04:48.490> ave<00:04:48.940> up

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
been in this a e which is the 5th ave up

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.370 
been in this a e which is the 5th ave up
a<00:04:50.050> minor<00:04:50.290> third<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:52.050> then<00:04:53.050> we're<00:04:53.169> doing<00:04:53.320> a

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
a minor third and then we're doing a

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.710 
a minor third and then we're doing a
hammer-on<00:04:53.680> and<00:04:53.770> pull-off<00:04:53.889> from<00:04:54.760> 7<00:04:55.120> to<00:04:55.240> 9<00:04:55.270> and

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
hammer-on and pull-off from 7 to 9 and

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.090 
hammer-on and pull-off from 7 to 9 and
then<00:04:55.870> sliding<00:04:56.320> down<00:04:56.620> to<00:04:56.889> 6<00:04:57.760> on<00:04:58.060> a<00:04:58.090> jew<00:04:59.100> then

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
then sliding down to 6 on a jew then

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.340 
then sliding down to 6 on a jew then
playing<00:05:00.370> seven<00:05:00.880> on<00:05:01.270> the<00:05:01.419> be<00:05:01.740> done<00:05:02.740> right<00:05:04.350> and

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
playing seven on the be done right and

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.210 
playing seven on the be done right and
they're<00:05:05.470> doing<00:05:05.650> their<00:05:05.770> best<00:05:05.860> to<00:05:05.980> catch

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
they're doing their best to catch

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.010 
they're doing their best to catch
another<00:05:06.580> pinch<00:05:06.820> harmonic<00:05:07.300> on<00:05:07.419> their<00:05:07.600> third<00:05:10.020> on

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
another pinch harmonic on their third on

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.110 
another pinch harmonic on their third on
the<00:05:11.169> a<00:05:11.200> string<00:05:11.350> which<00:05:12.220> is<00:05:12.250> a<00:05:12.370> basically<00:05:12.850> minor

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
the a string which is a basically minor

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:26.939 
the a string which is a basically minor
for<00:05:13.419> so

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.550 

I<00:05:26.979> can<00:05:27.969> be<00:05:28.090> a<00:05:28.120> bit<00:05:28.330> bit<00:05:29.020> hit<00:05:29.199> me<00:05:29.409> especially

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
I can be a bit bit hit me especially

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.029 
I can be a bit bit hit me especially
when<00:05:29.889> you<00:05:29.949> do<00:05:30.069> the<00:05:30.189> debut<00:05:30.490> day<00:05:30.610> trust<00:05:30.849> me<00:05:31.030> but

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
when you do the debut day trust me but

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:37.580 
when you do the debut day trust me but
normal

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.600 

that's<00:05:38.590> a<00:05:38.710> great<00:05:38.890> way<00:05:39.010> of<00:05:39.040> getting<00:05:39.190> pinched

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
that's a great way of getting pinched

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.730 
that's a great way of getting pinched
harmonics
