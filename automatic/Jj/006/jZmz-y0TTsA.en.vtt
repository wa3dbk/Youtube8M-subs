fighting system that probably annoys me

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.050 
fighting system that probably annoys me
is<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.650> fact<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.160> can't<00:02:58.370> really<00:02:58.610> finish

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
is the fact that you can't really finish

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.120
