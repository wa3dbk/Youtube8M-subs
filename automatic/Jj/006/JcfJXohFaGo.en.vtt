would to have heavies less affected by
wind<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.160> get<00:01:02.280> tossed<00:01:02.579> around<00:01:02.730> all<00:01:03.120> last<00:01:03.329> a

wind and I get tossed around all last a
more<00:01:03.690> stable<00:01:03.960> these<00:01:04.710> guys<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:05.159> be<00:01:05.220> faster<00:01:05.760> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
more stable these guys can be faster and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.179 
more stable these guys can be faster and
they<00:01:06.119> get<00:01:06.409> lifted<00:01:07.409> higher<00:01:07.680> on<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> hang

they get lifted higher on the hang
glider<00:01:09.409> anything<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.530> would<00:01:10.590> make<00:01:10.740> common

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.550 
future I use use the light ones so I
think<00:01:19.380> we'll<00:01:19.710> go<00:01:19.890> with<00:01:21.140> I'll<00:01:22.140> probably<00:01:22.320> use<00:01:22.470> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
think we'll go with I'll probably use a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.200 
think we'll go with I'll probably use a
bit<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.740> each<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.100> these<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.700> by<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:23.970> end<00:01:24.090> of

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
bit of each of these and by the end of

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.580 
bit of each of these and by the end of
the<00:01:24.299> thing<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:24.509> we'll<00:01:24.810> start<00:01:24.990> with<00:01:25.080> Kiwi<00:01:27.590> so

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the thing but we'll start with Kiwi so

the thing but we'll start with Kiwi so
the<00:01:28.829> first<00:01:28.979> few<00:01:29.189> levels<00:01:29.340> are<00:01:29.520> pretty<00:01:29.549> easy

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880

hardest<00:01:52.000> part<00:01:52.300> about<00:01:52.420> this<00:01:52.660> game<00:01:52.930> and<00:01:55.410> well

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
hardest part about this game and well

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.560 
hardest part about this game and well
you'll<00:01:56.680> see<00:01:56.860> when<00:01:56.980> we<00:01:57.040> start<00:01:57.280> doing<00:01:57.370> it<00:01:57.610> give

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
you'll see when we start doing it give

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.020 
you'll see when we start doing it give
you<00:01:58.660> a<00:01:58.690> little<00:01:59.340> scoring<00:02:00.340> scheme<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:01.000> the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
you a little scoring scheme and the

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.010 
you a little scoring scheme and the
controls<00:02:02.550> this<00:02:03.550> is<00:02:03.730> this<00:02:04.060> is<00:02:04.210> so<00:02:04.360> beautiful<00:02:04.570> a

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
controls this is this is so beautiful a

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.470 
controls this is this is so beautiful a
and<00:02:05.650> B<00:02:05.770> do<00:02:05.980> the<00:02:06.100> same<00:02:06.400> thing<00:02:06.730> how<00:02:07.150> many<00:02:07.300> games

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
and B do the same thing how many games

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.630 
and B do the same thing how many games
are<00:02:07.780> there<00:02:08.050> are<00:02:08.320> so<00:02:08.619> simple<00:02:08.950> that<00:02:09.130> a<00:02:09.280> and<00:02:09.369> B<00:02:09.610> are

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
are there are so simple that a and B are

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.690 
are there are so simple that a and B are
used<00:02:09.910> for<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.180> same<00:02:10.360> thing<00:02:10.630> just<00:02:11.700> fantastic

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
used for the same thing just fantastic

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.190 
used for the same thing just fantastic
well<00:02:13.330> let's<00:02:13.750> start<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:16.360> we're<00:02:16.900> in<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:17.020> hang

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
well let's start so we're in a hang

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.010 
well let's start so we're in a hang
glider<00:02:17.970> hang<00:02:18.970> gliders<00:02:19.360> are<00:02:19.510> pretty<00:02:19.810> much<00:02:19.900> what

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
glider hang gliders are pretty much what

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.450 
glider hang gliders are pretty much what
you<00:02:20.050> think<00:02:20.290> there<00:02:20.440> there's<00:02:20.740> no<00:02:20.860> motor<00:02:21.130> you're

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
you think there there's no motor you're

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.060 
you think there there's no motor you're
just<00:02:21.580> drifting<00:02:22.210> around<00:02:22.300> so<00:02:22.960> if<00:02:23.680> you<00:02:23.830> want<00:02:24.010> to

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
just drifting around so if you want to

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.410 
just drifting around so if you want to
go<00:02:24.160> higher<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.610> pretty<00:02:24.820> much<00:02:24.880> need<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.300> use

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
go higher you pretty much need to use

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.920 
go higher you pretty much need to use
these<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.720> thermal<00:02:26.710> currents<00:02:27.070> so<00:02:27.340> whoa<00:02:28.060> up<00:02:28.750> we

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
these a thermal currents so whoa up we

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.080 
these a thermal currents so whoa up we
go<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:31.690> objective<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:32.110> this<00:02:32.230> one<00:02:32.470> is<00:02:32.620> to

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
go and the objective of this one is to

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.640 
go and the objective of this one is to
fly<00:02:34.090> through<00:02:34.360> my<00:02:34.600> rings<00:02:34.870> as<00:02:35.020> possible<00:02:35.500> and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
fly through my rings as possible and

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.580 
fly through my rings as possible and
then<00:02:35.740> land<00:02:36.250> on<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.580> landing<00:02:36.880> spot<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:38.500> the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
then land on the landing spot so the

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.610 
then land on the landing spot so the
points<00:02:38.980> are<00:02:39.100> based<00:02:39.250> on<00:02:39.490> rings<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:41.020> landing

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
points are based on rings and landing

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.570 
points are based on rings and landing
accuracy<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:42.370> landing<00:02:43.060> impact<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:44.580> maybe

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
accuracy and landing impact and maybe

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.280 
accuracy and landing impact and maybe
time<00:02:45.880> probably<00:02:46.390> not<00:02:46.510> I<00:02:46.750> already<00:02:46.840> forget<00:02:47.170> what

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
time probably not I already forget what

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.500 
time probably not I already forget what
to<00:02:47.350> say<00:02:48.959> so<00:02:49.959> you<00:02:50.590> got<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:50.920> Rings<00:02:51.100> have<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.180> slow

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
to say so you got the Rings have to slow

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.730 
to say so you got the Rings have to slow
down<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.989> bit

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
down a bit

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:01.180 
down a bit
and<00:02:55.160> see<00:02:55.460> we<00:02:55.610> can<00:02:55.760> nail<00:02:55.970> this<00:02:56.150> landing<00:03:00.190> seems

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
and see we can nail this landing seems

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:08.680 
and see we can nail this landing seems
like<00:03:01.310> it's<00:03:01.460> okay<00:03:01.730> Oh<00:03:06.970> see<00:03:07.970> what<00:03:08.090> I<00:03:08.120> mean<00:03:08.240> k<00:03:08.480> so<00:03:08.540> I

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
like it's okay Oh see what I mean k so I

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:09.970 
like it's okay Oh see what I mean k so I
guess<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:08.870> was<00:03:09.050> a<00:03:09.110> little<00:03:09.350> too<00:03:09.440> hard<00:03:09.770> on<00:03:09.860> the

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
guess that was a little too hard on the

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:17.740 
guess that was a little too hard on the
landing<00:03:11.290> only<00:03:12.290> 98<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:15.850> 98<00:03:16.850> is<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:17.000> gold<00:03:17.270> medal<00:03:17.600> as

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
landing only 98 so 98 is a gold medal as

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.330 
landing only 98 so 98 is a gold medal as
we'll<00:03:18.110> see<00:03:18.290> in<00:03:18.320> this<00:03:18.440> little<00:03:18.710> celebrations

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
we'll see in this little celebrations

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.100 
we'll see in this little celebrations
I'll<00:03:19.490> be<00:03:19.580> skipping<00:03:19.790> most<00:03:20.090> of<00:03:20.240> the<00:03:20.300> time<00:03:20.510> but

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
I'll be skipping most of the time but

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.570 
I'll be skipping most of the time but
i'll<00:03:21.410> show<00:03:21.710> it<00:03:21.740> once<00:03:23.350> look<00:03:24.350> I'm<00:03:24.470> go<00:03:24.650> gliding

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
i'll show it once look I'm go gliding

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.770 
i'll show it once look I'm go gliding
around

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
around

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.170 
around
so<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.410> gold<00:03:28.770> matte<00:03:28.980> gold<00:03:29.220> badge<00:03:29.459> is<00:03:29.700> enough<00:03:29.970> to

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
so a gold matte gold badge is enough to

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.059 
so a gold matte gold badge is enough to
unlock<00:03:30.870> anything<00:03:31.170> that<00:03:31.530> we<00:03:31.650> need<00:03:31.680> for<00:03:31.980> the

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
unlock anything that we need for the

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.760 
unlock anything that we need for the
game<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.490> mean<00:03:32.700> it's<00:03:33.090> nice<00:03:33.270> to<00:03:33.480> get<00:03:33.569> perfect<00:03:33.840> but

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
game I mean it's nice to get perfect but

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.150 
game I mean it's nice to get perfect but
they're<00:03:35.069> not<00:03:35.190> necessary<00:03:36.470> well<00:03:37.470> let's<00:03:37.800> move<00:03:38.010> on

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
they're not necessary well let's move on

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.570 
they're not necessary well let's move on
to<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.340> rocket<00:03:38.640> belt<00:03:39.800> now<00:03:40.800> let's<00:03:41.069> take<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.310> kiwi

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
to the rocket belt now let's take a kiwi

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.640 
to the rocket belt now let's take a kiwi
fair<00:03:41.790> bit<00:03:44.600> now<00:03:45.600> let's<00:03:45.900> show<00:03:46.020> off<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.260> controls

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
fair bit now let's show off the controls

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.949 
fair bit now let's show off the controls
for<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.860> rocket<00:03:47.190> belt<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:47.640> this<00:03:48.330> strong<00:03:48.660> weak

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
for the rocket belt so this strong weak

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.410 
for the rocket belt so this strong weak
jet<00:03:49.260> I<00:03:49.470> think<00:03:49.860> I<00:03:49.950> usually<00:03:50.370> use<00:03:50.550> this<00:03:51.030> strong

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
jet I think I usually use this strong

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.710 
jet I think I usually use this strong
one<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.709> you<00:03:52.800> get<00:03:52.950> hover<00:03:56.600> actually<00:03:57.600> there's

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
one and you get hover actually there's

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.150 
one and you get hover actually there's
one<00:03:57.750> little<00:03:57.989> neat<00:03:58.290> thing<00:03:58.530> in<00:03:58.620> this<00:03:58.739> level<00:03:59.069> that

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
one little neat thing in this level that

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.770 
one little neat thing in this level that
I<00:03:59.220> got<00:03:59.370> there<00:03:59.700> soon<00:03:59.880> I<00:04:00.180> know<00:04:00.390> a<00:04:00.420> few<00:04:00.510> little

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
I got there soon I know a few little

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.259 
I got there soon I know a few little
tricks<00:04:01.019> in<00:04:01.260> this<00:04:01.350> game<00:04:01.560> not<00:04:01.709> a<00:04:01.769> lot<00:04:02.040> but<00:04:02.400> each

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
tricks in this game not a lot but each

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.850 
tricks in this game not a lot but each
one<00:04:03.300> that<00:04:03.510> I<00:04:03.540> want<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.750> show<00:04:03.900> off<00:04:04.080> he<00:04:04.590> knows<00:04:04.680> how

one that I want to show off he knows how

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.090 
one that I want to show off he knows how
it's<00:04:05.010> nice<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:05.400> bright<00:04:05.640> out<00:04:06.030> date<00:04:06.600> I'm

it's nice and bright out date I'm
already<00:04:08.100> going<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.400> this<00:04:08.550> little<00:04:08.760> cave<00:04:09.000> for<00:04:09.330> a

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
already going to this little cave for a

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:19.039 
already going to this little cave for a
second<00:04:09.840> oh<00:04:13.340> which<00:04:14.340> what's<00:04:14.880> happening<00:04:15.209> oh<00:04:18.049> look

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
second oh which what's happening oh look

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.370 
second oh which what's happening oh look
it's<00:04:19.320> night<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:21.019> think<00:04:22.019> it's<00:04:22.140> pretty<00:04:22.260> neat

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
it's night I think it's pretty neat

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.220 
it's night I think it's pretty neat
yeah<00:04:25.190> we<00:04:25.310> break<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.640> balloon<00:04:25.880> which<00:04:26.360> was<00:04:26.570> okay

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
yeah we break the balloon which was okay

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.430 
yeah we break the balloon which was okay
to<00:04:27.290> do<00:04:27.470> for<00:04:27.650> this<00:04:27.710> level<00:04:28.070> and<00:04:29.170> we'll<00:04:30.170> get<00:04:30.260> to

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
to do for this level and we'll get to

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.330 
to do for this level and we'll get to
the<00:04:30.530> exit<00:04:30.620> I<00:04:32.380> hope<00:04:33.380> I<00:04:33.440> can<00:04:33.590> still<00:04:33.740> get<00:04:33.890> perfect

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
the exit I hope I can still get perfect

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.500 
the exit I hope I can still get perfect
time<00:04:34.520> point<00:04:34.820> even<00:04:35.090> with<00:04:35.120> that<00:04:35.330> little

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
time point even with that little

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.270 
time point even with that little
diversion<00:04:36.050> for<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.380> little<00:04:36.800> trick<00:04:37.010> we'll<00:04:37.430> see

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
diversion for the little trick we'll see

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.090 
diversion for the little trick we'll see
and<00:04:40.280> once<00:04:40.430> again<00:04:41.470> the<00:04:42.470> landing<00:04:42.800> impacts

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
and once again the landing impacts

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:50.850 
and once again the landing impacts
important<00:04:45.280> hopefully<00:04:46.280> that's<00:04:46.460> good<00:04:46.640> enough

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.040 

accuracy<00:04:51.860> I<00:04:52.340> guess<00:04:53.150> I<00:04:53.270> got<00:04:53.420> lazy<00:04:53.660> and<00:04:53.840> dingy

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
accuracy I guess I got lazy and dingy

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.770 
accuracy I guess I got lazy and dingy
close<00:04:54.290> enough<00:04:54.500> to<00:04:54.590> the<00:04:54.680> middle<00:04:54.890> hello<00:04:55.670> I<00:04:55.910> know

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
close enough to the middle hello I know

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.040 
close enough to the middle hello I know
they're<00:04:56.900> not<00:04:57.110> perfect<00:04:57.970> but<00:04:58.970> again<00:04:59.270> gold

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
they're not perfect but again gold

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.070 
they're not perfect but again gold
medals<00:05:00.320> good<00:05:00.470> enough<00:05:04.690> and<00:05:05.690> now<00:05:05.810> for<00:05:05.990> the<00:05:06.050> final

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
medals good enough and now for the final

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.280 
medals good enough and now for the final
of<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:07.420> means<00:05:08.420> there<00:05:08.900> are<00:05:09.020> some<00:05:09.170> other

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
of the means there are some other

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.780 
of the means there are some other
vehicles<00:05:09.710> that<00:05:09.800> we<00:05:09.860> can<00:05:10.010> unlock<00:05:10.250> eventually

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
vehicles that we can unlock eventually

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.330 
vehicles that we can unlock eventually
but<00:05:11.140> the<00:05:12.140> final<00:05:12.470> of<00:05:12.560> the<00:05:12.590> main<00:05:12.830> three<00:05:13.130> the

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
but the final of the main three the

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:22.060 
but the final of the main three the
gyrocopter<00:05:19.360> show<00:05:20.360> you<00:05:20.420> the<00:05:20.510> controls<00:05:21.070> so

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
gyrocopter show you the controls so

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.230 
gyrocopter show you the controls so
there<00:05:22.280> are<00:05:22.310> actually<00:05:22.580> missiles<00:05:22.910> in<00:05:22.970> this<00:05:23.030> one

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
there are actually missiles in this one

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.430 
there are actually missiles in this one
this<00:05:23.330> is<00:05:23.390> one<00:05:23.630> of<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:23.780> few<00:05:23.900> vehicles<00:05:24.050> we

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
this is one of the few vehicles we

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.360 
this is one of the few vehicles we
actually<00:05:24.680> get<00:05:24.770> to<00:05:24.800> go<00:05:24.980> hurt<00:05:25.460> something<00:05:27.370> this

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
actually get to go hurt something this

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.330 
actually get to go hurt something this
game<00:05:28.610> is<00:05:28.760> a<00:05:28.820> pretty<00:05:29.920> pacifist<00:05:30.920> game<00:05:31.130> i<00:05:31.310> guess

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
game is a pretty pacifist game i guess

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.570 
game is a pretty pacifist game i guess
but<00:05:32.890> everyone<00:05:33.890> strongly<00:05:34.130> get<00:05:34.310> to<00:05:34.400> shoot

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
but everyone strongly get to shoot

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.700 
but everyone strongly get to shoot
things<00:05:34.760> not<00:05:35.300> here

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.380 

so

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
so

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.910 
so
to<00:05:39.840> the<00:05:39.930> gyrocopter<00:05:40.500> you<00:05:40.590> always<00:05:40.770> hit<00:05:40.860> the

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
to the gyrocopter you always hit the

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.660 
to the gyrocopter you always hit the
take<00:05:41.160> off<00:05:41.340> first<00:05:41.780> here<00:05:42.780> we<00:05:42.930> go<00:05:43.190> and<00:05:44.190> there's

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.670 
take off first here we go and there's

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.460 
take off first here we go and there's
Springs<00:05:44.940> we<00:05:45.060> have<00:05:45.150> to<00:05:45.210> play<00:05:45.360> through<00:05:45.570> there's

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
Springs we have to play through there's

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.110 
Springs we have to play through there's
the<00:05:46.620> missiles<00:05:46.980> once<00:05:47.220> we<00:05:47.340> get<00:05:47.580> to<00:05:47.640> shoot<00:05:47.910> them

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
the missiles once we get to shoot them

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.650 
the missiles once we get to shoot them
doesn't<00:05:48.630> matter<00:05:48.810> here<00:05:49.110> but<00:05:50.390> figure<00:05:51.390> I'll<00:05:51.480> show

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
doesn't matter here but figure I'll show

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.610 
doesn't matter here but figure I'll show
you<00:05:51.720> we<00:05:51.870> can

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.780 

so<00:05:55.620> just<00:05:55.950> three<00:05:56.160> rings<00:05:56.340> in<00:05:56.490> this<00:05:56.610> one

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
so just three rings in this one

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.999 
so just three rings in this one
and<00:05:59.090> now<00:05:59.360> we<00:05:59.420> have<00:05:59.570> to<00:05:59.690> land

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:03.009 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:05.999 

which<00:06:03.550> is<00:06:03.699> a<00:06:03.789> pain<00:06:04.089> a<00:06:04.559> hate<00:06:05.559> land<00:06:05.830> in<00:06:05.949> the

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.009 
which is a pain a hate land in the

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:11.959 
which is a pain a hate land in the
gyrocopter

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:15.230 

so

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.879 

where's<00:06:15.870> that<00:06:16.139> landing<00:06:16.500> strip

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:20.889 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:23.100 

here<00:06:21.400> comes

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
here comes

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.210 
here comes
try<00:06:23.710> to<00:06:23.770> line<00:06:23.980> up<00:06:24.130> with<00:06:24.160> it<00:06:25.680> so<00:06:26.680> to<00:06:26.740> get<00:06:26.860> primack

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
try to line up with it so to get primack

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.160 
try to line up with it so to get primack
accuracy<00:06:27.790> points<00:06:28.120> you<00:06:28.210> have<00:06:28.240> to<00:06:28.360> land<00:06:28.720> on<00:06:29.050> the

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.170 
accuracy points you have to land on the

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.010 
accuracy points you have to land on the
middle<00:06:29.440> and<00:06:29.620> then<00:06:29.950> stop<00:06:30.490> on<00:06:30.700> the<00:06:30.790> middle<00:06:31.060> so

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
middle and then stop on the middle so

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.230 
middle and then stop on the middle so
you<00:06:32.110> got<00:06:32.230> to<00:06:32.320> be<00:06:32.460> see<00:06:33.460> I'm<00:06:33.550> not<00:06:33.700> going<00:06:33.970> to<00:06:34.030> land

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
you got to be see I'm not going to land

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.130 
you got to be see I'm not going to land
on<00:06:34.360> the<00:06:34.450> middle<00:06:34.690> adult<00:06:34.900> thing<00:06:36.930> maybe<00:06:37.930> that's

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140 
on the middle adult thing maybe that's

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.800 
on the middle adult thing maybe that's
close<00:06:38.380> enough

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.000 

maybe<00:06:43.810> that's<00:06:44.080> close<00:06:44.290> enough<00:06:44.320> I<00:06:44.770> don't<00:06:44.980> know

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.010 
maybe that's close enough I don't know

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:52.740 
maybe that's close enough I don't know
all<00:06:48.010> right<00:06:48.840> so<00:06:50.220> we<00:06:51.220> got<00:06:51.250> in<00:06:51.490> a<00:06:51.550> hundred<00:06:51.760> and

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
all right so we got in a hundred and

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.850 
all right so we got in a hundred and
I'll<00:06:52.900> show<00:06:53.110> you<00:06:53.170> what<00:06:53.290> that<00:06:53.350> looks<00:06:53.530> like

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.770 

now<00:06:58.430> their<00:06:58.610> own<00:06:58.729> gyrocopters<00:06:59.419> not<00:06:59.599> hang

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
now their own gyrocopters not hang

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:06.290 
now their own gyrocopters not hang
gliders

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.240 

oh<00:07:06.360> it's<00:07:07.229> exactly<00:07:07.560> the<00:07:07.680> same<00:07:07.860> as<00:07:08.009> the<00:07:08.069> gold

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 
oh it's exactly the same as the gold
