00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.320
 and 'the machine' or colored sugar for 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.260
 Give a touch of brightness and color to 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.990
 our desserts and for this we are going to 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.680
 need 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.590
 a cookie baking tray 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.900
 waxed paper also white sugar 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.910
 Grainy and vegetable colors 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.550
 artificial of your preference 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.800
 let's put the sugar in a bowl or a 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.789
 dish and here there is no quantity all 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.890
 depends on how much you will need 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.960
 let's put a few drops of our 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.300
 vegetable color and remember that the more 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.300
 drops, the stronger the color 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.890
 let's mix very well going around 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.050
 but at the same time as if you were 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.420
 crushing the colored balls so that 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.930
 you will be very well painted the sugar this 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.940
 it takes between 2 or 3 minutes and more or less 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.570
 after this time it is starting to 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.559
 take color 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.559
 make sure there are no lumps 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.300
 and more or less there has to be something left 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.360
 A) Yes 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.670
 and as you can see there is something wet and so 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.680
 grip shine and you want dry let's 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.380
 put on our baking sheet 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.600
 some waxed paper 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.320
 we are going to empty the sugar along 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.320
 our tray 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.310
 With the help of a spoon we are going to 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.310
 extend very well 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.730
 and we're going to put it in our oven 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.730
 stove 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:57.490
 at a temperature of 350 between 8 to 10 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.490
 minutes 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.649
 when the tray is cold, the only thing 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.170
 we have to do is move a little bit the 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.530
 waxed paper to put all our 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.900
 sugar and you're ready to use 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.310
 you can store it in jars with balls 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.310
 of plastic as I am doing 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.780
 here I have other colors like blue and 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.440
 the green more pink and yellow and 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.890
 Red 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.150
 and an idea of how you can use it 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.150
 exposing lb your cupcake hand 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.570
 and they added the diamond in this way 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.440
 or you can also use whipped cream 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.190
 and put only a little bit of dust 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.590
 these are other options but the 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.110
 creativity is yours 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.750
 you can use it also on cookies or 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.590
 I hope you liked this cake 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.510
 video 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.459
 if so, give me a like and save it in 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.210
 your favorites I leave my social networks 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.790
 in case you use to share me some creation 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.170
 it's all because of the video of today and 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.170
