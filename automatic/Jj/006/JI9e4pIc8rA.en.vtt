so real quickly I just wanted to show
you<00:01:03.990> how<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.320> lair<00:01:04.710> sounds<00:01:05.430> between<00:01:05.850> multiple

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
you how I lair sounds between multiple

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.000 
you how I lair sounds between multiple
programs<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.110> control<00:01:07.530> them<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.830> geo

synthesizer<00:01:10.490> for<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.700> demo<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.510> started<00:01:13.320> with

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
synthesizer for this demo I started with

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.170 
synthesizer for this demo I started with
a<00:01:14.030> synth<00:01:15.030> pad<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.200> got<00:01:16.470> from<00:01:16.710> alchemy<00:01:17.250> so

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
a synth pad that I got from alchemy so

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.320 
a synth pad that I got from alchemy so
we'll<00:01:18.330> start<00:01:18.600> there<00:01:19.610> and<00:01:20.610> from<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.150> I've

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
we'll start there and from this I've

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.240 
we'll start there and from this I've
chosen<00:01:21.630> something<00:01:22.020> from<00:01:22.500> their<00:01:22.710> big<00:01:22.950> tone

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
chosen something from their big tone

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.280 
chosen something from their big tone
library<00:01:23.700> called<00:01:24.000> epics<00:01:24.450> well<00:01:24.720> we'll<00:01:25.110> just

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
library called epics well we'll just

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:33.800 
library called epics well we'll just
play<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.800> real<00:01:25.950> quick<00:01:32.150> and<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> pad

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
play for you real quick and for the pad

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.420 
play for you real quick and for the pad
I<00:01:33.840> want<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.320> actually<00:01:34.470> start<00:01:34.710> off<00:01:35.130> with

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
I want to actually start off with

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.640 
I want to actually start off with
silence<00:01:36.000> or<00:01:36.240> something<00:01:36.600> close<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.810> silence<00:01:37.410> so

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
silence or something close to silence so

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.770 
silence or something close to silence so
when<00:01:38.190> we<00:01:38.310> hit<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.580> notes<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:38.940> geo<00:01:39.150> synthesizer

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
when we hit the notes in geo synthesizer

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.010 
when we hit the notes in geo synthesizer
that<00:01:40.340> swell<00:01:41.340> will<00:01:41.520> kind<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.850> fade<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.360> which

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
that swell will kind of fade in which

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.390 
that swell will kind of fade in which
would<00:01:43.229> mean<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.440> when<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.770> play<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.190> faster

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
would mean that when you play the faster

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.130 
would mean that when you play the faster
notes<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.030> don't<00:01:45.060> actually<00:01:45.390> hear<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.869> swell

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
notes you don't actually hear the swell

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.530 
notes you don't actually hear the swell
so<00:01:46.860> what<00:01:47.220> I'm<00:01:47.310> going<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.520> do<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:48.030> bring<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
so what I'm going to do is bring the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.680 
so what I'm going to do is bring the
master<00:01:49.020> volume<00:01:49.229> all<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.590> way<00:01:49.680> down<00:01:50.450> put<00:01:51.450> that

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
master volume all the way down put that

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.420 
master volume all the way down put that
or<00:01:52.200> maybe<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.040> little<00:01:53.070> bit<00:01:53.369> above<00:01:54.060> that

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
or maybe just a little bit above that

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.580 
or maybe just a little bit above that
put<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.520> whole<00:01:56.700> top<00:01:56.970> Chinon<00:01:57.330> and<00:01:57.899> play<00:01:58.410> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
put the whole top Chinon and play the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.690 
put the whole top Chinon and play the
note<00:01:58.770> well<00:01:59.040> actually<00:01:59.190> I'm<00:01:59.399> going<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.580> hit

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
note well actually I'm going to hit

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.670 
note well actually I'm going to hit
record<00:02:01.190> play<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.369> note<00:02:02.580> and<00:02:03.290> then<00:02:04.290> bring<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
record play the note and then bring the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:17.780 
record play the note and then bring the
volume<00:02:04.860> up<00:02:16.280> that's<00:02:17.280> probably<00:02:17.580> good<00:02:17.760> enough

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
volume up that's probably good enough

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.060 
volume up that's probably good enough
sample<00:02:18.420> whiz<00:02:18.540> works<00:02:18.780> with<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.019> I<00:02:19.440> think<00:02:19.799> up<00:02:19.950> to

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
sample whiz works with a I think up to

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.370 
sample whiz works with a I think up to
ten<00:02:20.310> seconds<00:02:20.850> so<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.600> I<00:02:21.989> think<00:02:22.200> there's<00:02:22.320> a

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
ten seconds so and I think there's a

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.720 
ten seconds so and I think there's a
little<00:02:22.560> less<00:02:22.799> than<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.130> so<00:02:23.900> I'm<00:02:24.900> gonna<00:02:25.730> use

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
little less than that so I'm gonna use

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.030 
little less than that so I'm gonna use
the<00:02:26.970> copy<00:02:27.239> feature<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:28.049> copy<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.860> my

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
the copy feature to copy that to my

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.110 
the copy feature to copy that to my
clipboard<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:31.280> this<00:02:32.280> really<00:02:32.549> would<00:02:32.700> work<00:02:32.880> for

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
clipboard and this really would work for

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.229 
clipboard and this really would work for
any<00:02:33.299> program<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.780> has<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.290> audio

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
any program that has the audio

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.150 
any program that has the audio
copy/paste<00:02:36.239> feature<00:02:36.570> so<00:02:37.230> just<00:02:37.590> using<00:02:37.769> alchemy

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
copy/paste feature so just using alchemy

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.580 
copy/paste feature so just using alchemy
as<00:02:38.310> an<00:02:38.430> example<00:02:39.230> going<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.380> switch<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:42.590> sample

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
as an example going to switch to sample

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.370 
as an example going to switch to sample
is

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.930 

and<00:02:51.380> for<00:02:51.950> this<00:02:52.070> I'm<00:02:52.220> just<00:02:52.250> going<00:02:52.550> to<00:02:52.580> start

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
and for this I'm just going to start

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.240 
and for this I'm just going to start
with<00:02:53.270> just<00:02:54.080> so<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.290> can<00:02:54.410> see<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.650> process<00:02:54.860> to

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
with just so you can see the process to

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.910 
with just so you can see the process to
start<00:02:55.490> with<00:02:55.700> one<00:02:55.880> of<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.110> built-in<00:02:57.110> presets<00:02:57.350> I

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
start with one of the built-in presets I

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.770 
start with one of the built-in presets I
don't<00:02:58.310> know<00:02:58.370> will<00:02:58.520> choose<00:02:58.700> dream<00:02:59.060> voice<00:02:59.330> here

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
don't know will choose dream voice here

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.580 
don't know will choose dream voice here
and<00:03:04.330> that's<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.480> built-in<00:03:05.840> preset<00:03:06.260> whoa<00:03:06.410> and

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
and that's the built-in preset whoa and

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.740 
and that's the built-in preset whoa and
then<00:03:06.680> I'm<00:03:06.800> going<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.030> go<00:03:08.030> in<00:03:08.180> there<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.540> here

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
then I'm going to go in there and here

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.990 
then I'm going to go in there and here
is<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.020> audio<00:03:09.200> paste<00:03:10.130> feature<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:12.820> this<00:03:13.820> is

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
is the audio paste feature and this is

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.960 
is the audio paste feature and this is
my<00:03:14.270> clip<00:03:14.600> that<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:14.840> just<00:03:15.080> recorded<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.970> I'm

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
my clip that I just recorded and I'm

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.640 
my clip that I just recorded and I'm
going<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.150> select<00:03:17.420> that<00:03:17.540> choose<00:03:17.990> pace<00:03:18.290> clip

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
going to select that choose pace clip

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.070 
going to select that choose pace clip
and<00:03:18.940> then<00:03:19.940> it<00:03:20.030> will<00:03:20.150> paste<00:03:20.390> that<00:03:20.630> that

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
and then it will paste that that

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:31.720 
and then it will paste that that
waveform<00:03:21.350> into<00:03:22.900> sample<00:03:23.900> is

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.860 

and<00:03:32.730> I'm<00:03:33.180> gonna<00:03:33.299> set<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:34.459> so<00:03:35.459> that<00:03:35.750> when<00:03:36.750> it

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
and I'm gonna set it so that when it

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.119 
and I'm gonna set it so that when it
gets<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.230> end<00:03:37.379> of<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.530> sample<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:38.010> will

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
gets to the end of the sample it will

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.910 
gets to the end of the sample it will
reverse<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.700> play<00:03:38.849> backwards<00:03:39.680> just<00:03:40.680> doing

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
reverse and play backwards just doing

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.350 
reverse and play backwards just doing
this<00:03:41.069> real<00:03:41.280> quick<00:03:41.549> here<00:03:41.760> there<00:03:41.909> may<00:03:42.030> be<00:03:42.060> some

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
this real quick here there may be some

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.039 
this real quick here there may be some
audio<00:03:42.629> mix<00:03:43.019> at<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.379> end<00:03:43.940> so<00:03:44.940> now<00:03:45.540> I<00:03:45.599> have<00:03:45.870> this

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
audio mix at the end so now I have this

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.350 
audio mix at the end so now I have this
this<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:46.560> gonna<00:03:46.830> be<00:03:46.920> my<00:03:47.040> pass<00:03:47.280> sound<00:03:47.640> in<00:03:47.940> sample

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
this is gonna be my pass sound in sample

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.270 
this is gonna be my pass sound in sample
Wiz<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:48.780> what<00:03:49.440> I'm<00:03:49.530> going<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.709> do<00:03:49.920> is<00:03:50.129> I'm

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
Wiz and what I'm going to do is I'm

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.970 
Wiz and what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.459> set<00:03:50.819> in<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.540> MIDI<00:03:51.750> options<00:03:52.319> I've

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
going to set in the MIDI options I've

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.830 
going to set in the MIDI options I've
got<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.250> loud<00:03:53.459> background<00:03:53.700> MIDI<00:03:54.150> on<00:03:54.360> so<00:03:54.659> that<00:03:54.810> I

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
got a loud background MIDI on so that I

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.199 
got a loud background MIDI on so that I
can<00:03:55.110> send<00:03:55.409> to<00:03:55.739> this<00:03:55.980> program<00:03:56.459> from<00:03:56.940> Gio

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
can send to this program from Gio

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.430 
can send to this program from Gio
synthesizer<00:03:58.220> for<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.310> channels<00:04:00.200> I've<00:04:01.200> only

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
synthesizer for the channels I've only

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.800 
synthesizer for the channels I've only
got<00:04:01.709> MIDI<00:04:02.220> channel<00:04:02.670> 2<00:04:02.879> activated<00:04:03.599> and<00:04:03.720> what

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
got MIDI channel 2 activated and what

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.300 
got MIDI channel 2 activated and what
that<00:04:03.989> will<00:04:04.140> allow<00:04:04.349> me<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.530> do<00:04:04.799> is<00:04:05.040> when<00:04:05.190> I'm

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
that will allow me to do is when I'm

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.059 
that will allow me to do is when I'm
playing<00:04:05.609> on<00:04:06.329> channel<00:04:06.750> 1<00:04:07.319> or<00:04:07.590> really<00:04:07.799> any<00:04:07.980> other

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
channel in Gio synthesizer this this

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.440 
channel in Gio synthesizer this this
sound<00:04:10.440> will<00:04:10.620> not<00:04:10.650> play<00:04:11.099> so<00:04:11.730> it's<00:04:11.910> a<00:04:12.030> good<00:04:12.299> way

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
sound will not play so it's a good way

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.420 
sound will not play so it's a good way
to<00:04:12.480> kind<00:04:12.720> of<00:04:12.840> layer<00:04:13.049> things

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.030 

we'll<00:04:17.329> go<00:04:17.449> ahead<00:04:17.600> and<00:04:17.959> open<00:04:18.109> Geo<00:04:18.470> synthesiser

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
we'll go ahead and open Geo synthesiser

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.629 
we'll go ahead and open Geo synthesiser
now<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:21.520> I<00:04:22.520> am<00:04:23.030> going<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.240> load<00:04:23.480> up<00:04:24.639> my

with a MIDI configuration where we can

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.670 
with a MIDI configuration where we can
see<00:04:37.860> here<00:04:38.070> I've<00:04:38.160> got<00:04:38.190> it<00:04:38.460> set<00:04:38.669> to<00:04:38.699> send<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.330> I

see here I've got it set to send to I

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.529 
see here I've got it set to send to I
turn<00:04:40.680> alchemy<00:04:41.130> off<00:04:41.310> I'm<00:04:41.520> it's<00:04:41.639> set<00:04:41.910> to<00:04:41.940> sample

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
turn alchemy off I'm it's set to sample

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.590 
turn alchemy off I'm it's set to sample
wiz<00:04:42.690> and<00:04:43.080> we're<00:04:43.919> on<00:04:44.039> bass<00:04:44.250> channel<00:04:44.789> one<00:04:45.120> so

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
wiz and we're on bass channel one so

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.120 
wiz and we're on bass channel one so
when<00:04:45.810> I<00:04:45.840> play<00:04:46.169> this<00:04:46.380> I<00:04:46.560> should<00:04:46.800> just<00:04:46.979> be

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
when I play this I should just be

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.010 
when I play this I should just be
hearing<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:47.580> sample<00:04:47.940> angyeo<00:04:48.210> synthesizer<00:04:48.810> at

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
hearing the sample angyeo synthesizer at

00:04:49.020 --> 00:05:01.790 
hearing the sample angyeo synthesizer at
this<00:04:49.139> point<00:04:57.770> and<00:05:00.050> now<00:05:01.050> if<00:05:01.169> we<00:05:01.289> go<00:05:01.410> back<00:05:01.560> to<00:05:01.590> our

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
this point and now if we go back to our

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.650 
this point and now if we go back to our
base<00:05:01.949> channels<00:05:02.400> that<00:05:02.520> I<00:05:02.580> include<00:05:02.940> channel<00:05:03.360> 2

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.210 

that<00:05:06.660> down<00:05:06.840> you<00:05:07.020> can<00:05:07.050> hear<00:05:07.380> how<00:05:07.530> that<00:05:07.560> sample

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
that down you can hear how that sample

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.550 
that down you can hear how that sample
is<00:05:08.310> coming<00:05:08.610> in

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.379 

as<00:05:15.560> I<00:05:15.770> play<00:05:16.010> quicker<00:05:16.310> notes<00:05:16.610> over<00:05:16.970> that<00:05:17.120> sense

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
as I play quicker notes over that sense

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.870 
as I play quicker notes over that sense
it's<00:05:17.540> a<00:05:17.630> fade<00:05:17.870> in<00:05:18.250> well<00:05:19.250> I<00:05:19.280> can<00:05:19.490> hold<00:05:19.610> down<00:05:19.820> the

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
it's a fade in well I can hold down the

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.439 
it's a fade in well I can hold down the
base<00:05:20.210> and<00:05:20.660> that<00:05:20.960> base<00:05:21.100> since<00:05:22.100> had<00:05:22.430> the<00:05:23.240> quicker

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449 
base and that base since had the quicker

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:31.479 
base and that base since had the quicker
notes<00:05:23.720> don't<00:05:23.960> have<00:05:24.229> that

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:31.489 

00:05:31.489 --> 00:05:34.100 

so<00:05:32.489> now<00:05:32.669> we've<00:05:32.819> got<00:05:32.969> two<00:05:33.209> sounds<00:05:33.659> in<00:05:33.779> there<00:05:33.959> and

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
so now we've got two sounds in there and

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.350 
so now we've got two sounds in there and
we've<00:05:34.199> got<00:05:34.229> the<00:05:34.499> ability<00:05:34.559> to<00:05:34.830> turn<00:05:35.159> turn<00:05:36.119> our

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
we've got the ability to turn turn our

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.589 
we've got the ability to turn turn our
pad<00:05:36.659> off<00:05:36.929> as<00:05:37.169> well<00:05:37.319> I'm<00:05:37.649> going<00:05:37.919> to<00:05:38.039> add<00:05:38.249> in<00:05:38.819> yet

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
pad off as well I'm going to add in yet

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:45.290 
pad off as well I'm going to add in yet
another<00:05:39.749> sound<00:05:40.319> with<00:05:40.619> thumbjam<00:05:42.199> and<00:05:44.149> the<00:05:45.149> only

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
another sound with thumbjam and the only

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.729 
another sound with thumbjam and the only
thing<00:05:45.479> I<00:05:45.539> don't<00:05:45.599> like<00:05:45.749> about<00:05:45.839> thumb<00:05:46.289> jam<00:05:46.529> is

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:46.739 
thing I don't like about thumb jam is

00:05:46.739 --> 00:05:48.439 
thing I don't like about thumb jam is
that<00:05:46.919> it's<00:05:47.069> all<00:05:47.219> in<00:05:47.369> portrait<00:05:47.789> mode<00:05:47.819> so<00:05:48.300> when

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:48.449 
that it's all in portrait mode so when

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:49.579 
that it's all in portrait mode so when
I'm<00:05:48.539> doing<00:05:48.779> something<00:05:48.809> like<00:05:49.139> this<00:05:49.409> I<00:05:49.559> just

kind of have to work sideways I'm gonna
pick<00:05:52.050> a<00:05:52.080> sound<00:05:52.729> let's<00:05:53.729> see

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979

00:05:57.769 --> 00:05:57.779 
category we'll choose maybe like a

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:09.499 
category we'll choose maybe like a
string<00:05:58.259> sound<00:06:03.409> if<00:06:04.409> I<00:06:04.589> can<00:06:04.769> find<00:06:05.129> one<00:06:05.369> here<00:06:08.509> I've

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:09.509 
string sound if I can find one here I've

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:10.939 
string sound if I can find one here I've
got<00:06:09.629> already<00:06:09.719> got<00:06:09.959> it<00:06:10.079> selected<00:06:10.259> so<00:06:10.709> it's<00:06:10.860> a

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:10.949 
got already got it selected so it's a

I'm<00:06:16.949> gonna<00:06:17.159> go<00:06:17.339> into<00:06:17.579> MIDI<00:06:17.849> make<00:06:18.360> sure<00:06:18.569> that

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:18.749 
I'm gonna go into MIDI make sure that

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:22.179 
I'm gonna go into MIDI make sure that
audio<00:06:19.169> or<00:06:20.039> active<00:06:20.429> and<00:06:20.610> background<00:06:21.089> is<00:06:21.269> on<00:06:21.419> and

00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:22.189 
audio or active and background is on and

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:24.589 
audio or active and background is on and
right<00:06:23.189> now<00:06:23.309> I've<00:06:23.429> got<00:06:23.639> on<00:06:23.819> me<00:06:23.999> mode<00:06:24.179> set<00:06:24.479> on

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
right now I've got on me mode set on

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:26.929 
right now I've got on me mode set on
which<00:06:24.779> means<00:06:24.959> that<00:06:25.229> any<00:06:25.379> MIDI<00:06:25.800> signal<00:06:26.789> that's

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:26.939 
which means that any MIDI signal that's

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:28.579 
which means that any MIDI signal that's
being<00:06:27.089> sent<00:06:27.360> regardless<00:06:27.869> of<00:06:28.019> Channel<00:06:28.409> will

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:28.589 
being sent regardless of Channel will

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:30.859 
being sent regardless of Channel will
play<00:06:28.860> in<00:06:29.129> thumbjam<00:06:29.429> if<00:06:29.909> you<00:06:30.329> wanted<00:06:30.629> to<00:06:30.719> turn

00:06:30.859 --> 00:06:30.869 
play in thumbjam if you wanted to turn

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:33.169 
play in thumbjam if you wanted to turn
that<00:06:31.079> off<00:06:31.139> then<00:06:31.679> it<00:06:32.519> would<00:06:32.639> only<00:06:32.729> play<00:06:32.969> on

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:33.179 
that off then it would only play on

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:35.449 
that off then it would only play on
channel<00:06:33.539> one<00:06:33.749> or<00:06:34.229> there's<00:06:34.769> a<00:06:34.829> second<00:06:35.279> sound

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:35.459 
channel one or there's a second sound

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:36.799 
channel one or there's a second sound
you<00:06:35.579> can<00:06:35.729> load<00:06:35.879> that<00:06:35.909> we<00:06:36.089> play<00:06:36.300> on<00:06:36.329> channel

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:36.809 
you can load that we play on channel

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:38.359 
you can load that we play on channel
channel<00:06:37.529> two<00:06:37.709> so<00:06:37.919> there's<00:06:38.069> a<00:06:38.159> lot<00:06:38.279> of

00:06:38.359 --> 00:06:38.369 
channel two so there's a lot of

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:39.769 
channel two so there's a lot of
possibilities<00:06:38.999> here<00:06:39.240> but<00:06:39.389> for<00:06:39.539> now<00:06:39.629> we'll

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:39.779 
possibilities here but for now we'll

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:42.619 
possibilities here but for now we'll
just<00:06:39.929> keep<00:06:40.019> it<00:06:40.169> an<00:06:40.289> omni<00:06:40.559> mode<00:06:41.300> now<00:06:42.300> if<00:06:42.419> I<00:06:42.479> go

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:42.629 
just keep it an omni mode now if I go

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:47.839 
just keep it an omni mode now if I go
back<00:06:42.809> to<00:06:42.839> geo<00:06:43.229> synth<00:06:43.499> and<00:06:46.189> set<00:06:47.189> my<00:06:47.429> base

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:47.849 
back to geo synth and set my base

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:50.869 
back to geo synth and set my base
channel<00:06:48.360> back<00:06:48.539> to<00:06:48.569> one<00:06:49.159> turn<00:06:50.159> my<00:06:50.369> volume<00:06:50.550> down

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:50.879 
channel back to one turn my volume down

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:53.779 
channel back to one turn my volume down
in<00:06:51.059> geo<00:06:51.240> synthesizer<00:06:52.279> there's<00:06:53.279> my<00:06:53.490> cello

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:53.789 
in geo synthesizer there's my cello

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:58.520 
in geo synthesizer there's my cello
sound

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.890 

and<00:06:59.580> then<00:07:00.580> if<00:07:00.760> I<00:07:00.880> bring<00:07:01.060> the<00:07:01.210> volume<00:07:01.570> up<00:07:01.720> I've

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:01.900 
and then if I bring the volume up I've

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:08.690 
and then if I bring the volume up I've
got<00:07:02.140> cello<00:07:02.470> and<00:07:02.740> the<00:07:02.920> Wizards<00:07:03.400> flute

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700

and<00:07:09.700> if<00:07:10.420> I<00:07:10.630> turn<00:07:10.930> to<00:07:11.110> Bass<00:07:11.260> channel<00:07:11.680> 2<00:07:11.920> now<00:07:12.220> I'm

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 
and if I turn to Bass channel 2 now I'm

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.020 
and if I turn to Bass channel 2 now I'm
sending<00:07:12.640> to<00:07:12.850> both<00:07:13.000> thumbjam<00:07:14.430> sample<00:07:15.430> whiz<00:07:15.580> and

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.030 
sending to both thumbjam sample whiz and

sending to both thumbjam sample whiz and
playing<00:07:16.390> in<00:07:16.570> geo<00:07:16.750> synthesizer<00:07:17.380> so

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:35.100 

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.460

can hear it's a great way to kind of

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.900 
can hear it's a great way to kind of
layer<00:07:39.060> sounds<00:07:39.980> makes<00:07:40.980> them<00:07:41.220> make<00:07:41.520> some<00:07:41.730> new

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:41.910 
layer sounds makes them make some new

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:47.630 
layer sounds makes them make some new
pads<00:07:42.210> and<00:07:42.960> and<00:07:44.180> there<00:07:45.180> you<00:07:45.300> have<00:07:45.480> it
