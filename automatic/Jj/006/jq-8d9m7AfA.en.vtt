all right we're gonna look at gravity

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.910 
all right we're gonna look at gravity
pull<00:01:25.280> and<00:01:26.899> then<00:01:27.899> gravity<00:01:28.470> mine<00:01:30.680> now<00:01:31.680> that

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
pull and then gravity mine now that

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.039 
pull and then gravity mine now that
one's<00:01:32.130> are<00:01:32.280> pretty<00:01:32.460> cool<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.820> mean<00:01:33.210> if<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.990> don't

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
down there orbit Oh strike and Lex probe

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.770 
down there orbit Oh strike and Lex probe
whoops

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780

this a pink kind of aura thing
ouch<00:02:20.870> green<00:02:21.379> arrow<00:02:21.680> definitely<00:02:22.430> not<00:02:22.610> happy

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
ouch green arrow definitely not happy

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.449 
ouch green arrow definitely not happy
right<00:02:23.120> now<00:02:26.739> all<00:02:27.739> right<00:02:27.799> we're<00:02:28.069> going<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.220> use

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
right now all right we're going to use

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:41.880 
right now all right we're going to use

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.030 

so<00:02:42.550> that<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:43.030> Lex<00:02:43.420> Luthor<00:02:43.960> super<00:02:44.530> let's<00:02:44.770> grab

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
so that is Lex Luthor super let's grab

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.750 
so that is Lex Luthor super let's grab
him

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
him

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.780
