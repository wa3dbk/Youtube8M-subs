so it makes it makes things a lot more
difficult<00:01:55.830> you<00:01:55.890> don't<00:01:56.040> really<00:01:56.160> get<00:01:56.340> kind<00:01:56.670> of

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
difficult you don't really get kind of

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.360 
difficult you don't really get kind of
the<00:01:56.820> marshmallows<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.570> do<00:01:57.690> at<00:01:57.870> big<00:01:58.170> events<00:01:58.370> so

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
the marshmallows you do at big events so

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.980 
the marshmallows you do at big events so
bigs<00:01:59.700> definitely<00:02:00.120> starting<00:02:00.450> gets<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.660> lot<00:02:00.780> more

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
bigs definitely starting gets a lot more

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.420 
bigs definitely starting gets a lot more
difficult<00:02:01.470> just<00:02:01.620> because<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:02.160> know<00:02:02.250> your

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
difficult just because you know your

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
small line and you can't just count on

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.050 
small line and you can't just count on
being<00:02:04.560> able<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.860> plane<00:02:05.250> over<00:02:05.520> someone<00:02:05.910> or

really takes I think the most the most
important<00:03:23.610> thing<00:03:23.700> is<00:03:23.819> teamwork<00:03:24.349> you<00:03:25.349> can<00:03:25.590> be<00:03:26.430> a

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
important thing is teamwork you can be a
