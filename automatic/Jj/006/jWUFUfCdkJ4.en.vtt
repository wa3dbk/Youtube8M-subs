00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.280 

so<00:01:44.470> five<00:01:44.950> five<00:01:45.250> on<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.760> fifth<00:01:45.970> string<00:01:46.290> seven

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
so five five on the fifth string seven

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.460 
so five five on the fifth string seven
on<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.530> fourth<00:01:48.570> seven<00:01:49.570> eight<00:01:49.780> seven<00:01:50.290> on<00:01:50.409> the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
on the fourth seven eight seven on the

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.680 
on the fourth seven eight seven on the
floor<00:01:50.680> mmm<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:51.790> then<00:01:51.909> it<00:01:52.030> pull<00:01:52.240> off<00:01:52.300> to<00:01:52.450> five

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
floor mmm and then it pull off to five

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.830 
floor mmm and then it pull off to five
mm-hmm<00:01:53.590> and<00:01:54.369> I<00:01:54.550> think<00:01:54.790> it's<00:01:54.880> just<00:01:54.940> five<00:01:55.330> on<00:01:55.690> the

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
mm-hmm and I think it's just five on the

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.010 
mm-hmm and I think it's just five on the
fourth<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:56.860> seven<00:01:57.400> twice<00:01:57.610> on<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:57.909> third<00:01:58.119> but

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
fourth and seven twice on the third but

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.690 
fourth and seven twice on the third but
I<00:01:59.049> couldn't<00:01:59.380> really<00:01:59.470> tell<00:01:59.740> that<00:01:59.920> part<00:02:00.130> so<00:02:00.460> that

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
I couldn't really tell that part so that

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.090 
I couldn't really tell that part so that
might<00:02:01.390> not<00:02:01.600> be<00:02:01.630> completely<00:02:02.500> correct<00:02:02.740> but

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
might not be completely correct but

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.700 
might not be completely correct but
anyway<00:02:03.399> so<00:02:04.210> that's<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.479> first<00:02:04.780> part<00:02:05.020> and<00:02:05.320> then

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
anyway so that's the first part and then

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.680 
anyway so that's the first part and then
I<00:02:05.740> I<00:02:06.130> think<00:02:06.430> you<00:02:06.940> might<00:02:07.119> have<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.360> neck<00:02:07.540> pick

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
I I think you might have the neck pick

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.690 
I I think you might have the neck pick
on<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:08.020> whole<00:02:08.200> time<00:02:08.410> on<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:08.950> whole<00:02:09.280> time<00:02:09.429> but

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
on the whole time on the whole time but

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.790 
on the whole time on the whole time but
I<00:02:09.940> switched<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.600> neck<00:02:10.810> pickup<00:02:11.050> for<00:02:11.440> this<00:02:11.560> next

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
I switched the neck pickup for this next

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.150 
I switched the neck pickup for this next
part

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:19.870

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670

the<00:02:28.650> third<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.459> think<00:02:29.640> he<00:02:29.700> kind<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:29.970> bends

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150
