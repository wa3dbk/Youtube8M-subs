00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.360
 I will tell you about the issue of tactics 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.309
 Invoker with moms in what sense of tactics 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.789

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.810
 initial purchase sprig colgate angus and 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.810
 go to the mid and farmim will not give 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.340
 but if everything is bad with farm 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.680
