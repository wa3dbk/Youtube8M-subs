00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
really a bad idea to be honest uh

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.290 
really a bad idea to be honest uh
there's<00:00:27.710> multiple<00:00:28.249> reasons<00:00:28.460> I<00:00:28.819> mean<00:00:28.970> yeah<00:00:29.179> of

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
there's multiple reasons I mean yeah of

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.639 
there's multiple reasons I mean yeah of
course<00:00:29.569> you're<00:00:29.749> going<00:00:29.869> to<00:00:29.929> get<00:00:30.019> mad<00:00:30.230> at<00:00:30.289> them

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:30.649 
course you're going to get mad at them

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.350 
course you're going to get mad at them
sometimes<00:00:31.369> you're<00:00:31.759> going<00:00:31.909> to<00:00:31.970> want<00:00:32.119> to<00:00:32.239> work

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
sometimes you're going to want to work

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.430 
sometimes you're going to want to work
they're<00:00:32.750> going<00:00:32.870> to<00:00:32.930> want<00:00:33.020> to<00:00:33.170> screw<00:00:33.410> around

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
they're going to want to screw around

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
they're going to want to screw around
that's<00:00:34.010> that's<00:00:34.340> obvious<00:00:34.820> you<00:00:35.449> know<00:00:35.769> but<00:00:36.769> there

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
that's that's obvious you know but there

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.119 
that's that's obvious you know but there
there<00:00:38.000> are<00:00:38.030> other<00:00:38.329> reasons<00:00:38.660> first<00:00:39.500> of<00:00:39.649> all<00:00:39.829> if

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
there are other reasons first of all if

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.970 
there are other reasons first of all if
you're<00:00:40.699> just<00:00:40.940> starting<00:00:41.379> the<00:00:42.379> learning<00:00:42.769> curve

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
you're just starting the learning curve

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.910 
you're just starting the learning curve
for<00:00:43.129> a<00:00:43.280> programmer<00:00:43.879> is<00:00:44.210> about<00:00:44.539> ten<00:00:45.199> times<00:00:45.559> more

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
for a programmer is about ten times more

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.130 
for a programmer is about ten times more
than<00:00:46.129> an<00:00:46.460> artist<00:00:46.879> or<00:00:47.089> musician<00:00:47.149> I'm<00:00:48.019> not

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
than an artist or musician I'm not

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.919 
than an artist or musician I'm not
saying<00:00:48.379> their<00:00:48.620> job<00:00:48.859> is<00:00:49.129> any<00:00:49.539> easier<00:00:50.539> because

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:50.929 
saying their job is any easier because

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.110 
saying their job is any easier because
it's<00:00:51.199> not<00:00:51.379> but<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:51.769> learning<00:00:52.219> curve<00:00:52.489> itself

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
it's not but the learning curve itself

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.020 
it's not but the learning curve itself
it<00:00:53.749> takes<00:00:53.989> a<00:00:54.109> programmer<00:00:54.829> much<00:00:55.129> more<00:00:55.519> time<00:00:55.730> to

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
it takes a programmer much more time to

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.060 
it takes a programmer much more time to
get<00:00:56.149> to<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:56.359> level<00:00:56.570> where<00:00:56.719> they<00:00:56.960> can<00:00:56.989> work<00:00:57.859> on

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
get to the level where they can work on

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.649 
get to the level where they can work on
a<00:00:58.129> game<00:00:58.429> that<00:00:58.640> does<00:00:58.820> for<00:00:59.059> an<00:00:59.120> artist<00:00:59.480> or

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
a game that does for an artist or

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.959 
a game that does for an artist or
musician<00:00:59.690> and<00:01:00.379> that<00:01:01.309> can<00:01:01.489> cause<00:01:01.640> a<00:01:01.699> lot<00:01:01.940> of

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
musician and that can cause a lot of

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.700 
musician and that can cause a lot of
problems<00:01:02.480> if<00:01:02.629> you're<00:01:02.780> just<00:01:02.870> starting<00:01:03.260> in<00:01:03.649> a

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
problems if you're just starting in a

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.460 
problems if you're just starting in a
team<00:01:04.750> also<00:01:06.130> working<00:01:07.130> in<00:01:07.370> a<00:01:07.490> team<00:01:07.730> like<00:01:08.120> weed<00:01:08.570> we

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
team also working in a team like weed we

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.260 
team also working in a team like weed we
don't<00:01:09.620> get<00:01:09.890> together<00:01:10.040> and<00:01:10.400> make<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.670> game<00:01:10.880> all

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
don't get together and make the game all

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.770 
don't get together and make the game all
the<00:01:11.420> time<00:01:11.470> that's<00:01:12.470> not<00:01:12.650> really<00:01:12.830> how<00:01:12.980> it<00:01:13.010> works

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
the time that's not really how it works

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.380 
the time that's not really how it works
during<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:14.900> week<00:01:15.200> we<00:01:15.560> sit<00:01:15.830> at<00:01:15.950> home<00:01:16.100> alone<00:01:16.390> not

seeing each other not in contact each
other<00:01:19.370> and<00:01:19.700> we<00:01:19.760> get<00:01:19.910> our<00:01:20.030> stuff<00:01:20.300> done<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:20.720> then

integrate our stuff you know it's still

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.050 
integrate our stuff you know it's still
a<00:01:26.150> very<00:01:26.540> antisocial<00:01:27.080> process<00:01:27.980> game<00:01:28.430> creation

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
a very antisocial process game creation

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.630 
a very antisocial process game creation
itself<00:01:29.890> you<00:01:30.890> have<00:01:31.010> to<00:01:31.100> be<00:01:31.160> able<00:01:31.220> to<00:01:31.370> sit<00:01:31.520> alone

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
itself you have to be able to sit alone

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.490 
itself you have to be able to sit alone
in<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:32.120> dark<00:01:32.360> room<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:32.840> think<00:01:33.020> about<00:01:33.290> this

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
in a dark room and think about this

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.860 
in a dark room and think about this
stuff<00:01:33.740> you<00:01:33.980> can't<00:01:34.250> just<00:01:34.360> create<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.540> entire

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
stuff you can't just create the entire

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.260 
stuff you can't just create the entire
game<00:01:36.140> together<00:01:36.440> that<00:01:36.860> doesn't<00:01:37.220> work<00:01:37.370> and<00:01:37.640> in

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
game together that doesn't work and in

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.580 
game together that doesn't work and in
order<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.570> be<00:01:38.630> able<00:01:38.690> to<00:01:38.810> do<00:01:38.930> that<00:01:39.080> you<00:01:39.260> all<00:01:39.410> have

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
order to be able to do that you all have

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.400 
order to be able to do that you all have
to<00:01:39.620> be<00:01:39.770> self-motivated<00:01:40.430> and<00:01:41.050> finding<00:01:42.050> a<00:01:42.140> team

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
to be self-motivated and finding a team

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.560 
to be self-motivated and finding a team
that<00:01:42.740> believes<00:01:43.250> in<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.670> same<00:01:43.910> thing<00:01:44.180> you<00:01:44.360> do

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.169 
easier for him like he estimate his our

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.309 
easier for him like he estimate his our
job<00:03:42.650> easier<00:03:43.010> for<00:03:43.220> us<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:43.639> I<00:03:44.540> really<00:03:45.079> think

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
job easier for us and I really think

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.970 
job easier for us and I really think
that<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:45.650> need<00:03:45.950> a<00:03:45.980> team<00:03:46.310> that<00:03:47.120> is<00:03:47.329> not<00:03:48.109> they

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
that you need a team that is not they

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.830 
that you need a team that is not they
focused<00:03:49.489> in<00:03:49.669> one<00:03:49.880> area<00:03:50.180> but<00:03:50.359> they're<00:03:50.660> also

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840

knowledgeable of the other areas of game

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.059

if you're doing this you're obviously an
ambitious<00:04:21.299> person<00:04:21.540> but<00:04:22.170> don't<00:04:22.410> let<00:04:22.590> that<00:04:22.620> get

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
ambitious person but don't let that get

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
something I'm a bunch of unfinished

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.600 
something I'm a bunch of unfinished
games<00:04:57.690> you<00:04:58.050> know<00:04:58.200> they<00:04:58.530> compile<00:04:59.010> but<00:04:59.400> they're

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
games you know they compile but they're

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.920 
games you know they compile but they're
not<00:04:59.730> much<00:04:59.940> to<00:05:00.120> show<00:05:00.150> off<00:05:00.540> because<00:05:01.250> usually<00:05:02.250> I

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
not much to show off because usually I

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.130 
not much to show off because usually I
tend<00:05:03.930> to<00:05:03.960> do<00:05:04.140> too<00:05:04.320> much<00:05:04.560> and<00:05:04.919> then<00:05:05.750> slowly<00:05:06.750> you

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
tend to do too much and then slowly you

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.840 
tend to do too much and then slowly you
know<00:05:07.260> you<00:05:07.350> sort<00:05:07.710> of<00:05:07.800> lose<00:05:07.919> motivation<00:05:08.220> when

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
know you sort of lose motivation when

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.700 
know you sort of lose motivation when
you're<00:05:09.000> not<00:05:09.180> reaching<00:05:09.690> your<00:05:10.020> own<00:05:10.140> standards

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
you're not reaching your own standards

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.730 
you're not reaching your own standards
but<00:05:11.220> I<00:05:11.510> think<00:05:12.510> you<00:05:12.690> need<00:05:12.810> to<00:05:12.870> start<00:05:13.229> off<00:05:13.380> simple

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
but I think you need to start off simple

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.880 
but I think you need to start off simple
and<00:05:14.130> then<00:05:14.430> slowly<00:05:14.840> progress<00:05:15.840> harder<00:05:16.740> and

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
and then slowly progress harder and

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.490 
and then slowly progress harder and
harder<00:05:17.100> don't<00:05:17.520> i<00:05:17.790> see<00:05:18.510> so<00:05:18.750> many<00:05:18.870> people<00:05:18.990> oh<00:05:19.350> I'm

that's<00:05:39.720> let's<00:05:40.680> weigh<00:05:40.860> more<00:05:41.100> realistic<00:05:41.610> you

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
that's let's weigh more realistic you

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.550 
that's let's weigh more realistic you
can<00:05:41.880> actually<00:05:42.000> do<00:05:42.360> that<00:05:42.570> and<00:05:43.290> then<00:05:43.380> once

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
can actually do that and then once

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.990 
can actually do that and then once
you've<00:05:43.710> done<00:05:43.919> that<00:05:43.979> you<00:05:44.370> can<00:05:44.400> do<00:05:44.700> something

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
you've done that you can do something

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.200 
you've done that you can do something
like<00:05:45.800> I'm<00:05:46.800> going<00:05:46.950> to<00:05:47.040> make<00:05:47.190> a<00:05:47.220> Mario<00:05:48.030> Brothers

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
like I'm going to make a Mario Brothers

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.850 
like I'm going to make a Mario Brothers
clone<00:05:48.660> you<00:05:48.840> know<00:05:48.960> that's<00:05:49.169> cool<00:05:49.380> yeah<00:05:49.530> you're

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
clone you know that's cool yeah you're

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.159 
clone you know that's cool yeah you're
working<00:05:50.010> your<00:05:50.310> way<00:05:50.460> up<00:05:50.490> and<00:05:51.270> I<00:05:51.360> think<00:05:51.660> that's

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
working your way up and I think that's

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.130 
working your way up and I think that's
definitely<00:05:53.010> the<00:05:53.400> way<00:05:53.550> to<00:05:53.580> go<00:05:53.729> don't<00:05:54.600> reach<00:05:54.810> too

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
definitely the way to go don't reach too

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.640 
definitely the way to go don't reach too
far<00:05:55.169> with<00:05:55.620> your<00:05:55.650> first<00:05:55.950> projects
