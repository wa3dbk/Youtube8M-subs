00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:13.339
 everyone gets to Portal Xing TV I welcome you to our second 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:18.509
 Episode of our project we build a PC in today's broadcast I would like 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:23.019
 you guys imagine the hard drives that block their system " 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.730
 were kindly put by Siegel to leadership 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.360
 We once got out of the Bawag or Series 3 that pot disks as well 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.610
 a hard disk for the enterprise and server 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.840
 around area 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.710
 the percent better disks are each barracuda he 7200 points 11 um 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.620
 there are up to a size of linen comma five by bike 1 we have 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.480
 a little Preiner 20 more far hard drive 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.450
 then a TERA at sound submit a one-comma 5 terabyte hard disk 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.960
 The obstruction can eat each time disks 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.000
 then there is living in Norman right up to the increasingly hard drives themselves 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.300
 for hand data transfer rates up to 120 megawatts per second 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.330
 who have the bigger 32 Negro White Ka Stiegl of a kind 16 megawatt cash 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.200
 um are designed for low current systems 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.810
 and there are closer to the hard drive each position guarantee of five 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.680
 years 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.880
 around 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.760
 at the server hard disk that it with Barak or only at 2 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.920
 The Birds not only delivered in the middle sata connection but also 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.680
 with a taser is 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.650
 by connection percent that's one percent 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.590
 Connection format, which is compatible with Ska downwards 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.149
 and especially in Enterprise our area percent is being used the 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.410
 Hard drives offer percent transfer rates up to 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.510
 around Riahi command LTi per second that's really crazy 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.719
 this, of course 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.709
 particularly interesting one big data streams on the hard disks 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:51.640
 stores 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.230
 or even media data for example 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.450
 to be especially interesting for us because we are the area 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.800
 Here are our records and a computer synonymous in the very safe 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.550
 Area 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.799
 in order to 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.120
 Test percent on his abilities accordingly 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.170
 The hard drives are said to be especially for the server and for that 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.719
 enterprise area thought 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.730
 also offer a special powertrain features 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.269
 so that they are a particularly thrifty in standby mode percent that of course 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.299
 even with large server farms is very important choice then appropriate 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.509
 Number of firmer use has 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:31.509
 Minden in the big data centers, of course, has every what's the Nine one 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:35.839
 Disk uses percent important and can very quickly become very expensive yes 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:39.109
 so much to the disks of seal the time through the hard drives summer 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:39.769
 short 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.260
 in the close-up 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.950
 Dahl so that you get a death as the hard drives look that is natural 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.079
 nothing special 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.819
 but in the medial of impression from the disk gets 9% short 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:28.129
 yes that should now be so far to those hard drives again many 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.319
 thanks to you for your money that you have provided us with the disks 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.530
 Of course I will show you Norma in the intended cases 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.370
 Aldi like the hard drives will cool because we have a water cooling system 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.090
 Innovate corner to get the leadership that allows us to the 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.840
 said to cool the hard disk by water then we have housing shape 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.060
 Lines SDI allows us a passive cooling of the hard drives which I will 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.180
 then introduce Norma and of course you will get the hard drives 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.520
 see the close-up after installation and then I can also 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.150
 Details of percent of disks go down 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.239
 and of course afterwards when the system is completely assembled I want 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.180
 of course, see 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.699
 the afloat hard disks are 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:10.379
 especially the Bawag or only 12 2 percent very interesting there I am 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.860
 looking forward to what three new data transfer rates 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.320
 we can determine here 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.070
 yes so much to today's broadcast to the next sad
