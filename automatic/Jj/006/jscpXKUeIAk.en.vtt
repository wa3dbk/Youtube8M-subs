00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.000
 i 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.040
 it is important to recognize the pastures in 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:36.410
 first instance to know 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.440
 what productive types do we have in the 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.920
 fields what is your cycle and in that way 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.610
 able to implement management according to the 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.320
 species that we have this is a concept 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.010
 very important that can be summarized 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.920
 as plant heterogeneity is to say the 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.559
 know the different pastures takes us 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.559
 to recognize that there are different 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.080
 plant communities present in the 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.300
 establishments or on a smaller scale yet 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.780
 in pastures or in a paddock 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.840
 that will allow us to isolate that kind of 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.930
 communities and manage them to parts things 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.930
 what things or plant communities that 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.750
 they are different handled the same as 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.910
 there is always someone who suffers 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.000
 the fields were traditionally divided 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.950
 by the presence of water gives in forms 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.690
 more modern by type of floor or 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.420
 it is known that even in one of 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.460
 soil type may exist different 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.170
 plant communities that need 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.750
 different handles since the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.960
 potentiality and seasonality in the 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.270
 grass production 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.100
 many times we get scared because 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.860
 they talk about our fields in the 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.470
 environment of 400 grasses or 400 gr girls 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.140
 different and it is not necessary 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.869
 recognize them all you know and that's 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.570
 studied that in the environment between 7 to 15 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.460
 species are the ones that dominate in each 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.729
 plant community and are those 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.180
 contribute more or less to 80% of the 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:10.330
 forage production know those 10 or 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.430
 15 or a little less some places 7 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.100
 species that produce the bulk of the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.230
 forage production is very important to 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.110
 When making decisions for 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.239
 perform management according to the 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.650
 potential of that plant community 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.840
 that's why it's important and that's what 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.600
 base the fact of knowing the 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.430
 pastures as well as any craftsman 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.480
 knows the inputs with which it is 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:40.030
 working the agricultural producer 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.459
 necessarily have to know the 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.120
 main species that are present 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.120
 in their fields 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:57.730
 to recognize the main pastures 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.890
 first of all you have to choose the time 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.510
 correct the best time to recognize 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.090
 the pastures that when the pastures have 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.450
 inflorescences that station is the 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.520
 spring since it matches that the grasses 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.950
 of winter are all with 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.520
 inflorescence and many of the pastures of 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.950
 summer are beginning to produce their 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.810
 inflorescence already there is that almost 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.150
 all the botanical surveys in the 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.570
 experiments are done in the spring 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.450
 for the ease of finding 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.350
 inflorescences and in that way for a 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.240
 beginner it becomes much easier 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.090
 recognize the species trying to 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.220
 identify the inflorescences and the 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.190
 learning of the species is done 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.120
 first for pleasure 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.460
 because people like to recognize the 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.210
 Pastures are interested in recognizing the 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:53.430
 themselves and another thing that is important is 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.170
 the training and the repetition one 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.330
 can learn a grass forget 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.340
 he resorts to books he resorts to a 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.650
 who knows but eventually the 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.990
 learn by repetition that is, there is no 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.060
 to be frustrated at the beginning that you do not know 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.790
 remember names is necessary 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.420
 emphasize that all species have 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.340
 vulgar names that can result 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.430
 that confusion and that depends on the 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.480
 locality in which one is located and 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.540
 for that are the scientific names 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.700
 which are written in Latin or words 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.650
 Greekized in order to order 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.490
 the species that's called the 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.980
 taxonomy this in general term and 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.380
 avoid confusions that may result 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.960
 with the names with the title example in 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.640
 the uruguay there is in the environment of 13-14 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.800
 species that as a common name have 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.010
 fox tail and that gives much room to 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.960
 confusions why scientists and 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.940
 the technicians in general speak with 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:54.020
 with the technical names are names 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:56.060
 scientists for good going back to the subject 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.700
 of the best time is spring the 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.410
 beginners should start as how 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.340
 say up and down looking at the 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.620
 inflorescence and for this the species 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.330
 they have particular characteristics with 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.880
 which this one can 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.220
 differentiate first is the 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.080
 inflorescence what good the 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.120
 inflorescence can be presented from 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.610
 different ways has characteristics 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.250
 special can be bread sheets can 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:26.950
 be ears can be bunches and also 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:31.360
 it's something that visually is easily 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:34.060
 differentiable once we learn to 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.490
 to differentiate species by those by 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.330
 good inflorescences we can see the 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.639
 blades of grasses that can be 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.819
 different ways can be blades 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:48.340
 thin can be wide sheets can 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:50.680
 have to end with articulated 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.229
 say in tip have can have a 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.909
 Rounded tip may have an apex 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:58.509
 navicular and that means according 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:06:00.639
 shaped boat shaped boat 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:03.280
 can have their in their initial part 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:05.409
 presence of hairs there depends if the 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.020
 of the length of the flights of hairs that 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:11.349
 They can be as long as wide a 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.629
 width of the blade there are ribs a 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:15.909
 central nerve very marked a rib 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:18.430
 centrally marked in turn in some 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:20.680
 species this can be translucent or not 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.650
 or there may be several ribs for the 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.439
 report we have in turn the liguila that 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:29.349
 is when the sheet ends and the 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:31.990
 lalan gula pod is an extension of 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:35.050
 the pod and there are different types of 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.300
 Lilacs can be membrane in membrane 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.940
 towards high membrane towards low 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.770
 grace to say transparent color 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:44.979
 it can be chestnut colored it can be 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.330
 dissolved in truncated hairs dissolved in 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:48.039
 cilias that means that until the 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.940
 half is dissolved in hair after 

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:54.879
 membranes already that is whether there are different 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.039
 types of lilacs or in some cases in the 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:59.530
 non - existence of lÃ­gula as it is in the 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:02.470
 case of the echinochloa after we have 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:06.879
 from the sheath when the gasket 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:08.830
 lilac with this one with the pseudo stem there 

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:11.650
 begins the pod that the pod can be 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:14.530
 in life it can be closed and finally 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:17.740
 we have the basis of all that can 

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:20.949
 be the presence of stolons and rhizomes 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:25.150
 all this is the set of 

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:27.419
 characteristics helps us to give 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.409
 steps to identify the species 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:31.569
 we necessarily have to look at the 

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:34.090
 surroundings because there are species that 

00:07:31.569 --> 00:07:36.849
 appear only in some habitats there 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.229
 these species that are growing in 

00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:39.789
 very wet places 

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:42.009
 even in places of flood or 

00:07:39.789 --> 00:07:45.219
 health bears and there are other species 

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:49.080
 in drained places or very dry places 

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:51.990
 the integration of all this information 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:56.009
 will help us gradually to go 

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:56.009
 identifying companies
