 I 'll show you the mail circle now. 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:21.730
 It looks so cool. It's a skill that tells you how your liner is used in the game. 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.730
 See hageteupnida 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:29.899

 That the number of people that use marine use by default Kraft 4 star gay 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.010
 It's a bed. 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.750
 So what's different and how it's used 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:48.979
 First, let me start by giving you an explanation. This q skill 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:51.320
 You may have direct damage to your opponent, but all 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:55.519
 This damage the character 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:59.960
 'M going to that red itjyo the two people could result in damage to both the line into 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:01.309
 No limitation of the number's all coming slip is converted teeth damages given 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.910
 I'll try it. 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:11.450
 If you see color, you knock it back and knock it back. 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:14.479
 You have to send it back to the opponent's back, but pay a little bit and push it to the dreamlike 4 wall 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.800
 There's a boat on the roller that rests. 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:23.210
 Well mothaedo wooreonal I know a little about the underlying technology side walls grateful edaga 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:27.229
 I could not go when giving in this way to my application or I flee 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:32.240
 If you have Arthur c here, you can run q 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:36.799
 There is a lte foot 2q that can be used to run away like that 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:42.649
 The important thing is that this technique will be introduced at any time and you can criticize the other party 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:46.520
 There haejumyeon rather flee median warm bath no restrictions 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:51.799
 Absolutely, but it's my skill . 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.500
 Skill 4 4 w this'm gonna spy plane that's what geonya fun 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.439
 My attack speed and attack power 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.159
 To give an increase to a whopping 20% 8 seconds 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:06.859
 For our heroic gnome minions, 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:10.850
 It's not as much of an effect as I am, but it's only 50% 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.720
 I'll show you that ability. He'll get a mail-mode buff. 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.950
 I see. 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.019
 This looks a little buff isnt in the fight against minions minions behind us 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.320
 I can easily beat the line . 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.690
 So, on the other's turret, 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.660
 4 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.800
 Oh chapter's ability to quickly pull together so Taemin came down the line light tank 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.450
 The media wants a minion 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.710
 Given this number, the line can be pushed very quickly and relatively quickly 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.660
 There is 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.350
 Really 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.700
 Now let 's show this skill to keep this gay 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.460
 It must be a lot. 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:53.400
 I'll show you the physical control of 30%'m a doedeoni 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:57.020
 I immediately fill my stamina. If you get less than 30% now, 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:00.770
 Adrenaline Rush takes care of books quickly 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:06.380
 Such a Raynor ending that does not have any escapes 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:11.450
 This skill is almost alive when I want to catch it. 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:14.570
 Since this is a very good character, 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:18.620
 Police recommended because when using passive Coloring 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:21.770
 So if you want to be dangerous then you can use q to blow another 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.850
 I showed you this once. 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:28.790
 4 I showed you a very powerful attack power. 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.970
 So now when the ball became party system're cool 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:36.800
 What is it, 9 is Hyperion. 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:40.250
 It's a Battle Cruiser, and this Hyperion is in StarCraft. 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.450
 It's in the gym riding walking to the main honey-class nature hath'd know it 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.500
 I believe 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:50.750
 It's been a long shot. 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:54.200
 10 devastation to the ball 12 seconds in a closed vow comforting 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:58.280
 Fly forward to make my damage 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:02.300
 What I can say is that you are a little bit 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:06.380
 When randomly against an enemy you can not set a target georaseo 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:11.810
 So I have a disadvantage, so I 'll show you a funny way. 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:15.590
 For example, I have to go away this is our headquarters is here that the two 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.130
 The name sniper is coming along with the idea that the concept was postponed to 0 0 0 rather 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.730

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.970
 It's coming along right about then I doengeop towards the palace in this Article 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:28.370
 Self articles also just go away when the cube 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:33.710
 I'll kill you. If you want to kill me, let's go. Fight. 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:37.610
 This is a technique that can be used at any given time. 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:42.080
 4 When you use this product to predict the designation to escape from your opponent 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:44.840
 Even support the four quarters is very important indeed good technical 4 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.720
 So let me show you one more time. 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:52.120
 It's last . 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:55.010

 I'm of two concealed Banshee digest 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:05.510
 If you do this, you will not see your opponent. 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.950
 And the second time I took an attack 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:12.770
 Liyuan 2 will cease to continue putting reliable danijyo once took 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.950
 I'll follow you. 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.710
 I'm going to go. I'll give it to you. 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:24.080
 I do not have the stamina . 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:25.580
 4 But try to do this through a fun and bensi achieve level 20 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.330
 If you do. 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:34.490
 Hey , three times as much as the seed, we have chosen to attack the end. 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:36.169
 Yigoyo look interesting part is that you'll know which party in the u Home tab 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:41.020

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.949
 So what are you talking about? 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:59.670
 Yes, why do not you go through the bansy to the end of your opponent in this way , 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:04.020
 I can do it, and the snake's attack power is fine. 10 minutes 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.920
 5 I can not do this. This looks like a hump. 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:10.890
 I gave it to you. 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:15.290
