00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.300
 football helmets protect 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.790
 the skull and help the players 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.370
 make touchdowns without ending up they sounded 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.470
 helmets are part of the sport from 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.300
 more than a century ago they were made 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.480
 of leather then went to the plastic 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.429
 padded in 1950 and have turned out to be 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:24.699
 Super shock absorbers for the 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:26.949
 skull in a sport where they abound 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.460
 the blows the helmet is an element 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.320
 essential to make them are introduced 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.090
 plastic pellets in a machine that 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.090
 melts them and gives them a helmet shape 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.040
 this first device shapes the 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.660
 interior of the housing that takes only 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.660
 a few seconds to harden 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.769
 a robot picks it up and takes it to a 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.769
 conveyor 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.090
 it's a good come back 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.050
 the housings are placed for a 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.500
 cut out the excess plastic 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.500
 of the molding 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.610
 then a robot makes up to nine 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.410
 holes in the housing the holes are 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.370
 will use to install a liner a 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:27.230
 Facial protector and various accessories 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.450
 this robot works much faster than 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.780
 a human being and does all the drilling 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.850
 in just 30 seconds it is programmed to 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.650
 act with great precision and makes a 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.010
 impeccable work with precision 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.200
 computing 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.680
 the robot retires waiting for another 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.680
 Case 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.990
 an operator picks up the casing and 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.380
 drilled and put another in position to 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.380
 the robot 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.140
 on the outside of the helmet with a 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.630
 circular polisher 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.930
 this prepares him for the primer and the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.930
 painting 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.920
 the housings spin while being sprayed 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.530
 with paint is great car paint 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.690
 quality apply three layers because the 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.890
 paint must have enough 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.890
 resistance to withstand the blows 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.680
 helmets are air dried for a few 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.870
 18 hours and a reaction occurs 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.140
 chemical that hardens the paint and 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.600
 Brightens it does not paint all the 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.000
 helmets sometimes the teams prefer the 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:42.500
 plastic dyed everything depends on the 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.300
 image that the team seeks, add the 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.210
 labels that carry the details of 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.520
 warning 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.550
 the emblem of the brand 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.620
 and the production date 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.900
 the padding is made of vinyl and 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.300
 foam they place it on top 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.910
 of the helmet 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.470
 the padding on the side and the back is 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.660
 of the same material 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.260
 Reinforce in the back with a 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.260
 piece of plastic 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.349
 a helmet of each consignment is subjected to a 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.640
 shock - proof helmet has been 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.819
 on a head-shaped support 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.760
 adopted from sensors the technician calibrates 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:24.670
 the sensors using a computer 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.400
 press a button and the stand with the helmet 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.829
 falls this reproduces the head of a 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.840
 player hitting the ground on the 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.260
 computer measures the force of the blow in the 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.030
 test head 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.380
 two 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.390
 when the helmets get the seen 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.520
 good they attach the protective face 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.770
 It is made of steel coated with 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.060
 plastic and has been made to measure in another 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.920
 factory there are many models of 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.560
 Facial protectors for the player 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.960
 can choose the helmet already has a 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.180
 fierce appearance but is not ready yet 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.240
 for the action he needs the chin strap and 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.830
 the tape this machine employs heat to 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.280
 apply an emblem to the ribbons of 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.940
 polyester also cuts them to the 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.940
 adequate length 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.360
 once a protector is sewn to the tape 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:25.090
 fastens on the whole to the helmet 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.360
 then each player will adjust it to his 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.360
 measure 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.280
 the helmet is almost ready for 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.500
 game passes a final exam and what 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.490
 wrapped with the manual and the 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.490
 Instructions for use 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.080
 it has taken less than a day to do 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.180
 This helmet is ready to hold 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.010
 thousands of blows because in football 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.110
 American protection against 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:59.330
 injury is done with a lot of head
