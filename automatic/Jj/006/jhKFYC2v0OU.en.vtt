00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
order for the fill valve to run there's

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.230 
order for the fill valve to run there's
only<00:00:16.920> two<00:00:17.300> places<00:00:18.300> where<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.670> water<00:00:20.670> can<00:00:21.000> go

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
only two places where the water can go

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.390 
only two places where the water can go
into<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.990> bowl<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.830> that's<00:00:22.949> through<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
into the bowl and that's through the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.230 
into the bowl and that's through the
stand<00:00:23.760> pipe<00:00:23.970> or<00:00:24.840> through<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.470> flapper<00:00:25.890> and

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
stand pipe or through the flapper and

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.849 
stand pipe or through the flapper and
the<00:00:27.240> water<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.720> probably<00:00:28.050> knit<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.500> have

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
the water is probably knit you have

the water is probably knit you have
lower<00:00:29.130> than<00:00:29.460> what<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.609> should<00:00:29.910> be<00:00:29.939> on<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.800> in

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
lower than what it should be on this in

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.299 
lower than what it should be on this in
this<00:00:32.070> tank<00:00:32.480> so<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:34.010> know<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> flapper

somewhere<00:01:05.840> as<00:01:06.840> far<00:01:07.049> as<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.350> height<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
somewhere as far as the height of the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.700 
somewhere as far as the height of the
water<00:01:08.280> goes<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.030> come<00:01:09.960> back<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.170> little<00:01:10.409> while

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
water goes and come back a little while

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.920 
water goes and come back a little while
see<00:01:11.220> if<00:01:11.250> it's<00:01:11.460> dropped<00:01:11.790> if<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:12.630> dropped

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
there's a problem with the flapper more

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.520 
there's a problem with the flapper more
like<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> flapper<00:01:18.600> if<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.080> water<00:01:19.259> has<00:01:19.500> to

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
like the flapper if the water has to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.260 
like the flapper if the water has to
come<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.070> height<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:21.770> am<00:01:22.770> just<00:01:23.430> going

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
come to this height so I am just going

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.000 
come to this height so I am just going
to<00:01:24.360> change<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.780> flat<00:01:25.140> rate

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
to change this flat rate

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:39.750 
to change this flat rate
the<00:01:28.010> water<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:37.640> this<00:01:37.970> one<00:01:38.210> has<00:01:38.390> a<00:01:38.420> plastic<00:01:39.110> a

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
the water and this one has a plastic a

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
the water and this one has a plastic a
plastic<00:01:41.500> chain<00:01:42.500> on<00:01:42.770> it<00:01:43.240> over<00:01:44.240> time<00:01:44.510> what

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
plastic chain on it over time what

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.740 
plastic chain on it over time what
happens<00:01:45.200> with<00:01:45.380> these<00:01:45.650> two<00:01:45.950> is<00:01:46.510> the<00:01:47.510> little

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
happens with these two is the little

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.580 
happens with these two is the little
breakdown<00:01:47.990> here<00:01:49.960> this<00:01:50.960> one<00:01:51.140> here<00:01:51.260> isn't<00:01:51.500> that

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
breakdown here this one here isn't that

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.580 
breakdown here this one here isn't that
bad<00:01:52.040> but<00:01:52.480> depending<00:01:53.480> on<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.690> water<00:01:53.900> they<00:01:54.410> will

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
bad but depending on the water they will

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.520 
bad but depending on the water they will
break<00:01:54.950> so<00:01:55.400> I<00:01:56.440> have<00:01:57.440> this<00:01:57.680> one<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:59.320> the<00:02:00.320> two

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
break so I have this one and the two

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.320 
break so I have this one and the two
arms<00:02:00.830> that<00:02:00.980> come<00:02:01.250> out<00:02:01.370> on<00:02:01.730> the<00:02:02.530> standpipe<00:02:04.330> just

that<00:02:42.709> for<00:02:42.860> numerous<00:02:43.340> times<00:02:43.640> could<00:02:44.480> flip<00:02:44.750> up

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
that for numerous times could flip up

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.460 
that for numerous times could flip up
and<00:02:45.380> actually<00:02:46.250> hook<00:02:46.400> on<00:02:46.610> there<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:48.050> therefore

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
and actually hook on there and therefore

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.110 
and actually hook on there and therefore
the<00:02:48.590> flapper<00:02:48.890> wouldn't<00:02:49.310> go<00:02:49.370> down<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.910> your

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
the flapper wouldn't go down and your

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.690 
the flapper wouldn't go down and your
water<00:02:50.330> would<00:02:50.600> burn<00:02:50.810> constantly<00:02:51.700> something

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
water would burn constantly something

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.920 
water would burn constantly something
else<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:54.320> check<00:02:54.620> as<00:02:54.830> well<00:02:55.070> I<00:02:55.870> shouldn't<00:02:56.870> say

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
else to to check as well I shouldn't say

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.420 
else to to check as well I shouldn't say
check<00:02:57.410> but<00:02:57.680> if<00:02:57.770> you've<00:02:57.920> come<00:02:58.130> across<00:02:58.250> a

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
check but if you've come across a

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.979 
check but if you've come across a
situation<00:02:59.170> where<00:03:01.239> you<00:03:02.239> had<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.660> hold<00:03:02.840> the

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
situation where you had to hold the

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.380 
situation where you had to hold the
handle<00:03:03.440> for<00:03:04.040> example<00:03:04.540> in<00:03:05.540> order<00:03:05.780> for<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:07.390> for

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
handle for example in order for the for

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.050 
handle for example in order for the for
the<00:03:08.510> toilet<00:03:08.959> to<00:03:09.200> flush<00:03:10.070> all<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.610> board<00:03:10.850> of<00:03:10.970> the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
the toilet to flush all the board of the

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.330 
the toilet to flush all the board of the
toilet<00:03:11.450> or<00:03:11.630> to<00:03:11.720> get<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:11.870> proper<00:03:12.260> flush<00:03:12.560> the

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
toilet or to get a proper flush the

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.390 
toilet or to get a proper flush the
problem<00:03:13.820> is<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.120> chain<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:15.140> you<00:03:15.200> just<00:03:16.160> have

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
problem is the chain and you just have

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.090 
problem is the chain and you just have
to<00:03:16.480> shorten<00:03:17.480> up<00:03:17.540> your<00:03:17.600> chain<00:03:18.020> just<00:03:18.530> a<00:03:18.709> link<00:03:18.950> or

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
to shorten up your chain just a link or

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.860 
to shorten up your chain just a link or
two<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:20.180> reason<00:03:20.540> I<00:03:20.630> removed<00:03:21.020> this<00:03:21.320> and<00:03:22.040> that's

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
two the reason I removed this and that's

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.340 
two the reason I removed this and that's
easier<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:23.900> because<00:03:24.560> it's<00:03:24.739> just<00:03:25.010> a<00:03:25.130> matter<00:03:25.160> of

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
easier to because it's just a matter of

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:37.140 
easier to because it's just a matter of
opening<00:03:27.350> up<00:03:27.830> the

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:50.220 

let's<00:03:38.150> all<00:03:40.060> just<00:03:41.060> reattach<00:03:41.360> it<00:03:41.810> right<00:03:42.020> quick

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.790 

that'll<00:03:51.230> do<00:03:51.380> it

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
that'll do it

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.250 
that'll do it
there<00:03:52.790> we<00:03:52.880> go<00:03:53.000> just<00:03:53.030> a<00:03:53.390> little<00:03:53.420> slack<00:03:53.930> there

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
there we go just a little slack there

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.820 
there we go just a little slack there
that's<00:03:54.680> what<00:03:54.860> you're<00:03:55.010> after<00:03:56.680> we're<00:03:57.680> just

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
that's what you're after we're just

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:07.660 
that's what you're after we're just
gonna<00:03:57.980> crimp<00:03:58.280> these<00:03:58.460> in<00:04:03.910> here<00:04:06.250> this<00:04:07.250> one<00:04:07.490> is

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
gonna crimp these in here this one is

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.220 
gonna crimp these in here this one is
the<00:04:07.820> most<00:04:07.940> important<00:04:08.570> to<00:04:08.720> make<00:04:08.870> sure<00:04:08.900> that

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
the most important to make sure that

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.550 
the most important to make sure that
it's<00:04:09.380> in<00:04:09.560> there<00:04:09.830> nice<00:04:10.220> and<00:04:10.250> tight<00:04:10.490> so<00:04:14.560> we're

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
it's in there nice and tight so we're

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.270 
it's in there nice and tight so we're
going<00:04:15.740> to<00:04:16.750> turn<00:04:17.750> on<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:17.989> water<00:04:18.260> let's<00:04:19.070> see

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
going to turn on the water let's see

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:29.930 
going to turn on the water let's see
what<00:04:19.430> we<00:04:19.580> have

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.080 

I<00:04:30.380> have<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.590> adjust<00:04:31.650> any<00:04:32.250> water<00:04:32.520> in<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:32.910> height

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
I have to adjust any water in the height

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.070 
I have to adjust any water in the height
for<00:04:33.300> this<00:04:33.980> sole<00:04:35.120> and<00:04:36.120> this<00:04:36.330> is<00:04:36.540> a<00:04:36.570> pretty

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
for this sole and this is a pretty

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.130 
for this sole and this is a pretty
simple<00:04:37.650> thing<00:04:38.400> to<00:04:39.060> do<00:04:39.240> it's<00:04:39.900> a<00:04:40.020> little

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
simple thing to do it's a little

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.110 
simple thing to do it's a little
adjustment<00:04:40.800> here<00:04:40.860> it's<00:04:41.250> got<00:04:41.490> a<00:04:41.520> piece<00:04:41.940> of

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
adjustment here it's got a piece of

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.480 
adjustment here it's got a piece of
spring<00:04:42.420> steel<00:04:42.600> in<00:04:43.050> it<00:04:43.170> and<00:04:43.440> it's<00:04:44.190> just<00:04:44.400> a

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
spring steel in it and it's just a

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.020 
spring steel in it and it's just a
matter<00:04:44.700> of<00:04:44.820> sliding<00:04:45.780> it<00:04:46.050> up<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.410> down<00:04:46.590> this

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
matter of sliding it up and down this

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.270 
matter of sliding it up and down this
this<00:04:48.030> guide<00:04:48.330> is<00:04:49.020> that<00:04:49.200> just<00:04:49.440> allowed<00:04:49.680> to<00:04:49.920> float

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
this guide is that just allowed to float

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.730 
this guide is that just allowed to float
to<00:04:50.310> rise<00:04:50.760> up<00:04:51.060> and<00:04:51.450> down<00:04:51.630> a<00:04:51.930> lot<00:04:52.200> of<00:04:52.380> water<00:04:52.560> to

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
to rise up and down a lot of water to

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.430 
to rise up and down a lot of water to
come<00:04:52.860> in<00:04:53.010> and<00:04:53.700> shut<00:04:53.970> off<00:04:56.750> and<00:04:57.750> just<00:04:57.960> let<00:04:58.140> it<00:04:58.200> go

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
come in and shut off and just let it go

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:09.809 
come in and shut off and just let it go
forward<00:04:58.920> is<00:04:59.760> set<00:05:00.120> up

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:09.819 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.059 

I've<00:05:10.819> been<00:05:10.999> getting<00:05:11.299> more<00:05:11.539> done<00:05:12.069> there's

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:13.069 
I've been getting more done there's

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:15.849 
I've been getting more done there's
gonna<00:05:13.279> dial<00:05:13.579> it<00:05:13.789> down<00:05:14.229> just<00:05:15.229> take<00:05:15.469> that<00:05:15.709> give

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:15.859 
gonna dial it down just take that give

00:05:15.859 --> 00:05:30.399 
gonna dial it down just take that give
it<00:05:15.949> a<00:05:15.979> simple<00:05:16.339> turn<00:05:16.519> like<00:05:28.899> say<00:05:29.899> just<00:05:30.199> made<00:05:30.379> a

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
it a simple turn like say just made a

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:31.869 
it a simple turn like say just made a
small<00:05:30.769> adjustment<00:05:30.949> just<00:05:31.519> a<00:05:31.639> matter<00:05:31.789> of

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:31.879 
small adjustment just a matter of

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:35.289 
small adjustment just a matter of
squeezing<00:05:32.539> this<00:05:32.719> together<00:05:33.169> and<00:05:34.299> that'll

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:35.299 
squeezing this together and that'll

00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:37.689 
squeezing this together and that'll
adjust<00:05:35.599> your<00:05:35.779> float<00:05:36.049> right<00:05:37.039> now<00:05:37.249> we'll<00:05:37.549> go<00:05:37.669> to

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
adjust your float right now we'll go to

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.759 
adjust your float right now we'll go to
3/8<00:05:38.569> of<00:05:38.749> an<00:05:38.899> inch<00:05:38.989> or<00:05:39.199> so<00:05:39.379> below<00:05:39.409> that

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:39.769 
3/8 of an inch or so below that

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:42.399 
3/8 of an inch or so below that
standpipe<00:05:40.549> below<00:05:41.029> the<00:05:41.149> top<00:05:41.360> that's<00:05:41.599> exactly

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:42.409 
standpipe below the top that's exactly

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.709 
standpipe below the top that's exactly
where<00:05:42.559> you<00:05:42.619> should<00:05:42.799> be<00:05:42.979> your<00:05:43.789> refill<00:05:44.209> tube<00:05:44.479> if

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:44.719 
where you should be your refill tube if

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:47.019 
where you should be your refill tube if
you<00:05:44.929> check<00:05:45.259> in<00:05:45.679> your<00:05:45.889> tank<00:05:46.159> your<00:05:46.399> refill<00:05:46.759> tube

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:47.029 
you check in your tank your refill tube

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:49.119 
you check in your tank your refill tube
should<00:05:47.389> be<00:05:47.449> down<00:05:47.809> in<00:05:48.079> the<00:05:48.139> stand<00:05:48.559> pipe<00:05:48.769> itself

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:49.129 
should be down in the stand pipe itself

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:51.249 
should be down in the stand pipe itself
