made from ABS plastic material which we

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.740 
made from ABS plastic material which we
had<00:01:02.980> already<00:01:03.190> in<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.670> past<00:01:03.940> as<00:01:04.239> a<00:01:04.269> very<00:01:04.540> good

and some very important issues one is

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.680 
and some very important issues one is
this<00:01:13.410> bell<00:01:14.410> section<00:01:15.280> usually<00:01:16.210> a<00:01:16.240> clarinet

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690

Bell has a metal ring and our bullheaded

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.950 
Bell has a metal ring and our bullheaded
as<00:01:22.300> well<00:01:22.540> but<00:01:23.370> we<00:01:24.370> try<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.670> to<00:01:25.600> make<00:01:25.780> this

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
as well but we try to to make this

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.650 
as well but we try to to make this
instrument<00:01:26.230> better<00:01:27.070> playable<00:01:27.550> and<00:01:27.760> yeah

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
instrument better playable and yeah

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
better playable for a student before

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.960 
better playable for a student before
especially<00:01:31.360> for<00:01:31.510> children<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:33.220> need<00:01:33.370> to<00:01:33.490> know

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
especially for children you need to know

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.210 
especially for children you need to know
that<00:01:34.180> a<00:01:34.240> clarinet<00:01:34.780> normally<00:01:35.350> lies<00:01:35.800> on<00:01:36.100> your

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
that a clarinet normally lies on your

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.090 
that a clarinet normally lies on your
read/write<00:01:37.000> thumb<00:01:37.270> if<00:01:37.870> you<00:01:38.200> have<00:01:38.770> it<00:01:38.860> here

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
read/write thumb if you have it here

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.940 
read/write thumb if you have it here
this<00:01:39.400> way<00:01:39.670> and<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:41.140> gives<00:01:41.650> a<00:01:41.740> lot<00:01:41.890> of

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
this way and that gives a lot of

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.310 
this way and that gives a lot of
pressure<00:01:42.340> and<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:43.000> weight<00:01:43.210> on<00:01:43.479> your<00:01:44.260> right

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
pressure and and weight on your right

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.130 
pressure and and weight on your right
thumb<00:01:44.740> so<00:01:45.490> you<00:01:45.580> can<00:01:45.850> easily<00:01:46.120> imagine<00:01:46.690> that

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
thumb so you can easily imagine that

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.070 
thumb so you can easily imagine that
when<00:01:47.710> this<00:01:48.370> barrel<00:01:48.729> is<00:01:48.940> especially<00:01:49.300> heavy<00:01:49.690> it

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
when this barrel is especially heavy it

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.190 
when this barrel is especially heavy it
it<00:01:50.890> presses<00:01:51.490> your<00:01:51.640> thumb<00:01:52.030> down<00:01:52.300> and<00:01:52.690> and<00:01:53.020> it's

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
it presses your thumb down and and it's

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.070 
it presses your thumb down and and it's
really<00:01:53.710> a<00:01:54.430> tension<00:01:55.180> here<00:01:55.330> in<00:01:55.540> your<00:01:55.720> hand<00:01:55.900> you

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
really a tension here in your hand you

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.160 
really a tension here in your hand you
cannot<00:01:56.290> really<00:01:56.530> play<00:01:56.890> well<00:01:57.130> so<00:01:57.909> we<00:01:58.630> remove<00:01:58.990> the

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
cannot really play well so we remove the

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.860 
cannot really play well so we remove the
metal<00:01:59.350> ring<00:01:59.680> and<00:01:59.909> redesign<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:00.940> Bell<00:02:01.330> shape

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
metal ring and redesign the Bell shape

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.380 
metal ring and redesign the Bell shape
in<00:02:02.200> order<00:02:03.040> to<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.640> keep<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.000> good<00:02:04.150> sound

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
in order to to keep the good sound

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.510 
in order to to keep the good sound
qualities<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:06.460> remove<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.090> weight

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.550 

the<00:02:10.520> big<00:02:10.670> improvement<00:02:11.210> is<00:02:11.360> that<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:11.870> is<00:02:12.020> not<00:02:12.320> as

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
the big improvement is that it is not as

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.010 
the big improvement is that it is not as
heavy<00:02:12.800> as<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.040> used<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.370> be<00:02:13.490> yes<00:02:14.240> not<00:02:14.600> as<00:02:14.750> heavy

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
heavy as it used to be yes not as heavy

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.700 
heavy as it used to be yes not as heavy
and<00:02:15.350> better<00:02:15.710> balanced<00:02:16.310> on<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:17.450> point<00:02:18.440> where

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
and better balanced on the point where

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.700 
and better balanced on the point where
you<00:02:18.860> hold<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.490> whole<00:02:19.640> weight<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.530> other

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
you hold the whole weight and the other

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.540 
you hold the whole weight and the other
thing<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.490> we<00:02:23.150> improve<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.810> thumb<00:02:24.260> rest

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
thing is that we improve the thumb rest

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.980 
thing is that we improve the thumb rest
which<00:02:25.550> is<00:02:26.650> adjustable<00:02:27.650> now<00:02:27.920> in<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:29.030> very<00:02:29.240> long

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
which is adjustable now in a very long

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.030 
which is adjustable now in a very long
distance<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.940> plate<00:02:32.240> is<00:02:32.480> thicker<00:02:33.320> which

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
distance and the plate is thicker which

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.220 
distance and the plate is thicker which
is<00:02:34.250> much<00:02:34.580> more<00:02:34.760> comfortable<00:02:35.030> for<00:02:35.360> your<00:02:35.930> thumb

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
is much more comfortable for your thumb

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.680 
is much more comfortable for your thumb
and<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:37.160> whole<00:02:37.340> thing<00:02:37.580> is<00:02:37.610> more<00:02:37.940> stable<00:02:38.450> than

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
and the whole thing is more stable than

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.200 
and the whole thing is more stable than
any<00:02:39.170> of<00:02:39.590> our<00:02:39.770> thumb<00:02:40.040> rests<00:02:40.280> we<00:02:40.400> had<00:02:40.790> before

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
any of our thumb rests we had before

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.030 
any of our thumb rests we had before
because<00:02:41.390> you<00:02:41.690> had<00:02:41.810> some<00:02:41.990> trouble<00:02:42.230> that<00:02:42.860> they

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
because you had some trouble that they

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.730 
because you had some trouble that they
sometimes<00:02:43.520> break<00:02:44.000> but<00:02:44.720> this<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:45.050> very<00:02:45.590> much

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
sometimes break but this is very much

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.010 
sometimes break but this is very much
more<00:02:46.010> stable<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.700> more<00:02:47.000> practical<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.780> it

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
more stable and more practical and it

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.350 
more stable and more practical and it
has<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.200> ring<00:02:48.500> that<00:02:48.950> you<00:02:49.040> can<00:02:49.070> even<00:02:49.700> use<00:02:49.940> a<00:02:49.970> sling

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
has a ring that you can even use a sling

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.860 
has a ring that you can even use a sling
to<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:51.410> hold<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.770> clarinet<00:02:52.160> which<00:02:52.670> again<00:02:53.570> is

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
to to hold the clarinet which again is

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.110 
to to hold the clarinet which again is
better<00:02:54.260> for<00:02:55.010> father's<00:02:55.520> pressure<00:02:55.790> on<00:02:56.030> the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
right hand is there a difference to the

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
instance is exactly the same but

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.700 
instance is exactly the same but
silver-plated<00:03:27.220> and

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.340 

the<00:03:32.710> third<00:03:32.980> one<00:03:33.190> here<00:03:33.370> has<00:03:34.180> one<00:03:34.510> extra<00:03:34.750> key

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
the third one here has one extra key

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.150 
the third one here has one extra key
here<00:03:35.860> which<00:03:36.670> is<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.180> so-called<00:03:37.570> left<00:03:38.170> a<00:03:38.530> flat

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
here which is the so-called left a flat

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.960 
here which is the so-called left a flat
key<00:03:39.460> for<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.090> left<00:03:40.270> little<00:03:40.720> finger<00:03:41.910> that<00:03:42.910> is

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
key for the left little finger that is

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.690 
key for the left little finger that is
also<00:03:43.240> in<00:03:43.600> some<00:03:43.780> regions<00:03:44.380> of<00:03:44.530> Europe<00:03:44.920> that<00:03:45.580> is

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
also in some regions of Europe that is

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.780 
also in some regions of Europe that is
very<00:03:45.880> well<00:03:46.830> accepted<00:03:47.830> and<00:03:47.980> so<00:03:48.430> they<00:03:48.610> are

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
very well accepted and so they are

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.650 
very well accepted and so they are
requesting<00:03:49.480> their<00:03:49.860> okay<00:03:50.860> so<00:03:51.670> I<00:03:51.970> think<00:03:52.330> that's

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
requesting their okay so I think that's

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.760 
requesting their okay so I think that's
it<00:03:52.840> isn't<00:03:53.320> it

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
it isn't it

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.460 
it isn't it
I<00:03:53.800> think<00:03:54.730> so<00:03:54.850> then<00:03:55.180> I<00:03:55.390> would<00:03:55.540> say<00:03:55.720> so<00:03:55.780> far<00:03:56.080> from

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
I think so then I would say so far from

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.760 
I think so then I would say so far from
here<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:56.920> we<00:03:57.400> see<00:03:57.550> us<00:03:57.670> again
