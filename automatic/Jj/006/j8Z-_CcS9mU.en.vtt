their effects on them are not
statistically<00:01:10.950> significant<00:01:12.020> meaning<00:01:13.020> is

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
statistically significant meaning is

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.859 
statistically significant meaning is
pretty<00:01:13.439> close<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.830> water<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.750> a

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
pretty close to water so it's a

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.749 
pretty close to water so it's a
non-issue<00:01:16.049> there<00:01:16.470> now<00:01:16.650> with<00:01:16.920> splenda<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.580> do

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
non-issue there now with splenda you do

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.300 
non-issue there now with splenda you do
gotta<00:01:18.000> count<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.600> maltodextrin<00:01:18.990> up<00:01:19.590> that

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
gotta count that maltodextrin up that

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.010 
gotta count that maltodextrin up that
filler<00:01:20.580> they<00:01:20.820> use<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> mottled<00:01:21.420> extra<00:01:21.780> might

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
filler they use a mottled extra might

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.420 
filler they use a mottled extra might
have<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> response<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:22.950> you'll<00:01:23.070> need<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.250> go

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
have a response but you'll need to go

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.280 
have a response but you'll need to go
research<00:01:23.820> with<00:01:24.180> those<00:01:24.330> fillers<00:01:24.600> how<00:01:25.020> many

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
research with those fillers how many

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.370 
research with those fillers how many
lets<00:01:25.740> they<00:01:26.340> contribute<00:01:26.820> towards<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:28.080> even

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
lets they contribute towards it but even

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.899 
lets they contribute towards it but even
then<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:28.680> not<00:01:28.740> going<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.040> be<00:01:29.130> very<00:01:29.159> big<00:01:29.579> even

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
then it's not going to be very big even

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.700 
then it's not going to be very big even
for<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.090> diabetic<00:01:30.479> unless<00:01:30.930> you're<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.590> know

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
for a diabetic unless you're you know

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.969 
for a diabetic unless you're you know

two<00:01:35.100> packs<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.490> Splenda<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.210> shouldn't<00:01:36.840> make<00:01:37.020> a

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
two packs of Splenda it shouldn't make a

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.780 
two packs of Splenda it shouldn't make a
significant<00:01:37.890> difference<00:01:38.009> even<00:01:38.430> with<00:01:38.670> that

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
significant difference even with that

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.460 
significant difference even with that
multi<00:01:39.150> bextrum<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:39.750> you'll<00:01:39.869> need<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.049> go<00:01:40.229> look

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
multi bextrum but you'll need to go look

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.780 
multi bextrum but you'll need to go look
at<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.680> content<00:01:41.130> figure<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.490> out<00:01:41.640> for

at the content figure it out for

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.870 
at the content figure it out for
yourself<00:01:43.250> but<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.340> far<00:01:44.490> as<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.729> actual

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
yourself but as far as the actual

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.749 
yourself but as far as the actual
sweeteners<00:01:45.570> themselves<00:01:46.380> they<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.009> not<00:01:47.430> seem

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
sweeteners themselves they do not seem

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.749 
sweeteners themselves they do not seem
to<00:01:47.939> have<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> measurable<00:01:48.630> effect<00:01:49.579> alright<00:01:50.579> next

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
to have a measurable effect alright next

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.170 
to have a measurable effect alright next
question<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.560> there<00:01:52.560> any<00:01:52.799> science<00:01:53.460> behind<00:01:53.700> all

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
question is there any science behind all

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.090 
question is there any science behind all
this<00:01:54.450> anti<00:01:54.869> drain<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.290> gluten-free<00:01:55.560> bullshit
