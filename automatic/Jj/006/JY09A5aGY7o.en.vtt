00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.740
 this disease is an advanced stage in 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.010
 where the virus leaves the body 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.320
 infected with very few defenses being 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.150
 vulnerable to any disease is 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.130
 develops as a consequence of the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.260
 progressive destruction of the system 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.359
 immune of the defenses of the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.020
 organism produced by a virus 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.080
 discovered in 1983 and called virus 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.869
 of human immunodeficiency and 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.289

 severe malnutrition states a 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.040
 important effect of immunity the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.379
 AIDS word comes from the initials 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.300
 of immunodeficiency syndrome 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.070
 acquired that consists of disability 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.899
 of the immune system to do 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.899
 against infections and others 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.899
 pathological processes AIDS is not 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.940
 consequence of a hereditary disorder 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.430
 but the result of exposure to a 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.870
 infection by the bi that facilitates the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.100
 development of new infections 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.320
 Opportunistic tumors and other processes 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.720
 this virus remains dormant and destroys 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.820
 a certain type of lymphocyte cells 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.060
 responsible for the defense of the system 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.909
 immune system consequences 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.479
 symptoms the AIDS virus attacks and 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.400
 destroys a type of white cells 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.009
 leukocytes defensive cells of the 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.830
 organism against the infection these 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.810
 cells called the pertecen activate to 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.420
 turn to other cells that produce 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.490
 antibodies which attack the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.159
 microorganisms that invade the body 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.040
 human being these cells are affected 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.020
 white the defensive capacity of 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.049
 body against infections is 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.970
 seriously prevented the elper te cells 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.890
 they stop having their normal paper and they 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.159
 they turn into factories for the virus 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.820
 of AIDS the virus multiplies in that 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.280
 process these cells are destroying 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.380
 gradually and as they disappear 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.200
 The main defense or immunity of 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.960
 organism is lost this destroys by 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.880
 complete the immune system in a 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.250
 recent article in the magazine 'new 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.670
 york 'presumptuously titled the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.590
 last 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.530
 word as far as avoiding the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.989
 been the author openly declares the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.300
 people do not die of AIDS dies of others 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.569
 diseases against which they can not 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.880
 fight however researchers 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.459
 they know that the AIDS virus can kill 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.890
 directly by seriously affecting the 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.050
 brain without the presence of any 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.959
 opportunistic infection and without destroying the 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.180
 immune system the AIDS virus 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.400
 by itself destroys the cells of the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.310
 brain and causes progressive disease 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.340
 of this encephalopathy by the virus of 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.260
 been the medical reports indicate that the 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.970
 brain disease produced by the 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.890
 AIDS is one of the most 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.290
 important of the infection of this 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.660
 disease there are currently three stages 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.090
 basic things a person goes through 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.910
 that is infected with the virus is first 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.700
 stage there are no symptoms but in the person 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.769
 the virus spreads the individual is 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.980
 infected with the virus but it does not show 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.280
 external symptoms may look good 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.440
 health and stay that way for many years 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.770
 but the absence of external symptoms is 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.320
 deceptive 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:21.340
 the virus gradually infects the eyes 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:24.460
 the brain the lungs the liver the 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.310
 spleen the kidneys and other organs of the 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.680
 people infected people who 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.990
 they have the AIDS virus including 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.440
 those that have no visible symptoms 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:38.470
 they can infect other carriers 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.420
 of AIDS that have no symptoms are 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.520
 putting each person with whom 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.420
 have sex in serious

 second stage risk presided complex 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.090
 related to AIDS aids relatÃ© complex 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.770
 arq the second stage of the infection of 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.390
 AIDS virus occurs when a 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.820
 infected individual begins to 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.770
 manifest the symptoms which 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.730
 may include weight loss 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.890
 unexplained excessive night sweats 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.380
 persistent diarrhea inflammation of 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.840
 lymph glands under the arm and 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.870

 ibarra or disorders if we take without 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.040
 However, it is estimated that the number of 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.680
 people who have presided according to the 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.670
 researchers is ten times greater than 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.790
 the people's 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.910
 in AIDS already in its third final stage 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.800
 final stage of AIDS the others 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.780
 diseases that affect people 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.870
 who are in this stage are called 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.790
 opportunistic infections attack when 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.630
 the destruction of the immune system 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.550
 leaves the body totally vulnerable 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.140
 normally the immune system 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.690
 protects the body against the effects of 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.120
 the infections but-as it is destroyed 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.300
 it decreases the defensive capacity 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.090
 against infections these appear and 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.010
 they spread throughout the body between 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.500
 opportunistic infections more 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.380
 frequent, pneumonia 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.540
 pneumocystis carinii also have a 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.540
 persistent cough that is accompanied by 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.280
 small amounts of white sputum 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.220
 probabilities that those who come to 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.850
 the third stage of AIDS survive are 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.840
 extremely insignificant 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.450
 practically nobody who has been 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.290
 developed the syndrome has lived more 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.290
 five years
