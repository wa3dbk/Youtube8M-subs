 so this morning I'm here for you 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.420
 talk about UFOs this is a subject 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.160
 which interests us in full field of 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.600
 fair for those who do not know UFO 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.910
 it's the initials of non flying objects 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.529
 identified for example the people who 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.060
 arouses from the top of a building are 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.800
 UFOs that's right for a few 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.149
 seconds fly there once without a sidewalk 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.100
 we have trouble identifying them 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.870
 but no, but do not worry 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.040
 is never long on the sidewalk 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.120
 general there are Chinese who come 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.579
 just after the accident for the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.530
 recover to make it buzz china 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.149
 your Chinese drinks in paris explains 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.590
 baba that's because it's really 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.239
 Chinese now they are more than 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.430
 electronic cigarettes or be it 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.510
 must also tc tea cache 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.559
 paris but with little bits of stuff 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.809
 to resist I find a butt a 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.670
 alliance no but really anguished he 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.260
 must then try to come back to 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.670
 UFOs you have to know that in France in 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.019
 a small village near Toulouse and 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.339
 it's not a bullshit there is the only 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.780
 meaning of testimonials to the world for 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.760
 people who think they have seen a UFO 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.750
 so I remember that in a small 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.010
 village in the heart of France 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.869
 I imagine most people we 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.549
 called just saw an Arab in full 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.409
 downtown that must be there 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.939
 do not look like him they are 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.460
 olive oil and ivan the cann and 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.930
 most expensive UFO footprints the most 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.159
 celebrates it remains obviously the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.990
 bogdanoff brothers 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.400
 so we've seen it and it's not even 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.450
 aliens I think that's 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.040
 still something else 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.689
 I think when aliens 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.100
 have landed on earth they will say 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.570
 wait, excuse us we do not have everything 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.340
 understood there you are beings 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.930
 humans ok that's plants that's it 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.079
 animals but both of them what is it 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.079
 exactly 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.439
 I tell you they are not we we do not 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.549
 will not resume when we speak then the 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.630
 aliens this is a subject that I 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.250
 know well then there I have you 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.079
 never necessarily speak but I have a 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.689
 uncle who works at the Moroccan nasa 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.950
 so imagine not one of the guys who 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.450
 idling as in armageddon 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.860
 to save the world a year nasa 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.149
 Moroccan is another delusion 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.759
 guys who were with keys 12 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.370
 they are smoking hounds that have been acquired 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.100
 too much mud 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.420
 and my name is the boss of NASA 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.590
 Moroccan it's my ball that made it 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.000
 more studies than others it's just 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.600
 that he has the most chico 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.550
 on the team 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.440
 that's how you go up in Iraq and 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.060
 Morocco then the aliens is a 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.500
 subject that inspires me months but also the 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.510
 other artists the singers especially 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.400
 katy perry and kanye west at the time 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.480
 had made the song aliens have won 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.010
 imagine not even know if you 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.000
 remember to make love with a 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.440
 extraterrestrial 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.660
 frankly when you look at a picture 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.070
 of kim kardashian without makeup you say 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.510
 that he succeeded in these rumors 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.160
 television also likes to treat the 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.420
 subject with emissions like time x to 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.970
 the time in the 80s with the 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.160
 fit boat he also had x-files 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.480
 with mulder and scully x-files scene under 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.340
 the 7 series that had at least 800 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.470
 different titles 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.920
 x-files at the borders of the real truth 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.540
 is elsewhere 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.550
 and if the screenwriter listens to us takes 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.810
 a brothers decision really made it known 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.510
 the same guy found the title alice 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.250

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.750

 go to the end you call it alice nevers 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.400

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.100

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.880

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.440

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.000
 next day without warning 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.170
 rates it's called coco pops it's 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.209
 asks why young people leave 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.290

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.970

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.320
 to get back to the aliens my 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.860
 favorite movie about them men 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.510

 but I dare not remember what I 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.870
 fell on the record beyond 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.290
 the porn adaptation that traumatized me 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.120
 not long 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.840

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.510
 ichi the extraterrestrial steven 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.750
 spielberg forgiveness which remains a model of 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.370
 kind 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.840
 I watched thousands of times and 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.090
 I am always moved in the end when there is 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.560
 finally returns to his planet by bike 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.330
 you have mentioned it comes back 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.610
 wrap the steering wheel flying bike but 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.590
 even if that they have very badly managed the 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.239
 budget of the film in the beginning they have everything 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.709
 farting you see to manufacture here at 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.510
 the end they had to tell themselves wahou no longer 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.459
 of budget for the spaceship go 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.540
 wonderfully mixed the people are them 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.130
 beautiful hungary is worth believing it's 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.170
 possible but more crazy if there are people 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.760
 who think that it exists 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.810
 my one time I have a friend of mine it's not 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.010
 a bullshit that told me something 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.530
 amazing and it's a true story 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.600
 he watched ichi with his mother and sk him 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.960
 asked at the end of the film but they have 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.800
 used what as animal for ferry that 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.940
 swear it's their story is not very 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.290
 smart to read everyone knows very 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.180
 although it's an actor who was in 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.320
 the costume before you leave me 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.700
 wanted to talk to you about the movie the soup 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.960
 this is important 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.430
 a very old movies with louis de funÃ¨s 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.419
 and jacques son and jacques villeret two 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.010
 huge actors who have us 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.240
 unfortunately left we're just going 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.850
 go back thirty seconds on the story 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.020
 to understand the sivom a french 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.270
 well even if one day we went to see 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.740
 producers to say listen I 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.090
 a great movie idea is history 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.350
 of an extraterrestrial who land on 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.040
 land in a small village with his 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.540
 Flying saucer 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.500
 so far nothing crazy but you go 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.630
 understand how much cinema 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.729
 French is noble with the following of 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.780
 history and meets a peasant and seen 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.580
 they not speak the same language it 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.419
 find a great way to communicate 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.940
 during all the movie 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:07.200
 he fires a village of quests 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.610
 that's what French cinema is 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.710
 the big difference with the united states 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.180
 the scenario it's the scenario that 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.320
 shit in there who was not playing the budget 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.729
 flying saucer but we still 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.430
 worse in France we do not like the budget 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.430
 pen the punchline
