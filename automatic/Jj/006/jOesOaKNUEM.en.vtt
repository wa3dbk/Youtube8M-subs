that and you can see that the text
travels<00:04:01.240> over<00:04:01.630> and<00:04:03.090> what<00:04:04.090> I<00:04:04.120> can<00:04:04.360> do<00:04:04.540> is<00:04:04.810> is<00:04:05.110> I

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
travels over and what I can do is is I

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.620 
travels over and what I can do is is I
could<00:04:05.860> if<00:04:06.220> I<00:04:06.340> wanted<00:04:06.670> to<00:04:06.790> stretch<00:04:07.090> this<00:04:07.330> down

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
could if I wanted to stretch this down

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.920 
could if I wanted to stretch this down
which<00:04:08.410> makes<00:04:08.680> that<00:04:08.860> smaller<00:04:09.310> so<00:04:10.240> then<00:04:10.420> notice

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
which makes that smaller so then notice

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.190 
which makes that smaller so then notice
how<00:04:11.050> they're<00:04:11.230> connected<00:04:12.060> right<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:14.050> is

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
how they're connected right that is

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:21.720 
how they're connected right that is
pretty<00:04:14.500> neat<00:04:18.150> so<00:04:19.150> now<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.780> text<00:04:20.410> flows<00:04:21.340> across

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
pretty neat so now the text flows across

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.840 
pretty neat so now the text flows across
I've<00:04:22.210> got<00:04:22.540> it<00:04:22.690> left<00:04:22.900> justified<00:04:23.530> and<00:04:23.850> before

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
I've got it left justified and before

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.490 
I've got it left justified and before
with<00:04:25.270> earlier<00:04:25.570> versions<00:04:25.630> of<00:04:26.050> flash<00:04:26.260> you

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
with earlier versions of flash you

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.390 
with earlier versions of flash you
couldn't<00:04:26.800> do<00:04:26.950> that

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
couldn't do that

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.850 
couldn't do that
you<00:04:27.790> had<00:04:27.910> to<00:04:28.060> make<00:04:28.270> separate<00:04:28.690> text<00:04:29.080> boxes<00:04:29.530> and

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
you had to make separate text boxes and

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.620 
you had to make separate text boxes and
there<00:04:30.460> was<00:04:30.580> no<00:04:30.730> connecting<00:04:31.240> so<00:04:31.360> that's<00:04:31.540> a

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
there was no connecting so that's a

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.480 
there was no connecting so that's a
really<00:04:31.990> easy<00:04:32.020> way<00:04:32.320> to<00:04:32.440> make<00:04:32.680> your<00:04:32.830> text<00:04:32.890> flow

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
really easy way to make your text flow

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.720 
really easy way to make your text flow
around<00:04:34.210> an<00:04:34.510> image<00:04:34.690> so<00:04:35.590> I<00:04:35.620> like<00:04:36.040> that<00:04:36.070> a<00:04:36.250> lot

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
around an image so I like that a lot

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.090 
around an image so I like that a lot
so<00:04:37.180> now<00:04:37.300> we've<00:04:37.450> got<00:04:37.600> a<00:04:38.350> little<00:04:38.830> something

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
so now we've got a little something

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.480 
so now we've got a little something
about<00:04:39.160> placing<00:04:39.910> some<00:04:40.090> text
