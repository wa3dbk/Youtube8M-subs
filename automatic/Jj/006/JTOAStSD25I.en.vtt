different approaches of management of
this<00:04:04.700> complex<00:04:06.160> problem<00:04:07.160> all<00:04:07.760> these<00:04:08.570> puts

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
this complex problem all these puts

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.740 
this complex problem all these puts
together<00:04:09.170> have<00:04:09.560> shown<00:04:09.950> that<00:04:10.570> progress<00:04:11.570> is

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
together have shown that progress is

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.860 
together have shown that progress is
being<00:04:12.080> made<00:04:12.850> but<00:04:13.850> again<00:04:14.180> you<00:04:14.360> have<00:04:14.510> to<00:04:14.570> think

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
being made but again you have to think

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.070 
being made but again you have to think
about<00:04:15.020> sustainability<00:04:16.510> you<00:04:17.510> make<00:04:17.720> you<00:04:17.930> have

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
about sustainability you make you have

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.400 
about sustainability you make you have
leadership<00:04:18.470> you<00:04:18.920> have<00:04:19.840> ownership<00:04:20.840> you<00:04:21.260> have

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
leadership you have ownership you have

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.430 
leadership you have ownership you have
partnership<00:04:22.220> and<00:04:22.400> collaboration<00:04:22.580> and<00:04:23.440> there

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
partnership and collaboration and there

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.080 
partnership and collaboration and there
is<00:04:24.560> this<00:04:24.980> innovation<00:04:25.520> going<00:04:26.060> on

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
is this innovation going on

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.510 
is this innovation going on
and<00:04:27.389> there<00:04:28.380> is<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.590> use<00:04:28.710> of<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:29.130> tools<00:04:29.400> that

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
and there is the use of the tools that

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.240 
and there is the use of the tools that
is<00:04:29.790> there<00:04:30.090> we<00:04:30.690> think<00:04:30.990> about<00:04:31.290> sustainability

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
is there we think about sustainability

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.600 
is there we think about sustainability
and<00:04:33.169> sustainability<00:04:34.169> has<00:04:34.949> to<00:04:35.250> build<00:04:35.520> on

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
and sustainability has to build on

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.600 
and sustainability has to build on
belief<00:04:38.610> that<00:04:39.510> what<00:04:39.870> is<00:04:40.139> being<00:04:40.410> done<00:04:41.870> can<00:04:42.870> be

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
belief that what is being done can be

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.020 
belief that what is being done can be
continued<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:44.729> be<00:04:44.760> done<00:04:45.060> and<00:04:45.300> morris's<00:04:45.930> can<00:04:46.229> be

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
continued to be done and morris's can be

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.480 
continued to be done and morris's can be
achieved<00:04:48.350> already<00:04:49.350> if<00:04:49.560> you<00:04:49.680> look<00:04:49.830> at<00:04:49.979> what<00:04:50.250> has

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
achieved already if you look at what has

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.879 
achieved already if you look at what has
happened<00:04:50.520> to<00:04:51.000> say<00:04:51.210> in<00:04:51.389> Africa<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:54.090> benefits

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
happened to say in Africa the benefits

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.159 
happened to say in Africa the benefits
from<00:04:55.889> these<00:04:56.130> efforts<00:04:56.699> are<00:04:57.389> beginning<00:04:57.840> through

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
from these efforts are beginning through

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.800 
from these efforts are beginning through
in<00:04:58.380> numbers<00:04:59.250> of<00:04:59.460> people<00:04:59.669> who<00:04:59.940> are<00:05:00.210> benefiting

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
in numbers of people who are benefiting

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.330 
in numbers of people who are benefiting
from<00:05:01.130> treatment<00:05:02.780> about<00:05:03.780> four<00:05:04.680> million<00:05:04.950> people

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
from treatment about four million people

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.170 
from treatment about four million people
under<00:05:06.030> treatment<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:07.130> enjoying<00:05:08.180> stabilized

under treatment and enjoying stabilized
and<00:05:09.510> have<00:05:10.050> continued<00:05:10.620> to<00:05:10.650> be<00:05:10.880> productive<00:05:11.880> as

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
and have continued to be productive as

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.120 
and have continued to be productive as
people<00:05:14.610> who<00:05:14.760> are<00:05:15.000> not<00:05:15.270> affected<00:05:16.260> by<00:05:16.290> the

people who are not affected by the

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.680 
people who are not affected by the
hiv/aids<00:05:17.790> so<00:05:18.360> how<00:05:18.570> think<00:05:19.020> about<00:05:19.669> continued

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
hiv/aids so how think about continued

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.490 
hiv/aids so how think about continued
financing<00:05:21.979> financing<00:05:23.660> alone<00:05:24.660> it<00:05:24.960> is<00:05:25.020> not

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
financing financing alone it is not

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.439 
financing financing alone it is not
enough<00:05:25.800> but<00:05:26.639> it<00:05:26.910> is<00:05:27.120> very<00:05:27.150> key<00:05:27.780> it<00:05:28.380> enables

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
enough but it is very key it enables

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:32.659 
enough but it is very key it enables

development of our countries should not
be<00:06:15.920> underestimated<00:06:16.510> and<00:06:17.510> that's<00:06:18.200> why<00:06:18.470> we<00:06:18.770> must

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
be underestimated and that's why we must

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.670 
be underestimated and that's why we must
not<00:06:19.610> only<00:06:19.790> invest<00:06:20.450> in<00:06:20.720> them<00:06:21.940> but<00:06:22.940> they<00:06:23.060> must

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
not only invest in them but they must

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.380 
not only invest in them but they must
take<00:06:24.680> the<00:06:24.890> center<00:06:25.130> stage<00:06:25.280> in<00:06:25.760> terms<00:06:26.000> of<00:06:26.180> these

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390 
take the center stage in terms of these

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.430 
take the center stage in terms of these
activities<00:06:26.720> because<00:06:27.470> after<00:06:27.860> all<00:06:29.440> isolating

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
activities because after all isolating

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.210 
activities because after all isolating
them<00:06:30.680> I<00:06:31.270> think<00:06:32.270> we<00:06:32.480> simply<00:06:33.290> read<00:06:33.470> it<00:06:33.620> to<00:06:33.800> loss

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.220 
them I think we simply read it to loss

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.250 
them I think we simply read it to loss
of<00:06:34.520> the<00:06:34.850> gains<00:06:35.060> who<00:06:35.300> have<00:06:35.480> made<00:06:35.810> over<00:06:36.230> the

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
of the gains who have made over the

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.570 
of the gains who have made over the
years<00:06:36.410> and<00:06:36.890> is<00:06:37.700> the<00:06:37.820> deprivation<00:06:38.180> of<00:06:38.660> Rights

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
years and is the deprivation of Rights

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.360 
years and is the deprivation of Rights
they<00:06:40.580> are<00:06:40.730> rights<00:06:40.940> but<00:06:41.660> in<00:06:41.810> the<00:06:41.930> end<00:06:42.050> the<00:06:43.010> human

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370 
they are rights but in the end the human

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.510 
they are rights but in the end the human
rights<00:06:43.580> so<00:06:44.570> I<00:06:44.600> want<00:06:44.930> to<00:06:45.230> end<00:06:45.500> on<00:06:45.740> this<00:06:45.890> note<00:06:45.950> and

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
rights so I want to end on this note and

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.330 
rights so I want to end on this note and
thank<00:06:47.330> you<00:06:47.510> all<00:06:47.720> and<00:06:47.960> I<00:06:48.290> hope<00:06:48.320> we<00:06:48.710> can<00:06:48.920> continue

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.340 
thank you all and I hope we can continue

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.590 
thank you all and I hope we can continue
to<00:06:49.730> work<00:06:49.880> together<00:06:50.950> so<00:06:51.950> that<00:06:51.980> we<00:06:52.370> don't<00:06:52.600> put

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:53.600 
to work together so that we don't put

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
to work together so that we don't put
our<00:06:53.810> eyes<00:06:54.050> off<00:06:54.080> what<00:06:54.820> has<00:06:55.820> been<00:06:56.150> gained<00:06:56.620> in

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
our eyes off what has been gained in

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.830 
our eyes off what has been gained in
terms<00:06:57.980> of<00:06:58.190> what<00:06:58.490> we<00:06:58.700> think<00:06:58.730> are<00:06:59.120> competing

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 
terms of what we think are competing

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.080 
terms of what we think are competing
priorities<00:07:00.050> but<00:07:00.620> actually<00:07:01.100> these<00:07:01.790> varieties

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.090 
priorities but actually these varieties

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.210 
priorities but actually these varieties
who<00:07:02.510> know<00:07:02.660> to<00:07:02.720> be<00:07:02.960> competing<00:07:03.590> in<00:07:03.740> terms<00:07:04.010> of

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:04.220 
who know to be competing in terms of

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.000 
who know to be competing in terms of
dividing<00:07:04.820> resources<00:07:05.360> but<00:07:05.660> rather<00:07:06.010> they

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.010 
dividing resources but rather they

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.670 
dividing resources but rather they
should<00:07:07.700> pull<00:07:08.030> resources<00:07:08.300> together<00:07:08.870> so<00:07:09.650> that

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 
should pull resources together so that

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.840 
should pull resources together so that
you<00:07:09.980> continue<00:07:10.340> to<00:07:10.610> move<00:07:10.790> in<00:07:11.750> a<00:07:11.900> holistic<00:07:12.200> sense

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:12.850 
you continue to move in a holistic sense

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.320 
you continue to move in a holistic sense
because<00:07:13.850> hiv/aids<00:07:14.950> does<00:07:15.950> not<00:07:16.280> stand<00:07:16.580> alone<00:07:16.760> it

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:17.330 
because hiv/aids does not stand alone it

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.780 
because hiv/aids does not stand alone it
is<00:07:17.600> complicated<00:07:17.990> or<00:07:18.680> contributed<00:07:19.280> to<00:07:19.550> by

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:19.790 
is complicated or contributed to by

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.540 
is complicated or contributed to by
other<00:07:20.180> factors<00:07:20.570> that<00:07:21.110> you<00:07:21.860> also<00:07:22.310> need<00:07:22.520> to

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:22.550 
other factors that you also need to

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.650 
other factors that you also need to
attend<00:07:23.360> to<00:07:23.480> where<00:07:23.840> it<00:07:23.990> is<00:07:24.020> poverty<00:07:24.620> and<00:07:25.660> other

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:26.660 
attend to where it is poverty and other

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.930 
attend to where it is poverty and other
issues<00:07:26.900> so<00:07:27.560> thank<00:07:27.919> you<00:07:28.070> very<00:07:28.250> much<00:07:28.460> and<00:07:28.760> hope
