00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
Sonic game um actually I think about we

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:45.590 
Sonic game um actually I think about we
didn't<00:01:43.920> see<00:01:44.039> it<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.279> leash<00:01:44.639> we<00:01:44.999> saw<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.450> um

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
didn't see it in leash we saw and um

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.179 
didn't see it in leash we saw and um
secret<00:01:45.959> rings<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.590> dark<00:01:46.889> me<00:01:47.009> nighty

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
secret rings and dark me nighty

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.609 
secret rings and dark me nighty
typically<00:01:47.609> you<00:01:47.729> I've<00:01:48.719> got<00:01:48.929> I<00:01:48.959> got<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.319> guess

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
typically you I've got I got I guess

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.559 
typically you I've got I got I guess
it's<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:50.039> colors<00:01:50.369> did<00:01:50.729> excel<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.179> one<00:01:51.359> thing

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
it's on colors did excel in one thing

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.370 
it's on colors did excel in one thing
though<00:01:51.749> um<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.469> think<00:01:52.979> gets<00:01:54.259> generations<00:01:55.259> i

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
though um I think gets generations i

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.480 
though um I think gets generations i
didn't<00:01:55.560> get<00:01:55.619> sonic<00:01:55.920> generations<00:01:56.189> that's<00:01:56.429> why

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
didn't get sonic generations that's why

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.130 
didn't get sonic generations that's why
