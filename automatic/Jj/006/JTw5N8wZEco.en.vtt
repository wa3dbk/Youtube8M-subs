00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
vibrato there

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.000 
vibrato there
amended<00:04:29.030> that's<00:04:29.270> great<00:04:29.540> just<00:04:29.870> you<00:04:30.320> know<00:04:30.440> not

amended that's great just you know not
bend<00:04:31.280> it<00:04:31.400> be<00:04:31.550> wiggler<00:04:32.450> no<00:04:32.600> lumen<00:04:33.850> okay<00:04:35.110> so

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
bend it be wiggler no lumen okay so

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.310 
bend it be wiggler no lumen okay so
that's<00:04:36.290> it<00:04:36.560> let's<00:04:36.770> do<00:04:36.980> it<00:04:37.100> together<00:04:37.250> ready<00:04:38.320> do

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
that's it let's do it together ready do

00:04:39.320 --> 00:05:07.679 
that's it let's do it together ready do
it<00:04:39.350> together<00:04:39.530> slow

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:07.689 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:10.149

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:10.159 
okay so let's rock this up a little bit

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:12.760 
okay so let's rock this up a little bit
okay<00:05:10.580> you<00:05:11.419> got<00:05:11.599> it<00:05:11.719> down<00:05:11.900> right<00:05:12.139> it's<00:05:12.559> pretty

okay hear those little ringing notes

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.760 
okay hear those little ringing notes
those<00:05:43.449> are<00:05:43.569> harmonics<00:05:44.199> that<00:05:44.500> I'm<00:05:44.620> hitting

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
those are harmonics that I'm hitting

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.800 
those are harmonics that I'm hitting
with<00:05:45.039> my<00:05:45.220> pick<00:05:45.490> and<00:05:45.729> if<00:05:46.270> you<00:05:46.360> want<00:05:46.599> to<00:05:46.659> learn
