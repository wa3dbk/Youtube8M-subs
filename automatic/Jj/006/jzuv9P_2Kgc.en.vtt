he when he has the empty net that it

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.880 
he when he has the empty net that it
felt<00:02:50.610> like<00:02:51.050> something<00:02:52.050> was<00:02:52.350> keeping<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.709> puck

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
felt like something was keeping the puck

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.500 
felt like something was keeping the puck
out<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.220> net<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.550> certainly<00:02:53.850> wasn't<00:02:54.150> a

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
out of the net it certainly wasn't a

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.479 
out of the net it certainly wasn't a
lack<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.959> opportunity<00:02:55.620> or<00:02:55.739> scoring<00:02:56.100> chances

or situations for our team for our
players<00:02:59.730> for<00:03:00.120> our<00:03:00.209> power<00:03:00.390> play<00:03:00.720> we<00:03:00.930> did<00:03:01.230> have

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
players for our power play we did have

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:09.020 
players for our power play we did have
them<00:03:03.350> and<00:03:04.350> at<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.010> end<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:06.320> it<00:03:07.550> it<00:03:08.550> felt<00:03:08.820> like

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
them and at the end it it it felt like

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.520 
them and at the end it it it felt like
not<00:03:09.209> only<00:03:09.360> Tuukka<00:03:09.780> Rask<00:03:09.810> was<00:03:10.200> keeping<00:03:10.440> the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
not only Tuukka Rask was keeping the

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.740 
not only Tuukka Rask was keeping the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
puck out of the net but but there was a

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.930 
puck out of the net but but there was a
force<00:03:13.050> around<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:13.440> net<00:03:13.590> because<00:03:13.860> we<00:03:14.430> we<00:03:14.760> had

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
force around the net because we we had

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.449 
force around the net because we we had
some<00:03:15.150> great<00:03:15.390> opportunities<00:03:15.450> but<00:03:16.459> situations

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
done something differently to put it in

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.069 
done something differently to put it in
a<00:03:34.170> different<00:03:34.530> direction<00:03:34.680> whether<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.400> was

a different direction whether it was

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.479 
a different direction whether it was
shaking<00:03:37.079> things<00:03:37.260> up<00:03:37.410> on<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.650> power<00:03:37.860> player<00:03:38.160> or

shaking things up on the power player or

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.420 
shaking things up on the power player or
just<00:03:38.760> anything<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.959> find<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:40.739> spark<00:03:41.040> at<00:03:41.220> some

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
just anything to find a spark at some

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.610 
just anything to find a spark at some
point<00:03:41.700> that<00:03:41.880> just<00:03:42.120> never<00:03:42.870> came<00:03:43.140> or<00:03:43.380> was<00:03:43.500> it

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
point that just never came or was it

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.740 
point that just never came or was it
just<00:03:43.799> not<00:03:44.130> meant<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.370> be

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:54.950 

but<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.990> one<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:50.130> know<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:53.660> we<00:03:54.660> didn't<00:03:54.870> do

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
but the one you know the we didn't do

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.440 
but the one you know the we didn't do
the<00:03:55.080> job<00:03:55.260> we<00:03:55.560> didn't<00:03:56.030> come<00:03:57.030> up<00:03:57.060> with<00:03:57.360> those

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
the job we didn't come up with those

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.660 
the job we didn't come up with those
situations<00:03:57.720> in<00:03:58.530> in<00:03:59.190> any<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.730> games<00:04:01.310> so<00:04:02.310> I

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
situations in in any of the games so I

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.900 
situations in in any of the games so I
don't<00:04:03.510> think<00:04:03.690> there's<00:04:04.260> gonna<00:04:04.470> be<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:05.010> not<00:04:05.880> a

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
don't think there's gonna be a not a

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.110 
don't think there's gonna be a not a
look<00:04:06.600> at<00:04:07.010> some<00:04:08.010> of<00:04:08.100> those<00:04:08.190> situations<00:04:08.880> when<00:04:09.030> it

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
look at some of those situations when it

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.710 
look at some of those situations when it
comes<00:04:09.300> to<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.020> power<00:04:10.230> play<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:11.370> know

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
comes to the to the power play you know

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.940 
comes to the to the power play you know
more<00:04:12.720> than<00:04:12.810> half<00:04:13.020> our<00:04:13.170> power<00:04:13.440> plays<00:04:13.680> had

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
more than half our power plays had

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.050 
more than half our power plays had
different<00:04:14.730> people<00:04:15.390> on<00:04:15.540> it<00:04:15.660> because<00:04:15.990> of

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
different people on it because of

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.380 
different people on it because of
variety<00:04:18.060> of<00:04:18.090> reasons<00:04:18.630> but<00:04:19.280> you<00:04:20.280> know<00:04:21.270> we

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
variety of reasons but you know we

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.070 
variety of reasons but you know we
didn't<00:04:21.600> get<00:04:21.810> our<00:04:22.340> top<00:04:23.340> unit<00:04:23.670> together<00:04:23.850> for<00:04:24.480> for

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
didn't get our top unit together for for

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.990 
didn't get our top unit together for for
more<00:04:25.260> than<00:04:25.410> half<00:04:25.620> of<00:04:25.740> them<00:04:25.910> because<00:04:26.910> the

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
more than half of them because the

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.910 
more than half of them because the
penalties<00:04:27.390> or<00:04:27.770> other<00:04:28.770> situations<00:04:30.830> during<00:04:31.830> the

penalties or other situations during the

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.250 
penalties or other situations during the
course<00:04:32.160> of<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.370> game<00:04:32.520> and<00:04:32.960> we<00:04:33.960> didn't<00:04:34.140> have

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
course of the game and we didn't have

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.080 
course of the game and we didn't have
the<00:04:34.350> continuity<00:04:34.710> on<00:04:34.920> our<00:04:35.040> PowerPoint<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:35.910> get

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
the continuity on our PowerPoint and get

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.750 
the continuity on our PowerPoint and get
that<00:04:36.270> goal<00:04:36.540> when<00:04:37.230> the<00:04:37.260> special<00:04:37.710> teams<00:04:37.920> that

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
that goal when the special teams that

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.830 
that goal when the special teams that
would<00:04:38.880> have<00:04:38.970> been<00:04:39.090> a<00:04:39.120> difference<00:04:39.480> in<00:04:39.600> one<00:04:39.750> of

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
would have been a difference in one of

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.830 
would have been a difference in one of
these<00:04:39.960> games<00:04:40.730> certainly<00:04:41.730> a<00:04:41.910> golden<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:42.600> three

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
these games certainly a golden and three

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.200 
these games certainly a golden and three

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
different factor for us if we've been

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.410 
different factor for us if we've been
able<00:04:46.530> to<00:04:46.650> get<00:04:46.830> that<00:04:47.100> and<00:04:47.310> we<00:04:47.940> weren't<00:04:48.120> able<00:04:48.270> to

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
able to get that and we weren't able to

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.020 
able to get that and we weren't able to
do<00:04:48.660> that<00:04:48.690> so<00:04:50.510> damnum<00:04:51.590> they<00:04:52.590> all<00:04:52.740> hurt<00:04:53.100> but<00:04:53.850> does
