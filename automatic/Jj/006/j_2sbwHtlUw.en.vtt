00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.919
 hi to all his elected officials 75 I hope that 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.510
 you are fine 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.460
 so we end up for a new 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.420
 gameplay so it's true that it makes 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.380
 long time it's not for sinking the 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.719
 gameplay but when you said that's 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.910
 the holidays enjoy so this is it 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.029
 a little episode a little month 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.740
 had proposed to me that as 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.600
 to invent the concept how bad 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.760
 time and I had been offered this class 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.590
 so cm 4 to 1 with the 18 geie in 2d we 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.140
 here I tried this little brand 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.420
 like in the good old days so for those 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.090
 who do not know so these seven months 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.399
 is to finally take a 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.100
 dmw class 2 and dessert the me with my 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.180
 case when you saw I accelerated the 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.410
 gameplay because there has been a change 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.170
 doubts and its access since you are here 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.210
 it's boring lazily doubt and 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.690
 then it's not very interesting lap 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.870
 washable kinds 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.010
 So here it is going to take this would be 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.269
 the mode pretty quickly because 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.909
 frankly I managed the spawn 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:08.710
 so when you know croatia the other 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.210
 point there so it's a good 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.399
 technique to have a fashion like go 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.299
 start moving 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.840
 so I really advise you to do 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.159
 that this little this little technique 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.470
 on resistance 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.990
 so after these smugglers you will have it 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.159
 every time but to work it's 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.990
 simpler art and do like that 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.110
 on this resistance prison cuincy 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.229
 I find it simpler desire and the 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.649
 enemies so the next video 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.030
 trains little month on intersection 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.950
 it's been a long time since they were celebrating 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.420
 was at the exit of the new maps 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.369
 the day the new maps come out of 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.170
 cracking on interception but never put 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:49.330
 so I help you put it in the 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.319
 in the week in his head this weekend 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.509
 that we give a lot more videos 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:58.899
 often but as I said here it's 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.950
 the big holidays to enjoy you 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:04.360
 not everyone has time to 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.819
 watch videos and in time here I 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.129
 not often play the same time as 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.530
 vacation does not play as much as I have 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:15.629
 played before there was not a lot of 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:19.090
 of gameplay in stocks versus wind 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:24.640
 so here we are the Jesuits who is a 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:27.700
 weapon is not personally it's not 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.310
 tears that I will have chosen in second 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.690
 weapon you know she's not really 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.629
 to use frankly it is not of 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.849
 all used even when it is not 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.510
 at all used compared to both 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.980
 submachine guns that are there npns 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.319
 and tmg 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.140
 apart from that even the scorpion we do not see 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.560
 never press, I never see 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.250
 almost never done by a scorpion 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.900
 except that we feel the king mo the whole 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.739
 So here it is true that there I doubt 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.069
 also the least used and we do not know 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.700
 what happened from double was 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:09.030
 far more powerful than them 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.250
 that backstage 18 from there that's why 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.700
 that he is not not used but 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.799
 see a small automatic pistol that 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.280
 fun times I do not have 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.530
 in use 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.930
 and then the 4 which is still very 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.650
 good weapons to ride although he 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.680
 assures to prefer small valadon month 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.060
 unblocked to the Catalan donkey with weapon 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.829
 secondary Monday 18 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.989
 loum here so I think it's 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.829
 episode 5 so as if you like that 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.480
 the mouawad part 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.549
 because that's me this concept that you 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.200
 did you see how we created it 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.900
 like that at the base and we said a lot 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.310
 to keep the party but after when 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.019
 same as on request and still had a 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.489
 change of others after me 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.290
 a lot that they left so I 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.730
 favorite cut that so I hope it 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.340
 will please you and can you but a 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.879
 very fast gameplay this weekend has gone 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.879
 greet
