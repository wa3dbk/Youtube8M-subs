00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.170
 in 1961 faithful and che find themselves 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.660
 for a round of golf at the old 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.420
 contrite laval club abandoned after the 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.710
 revolution 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.990
 that's where I like in their minds 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.990
 the idea of building an art school 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.570
 to undertake such a project three 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.510
 Young architects are called the 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.129
 executives at the port of Cuban nationality 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.080
 coordinates the project and takes under 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.229
 responsibility the art schools 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.199
 plastics and modern dance it makes 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:53.659
 call to two young Italian architects 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:56.000
 roberto cota 10 and vital warranty 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.040
 in charge of designing schools of 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.460
 ballet of music and arts of the 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.159
 scene each of the architects created with 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.399
 an absolute freedom m based 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.740
 of common assumptions it is necessary that each 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:12.369
 element of the work be integrated into 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.780
 the natural environment 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.210
 the whole must express the roots 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.070
 of the Cuban nation 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.740
 that's why we find the image of 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.859
 africa village associated with the portal 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.859
 European 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.180
 the earth will be the material of 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.680
 construction and roofs will 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.960
 constructed according to the technique of 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.550
 Catalan city 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.860
 the whole will consist of pavilions 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.460
 articulated by courtyards and galleries of 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.770
 circulation in order to cope with the 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.009
 shortage of steel concrete and machinery 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.050
 caused by the American blockade rick is 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.119
 of port makes use of know-how 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:55.040
 Catalan craftsmen in the art of 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:57.050
 brick construction but the 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.820
 school design was also 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.970
 the subject of passionate controversy in 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.350
 national and international forums 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.600
 no construction after the revolution 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.959
 was no more controversial than school 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.239
 national art the unexpected blow of the 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.860
 eco design buildings causes 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.890
 many wasteful complaints 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.060
 economic 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.280
 some think that the country has other 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.780
 urgent priorities and that it is not 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.230
 the time to waste the poor 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.180
 resources of projects of this magnitude 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.910
 school construction paralyze 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.070
 in 1965 for reasons of the 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.209
 aesthetic understanding and because of 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.209
 the scarcity of materials 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.900
 it was in October 1999 that the union 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.020
 national writers and artists of 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.740
 Cuba decides with the support of Fidel 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.530
 castro to go back to the original project so 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.500
 to finish it and recover it with 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.510
 the participation of its authors 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.640
 three architects are invited to come back 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.650
 to laval to finish the job 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.230
 in 2010 the school is declared a monument 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:11.980
 by the National Commission for 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:13.720
 cuba monuments in cuba 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.510
 despite the limited means available to the 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.290
 country of arts in all their forms 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.290
 remains a priority 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.940
 the biennale of Havana was born in 1984 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.890
 it takes place every two years whose 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.840
 Cuban capital 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.420
 the 11th biennale of Havana held 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.790
 in may june 2012 and transformed the 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.370
 entire city into an exhibition hall 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.410
 and giant shows a kind a 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.320
 public space participate in the event 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.720
 and attract the crowds 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:14.290
 the theme of 2012 was practical 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.790
 artistic and imaginary social the theme 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.090
 of memory and the center of 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.350
 the exhibition the ability of the media to 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.169
 make collective memories 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.290
 manipulate causes more amnesia 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.910
 in more generalized that's why the 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.040
 biennale wanted to develop the theme of 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.720
 memory in order to highlight the 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.690
 artistic expressions that tend to 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.550
 recover those areas of memory it 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.830
 needed to restore memory to the old 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.680
 colonized countries and dismantle the 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.690
 definitions based on the exclusion that denies 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.460
 to this world the opportunity to occupy 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.560
 space in universal culture 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.780
 it was necessary to desecrate the great 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.940
 history of art a discipline in the 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.940
 tradition is 900 creek is well known
