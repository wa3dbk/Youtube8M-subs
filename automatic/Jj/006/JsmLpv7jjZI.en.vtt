00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.390
 the tasting his dad 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.790
 I want to take the lost steps to another video that the pope 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.299
 Soup 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.209
 this time we're going to talk about something that I think everyone 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.359
 interesting here that's the types of people 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.149
 this is a pretty broad topic so that's the first video of several 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:27.659
 or not 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:29.539
 of many or few 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.130
 but maybe that's the first 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.510
 of all the types of people that can exist 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.910
 round the types of people can be 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.120
 as its name says whatever type it even had can be identified in 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.260
 of this great list of types of people and if you do not feel identified 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
 it means that it is works in society 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.389
 so without further ado 

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:54.799
 let's start with the first type of person and 16 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.880
 perurena can be divided into two parts 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.520
 the Catalan 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.280
 and the spa lover 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.270
 and believe me 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.640
 min like that nobody would like to do that the difference is simple 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.640
 a beau is gallant by nature 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.460
 dávila ap 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.030
 a great forward 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.070
 hadad 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.390
 let's say 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.180
 exaggerates a bit to identify a spa lover is very, very peace 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.640
 The only thing you need is to look at your goal 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.980
 and for example if it says so 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.010
 with t-shirts of this type 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.260
 sleeveless 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.100
 and instead of facebook has a microphone 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.550
 both assured that he is a gallant of banias 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.280
 a bullet 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.580
 before the doubt 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.070
 there is also the pretentious one, not because he knows Europe 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.850
 in fact according to him 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.609
 forgetting a little bit at 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.620
 the Spanish 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.780
 i 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.710
 good as for many it would be 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.329
 in 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.300
 Canada 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.300
 but talavante in europe 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.380
 the 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.770
 borges heads of europe without even passport times 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.460
 He indicated that what happens to them because he could leave the country is outrageous 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.840
 ten united states of immigrant 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.660
 is it a person who does not even know where he is 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.319
 avn 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.319
 now it's not that it's that 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:22.539
 I have to go 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:26.729
 that's also the type of uncomfortable questions and that all the 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:28.679
 time is bothering 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:29.929
 but to annoy 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:31.649
 crystal jul 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:34.649

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.269
 against those boli 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.669
 the problem is that when you bother them 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:06.869
 consists of a hotel to basket 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:09.399
 because they are very good at what they do 

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:11.349

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:17.289
 they 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.689
 but we also have 

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:23.939
 to more characters like for example the pirru reis the first revision is a 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:28.999
 Interfresa combination combined with power and has a bit of paper to mouth 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:30.580
 making this one 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.110
 a rather peculiar character 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.099

 they call him papi min 14 imposes to the bottom and because I have everything 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.650
 As far as having a problem, the selective review is the one that always 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.300
 that who is right 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.650

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.370
 hoon that they take from the school an old subject come to fight 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:12.580
 they are usually talkative is another of the most beloved characters by 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.219
 all not the truth not but at least yes the best known are 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.050
 the goods 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.050
 the fears are a combination between 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.330
 bad taste jokes 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.060
 and vulgar comments 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.180
 that make them quite funny characters but not for themselves and their friends 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.550
 If not the opposite 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.129
 to laugh at them 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:38.629
