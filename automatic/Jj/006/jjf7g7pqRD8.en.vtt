00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
today's review is a look at the design

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.570 
today's review is a look at the design
feature<00:00:14.339> of<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.299> hot<00:00:15.629> swappable<00:00:16.320> at<00:00:16.590> bay<00:00:17.189> at

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
feature of the hot swappable at bay at

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.359 
feature of the hot swappable at bay at
the<00:00:18.029> front<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.930> laptop<00:00:19.169> which<00:00:19.919> you<00:00:20.160> can

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
the front of the laptop which you can

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.190 
the front of the laptop which you can
find<00:00:20.399> here<00:00:21.169> so<00:00:22.169> if<00:00:22.649> you<00:00:23.189> buy<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.910> stock<00:00:24.570> laptop

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
find here so if you buy the stock laptop

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.679 
find here so if you buy the stock laptop
from<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.770> shop<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.880> will<00:00:27.000> most<00:00:27.210> likely<00:00:27.509> be

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
from the shop you will most likely be

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.080 
from the shop you will most likely be
provided<00:00:28.320> with<00:00:28.469> an<00:00:28.619> optical<00:00:28.829> disc<00:00:29.520> drive<00:00:29.640> as

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
provided with an optical disc drive as

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.990 
provided with an optical disc drive as
in<00:00:30.480> my<00:00:30.840> iteration<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.890> laptop<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.880> can

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
in my iteration of a laptop and you can

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.299 
in my iteration of a laptop and you can
see<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.629> is<00:00:33.899> where<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.469> disk<00:00:34.710> drive<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.100> at

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
see this is where the disk drive is at

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.390 
see this is where the disk drive is at
the<00:00:35.550> front<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.000> laptop<00:00:36.330> and<00:00:36.590> this<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.830> where

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
the front of a laptop and this is where

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.840 
the front of a laptop and this is where
the<00:00:38.610> eject<00:00:39.000> button<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.480> now<00:00:40.310> before<00:00:41.310> i<00:00:41.340> bought

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
the eject button is now before i bought

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.610 
the eject button is now before i bought
a<00:00:41.880> laptop<00:00:42.120> i<00:00:42.540> didn't<00:00:42.840> think<00:00:42.870> anything<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.380> this

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
a laptop i didn't think anything of this

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.360 
a laptop i didn't think anything of this
particular<00:00:44.220> design<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:46.100> position<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
particular design and position of the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.550 
particular design and position of the
optical<00:00:47.760> disc<00:00:47.820> drive<00:00:48.000> but<00:00:48.870> then<00:00:49.430> what<00:00:50.430> does<00:00:51.000> a

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
optical disc drive but then what does a

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.910 
optical disc drive but then what does a
laptop<00:00:52.579> potentially<00:00:53.579> allow<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.360> do<00:00:54.920> well

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
laptop potentially allow you to do well

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.639 
laptop potentially allow you to do well
the<00:00:56.040> obvious<00:00:56.160> answer<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.570> name<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
the obvious answer is in the name of the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.740 
the obvious answer is in the name of the
device<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.310> allows<00:00:59.610> you<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.970> put<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.420> your

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
device it allows you to put it on your

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.979 
device it allows you to put it on your
lap<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.610> now<00:01:02.610> think<00:01:02.910> about<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.450> where<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.870> that

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
lap and now think about it where is that

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.590 
lap and now think about it where is that
optical<00:01:04.439> drive<00:01:04.680> sitting<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.369> where<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.450> your

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
optical drive sitting and where is your

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.950 
optical drive sitting and where is your
let<00:01:07.140> button<00:01:07.590> right<00:01:08.219> there<00:01:08.359> and<00:01:09.359> i<00:01:09.450> found<00:01:09.810> that

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
let button right there and i found that

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.330 
let button right there and i found that
when<00:01:10.049> i<00:01:10.079> have<00:01:10.319> been<00:01:10.350> using<00:01:10.679> the<00:01:10.829> laptop<00:01:11.009> on<00:01:11.310> my

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
when i have been using the laptop on my

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.690 
when i have been using the laptop on my
lap<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.899> just<00:01:13.289> adjust<00:01:13.889> the<00:01:14.069> laptop<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.639> my

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
lap and I just adjust the laptop on my

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.200 
lap and I just adjust the laptop on my
lap<00:01:14.969> I<00:01:15.450> often<00:01:15.719> catch<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:17.009> eject<00:01:17.789> button<00:01:17.850> and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
lap I often catch the eject button and

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:27.230 
lap I often catch the eject button and
this<00:01:18.270> happens<00:01:23.539> it<00:01:24.539> kicks<00:01:25.049> out<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.740> disc<00:01:26.280> so

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
this happens it kicks out the disc so

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.529 
this happens it kicks out the disc so
just<00:01:27.810> be<00:01:27.990> aware<00:01:28.020> but<00:01:28.799> if<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.100> do<00:01:29.399> like<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.119> have

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
just be aware but if you do like to have

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.090 
just be aware but if you do like to have
a<00:01:30.569> laptop<00:01:30.899> in<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.319> comfortable<00:01:31.619> position<00:01:31.740> on

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
a laptop in a comfortable position on

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.370 
a laptop in a comfortable position on
your<00:01:32.219> lap<00:01:32.369> maybe<00:01:32.609> on<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.819> couch<00:01:33.200> you<00:01:34.200> are

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
your lap maybe on the couch you are

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.289 
your lap maybe on the couch you are
going<00:01:34.649> to<00:01:34.799> get<00:01:34.920> times<00:01:35.249> when<00:01:35.459> you<00:01:35.549> accidentally

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
going to get times when you accidentally

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.569 
going to get times when you accidentally
press<00:01:36.539> the<00:01:36.779> optical<00:01:37.319> drive<00:01:37.529> and<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.829> could

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
press the optical drive and that could

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.459 
press the optical drive and that could
be<00:01:38.609> quite<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.029> potential<00:01:39.659> issue<00:01:39.779> if<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.380> are

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
be quite a potential issue if you are

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:42.859 
be quite a potential issue if you are
playing<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.950> game<00:01:41.189> or<00:01:41.520> watching<00:01:41.999> a<00:01:42.329> movie<00:01:42.719> on

playing a game or watching a movie on
the<00:01:43.409> disc<00:01:43.709> drive<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.179> is<00:01:45.209> a<00:01:45.389> bit<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:46.139> a

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
the disc drive so it is a bit of a

the disc drive so it is a bit of a
design<00:01:46.560> flaw<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.039> must<00:01:47.429> admit<00:01:48.079> fortunately<00:01:49.079> for
