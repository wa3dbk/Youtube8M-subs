00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 The job of the postman is hard 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.710
 each and every one hauls hundreds every day 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.660
 kilo of mailings to customers and 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.050
 the employment relationships are always 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.330
 harder 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.969
 the delivery areas and thus the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.010
 Distances become greater time pressure and 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.210
 Stress for the post office workers 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.980
 Employees grow 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.210
 we have the union chairman 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.029
 accompanied to a local eye 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.289
 hundreds of kilo post and day after day 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.179
 Employees at the post have enough too 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.369
 and every year there is more 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.320
 the union chairman helmut 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.969
 liebinger wants to get a picture of himself 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.829
 make the situation and that works best 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.660
 if you cooperate yourself due to the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.550
 intense almost daily in 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.430
 Negotiations with the boards and the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.350
 Post-management is important to know 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.170
 From what we talk about it is important too 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.430
 know which problems really exist 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.960
 on the spot after a short 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.969
 induction time may be the chairman 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.160
 already draw a first conclusion 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.410
 The biggest burden is certainly 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.850
 that we have too little staff that 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.159
 pulls like a red thread through 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.790
 all departments through the permanent 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.110
 up system honor field staff wegfiele 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.479
 we do not go the invention 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.330
 occupied and that is an untenable 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.299
 situation if you are already so big 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.220
 that it's a daily big burden 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.439
 there for the workforce then have to go for it 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.000
 Carry if someone is on vacation 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.280
 wants to go or if someone gets sick 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.119
 that immediately a spare everything else 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.369
 is unreasonable 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.790
 Many employees see the commitment 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.549
 the union is very positive it means 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.799
 always the computer takes care of the hotel and 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.659
 that must go out at present and that the 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.950
 union or that we can do it 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.649
 looks like if the practice looks 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.329
 really different but among the 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.030
 there are also critical employees 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.590
 Vote in the personal representation of 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.600
 it just fits that always 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.100
 tearing each other apart 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:01.159
 that is should have with representations 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.840
 work together and that's important 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.820
 Helmut deliinger will be encouraged 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.920
 works in various industries 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.410
 post with him is this action 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.920
 especially a matter as 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.810
 representatives of the workforce 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.459
 Know what we need to know 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.650
 what are the biggest problems 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.330
 That's what we want to do best possible 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.430
 only works if the permanent 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.110
 contact is given and the resonance off 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.750
 the staff shows that this is very very 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.430
 Well, that's important to me too 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.590
 also has to do with appreciation 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.069
 has community with solidarity too 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.360
 do 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.819
 we have to shoulder to shoulder 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.459
 march and form a bulwark here 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.769
 thing that the management still intends 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.459
 It is now with this goal in mind 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.459
 on the tour
