00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
three fingers out of the way these two

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.530 
three fingers out of the way these two
are<00:01:38.820> mostly<00:01:39.240> doing<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.630> motion<00:01:40.130> okay<00:01:41.540> nice

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
are mostly doing the motion okay nice

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.609 
are mostly doing the motion okay nice
and<00:01:42.780> slow<00:01:43.189> and<00:01:44.390> then<00:01:45.390> three<00:01:45.689> hits<00:01:45.930> again<00:01:46.229> okay

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
and slow and then three hits again okay

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.190 
and slow and then three hits again okay
so<00:01:48.680> now<00:01:49.680> when<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.159> combine<00:01:50.640> them<00:01:50.820> one<00:01:51.479> two

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
so now when you combine them one two

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:01.410 
so now when you combine them one two
three<00:01:53.100> one<00:01:53.790> two<00:01:54.079> three

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.760 

definitely<00:02:02.420> takes<00:02:02.600> a<00:02:02.690> lot<00:02:02.810> of<00:02:02.840> practice

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.680 

sometimes<00:02:09.820> when<00:02:10.820> you<00:02:10.910> develop<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.510> little

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
sometimes when you develop it a little

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.390 
sometimes when you develop it a little
bit<00:02:11.930> it's<00:02:12.140> going<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.440> be<00:02:12.560> easier<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.310> get

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
bit it's going to be easier to get

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:24.450 
bit it's going to be easier to get
faster

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.310 

okay<00:02:25.460> let's<00:02:25.790> start<00:02:25.970> slow<00:02:26.240> with<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.900> basic

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
okay let's start slow with the basic

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:44.170 
okay let's start slow with the basic
twirl<00:02:27.650> come<00:02:28.310> around<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.780> then<00:02:30.230> three<00:02:30.470> hits

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.179 

what<00:02:44.840> do<00:02:44.989> you<00:02:45.079> say<00:02:45.319> to<00:02:45.379> those<00:02:45.590> people<00:02:45.859> who<00:02:46.129> say

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
those who practice stick tricks are less

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.789 
those who practice stick tricks are less
quality<00:02:52.909> drummers<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.900> those<00:02:54.170> who<00:02:54.379> don't

so then would you say that learning
stick<00:03:29.360> tricks<00:03:29.720> is<00:03:30.099> actually<00:03:31.099> a<00:03:31.129> way<00:03:31.640> of

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
stick tricks is actually a way of

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.509 
stick tricks is actually a way of
learning<00:03:32.299> an<00:03:32.750> advanced<00:03:33.470> drumming<00:03:33.980> technique

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
learning an advanced drumming technique

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.119 
learning an advanced drumming technique
yes<00:03:35.060> that's<00:03:35.330> what<00:03:35.480> it<00:03:35.599> is<00:03:35.720> because<00:03:36.019> you<00:03:36.200> remove

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
yes that's what it is because you remove

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:38.680 
yes that's what it is because you remove
it<00:03:37.250> so<00:03:37.370> many<00:03:37.549> different<00:03:37.909> muscle<00:03:38.209> groups<00:03:38.239> and

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
it so many different muscle groups and

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.660 
it so many different muscle groups and
you<00:03:39.049> sending<00:03:39.500> so<00:03:39.680> many<00:03:39.769> signals<00:03:40.340> from<00:03:40.489> your

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
you sending so many signals from your

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.130 
you sending so many signals from your
brain<00:03:40.730> let's<00:03:41.269> say<00:03:41.360> I'm<00:03:41.450> just<00:03:41.599> playing<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:41.959> free

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.670 
brain let's say I'm just playing a free
stroke<00:03:42.470> I'm<00:03:42.950> sending<00:03:43.400> a<00:03:43.459> certain<00:03:44.150> signals

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
stroke I'm sending a certain signals

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.199 
stroke I'm sending a certain signals
recognizing<00:03:45.680> a<00:03:45.739> free<00:03:45.950> stroke<00:03:46.190> if<00:03:46.819> I<00:03:47.000> do<00:03:47.060> a

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
recognizing a free stroke if I do a

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.690 
recognizing a free stroke if I do a
twirl<00:03:47.569> my<00:03:48.080> brain<00:03:48.319> has<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:48.739> send<00:03:48.980> so<00:03:49.310> many<00:03:49.430> more

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
twirl my brain has to send so many more

twirl my brain has to send so many more
informations<00:03:50.480> there's<00:03:51.049> so<00:03:51.230> many<00:03:51.349> more<00:03:51.680> small

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010

doing is empowering children to practice

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.170 
doing is empowering children to practice
and<00:04:07.230> then<00:04:07.650> they<00:04:07.740> learn<00:04:07.950> those<00:04:08.160> tricks<00:04:08.490> and

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
and then they learn those tricks and

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.400 
and then they learn those tricks and
what<00:04:09.300> happens<00:04:09.660> is<00:04:09.750> they're<00:04:09.930> better<00:04:10.140> in<00:04:10.320> school

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410

they're<00:04:11.160> doing<00:04:11.400> better<00:04:11.520> in<00:04:11.730> math<00:04:11.910> they<00:04:12.600> can

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
they're doing better in math they can

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.750 
they're doing better in math they can
focus<00:04:13.230> more<00:04:13.560> because<00:04:13.860> it<00:04:13.980> needs<00:04:14.490> a<00:04:14.610> lot<00:04:14.730> of
