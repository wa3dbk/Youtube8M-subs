biggest thing is essentially the

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.040 
biggest thing is essentially the
evolution<00:01:23.440> of<00:01:23.560> this<00:01:23.740> show<00:01:23.979> it<00:01:24.400> was<00:01:24.460> a<00:01:25.360> creative

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
evolution of this show it was a creative

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.859 
evolution of this show it was a creative
meeting<00:01:26.350> where<00:01:26.500> we<00:01:26.530> used<00:01:26.860> to<00:01:26.979> have<00:01:27.869> pyramids

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
meeting where we used to have pyramids

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.300 
meeting where we used to have pyramids
that<00:01:28.960> were<00:01:29.140> on<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.350> ice<00:01:29.500> and<00:01:29.890> then<00:01:29.979> from<00:01:30.190> the

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
that were on the ice and then from the

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.130 
that were on the ice and then from the
parens<00:01:30.670> you<00:01:30.759> went<00:01:30.940> to<00:01:31.090> trust<00:01:31.420> they<00:01:31.660> had<00:01:31.810> a<00:01:31.840> wolf

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
parens you went to trust they had a wolf

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.170 
parens you went to trust they had a wolf
head<00:01:32.440> that<00:01:32.770> fire<00:01:33.100> shot<00:01:33.400> out<00:01:33.550> of<00:01:33.580> his<00:01:33.670> mouth<00:01:33.910> and

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
head that fire shot out of his mouth and

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.359 
head that fire shot out of his mouth and
then<00:01:34.330> it<00:01:34.960> was<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.320> world<00:01:35.530> what's<00:01:35.710> next<00:01:36.130> and

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
then it was the world what's next and

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.270 
then it was the world what's next and
then<00:01:36.490> we<00:01:36.580> started<00:01:37.649> expanding<00:01:38.649> with<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.070> set

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
then we started expanding with the set

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.830 
then we started expanding with the set
pieces<00:01:39.550> and<00:01:39.700> things<00:01:40.000> like<00:01:40.149> that<00:01:40.240> you<00:01:40.750> know

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
pieces and things like that you know

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.480 
pieces and things like that you know
mark<00:01:41.170> was<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.500> first<00:01:41.740> one<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:42.009> come<00:01:42.130> up<00:01:42.340> with

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
mark was the first one to come up with

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.969 
mark was the first one to come up with
paws<00:01:43.330> with<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.869> planes<00:01:44.140> coming<00:01:44.500> out<00:01:44.710> of<00:01:44.830> them

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
paws with the planes coming out of them

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.330 
paws with the planes coming out of them
it<00:01:45.430> was<00:01:45.550> just<00:01:45.820> one<00:01:45.940> of<00:01:45.970> those<00:01:46.119> basically<00:01:47.340> how

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
it was just one of those basically how

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.859 
it was just one of those basically how
about<00:01:48.550> if<00:01:48.670> there's<00:01:48.850> a<00:01:48.940> giant<00:01:49.240> wolf<00:01:49.450> had<00:01:49.690> him

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
about if there's a giant wolf had him

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.020 
about if there's a giant wolf had him
and<00:01:50.050> there<00:01:50.170> was<00:01:50.290> their<00:01:51.040> bows<00:01:51.190> well<00:01:51.670> wolf

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
and there was their bows well wolf

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.340 
and there was their bows well wolf
that's<00:01:52.330> pretty<00:01:52.539> cool<00:01:52.780> they're<00:01:52.960> like<00:01:53.050> what<00:01:53.259> if

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
that's pretty cool they're like what if

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.980 
that's pretty cool they're like what if
it<00:01:53.440> had<00:01:53.619> paws<00:01:53.920> like<00:01:54.789> that'd<00:01:55.450> be<00:01:55.569> really<00:01:55.810> cool

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
it had paws like that'd be really cool

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.480 
it had paws like that'd be really cool
if<00:01:56.170> it<00:01:56.259> had<00:01:56.380> a<00:01:56.410> wolf's<00:01:56.679> head<00:01:56.890> and<00:01:57.130> then<00:01:57.220> pause

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
if it had a wolf's head and then pause

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.130 
if it had a wolf's head and then pause
and<00:01:57.759> then<00:01:57.850> if<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.030> paws<00:01:58.240> had<00:01:58.479> flames<00:01:58.840> come<00:01:59.020> out

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
and then if the paws had flames come out

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.139 
and then if the paws had flames come out
of<00:01:59.259> them<00:01:59.380> so<00:01:59.619> it<00:02:00.190> kind<00:02:00.399> of<00:02:00.460> from<00:02:00.670> there<00:02:00.880> it<00:02:00.970> kind

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
of them so it kind of from there it kind

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.719 
of them so it kind of from there it kind
of<00:02:01.210> grew<00:02:01.569> and<00:02:02.110> then<00:02:02.350> that<00:02:02.920> lasted<00:02:03.399> for<00:02:03.550> a<00:02:03.580> while

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
of grew and then that lasted for a while

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.160 
of grew and then that lasted for a while
then<00:02:04.090> we<00:02:04.179> felt<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:04.569> we<00:02:04.660> wanted<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:04.990> really

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
then we felt that we wanted to really

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.930 
then we felt that we wanted to really
modernize<00:02:05.440> and<00:02:05.950> kind<00:02:06.190> of<00:02:06.280> a<00:02:06.369> little<00:02:06.700> bit<00:02:06.819> of<00:02:06.880> a

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
modernize and kind of a little bit of a

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.999 
modernize and kind of a little bit of a
darker<00:02:07.360> look<00:02:07.630> we<00:02:07.780> also<00:02:07.929> had<00:02:08.200> some<00:02:08.229> constraints

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
darker look we also had some constraints

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.460 
darker look we also had some constraints
just<00:02:09.940> getting<00:02:10.330> equipment<00:02:10.600> off<00:02:10.929> and<00:02:11.170> on<00:02:11.260> the

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
just getting equipment off and on the

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.460 
just getting equipment off and on the
ice<00:02:11.590> is<00:02:11.830> fairly<00:02:12.190> difficult<00:02:12.370> so<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:14.170> know<00:02:14.290> to

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
ice is fairly difficult so you know to

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.530 
ice is fairly difficult so you know to
kind<00:02:15.040> of<00:02:15.160> alleviate<00:02:15.370> that<00:02:15.640> problem<00:02:16.090> we<00:02:16.360> made

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
kind of alleviate that problem we made

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.199 
kind of alleviate that problem we made
everything<00:02:16.840> lighter<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.560> smaller<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:19.090> that

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
everything lighter and smaller so that

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.730 
everything lighter and smaller so that
it<00:02:19.300> can<00:02:19.450> get<00:02:19.600> through<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.959> opening<00:02:20.380> before

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
it can get through the opening before

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.380 
it can get through the opening before
the<00:02:21.160> physical<00:02:21.340> structure<00:02:21.910> was<00:02:22.000> this<00:02:22.120> giant

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
the physical structure was this giant

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.020 
the physical structure was this giant
wolf<00:02:22.630> head<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:23.020> was<00:02:23.140> as<00:02:24.040> deep<00:02:24.310> as<00:02:24.490> it<00:02:24.610> was<00:02:24.790> why

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
wolf head that was as deep as it was why

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.699 
wolf head that was as deep as it was why
for<00:02:25.600> trying<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.870> get<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:26.140> through<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.380> Zamboni

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
for trying to get it through the Zamboni

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.860 
for trying to get it through the Zamboni
opening<00:02:27.130> was<00:02:27.280> very<00:02:27.490> difficult<00:02:27.670> so<00:02:28.390> we<00:02:28.540> decided

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
opening was very difficult so we decided

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.390 
opening was very difficult so we decided
to<00:02:28.990> do<00:02:29.230> was<00:02:29.350> make<00:02:29.530> something<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.040> was<00:02:30.160> still

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
to do was make something that was still

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.670 
to do was make something that was still
as<00:02:30.610> wide<00:02:30.910> but<00:02:31.569> made<00:02:31.750> it<00:02:31.870> very<00:02:32.020> thin<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:32.650> that

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
as wide but made it very thin so that

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.110 
as wide but made it very thin so that
when<00:02:32.950> we<00:02:33.069> tried<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.400> bring<00:02:33.610> it<00:02:33.760> through<00:02:33.970> the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
when we tried to bring it through the

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.630 
when we tried to bring it through the
Zamboni

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
Zamboni

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.970 
Zamboni
it's<00:02:35.180> very<00:02:35.390> easy<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:35.900> actually<00:02:36.230> be<00:02:36.740> able<00:02:36.800> to

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
it's very easy and actually be able to

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.190 
it's very easy and actually be able to
make<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.280> wider<00:02:37.550> so<00:02:38.480> we<00:02:38.690> weren't<00:02:38.930> kind<00:02:39.050> of

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
make it wider so we weren't kind of

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.110 
make it wider so we weren't kind of
constrained<00:02:39.710> by<00:02:39.980> what<00:02:40.010> what<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.760> physical

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
constrained by what what the physical

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.060 
constrained by what what the physical
open<00:02:41.450> laws<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:42.110> actually<00:02:42.410> helped<00:02:42.680> us<00:02:42.800> to

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
open laws that actually helped us to

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.440 
open laws that actually helped us to
because<00:02:43.370> with<00:02:43.550> some<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.850> other<00:02:43.970> clubs<00:02:44.300> we

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
because with some of the other clubs we

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.090 
because with some of the other clubs we
started<00:02:44.840> building<00:02:44.960> set<00:02:45.350> pieces<00:02:45.800> and<00:02:45.980> things

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
started building set pieces and things

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.070 
started building set pieces and things
that<00:02:46.340> we<00:02:46.460> would<00:02:46.610> build<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.970> effects<00:02:47.390> into<00:02:47.570> but

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
that we would build the effects into but

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.870 
that we would build the effects into but
the<00:02:48.170> wolves<00:02:48.470> are<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.680> first<00:02:48.950> ones<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.370> do<00:02:49.670> that

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
the wolves are the first ones to do that

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.840 
the wolves are the first ones to do that
one<00:02:50.270> of<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.420> neatest<00:02:50.630> things<00:02:50.960> was<00:02:51.200> in<00:02:51.950> 2008

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
one of the neatest things was in 2008

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.190 
one of the neatest things was in 2008
when<00:02:52.910> we<00:02:53.060> raised<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.360> banner<00:02:53.510> for<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.870> Calder

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
when we raised the banner for the Calder

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.750 
when we raised the banner for the Calder
Cup<00:02:54.410> we've<00:02:54.770> had<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.250> privilege<00:02:55.400> of

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
Cup we've had the privilege of

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.940 
Cup we've had the privilege of
presenting<00:02:56.090> this<00:02:56.660> Cup<00:02:56.930> you<00:02:57.380> know<00:02:57.470> three<00:02:57.740> times

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
presenting this Cup you know three times

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.010 
presenting this Cup you know three times
before<00:02:58.520> this<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:58.940> it's<00:02:59.060> always<00:02:59.660> looking<00:02:59.810> for

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
before this and it's always looking for

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.570 
before this and it's always looking for
an<00:03:00.110> inventive<00:03:00.470> way<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.680> introduce<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.430> the

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
an inventive way to introduce it the

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.980 
an inventive way to introduce it the
colder<00:03:01.880> Cup<00:03:02.030> where<00:03:02.180> it<00:03:02.240> rose<00:03:02.420> up<00:03:02.450> out<00:03:02.720> of<00:03:02.780> the

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
colder Cup where it rose up out of the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.620 
colder Cup where it rose up out of the
thing<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:04.280> know<00:03:04.370> that<00:03:04.670> was<00:03:05.060> just<00:03:05.090> one<00:03:05.390> of

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
thing you know that was just one of

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.060 
thing you know that was just one of
those<00:03:05.750> moments<00:03:05.990> where<00:03:06.290> we<00:03:06.320> all<00:03:06.440> kind<00:03:06.770> of<00:03:06.830> sit

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
those moments where we all kind of sit

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.590 
those moments where we all kind of sit
there<00:03:07.100> and<00:03:07.310> it's<00:03:07.430> like<00:03:07.490> what<00:03:07.970> what<00:03:08.209> can<00:03:08.330> we<00:03:08.420> do

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
there and it's like what what can we do

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.590 
there and it's like what what can we do
that<00:03:08.810> hasn't<00:03:09.080> been<00:03:09.260> done<00:03:09.760> so<00:03:10.760> you<00:03:11.209> know<00:03:11.300> we<00:03:11.390> put

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
that hasn't been done so you know we put

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.570 
that hasn't been done so you know we put
co2<00:03:11.810> jets<00:03:12.350> into<00:03:12.530> it<00:03:12.739> so<00:03:12.890> it<00:03:12.980> looked<00:03:13.160> as<00:03:13.310> if<00:03:13.340> it

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
co2 jets into it so it looked as if it

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.090 
co2 jets into it so it looked as if it
was<00:03:13.670> being<00:03:13.850> lifted<00:03:14.150> up<00:03:14.480> out<00:03:14.690> of<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:16.010> know

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
was being lifted up out of it you know

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.580 
was being lifted up out of it you know
we<00:03:16.220> had<00:03:16.400> these<00:03:16.580> ribbon<00:03:17.239> lips<00:03:17.450> that<00:03:17.720> are<00:03:17.750> about

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
we had these ribbon lips that are about

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.990 
we had these ribbon lips that are about
an<00:03:18.739> 18<00:03:19.190> inch<00:03:19.370> high<00:03:21.130> platform<00:03:22.130> that<00:03:22.610> can<00:03:22.760> you<00:03:22.880> go

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
an 18 inch high platform that can you go

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.750 
an 18 inch high platform that can you go
up<00:03:23.180> 16<00:03:23.630> feet<00:03:23.870> in<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.050> air<00:03:24.080> it's<00:03:24.320> three<00:03:24.760> zipper

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
up 16 feet in the air it's three zipper

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.180 
up 16 feet in the air it's three zipper
kind<00:03:26.120> of<00:03:26.239> pieces<00:03:27.050> of<00:03:27.200> metal<00:03:27.500> that<00:03:27.680> come

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
kind of pieces of metal that come

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.920 
kind of pieces of metal that come
together<00:03:28.370> and<00:03:28.730> can<00:03:28.940> lift<00:03:29.330> up<00:03:29.510> about<00:03:29.720> 200

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
together and can lift up about 200

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.400 
together and can lift up about 200
pounds<00:03:30.290> so<00:03:30.950> it's<00:03:31.130> a<00:03:31.190> very<00:03:31.400> small<00:03:32.410> structure

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
pounds so it's a very small structure

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.470 
pounds so it's a very small structure
that<00:03:33.650> can<00:03:33.800> go<00:03:33.950> very<00:03:33.980> high<00:03:34.400> me<00:03:34.610> yet<00:03:34.790> so<00:03:35.030> we've

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
that can go very high me yet so we've

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.330 
that can go very high me yet so we've
stuck<00:03:35.750> it<00:03:35.870> into<00:03:36.050> a<00:03:36.080> box<00:03:36.380> but<00:03:36.680> some<00:03:36.860> logos<00:03:37.040> on

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
stuck it into a box but some logos on

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.590 
stuck it into a box but some logos on
the<00:03:37.430> outside<00:03:37.820> of<00:03:37.940> it<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:38.239> then<00:03:38.360> there<00:03:38.510> was

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
the outside of it and then there was

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.289 
the outside of it and then there was
magic<00:03:38.989> it<00:03:39.200> was<00:03:39.320> a<00:03:39.350> moment<00:03:40.060> typically<00:03:41.060> there's

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
magic it was a moment typically there's

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.509 
magic it was a moment typically there's
three<00:03:41.720> people<00:03:42.110> at<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.290> game<00:03:42.530> one<00:03:42.920> person<00:03:43.310> is<00:03:43.400> up

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
three people at a game one person is up

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.130 
three people at a game one person is up
with<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:43.760> laser<00:03:43.970> system<00:03:44.420> there's<00:03:44.660> one<00:03:44.900> person

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
with the laser system there's one person

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.380 
with the laser system there's one person
on<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.590> ice<00:03:45.739> that<00:03:46.070> handles<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.790> flames<00:03:47.120> and

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
on the ice that handles the flames and

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.060 
on the ice that handles the flames and
the<00:03:47.480> pyro<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:47.870> then<00:03:48.049> there's<00:03:48.230> one<00:03:48.410> operator<00:03:48.860> I

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
the pyro and then there's one operator I

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.670 
the pyro and then there's one operator I
mean<00:03:49.220> most<00:03:49.580> people<00:03:49.970> are<00:03:50.120> running<00:03:50.470> they'll<00:03:51.470> run

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
mean most people are running they'll run

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.820 
mean most people are running they'll run
lights<00:03:51.950> they'll<00:03:52.280> run<00:03:52.489> lasers<00:03:52.730> they'll<00:03:53.239> run

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
lights they'll run lasers they'll run

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.870 
lights they'll run lasers they'll run
pyro<00:03:55.209> whatever<00:03:56.209> on<00:03:56.570> on<00:03:57.580> three<00:03:58.580> different

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880
