00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:04.850
 if people today i have another peculiarity case like this you have 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.300
 already determined in those in the growing video seen and I've got the 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:11.809
 Crisis though they look closely they come from 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:12.709
 I see you 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.669
 Propst i because of Link and everything else you know is for me too 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:17.579
 a description 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.900
 underneath me he is sure that Alba is already in the middle of it down here 

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:23.030
 flash a bit 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.190
 known that he still flourishes from selection coach Blanc Stettner 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.039
 already open so it looks from the front it is only every Christian 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.319
 the Bundeswehr Caroline 

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:36.209
 No such a little engraved next, that's not all so smooth 

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:39.859
 Leathers and you look everywhere a bit like he has been kinked like that 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:43.559
 so it becomes so obvious that everything is real 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.639
 very very cool very very noble is also well processed when trying it 

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:51.519
 is from behind here is this binds them with this war went on 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:52.570
 that can do too 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.510
 No he is still such a rubber band whose function I unfortunately not yet 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.260
 could find out 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.330
 and standard 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.580
 It's best we make a new start now 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.760
 Just open it and it looks like this 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.380
 the iPad OS seventh startup 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.090
 the iPad percent are so to speak sandwiched I can Ottmar stuff 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.160
 undressed to show you that said 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.220
 that's all, it turned out to be a hit, and you see, they'll be 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.510
 packed over the edges, so to speak 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.250
 Cannes is here again 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.050
 So reach a Haiti 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.010
 January over 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.110
 and they have it too 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.850
 Planning was and already that is the one I steer in there rock solid 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.890
 Percent against nothing 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.830
 and 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.970
 I thought at the beginning of such a year is it comes to the beginning I thought that 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.610
 these parts here is the first highlight 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.420
 he just give it on the screen but then here 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.729
 the iPad may turn on then you can see that I think that's the rehearsal 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.060
 At the most minimal the slightly embarrassed but he takes all the people is so big 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.470
 Commander actually almost never that's why I do not place that at all 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.320
 when it is now it is really Guntrum if you look at that from the 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.530
 Page listed 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.790
 You can do everything a wonderful the kids that they are not completely casual 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.310
 and want this little 2 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.890
 and also doped collections on with speakers is also wonderfully soft 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.429
 Belly up here 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:18.429
 Koppelmann Warendorf live on the Baltic Sea 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:23.669
 Everything is still good to reach but that's not nice the only one that protects 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.479
 not only good but also really very practical here 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.869
 you know you can live the hard life so high so to speak 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:31.749
 and that can be here 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:35.549
 put it in and you have such a really amuse me anymore 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.439
 then there is always some alienation between manufacturers for that 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:41.919
 Movie is a hero 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.749
 there are many different voices 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.999
 Nobody is so straight we have now I think they are long overdue then too 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.699
 They help me to use it, because they use it a lot 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:54.199
 very good way "Wittig described the very very firmly very very well 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:56.200
 and that's why I'm happy 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.139
 perfect percent satisfied with this case because 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.830
 certainly very functional plus percent 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.869
 real or looks and percent 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:10.120
 it just has such a shit the Elbe man, for example, percent in the sun 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.460
 Bachmann bought a song sung damage Andersen a baby 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.519
 in good conscience 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:16.809
 we have like that 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:18.959
 So there is really very cool 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.209
 wanted to have with this realization also said I've got in the description 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.869
 I pretty much first Felix to the product directly and you still 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:31.709
 March so anxious they were right there could put the lyrics and 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.059
 we want the contact request you can then percent by the same 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:39.529
 Boxes put the price in the price then they will also clear 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:44.049
 and the exhaust gases I can owns the moment percent of my revision 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.730
 I do not have them there either 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.239
 all the time and swimming yes 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.900
 I can not say anything more Â»I wish you otherwise 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.709
 come already roof and have fun 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.539
 I do not call it that way out there, unfortunately I have today 

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:59.610
 to forget something 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.819
 because the people of ETEC points that have even percent 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.439
 something new is something else with stories writes life itself 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:11.389
 Astra as if everything was already here in black with a good start 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:12.989
 the Black Forest 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.789
 our client important but here just imagine us in the 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:17.719
 friends or 

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:21.709
 Rubber Arteaga coating with which we then also percent serves everything 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.780
 The design is pretty simple 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.440
 Ihringen around her was there so well and if already Werder Bremen in 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.130
 their book means you can use such key chains or something 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.639
 this is unfortunately annoying because Apple is 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:35.559
 spared 

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:38.300
 that's pretty loud and you're here at i 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.050
 Due to the system, then percent flickers always look that way 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.059
 You can also do them what I would recommend to anyone 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:48.779
 to and now you have just set here 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:51.699
 I turn the old one on and around 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.229
 then it could be easy with this pen but also just yours 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:56.889
 iPad operated 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.669
 whether you need such a ship is the question I think he is not different 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.339
 Today the IPO of the iPad is designed on like never before 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:07.439
 to be served only with the fingers but we still have such a pen 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.879
 want 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:08.680
 around 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.729
 I just looked at it and it works 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.189
 in principle, relatively good but it is quite limited because you have to 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:17.050
 on 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.410
 always press relatively firm which starts for example Focus Online 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.540
 I have to spend a lot of time on it. Hermann I do not want to say but 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.620
 but it's not so easy to knock on it 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.370
 a little more about suffering and so each of them has to 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.880
 Percent, touch a few dollars here 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.980
 this has ever happened here at all that is relatively well 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.529
 to become 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:42.679
 But where really so a little percent of what is what you do not do so well 

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:44.950
 Can Apple because you just go to safari 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.770
 if you want to zoom somewhere, for example 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.379
 that only works over twice as nice 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:53.989
 and percent are also activated in the one you want in which you do not have 

00:05:53.989 --> 00:05:58.369
 want or so and who just gets this in and out with two fingers and that is 

00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:00.210
 just not possible in this pen 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.320
 and around 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.630
 yes, I think rather that you do not need such a piece but someone 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.650
 percent 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.080
 who still wants to have the Kander also come on the side of normal yes 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.729
 was also everything I wanted to say here again because I just in 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.590
 my main school you forgot and yes thank you for Justin 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.980
 Grugel here for this extension and then nothing remains 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.260
 if look and nothing more to say and fro
