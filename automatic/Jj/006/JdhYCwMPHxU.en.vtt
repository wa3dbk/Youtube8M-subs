00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
a flip-flop on the subject I guess

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.550 
a flip-flop on the subject I guess
looking<00:01:33.390> at<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.840> now<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.579> only<00:01:35.579> spent<00:01:36.000> 56<00:01:36.869> hours

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
looking at it now I only spent 56 hours

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.109 
looking at it now I only spent 56 hours
of<00:01:37.799> my<00:01:37.890> time<00:01:38.450> no<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.630> cost<00:01:39.869> me<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> total<00:01:40.350> of

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
of my time no it cost me a total of

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.190 
of my time no it cost me a total of
twenty-two<00:01:42.119> dollars<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.780> now<00:01:42.869> I'm<00:01:42.990> going<00:01:43.140> to

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
twenty-two dollars and now I'm going to

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:51.410 
twenty-two dollars and now I'm going to
get<00:01:43.350> back<00:01:43.530> 150<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.390> guess<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:50.180> guess<00:01:51.180> that's

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
get back 150 so I guess I guess that's

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.190 
get back 150 so I guess I guess that's
not<00:01:51.600> too<00:01:51.659> bad<00:01:52.220> you<00:01:53.220> know<00:01:56.479> 45<00:01:57.479> 50<00:01:57.960> would<00:01:58.079> have

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
not too bad you know 45 50 would have

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.260 
not too bad you know 45 50 would have
been<00:01:58.350> good<00:01:58.560> back<00:01:58.799> then<00:01:59.100> course<00:01:59.610> hundred<00:01:59.969> fifty

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
been good back then course hundred fifty

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.090 
been good back then course hundred fifty
now<00:02:00.450> seems<00:02:00.899> pretty<00:02:01.140> good<00:02:01.409> but

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
now seems pretty good but

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.830 
now seems pretty good but
it<00:02:02.400> has<00:02:02.520> taken<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:03.030> couple<00:02:03.210> months<00:02:03.479> it's<00:02:03.780> been

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
it has taken a couple months it's been

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.270 
it has taken a couple months it's been
sitting<00:02:04.140> around<00:02:04.290> for<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.740> while<00:02:06.979> so<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.009> guess

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
sitting around for a while so I guess

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.449 
sitting around for a while so I guess
that's<00:02:08.429> two<00:02:08.670> schools<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.149> thought<00:02:09.319> now

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
that's two schools of thought now

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.760 
that's two schools of thought now
whatever<00:02:11.459> your<00:02:11.640> preference<00:02:11.880> is<00:02:12.300> if<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.590> could

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
whatever your preference is if you could

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.820 
whatever your preference is if you could
wait<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.840> guess<00:02:15.840> it's<00:02:16.050> not<00:02:16.200> too<00:02:16.440> bad<00:02:18.770> let<00:02:19.770> me

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
wait I guess it's not too bad let me

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.340 
wait I guess it's not too bad let me
know<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.100> think
