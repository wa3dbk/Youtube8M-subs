even<00:00:22.260> with<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.500> cheaper<00:00:22.890> case<00:00:23.100> like<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.519> one

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
even with the cheaper case like this one

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.410 
even with the cheaper case like this one
this<00:00:23.910> retails<00:00:24.359> for<00:00:24.859> 2495<00:00:26.060> comes<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.210> several

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
this retails for 2495 comes in several

hopefully<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.360> can<00:00:33.510> see<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.780> there<00:00:34.940> so<00:00:35.940> it's

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
hopefully you can see that there so it's

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.670 
hopefully you can see that there so it's
going<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.239> look<00:00:36.300> darker<00:00:36.630> with<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.200> phone<00:00:37.410> on

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
going to look darker with the phone on

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.590 
going to look darker with the phone on
with<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.460> phone<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.969> you'll<00:00:39.090> see<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.300> here

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
with the phone and you'll see that here

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.810 
with the phone and you'll see that here
in<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.750> second<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.950> what<00:00:41.129> they<00:00:41.280> call<00:00:41.460> their

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
in a second this is what they call their

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.959 
in a second this is what they call their
NGP<00:00:42.780> material<00:00:43.440> its<00:00:43.649> next<00:00:44.010> generation<00:00:44.040> polymer

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
NGP material its next generation polymer

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.840 
NGP material its next generation polymer
and<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.989> good<00:00:46.800> polymer<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.700> it's

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
and it's a good polymer in that it's

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.670 
and it's a good polymer in that it's
stiff<00:00:48.570> enough<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:49.110> it's<00:00:49.260> going<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.500> protect

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
stiff enough that it's going to protect

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.119 
stiff enough that it's going to protect
it<00:00:50.070> but<00:00:50.309> not<00:00:51.440> you<00:00:52.440> know<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.710> still<00:00:52.920> has<00:00:53.100> a

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
it but not you know it still has a

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.209 
it but not you know it still has a
little<00:00:53.280> bit<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.850> polymer<00:00:54.690> feel<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.350> it's

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
little bit of a polymer feel to it it's

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.180 
little bit of a polymer feel to it it's
going<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.399> give<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.670> good<00:00:56.820> protection<00:00:58.190> simple

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
going to give it good protection simple

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.529 
going to give it good protection simple
here<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.640> see<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.910> kind<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.180> has<00:01:00.329> this

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
here you can see it kind of has this

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.990 
here you can see it kind of has this
these<00:01:01.199> little<00:01:01.530> squares<00:01:01.920> or<00:01:02.370> rectangles<00:01:02.399> or

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
these little squares or rectangles or

the<00:01:05.850> bottom<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> case<00:01:06.659> all<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> cases<00:01:07.320> are

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
the bottom of the case all the cases are

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.950 
the bottom of the case all the cases are
like<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.159> anyway<00:01:09.060> I'll<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.390> throw<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.840> on

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
like that anyway I'll just throw it on

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.149 
like that anyway I'll just throw it on
the<00:01:10.140> iphone<00:01:10.260> 5<00:01:11.180> so<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> put<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.890> works<00:01:13.890> best

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
the iphone 5 so to put it on works best

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.910 
the iphone 5 so to put it on works best
to<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.520> get<00:01:14.729> one<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.030> corners<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.540> first

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
to just get one of the corners in first

to just get one of the corners in first
there<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.009> can<00:01:17.070> see<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.460> pops<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.060> nicely

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
there you can see it just pops on nicely

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.760 
there you can see it just pops on nicely
it's<00:01:19.229> pretty<00:01:19.439> slim<00:01:19.799> which<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.250> great<00:01:21.619> you<00:01:22.619> can

and gives you all your ports access

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.660 
and gives you all your ports access
there<00:01:43.470> everything's<00:01:43.979> good<00:01:44.399> as<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.720> incipio

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
there everything's good as the incipio

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.810 
there everything's good as the incipio
logo<00:01:47.670> there<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.960> our<00:01:48.990> simple<00:01:49.500> case<00:01:49.820> 2495
