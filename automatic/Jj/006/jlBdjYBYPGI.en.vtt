00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
your head here I have the power

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.219 
your head here I have the power
generator<00:00:58.220> hood<00:00:58.489> which<00:00:58.790> you<00:00:58.970> can<00:00:59.150> get<00:00:59.390> from

system

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.039 
system
there<00:01:03.589> you<00:01:03.710> go<00:01:03.860> but<00:01:04.580> also<00:01:04.760> guys<00:01:05.180> make<00:01:05.510> sure<00:01:05.810> it

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
there you go but also guys make sure it

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.289

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
is set to a Roy because this is the

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.390 
is set to a Roy because this is the
heroic<00:01:08.810> version<00:01:09.200> not<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:09.860> normal<00:01:10.130> this<00:01:10.250> is

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
heroic version not the normal this is

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.380 
heroic version not the normal this is
the<00:01:10.549> abroke<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.210> red<00:01:11.450> version<00:01:11.810> okay<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:12.799> the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
the abroke the red version okay so the

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.850 
the abroke the red version okay so the
motion<00:01:14.390> defense<00:01:15.020> system<00:01:15.320> drops<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.680> power

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
motion defense system drops the power

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.920 
motion defense system drops the power
generator<00:01:16.280> hood<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:16.640> so<00:01:16.880> does<00:01:17.119> nefarious<00:01:17.689> end

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
generator hood and so does nefarious end

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.690 
generator hood and so does nefarious end
who<00:01:18.140> drops<00:01:18.469> the<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:20.570> helmet<00:01:21.159> but<00:01:22.159> there<00:01:22.610> are

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.809 
which sucks quite much if you ask me so
what<00:02:03.469> I<00:02:03.979> what<00:02:04.549> I<00:02:04.579> did<00:02:04.939> then<00:02:05.869> is<00:02:06.229> that<00:02:06.530> I

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
what I what I did then is that I

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.050 
what I what I did then is that I
basically<00:02:07.819> um<00:02:08.649> now<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:09.679> have<00:02:10.160> I<00:02:10.369> don't<00:02:10.700> display

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
basically um now I have I don't display

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.390 
basically um now I have I don't display
it<00:02:11.200> but<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.230> think<00:02:12.500> it<00:02:12.590> looks<00:02:12.770> horrible<00:02:13.190> without

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400

it but I think it looks horrible without
a<00:02:13.460> close<00:02:13.819> so<00:02:14.090> probably<00:02:14.360> gonna<00:02:14.450> put<00:02:14.630> it<00:02:14.750> on

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840

a close so probably gonna put it on
later<00:02:15.050> on<00:02:15.290> but<00:02:16.069> if<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:17.090> don't<00:02:17.360> like<00:02:17.750> having<00:02:18.260> no
