done<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.069> video<00:03:02.340> on<00:03:02.519> this<00:03:02.850> i'd<00:03:03.390> say<00:03:03.630> probably<00:03:03.660> a

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
done a video on this i'd say probably a

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.020 
done a video on this i'd say probably a
month<00:03:04.350> ago<00:03:04.560> but<00:03:05.160> i<00:03:05.340> have<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.640> lot<00:03:05.819> more

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
month ago but i have a lot more

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.880 
month ago but i have a lot more
different<00:03:06.420> views<00:03:06.630> i<00:03:06.780> think<00:03:07.049> now<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.440> the

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
different views i think now and the

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.100 
different views i think now and the
reason<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.310> say<00:03:08.340> this<00:03:08.489> is<00:03:08.670> because<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.239> didn't

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
reason I say this is because I didn't

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.840 
reason I say this is because I didn't
really<00:03:10.230> give<00:03:10.440> cold<00:03:10.799> duty<00:03:11.100> ghosts<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.489> chance

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
really give cold duty ghosts the chance

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.100 
really give cold duty ghosts the chance
I<00:03:12.030> guess<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.299> could<00:03:12.420> say<00:03:12.540> when<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.750> did<00:03:12.989> that

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
I guess you could say when I did that

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.350 
I guess you could say when I did that
comparison<00:03:13.650> video<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.400> right<00:03:14.880> now<00:03:14.910> let<00:03:15.180> me<00:03:15.209> get

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
comparison video so right now let me get

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.539 
comparison video so right now let me get
right<00:03:15.480> down<00:03:15.540> into<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:16.080> so<00:03:16.230> obviously<00:03:16.769> call<00:03:17.459> of

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
right down into it so obviously call of

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.060 
right down into it so obviously call of
duty<00:03:17.610> black<00:03:17.790> ops<00:03:18.180> 2<00:03:18.480> by<00:03:19.019> far<00:03:19.320> I<00:03:19.350> think<00:03:19.560> was<00:03:20.040> the

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
duty black ops 2 by far I think was the

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.220 
duty black ops 2 by far I think was the
best<00:03:20.459> Call<00:03:20.820> of<00:03:20.850> Duty<00:03:21.180> game<00:03:21.359> there<00:03:21.540> was<00:03:21.750> I'm

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
best Call of Duty game there was I'm

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.560 
best Call of Duty game there was I'm
saying<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.739> only<00:03:22.950> because<00:03:23.670> of<00:03:23.880> how<00:03:24.269> much

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
saying that only because of how much

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.960 
saying that only because of how much
exposure<00:03:25.109> brought<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:26.070> so<00:03:26.310> many<00:03:26.459> communities

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
exposure brought to so many communities

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.720 
exposure brought to so many communities
pub<00:03:27.239> stomping<00:03:27.690> wise<00:03:27.890> competitive<00:03:28.890> I<00:03:29.070> mean<00:03:29.579> it

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
pub stomping wise competitive I mean it

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.030 
pub stomping wise competitive I mean it
brought<00:03:30.030> so<00:03:30.060> much<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.079> it<00:03:31.260> really<00:03:31.530> didn't

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
brought so much to it it really didn't

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.650 
brought so much to it it really didn't
help<00:03:32.070> out<00:03:32.310> sniping<00:03:32.850> community<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:33.269> guess<00:03:33.450> too

much<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:34.019> think<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:34.500> found<00:03:34.680> more<00:03:34.950> talent<00:03:35.549> and

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
much I think it found more talent and

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.009 
much I think it found more talent and
sniping<00:03:36.060> community<00:03:36.510> because<00:03:36.720> i'm<00:03:36.870> pretty

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
sniping community because i'm pretty

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.680 
sniping community because i'm pretty
sure<00:03:37.170> took<00:03:37.470> 20<00:03:38.250> times<00:03:38.489> more<00:03:38.820> skill<00:03:39.239> to<00:03:39.450> snipe

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
sure took 20 times more skill to snipe

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.680 
sure took 20 times more skill to snipe
and<00:03:40.109> black<00:03:40.440> ops<00:03:40.709> 2<00:03:40.950> than<00:03:41.190> it<00:03:41.310> did<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:42.209> then<00:03:42.570> it

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
and black ops 2 than it did and then it

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.199 
and black ops 2 than it did and then it
doesn't<00:03:42.900> ghost<00:03:43.290> in<00:03:43.440> my<00:03:43.470> opinion<00:03:43.890> or<00:03:44.250> in<00:03:44.790> modern

doesn't ghost in my opinion or in modern
warfare<00:03:45.239> 3<00:03:45.560> obviously<00:03:46.560> modern<00:03:47.100> warfare

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
warfare 3 obviously modern warfare

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.610 
warfare 3 obviously modern warfare
series<00:03:47.459> are<00:03:48.150> really<00:03:48.600> easy<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:49.019> snipe<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.500> in

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
series are really easy to snipe and in

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.979 
series are really easy to snipe and in
my<00:03:49.739> opinion<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:50.489> does<00:03:50.940> I<00:03:51.209> mean<00:03:51.600> modern<00:03:51.840> warfare

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
my opinion it does I mean modern warfare

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.289 
my opinion it does I mean modern warfare
2<00:03:52.290> was<00:03:52.500> beyond<00:03:52.890> that<00:03:53.190> but<00:03:53.400> anyways<00:03:53.940> getting<00:03:54.209> on

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
2 was beyond that but anyways getting on

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.630 
2 was beyond that but anyways getting on
to<00:03:54.450> this<00:03:54.570> point<00:03:54.840> of<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.260> comparison<00:03:55.920> without

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
to this point of the comparison without

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.180 
to this point of the comparison without
a<00:03:56.670> doubt<00:03:56.760> I<00:03:57.209> think<00:03:57.480> black<00:03:57.780> ops<00:03:58.079> 2<00:03:58.410> was<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:59.010> best

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
a doubt I think black ops 2 was the best

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.610 
a doubt I think black ops 2 was the best

duty ghosts is a lot more successful in
my<00:04:55.320> opinion<00:04:55.590> do<00:04:55.889> so<00:04:56.310> then<00:04:56.460> bring<00:04:56.699> so<00:04:57.090> much<00:04:57.270> DLC

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
my opinion do so then bring so much DLC

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.480 
my opinion do so then bring so much DLC
into<00:04:58.110> it<00:04:58.229> and<00:04:58.380> that's<00:04:58.770> how<00:04:58.949> I<00:04:58.979> think<00:04:59.310> this<00:04:59.430> is

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
into it and that's how I think this is

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.490 
into it and that's how I think this is
going<00:04:59.820> to<00:04:59.910> keep<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.150> franchise<00:05:00.570> live<00:05:00.960> if<00:05:01.470> they

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
going to keep the franchise live if they

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.770 
going to keep the franchise live if they
constantly<00:05:02.250> bring<00:05:02.580> out<00:05:02.699> this<00:05:02.850> DLC<00:05:03.330> like<00:05:03.539> new

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
weapons with the Maverick and the repair

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.250 
weapons with the Maverick and the repair
and<00:05:05.550> honestly<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.300> Ripper<00:05:06.570> is<00:05:06.600> the<00:05:06.750> absolute

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
and honestly the Ripper is the absolute

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.320 
and honestly the Ripper is the absolute
tank<00:05:07.590> then<00:05:08.070> this<00:05:08.220> game<00:05:08.430> will<00:05:08.610> be<00:05:08.820> one<00:05:09.150> of<00:05:09.180> the

tank then this game will be one of the

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.790 
tank then this game will be one of the
best<00:05:09.449> of<00:05:09.630> all<00:05:09.750> time<00:05:09.960> and<00:05:10.199> the<00:05:10.320> reason<00:05:10.650> why<00:05:10.770> I

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
best of all time and the reason why I

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.469 
best of all time and the reason why I
say<00:05:11.100> that<00:05:11.310> it's<00:05:11.699> because<00:05:11.880> it<00:05:12.000> constantly

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
say that it's because it constantly

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.719 
say that it's because it constantly
keeps<00:05:12.810> up<00:05:13.050> it<00:05:13.410> constantly<00:05:13.889> keeps<00:05:14.130> a<00:05:14.250> person<00:05:14.280> I
