00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
point using i mean there is a point in

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.289 
point using i mean there is a point in
using<00:03:42.590> shepherd<00:03:43.130> possibility<00:03:43.790> because<00:03:44.120> then

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
using shepherd possibility because then

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.410 
using shepherd possibility because then
I<00:03:44.540> kill<00:03:45.380> him<00:03:45.470> quicker<00:03:45.890> because<00:03:46.850> instead<00:03:47.360> of

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
I kill him quicker because instead of

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.030 
I kill him quicker because instead of
doing<00:03:47.630> one<00:03:47.810> damage<00:03:48.080> it<00:03:48.200> woulda<00:03:48.320> done<00:03:48.440> for<00:03:48.739> so

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
doing one damage it woulda done for so

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.030 
doing one damage it woulda done for so
he'd<00:03:49.310> be<00:03:49.340> at<00:03:50.200> three<00:03:51.200> less<00:03:51.380> life<00:03:51.650> than<00:03:51.920> i<00:03:51.980> can

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
he'd be at three less life than i can

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.620 
he'd be at three less life than i can
actually<00:03:52.640> i<00:03:52.820> think<00:03:52.850> i<00:03:53.060> could<00:03:53.209> still<00:03:53.360> kill<00:03:53.540> him
