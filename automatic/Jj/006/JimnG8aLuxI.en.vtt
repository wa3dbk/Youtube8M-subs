00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
there's a Philips screw in here you've

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.980 
there's a Philips screw in here you've
got<00:01:25.640> Philips<00:01:26.030> number<00:01:26.299> one<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:26.689> Philips

got Philips number one and Philips

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.419 
got Philips number one and Philips
number<00:01:27.229> two<00:01:27.380> for<00:01:27.590> this<00:01:27.740> one<00:01:27.799> you<00:01:28.070> always<00:01:28.189> want

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
number two for this one you always want

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:31.590 
number two for this one you always want
to<00:01:28.490> use<00:01:28.640> a<00:01:28.670> number<00:01:29.000> two<00:01:29.030> is<00:01:29.330> harder<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:30.140> string

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
to use a number two is harder to string

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.169 
to use a number two is harder to string
all<00:01:32.600> you're<00:01:32.780> gonna<00:01:32.899> do<00:01:33.170> is<00:01:33.520> put<00:01:34.520> it<00:01:34.579> in<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:34.939> put

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
all you're gonna do is put it in and put

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.219 
all you're gonna do is put it in and put
some<00:01:35.210> hard<00:01:36.049> pressure<00:01:37.600> push<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:38.780> down<00:01:38.960> and

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
some hard pressure push it down and

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.469 
some hard pressure push it down and
twist<00:01:39.619> it<00:01:39.799> and<00:01:39.829> it<00:01:40.100> should<00:01:40.310> come<00:01:40.610> out<00:01:40.640> with<00:01:41.090> not

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
twist it and it should come out with not

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.270 
twist it and it should come out with not
a<00:01:41.539> problem

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.610 

now<00:01:46.850> after<00:01:47.180> you<00:01:47.510> remove<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.780> screw<00:01:48.170> just

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
now after you remove the screw just

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.500 
now after you remove the screw just
gotta<00:01:48.920> move<00:01:49.160> aside<00:01:49.490> aside<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:50.060> break<00:01:50.330> because

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
gotta move aside aside to break because

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.720 
gotta move aside aside to break because
sometimes<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.260> rubber<00:01:51.560> seal<00:01:52.010> sticks<00:01:52.550> into

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
sometimes the rubber seal sticks into

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.270 
sometimes the rubber seal sticks into
the<00:01:52.820> intake<00:01:53.180> manifold<00:01:53.600> just<00:01:54.410> gotta

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
the intake manifold just gotta

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.940 
the intake manifold just gotta
jiggle<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.480> she'll<00:01:58.290> come<00:01:58.560> right<00:01:58.890> out

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
jiggle it and she'll come right out

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.080 
jiggle it and she'll come right out
another<00:01:59.340> problem<00:01:59.850> now<00:02:00.290> this<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.410> the<00:02:01.530> hon<00:02:01.710> data

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
another problem now this is the hon data

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.600 
another problem now this is the hon data
for<00:02:03.090> my<00:02:03.270> map<00:02:03.480> sensor<00:02:03.800> sometimes<00:02:04.800> he<00:02:05.220> helps<00:02:05.490> if

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
for my map sensor sometimes he helps if

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.090 
for my map sensor sometimes he helps if
you<00:02:05.730> put<00:02:05.760> some<00:02:06.090> Lube<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.690> it<00:02:06.870> sometimes<00:02:07.530> you

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
you put some Lube in it sometimes you

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.690 
you put some Lube in it sometimes you
know<00:02:08.220> if<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.090> work<00:02:09.300> right<00:02:09.540> if<00:02:09.869> you're<00:02:10.050> going

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
know if you work right if you're going

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.680 
know if you work right if you're going
same<00:02:11.700> process

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.070 

and<00:02:16.960> that's<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.530> it's<00:02:18.460> it<00:02:18.810> after<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:19.960> you

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
and that's it it's it after that you

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.510 
and that's it it's it after that you
just<00:02:20.200> put<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.530> filler<00:02:20.770> screwdriver<00:02:21.190> back<00:02:21.310> in

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
just put the filler screwdriver back in

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:31.460 
just put the filler screwdriver back in
make<00:02:22.000> sure<00:02:22.030> it's<00:02:22.330> tight<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:23.230> plug<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.710> again

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.699 

is<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.740> recording

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.250 

it's<00:02:35.010> per<00:02:35.220> plot<00:02:35.519> with<00:02:35.909> the<00:02:36.080> indicators<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.230> the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
it's per plot with the indicators in the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.449 
it's per plot with the indicators in the
village<00:02:39.379> to<00:02:40.379> get<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.769> Spartans<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.310> gotta

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
village to get to the Spartans you gotta

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.610 
village to get to the Spartans you gotta
go<00:02:41.640> this<00:02:41.849> four<00:02:42.150> millimeter<00:02:42.659> bolts<00:02:43.049> to<00:02:43.349> get<00:02:43.500> to

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
go this four millimeter bolts to get to

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.559 
go this four millimeter bolts to get to
this<00:02:43.739> cover<00:02:44.040> on<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.459> knee<00:02:44.640> will<00:02:44.879> be<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.150> coils

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
this cover on the knee will be the coils

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.750 
this cover on the knee will be the coils
which<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.049> got<00:02:46.170> on<00:02:46.319> plot<00:02:46.620> on<00:02:46.799> bolt<00:02:47.099> and<00:02:47.610> the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
which you got on plot on bolt and the

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.880 
which you got on plot on bolt and the
sparkles<00:02:48.299> are<00:02:48.480> underneath

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.610 

now<00:02:53.430> after<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.060> take<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.360> plastic<00:02:54.810> core<00:02:55.020> out

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
now after you take the plastic core out

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.060 
now after you take the plastic core out
there's<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.160> four<00:02:56.400> coils<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:58.590> gotta<00:02:58.800> loosen

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
there's the four coils you gotta loosen

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.870 
there's the four coils you gotta loosen
the<00:02:59.250> bolts<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:01.110> pull<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.160> coil<00:03:02.370> soft<00:03:02.700> after

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
the bolts and pull the coil soft after

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.580 
the bolts and pull the coil soft after
you<00:03:03.180> pull<00:03:03.360> them<00:03:03.450> up<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.720> can<00:03:03.900> run<00:03:04.050> plug<00:03:04.290> in<00:03:04.440> and

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
you pull them up you can run plug in and

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.580 
you pull them up you can run plug in and
take<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.070> coils<00:03:05.460> and

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.970 

for<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.220> coil<00:03:11.430> out<00:03:11.550> young<00:03:12.540> plug<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:12.990> and<00:03:13.200> you

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
for the coil out young plug it and you

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.600 
for the coil out young plug it and you
remove

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.220 

we're<00:03:18.610> gonna<00:03:18.760> get<00:03:18.939> the<00:03:19.060> right<00:03:19.269> spark<00:03:19.989> plug

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
we're gonna get the right spark plug

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.589 
we're gonna get the right spark plug
socket<00:03:20.370> remove<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.700> Sparkletts<00:03:22.180> out<00:03:22.390> of<00:03:22.510> it

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
socket remove the Sparkletts out of it

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.600 
socket remove the Sparkletts out of it
make<00:03:22.810> sure<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:23.019> note<00:03:23.349> dirt<00:03:23.620> goes<00:03:23.860> inside<00:03:24.430> the

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
make sure the note dirt goes inside the

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:32.940 
make sure the note dirt goes inside the
hole<00:03:26.159> replace<00:03:27.159> it<00:03:27.250> with<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.370> new<00:03:27.549> one

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.550 

replaced<00:03:33.550> with<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.760> new<00:03:33.910> spark<00:03:34.240> plugs

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
replaced with the new spark plugs

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.620 
replaced with the new spark plugs
usually<00:03:35.560> we<00:03:35.680> don't<00:03:35.890> get<00:03:36.069> them<00:03:36.280> we<00:03:37.030> haven't<00:03:37.300> had

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
usually we don't get them we haven't had

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.190 
usually we don't get them we haven't had
any<00:03:38.020> problem<00:03:38.680> with<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:39.550> gap

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
any problem with the gap

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.190 
any problem with the gap
comes<00:03:41.680> with<00:03:42.210> from<00:03:43.210> fight<00:03:43.450> run<00:03:43.900> the

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
comes with from fight run the

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.270 
comes with from fight run the
manufacturer<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:46.410> then<00:03:47.410> you<00:03:47.590> got<00:03:47.740> a<00:03:47.770> torque

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
manufacturer and then you got a torque

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.580 
manufacturer and then you got a torque
the<00:03:48.490> spark<00:03:48.790> plugs<00:03:49.060> to<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:49.870> specific<00:03:50.380> torque

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590
