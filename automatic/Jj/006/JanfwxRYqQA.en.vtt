00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.810 
even first a week and doors and doors
pretty<00:01:19.770> bad<00:01:19.979> -<00:01:22.160> nothing<00:01:23.160> eyes<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.490> see<00:01:23.640> that

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
pretty bad - nothing eyes can see that

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.760 
pretty bad - nothing eyes can see that
or<00:01:23.940> not<00:01:26.030> but

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.499 

yeah<00:01:30.340> it's<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.759> rough<00:01:30.970> one

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.830 

so<00:01:34.140> anyway<00:01:34.789> we'll<00:01:35.789> make<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:35.969> look<00:01:36.180> better<00:01:36.420> I'll

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
so anyway we'll make it look better I'll

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.149 
so anyway we'll make it look better I'll
bet<00:01:38.060> it<00:01:39.060> may<00:01:39.210> not<00:01:39.360> be<00:01:39.539> perfect<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.079> it'll<00:01:41.070> be

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
bet it may not be perfect but it'll be

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.440 
bet it may not be perfect but it'll be
better<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:42.240> that's<00:01:43.229> what<00:01:43.350> counts

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
better and that's what counts

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
better and that's what counts
so<00:01:47.149> that's<00:01:48.149> where<00:01:48.360> we're<00:01:48.539> at<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.719> this<00:01:49.049> pickup

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.390 
I just hammered that pinion shaft nut on
with<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.640> impact<00:02:09.479> wrench<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.229> spun<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.009> with<00:02:11.220> my

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
with a impact wrench and spun it with my

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.170 
with a impact wrench and spun it with my
hand<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.849> felt<00:02:12.150> like<00:02:12.299> I<00:02:12.329> had<00:02:12.569> about<00:02:12.750> 20<00:02:12.959> 25

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
hand and felt like I had about 20 25

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.640 
hand and felt like I had about 20 25
inch<00:02:15.180> pounds<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.840> torque<00:02:15.989> on<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.349> when<00:02:16.530> it

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
inch pounds of torque on it when it

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.740 
inch pounds of torque on it when it
turned<00:02:16.890> opinion<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:17.579> I'm<00:02:18.030> calling<00:02:18.329> that<00:02:18.450> good

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
turned opinion so I'm calling that good

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.600

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
goes smooth down the road and that's all

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.350 
goes smooth down the road and that's all
matters<00:02:26.069> so<00:02:26.819> that's<00:02:26.970> where<00:02:27.150> we're<00:02:27.269> at<00:02:27.299> on

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360
