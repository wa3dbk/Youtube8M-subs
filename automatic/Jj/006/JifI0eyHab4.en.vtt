00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
I guess it's not really easy with the

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.919 
I guess it's not really easy with the
white<00:00:14.639> midsole<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.240> white<00:00:15.389> swooshes<00:00:15.780> and

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
white midsole and the white swooshes and

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.019 
white midsole and the white swooshes and

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
accents and stuff like that but but I

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.670 
accents and stuff like that but but I
could<00:00:18.150> see<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.390> know<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:18.630> like<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.900> laser

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
could see you know it's like the laser

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.060 
could see you know it's like the laser
crimson<00:00:20.100> collar<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.609> small<00:00:21.240> accents<00:00:21.830> so<00:00:22.830> it

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
crimson collar and small accents so it

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.679 
crimson collar and small accents so it
kind<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.310> gives<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:24.150> sort<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.480> easy

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689

esque<00:00:24.930> feel<00:00:25.289> if<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:26.010> will<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.460> also<00:00:26.820> have<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
esque feel if you will I also have the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.919 
esque feel if you will I also have the
the<00:00:28.289> Foamposites<00:00:28.890> here<00:00:29.220> for<00:00:29.400> comparison

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
the Foamposites here for comparison

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.020 
the Foamposites here for comparison
because<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.410> colorway<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.920> both<00:00:32.759> laser

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
because the colorway is both laser

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.970 
because the colorway is both laser
crimson<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.540> both<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.870> them<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.170> from<00:00:34.860> a

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
crimson on both of them so from a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.040 
crimson on both of them so from a
distance<00:00:35.100> they<00:00:35.399> look<00:00:35.430> about<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.420> same<00:00:36.690> up

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
distance they look about the same up

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.080 
distance they look about the same up
close<00:00:37.380> they<00:00:38.100> looked<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.430> little<00:00:38.460> bit<00:00:38.760> different

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
close they looked a little bit different

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.869 
close they looked a little bit different
but<00:00:39.210> only<00:00:39.390> because<00:00:39.890> I'll<00:00:40.890> try<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.129> focus<00:00:41.579> in

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
but only because I'll try to focus in

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.170 
but only because I'll try to focus in
here<00:00:42.059> if<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.239> can<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:43.379> laser<00:00:43.890> crimson<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
here if I can the laser crimson on the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.350 
here if I can the laser crimson on the
Kobe's<00:00:45.539> actually<00:00:45.840> looked<00:00:45.989> more<00:00:46.140> pink<00:00:47.360> at

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
Kobe's actually looked more pink at

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.100 
Kobe's actually looked more pink at
least<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.660> my<00:00:48.780> eyes<00:00:48.930> maybe<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:49.680> sliding<00:00:50.160> here

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
least in my eyes maybe just sliding here

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.689 
least in my eyes maybe just sliding here
but<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:52.530> it's<00:00:52.739> also<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.520> like<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
but but it's also that this is like a

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.900 
but but it's also that this is like a
mesh<00:00:54.000> liner<00:00:54.989> versus<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.039> kind<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.670> I

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
mesh liner versus just this kind of I

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.660 
mesh liner versus just this kind of I
don't<00:00:57.719> want<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.020> say<00:00:58.170> nylon<00:00:58.620> liner<00:00:59.160> but<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
don't want to say nylon liner but the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.689 
don't want to say nylon liner but the
line<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.120> liner<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.480> different<00:01:01.309> but<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.489> one

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
line the liner is different but this one

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.399 
line the liner is different but this one
looks<00:01:02.850> more<00:01:02.910> pinkish<00:01:03.329> than<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:04.199> one<00:01:04.379> does

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
looks more pinkish than this one does

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.250 
looks more pinkish than this one does
