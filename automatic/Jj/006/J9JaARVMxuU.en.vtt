00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.520
 very interesting and course you are 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.050
 held at the Ligurian final on the wasp 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.910
 velvet na because it was possible 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.750
 fully understand the complexity 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.639
 of the problem 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.980
 after the excellent classification of the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.080
 you are professor marco cardinal 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.750
 touched on practical aspects of contrast a 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.760
 this insect with Fabrizio Zani the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.510
 rest having tina is an alien insect 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.510
 very very particular 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:33.930
 ok if taken in the full that are there 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.390
 really bad 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.700
 a very aggressive insect equipped with 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.470
 a conspicuous amount of poison and a 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.750
 sting that requires protection 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.240
 greater than what was used 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.550
 with bees 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.190
 the media of this particular Calabrian 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.960
 nation generally positioned at the top 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.320
 to high plants and often in places 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.320
 inaccessible 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.910
 absolutely right 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.640
 agree 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.620
 then 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.510
 we were able to attend the 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.580
 destruction of a nest thanks to 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.580
 collaboration with the fire brigade 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.990
 but it doesn't even change the park we say everything 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.980
 the fight this insect must be based 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.560
 on many actions from monitoring to 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.239
 trap to the identification of myths 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.340
 and their destruction 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.770
 once it can be accomplished only 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.300
 with an excellent organization that with the 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.430
 full involvement of all 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.720
 beekeepers 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.239
 but probably the methods and the 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.060
 tools used so far must 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.760
 being radically revised these is 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.890
 in fact they were borrowed from the note to the 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.870
 hornet of the Italian but which has all 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:11.150
 the features and be it for 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.500
 dangerousness due to diffusion in the case 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.030
 of the velvet vespa 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.500
 we need to intervene much more 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.170
 incisive in population control 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.970
 and therefore they must be in mode 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.920
 simpler and less intervention 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.420
 expensive Latin tumi da and the wasp 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.060
 na velvet is a challenge 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.850
 remarkable that involves beekeepers world 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.650
 scientific and institutions while the 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.120
 varroa a cycle of development that has 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.850
 limited and conditioned by the environment 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.280
 these new enemies are hive instead 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.930
 territorial settlers and therefore the 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.130
 struggle becomes much more difficult 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.130
 complex and articulated 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:33.430
 of reflection ning them via pianillo piano 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:36.650
 should not be silent about people and then a 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.600
 sprig lends itself to survival 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.130
 of our organs depends on the degree of 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.440
 coordination that we will be able to put 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.630
 in the field we need to know 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.850
 more thoroughly this insect for 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.410
 fight it more effectively but it is 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.080
 especially appropriate for strategies 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.780
 of struggle are standardized and common 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.050
 to prevent the do-it-yourself from causing damage 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.050
 more 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.930
 if you are using brood cells 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.689
 it is noted that the spawning 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.379
 does not occur on the bottom of the cell but 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:12.379
 on a wall 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.889
 fabrizio goes on to indicate a narmada 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:21.050
 place just opened up right 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.270
 velvets is incredibly existing and 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:27.699
 tenacious that also survives conditions 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.699
 remarkably difficult and adverse 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:45.900
 since Tuesday not eating today we are a 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:47.759
 Sunday in the cold in the garages 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.460
 static planning the news there 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:52.919
 canton ticino crown fair 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.050
 she says she only does two laps but there was 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:06:00.750
 trend already for example at least it seems to me 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:04.400
 really strange if not even 4 3 but 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.400
 could you know it characterizes them 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.750
 but more 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:13.590
 I have to turn to corporate who said 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.590
 only verification
