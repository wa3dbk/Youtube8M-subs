00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.380
 mastering the braking you need in order 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.370
 so that you are not afraid at any moment 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.370
 could stop 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.400
 for this exercise you need to choose 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.650
 again the slope is more or less gentle and 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.199
 flat roll out to your 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.250
 slip did not give you a reason to be afraid and 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.250
 you would not be scared 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.789
 for doing these exercises you 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.829
 need this mat this mat 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:47.390
 necessary in order for your back 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.390
 the foot did not slide on the board 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.180
 before you start the exercise you 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.180
 pull the leading leg away and erase 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.160
 squeeze the board along the slope on the basis 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.410
 free leg 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:12.100
 then you let go of the board and free 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:15.750
 foot stand on the board between the mount 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.070
 the rug will help her not to slip 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.270
 get ready put your hands in front of you 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.270
 and let go 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.190
 farther you move having distributed in 70 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.210
 weight percent on the front foot and 30 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.210
 percent on the back 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.200
 you move your hands in front of you before 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.090
 moment until you feel that you 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.240
 move confidently straight and nothing 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.540
 prevents you from doing braking like this 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.540
 done consider that option when you 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.040
 brake with the rear edge you 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.380
 moving on a flat board 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.990
 then you start to lay hands on 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.900
 side of the back and stretch slightly behind them 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.520
 slightly turning the body body weight 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.520
 moved to the front foot 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.630
 it is very important to start this movement smoothly 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.630
 and there should be no sudden movements 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.319
 without body moved to the front leg 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.110
 you lean lightly on the front heel 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.560
 legs and feel the board starts 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.970
 turn as soon as this 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.190
 felt you can feel free 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.940
 unroll the board and across the slope 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:40.170
 resting on both heels and rear heels 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.170
 most perform braking 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.120
 these movements are exactly the same for 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.120
 goofy regulars 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.530
 and 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.090
 braking can be like the back 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.870
 cante so in the front now we 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.870
 consider the second option 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.670
 after you feel that 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.500
 moving pretty sure you can 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.470
 start doing braking like this 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.629
 happens you start to wring hands 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.730
 sport chest slightly turning body 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.730
 body weight should be on the front leg 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.670
 but 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.570
 then follow slightly lean on 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.560
 front foot toe and feel how 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.560
 board unfolds 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.690
 after you have done all these 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.380
 the movement of the board itself begins 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.380
 unfold 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.500
 we can only put and across 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.500
 slope 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.530
 and leaning on both legs to do the braking 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.740
 these movements are exactly the same for 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.740
 deaf regulars 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.860
 as a result of these exercises you must 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.870
 feel what the load should be 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.220
 on the front foot it will help you a lot 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.570
 when you start learning first turns 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.700
 the next lesson is side 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.400
 sliding this exercise is necessary 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.020
 in order to sell muscle work for 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.060
 the correct ending is also this 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.160
 exercise will help you not to stumble 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.660
 front and back edging that moment 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.670
 when you start doing turns 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.290
 performing this exercise you form 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.300
 the right stance and the right one 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.470
 the position of your hands should be your hands 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.470
 always in front of you
