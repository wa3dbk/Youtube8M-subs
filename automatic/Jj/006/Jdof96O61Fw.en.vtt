00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.940
 hi i'm felipe now let's go and see 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.140
 a qualifying lap in monaco a track 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.050
 very very difficult 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.430
 now we are about to start the tour yes 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.050
 sees that the track is very very narrow 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.370
 we arrive here at the end of the straight 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:42.730
 of the pits I think a climb is difficult 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:46.870
 very very big and now here in Monaco 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:50.200
 where you come to a curve in the third 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.780
 driving there is always so much understeer and 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.660
 always trying to use the whole track 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.750
 braking very very hard almost 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.400
 touching the look at her now where you are 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.280
 comes the slower water of the circuit 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.809
 by the Hon 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.530
 then after a pre-selection in the second 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.860
 marches another slow curve where it is 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.920
 enter the tunnel where you see much less 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.780
 of the other places a culture where there is 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.030
 a very very fast curve but what more 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.600
 fast braking of the circuit where it is 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.420
 goes into second gear goes chicane after the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.600
 tunnel where a tobacco arrives here 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.950
 fast curve is also difficult to do 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.820
 where you also get the very chicane 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.920
 fast of the kitchen that immediately one 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.190
 braking for the other chicane where it is 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.520
 arrives here at the end of the lap but braking 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.070
 a little oversteer where you get too 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.369
 at the last last curve of the tenor of 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.500
 very difficult track box as you see 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.500
 always very close to the guard rail
