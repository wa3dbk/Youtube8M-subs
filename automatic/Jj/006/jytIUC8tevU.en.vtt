file delivery is a little soft very off
the<00:01:16.659> bottom<00:01:16.930> but<00:01:17.080> once<00:01:17.200> you<00:01:17.290> get<00:01:17.409> up<00:01:17.500> mid-range

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
the bottom but once you get up mid-range

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
how a deputy electronics our pair that

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.830 
how a deputy electronics our pair that
with<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.280> wailing<00:02:58.819> rush<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.180> its<00:02:59.329> engine<00:02:59.720> and
