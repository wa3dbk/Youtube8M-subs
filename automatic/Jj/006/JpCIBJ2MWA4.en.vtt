00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
students I have classes 9:00 to 5:00

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.560 
students I have classes 9:00 to 5:00
every<00:01:07.619> day<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:09.119> lessons<00:01:09.450> are<00:01:09.540> really

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
every day and the lessons are really

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.320 
every day and the lessons are really
good<00:01:09.930> because<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:11.189> class<00:01:11.490> size<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:12.000> small

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
good because the class size is small

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.609 
good because the class size is small
maybe<00:01:13.229> just<00:01:13.530> five<00:01:14.189> ten<00:01:14.729> each<00:01:15.600> class<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.560> you

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
maybe just five ten each class so you

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.370

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
ways of learning such as my mapping or

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.679 
ways of learning such as my mapping or
presentations<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:42.119> find<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.479> really

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
the chemistry ones because I like to

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
the chemistry ones because I like to
learn<00:02:00.869> by<00:02:01.079> doing<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.469> it's<00:02:01.619> really
