00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.660
 and we have already put other pockets 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.660
 so you can see here how the subject goes 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:15.430
 you see the home and here we have the 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.280
 first let's say the first conduit that 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.960
 is going to do this I have to cover it 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.930
 up here 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.510
 and then continue up 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.289
 and over there and here I'm going to make a 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.739
 ornette and then already there the exit knows 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:37.449
 he has two more dribbles left but 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.449
 this is already sold 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.140
 here 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.149
 is saying as 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.550
 it is staying now at the beginning then 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.809
 all the stories will be finished now 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.809
 what it is about doing 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.550
 and good guys that you that those 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.550
 bridges 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.140
 here is the theme 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.730
 as you see here then to do this 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.750
 I could do that in many ways 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.790
 even the conduits if you have out there 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.650
 tile to the want of this that is 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.920
 prepared for high temperatures and such 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.850
 Well you want to put a lid on those 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.680
 instead I'm doing the 26 that 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.590
 I'm doing it a little bit arched 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.540
 so in principle so that endurance 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.390
 more realize that the arcs are what 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.060
 that take lives or anything and in doing 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.430
 the body once it gets hard by 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.210
 that holds what is activated by a little 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.160
 that's not it will not hold weight anymore 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.670
 you know it's going to be just the smoke but 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.090
 well in principle this is going to sustain 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.979
 a Little better 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.409
 and good guys here I will follow a 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.980
 little with the march this is 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:06.150
 what do you think are sources 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.860
 a while or a thing another time another and 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.090
 while still such that it is because 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.090
 I'm staying here 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.490
 then another day and we followed another little 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:22.210
 Let's see what we are going to do 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:24.460
 this you know works in this way 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.370
 Some friend told me that how lucky 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.629
 what 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.640
 that the firewood and such I already tell you that in 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.319
 I'm doing it because 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.510
 there are many people who will be able to do it 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.960
 and that already takes advantage of the firewood lives in 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.030
 sites 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:45.690
 What I want to tell you is that with a 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:48.780
 little resistance that you do and that 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.960
 a way you have to have energy 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.810
 make a little motor or do one 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.190
 small for a floor or do a 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.300
 these little pot with two or three 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.770
 ducts you put a resistance 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.290
 little girl of say for volts 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.540
 imagine for example a dryer quoted 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.550
 but I say it because I have the head that 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.380
 now I know every bit of these from 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.480
 these travel hands that carry is 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.910
 a little resistance because only 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.740
 disarmament is what you read in a brick what 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.370
 plug in and if that's going to catch only 12 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.900
 volts surely then then that 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.790
 once it will heat up maybe 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.640
 it would take them to warm up but it's only once 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.010
 that will not turn off the root never never 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.840
 only that it will turn off because you have to 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.660
 put your stories to the resistances 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.690
 for that which is further heated as 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.490
 that shoots like any plate 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.190
 these electrical ones of these that we have in 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:45.330
 house and such for a style that's it with 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.610
 that more or less then we would put the subject 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.860
 that and 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.900
 it's practically all winter 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.900
 once it will heat up the pileup 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.750
 this would be practically with 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.620
 little energy seems to me everything is in 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.380
 that in starting to do tests and also 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.900
 what do you want that forces you good boy 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.270
 that I do nothing but talk that I could 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.610
 have put here to record while 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.230
 I do it but I say that as a 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.630
 bell and here to record while what 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.340
 I have an egg to be here two or 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.540
 three years for the beach bar to be 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.280
 because I stop talking and madonna like that 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.580
 is that boys can continue teaching 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.350
 here in steps of this you see that the 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.469
 videos of these little ones for 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.389
 that you see the steps and a little 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:37.980
 elementals and it's good to come another 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:42.780
 day another time we throw another 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:45.050
 another video these guys are I am 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.050
 other
