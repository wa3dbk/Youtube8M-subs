00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.580
 m 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.100
 Yes 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.100
 but 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.650
 it's almost perfect but the 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.939
 fall is cruel that 's it's to stop 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.399
 almost perfect it was a little too much 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.190
 along 2 minutes and three minutes I 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.930
 believe it was three times the score and 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.870
 against a League 2 these projects three 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.280
 times after I was given 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.219
 they do the right thing as in the 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.420
 moments when we have to stop 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.460
 teams like that you need nothing 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.350
 let go of a human being mute of absence 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.410
 of a minute because otherwise everything is going 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.339
 it was perfect the work that was needed 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.290
 the efforts that needed what is 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.170
 shame is that bunge going through 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.250
 a verrine to the end because at 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.479
 to play a first time in the 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.760
 train arrives in the traditional if 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.130
 it's complicated master roger a 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:11.380
 second time two minutes from the end 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.869
 extensions is what is it 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.600
 missed it may be a little tool 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.530
 more experience yes but multiple 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.690
 experiences are not going to be evicted 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.310
 on the sweat on the field and 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.050
 finish at eleven we played thirty 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.039
 minutes to ten 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.409
 that's when a team like this is 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.850
 Cecile must not make mistakes here we 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.649
 not make a mistake good after I think 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.000
 that in the game we have been internally 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:35.800
 was fine I think we deserve the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.090
 qualification here we are not gold on 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.530
 nothing has nothing to reproach us for 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.020
 can not blame a minute and 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.630
 open three minutes on a sur ensures 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.890
 over two hours it's not much 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.289
 given the efforts she had 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.750
 done during the probable and efforts 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.590
 that are done on the ground 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.160
 that's a lot of 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.160
 disappointment tonight 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:00.060
 the rest of the season 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.069
 no you do not have to be disappointed because 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.750
 that then something good he does 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.759
 more than equal game so do not be 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.869
 disappointed you have to use it to get back to 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.550
 more job matches because otherwise 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.440
 contracts the needs of a disillusion 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.489
 we will say passage yesterday because it is 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.269
 very well that the Coupe de France and its 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:19.739
 passengers to a big fat idiot 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.940
 on the championship me I'm disappointed this 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.040
 evening the lions are going to be disappointed that sense 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.510
 we will try to evacuate her 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:30.440
 during the weekend to leave on Tuesday 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.440
 to leave quickly on Tuesday 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.739
 so I told them to stay to stay 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.370
 from the sky remained focused it will be played 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.200
 not much 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.510
 we could have been the opportunity to score 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.580
 a second goal that might have been 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.709
 given a blow to the opponent's morale 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.200
 but there we could not because 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.930
 also you face quality but 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.129
 well we take two goals on kicks 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.879
 out of ten out of 10 centers 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.370
 kicks stopped and respond 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.540
 game action it's clamping a grain 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.340
 so that means that even if we 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.860
 had drunk a lot of work in the 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.410
 week practically they did some 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:11.560
 good efforts we must continue like this 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.560
 we knew very well that they made me 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.129
 trust and pride they do not know 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.810
 not that 's my disappointment because they 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.640
 deserve it but retained is the pride 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.109
 for sure they used in some 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.079
 good thing he was doing very well 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.750
 still we can be proud of it 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.099
 the mood of a stadium myhique league 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.349
 watch champions have turned their from 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.220
 instance 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.440
 it is always done in Vincennes 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.810
 spectators and camtel 3600 points 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.489
 different here is our idea it's good 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.790
 if it can give a little more to life 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.669
 of these respondents we would have deserved 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.910
 to have a second party 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.910
 too bad
