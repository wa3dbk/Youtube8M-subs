00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.850 
the animation isn't the best thing there
is<00:03:12.310> since<00:03:12.970> like<00:03:13.180> I<00:03:13.269> said<00:03:13.540> this<00:03:13.660> is<00:03:13.720> by<00:03:13.989> a<00:03:14.260> studio

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.039 
love it the engine was actually pretty
decent<00:04:11.319> I'd<00:04:11.980> say<00:04:12.400> not<00:04:12.819> the<00:04:13.060> best<00:04:13.329> ending<00:04:13.900> of

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049

decent I'd say not the best ending of
course<00:04:14.319> but<00:04:14.620> pretty<00:04:14.980> decent<00:04:15.430> it<00:04:15.730> gets<00:04:15.910> pretty

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
course but pretty decent it gets pretty

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.150 
course but pretty decent it gets pretty
intense<00:04:16.209> in<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.810> end<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.440> only<00:04:17.470> thing<00:04:18.010> that

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160
