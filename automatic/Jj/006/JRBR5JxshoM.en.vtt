 manipulations 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.480
 need to consider some 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.269
 technical features that need 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.900

 We build juice which Yaniv precisely 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:55.120
 rubber tip or the like 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.010
 use a can of it 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.440
 boil for ten to fifteen 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.140
 minutes

 saline which can be bought in 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.869
 pharmacy fluid temperature should be

 22 24 degrees that is room 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.530
 temperature 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.330
 if the water is too warm more than 22 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.630
 degrees then in this case she can 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.850
 stay in the gut if the waterfall is less 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.190
 22 degrees then in this case on you 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.009
 cold and it can cause cramps 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.110
 intestines in either case you 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:33.220
 will not achieve the result pursued 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.610
 procedures need to take bo best 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:42.660
 clean fill it completely 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:46.209
 fluid and lubricate the tip of the can 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:49.000
 petroleum jelly before driving

 reap a little spray to 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.280
 it seemed liquid for what it needs 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.899
 do the fact is that when you 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.330
 fill the can with water 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.330
 get such a situation that in the far 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.530
 completely fills the can and in it 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:14.040
 air remains and if you will 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:18.150
 liquid intestine baby introduce 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.459

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.099
 how to keep the bowel of a child 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:27.989
 you need to squeeze it to remove

 excess air seemed to water and enter 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.870
 in the intestines of the child the child while 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.430
 should be located either on the left while 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:41.879
 either on the back of the child’s legs 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:48.359
 should be brought to tummy frenki 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:50.670
 and we enter the baby's intestinal can 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.870
 makes up somewhere points at 3-5 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.169
 centimeters 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.689
 we drive the water very carefully 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:03:00.739
 slowly sharply and excretion of fluid 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:04.409
 may cause intestinal spasm 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.010
 full volume of fluid and need 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.849
 remove 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.109
 can not unclenching it if you 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.120
 will open up 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.120
 can when he is still in 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.400
 the child’s gut 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.669
 simply spray the contents of the intestine 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.400
 done that can cum cans 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:27.840
 cling to the intestinal wall and cause 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.540
 its damage and so completely when you 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.549
 lived all the liquid in the intestines of the child not 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.970
 opening his can 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:39.479
 hit and need to clamp the buttocks 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.870

 to soften fecal masses 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.970
 how much to drive depends on mass 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:50.280
 child is calculated by the formula 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.700
 child weight in kilograms multiplied 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.550
 on 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.810
 if you are here milliliters per kilogram 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.120
 suppose the child’s mass is five s 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.060
 half kilograms multiplied by ten 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.780
 we get 5 55 milliliters 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.879
 and these are two such spray cans after 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.269
 how did you drive the full volume of fluid 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:14.220
 the child needs him to massage 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:17.130
 tummy no lane do not do 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.459
 abdominal massage clockwise around 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:24.470
 navel further pavel coming to life movement 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:28.700
 top down tummy and side 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.700
 stroking movements on the sides 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:42.019
