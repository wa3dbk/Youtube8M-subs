00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.170
 match gives now it's written on 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.189
 every product before I really 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.950
 a talking pitch is a product 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.730
 which is important it is not 100% 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.530
 as I want 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.530

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.229
 we are in the process of 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.829
 elaborated with jacques our tour chemist 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:42.090
 textures a perfume the ingredients 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.679
 the packages all self over expensive then to 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.329
 younger because at first 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.130
 because they have a laboratory of 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.009

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.700
