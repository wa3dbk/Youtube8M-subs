daughter<00:00:40.530> when<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> do<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.460> if<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.059> do<00:00:43.640> she

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
daughter when I do that and if I do she

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.360 
daughter when I do that and if I do she
would<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:44.850> screaming<00:00:45.840> her<00:00:46.469> head<00:00:46.530> off<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.129> it

would be screaming her head off and it

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.830 
would be screaming her head off and it
would<00:00:47.460> probably<00:00:47.700> break<00:00:48.059> through<00:00:48.300> her<00:00:48.390> skin<00:00:48.629> it

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
would probably break through her skin it

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.970
