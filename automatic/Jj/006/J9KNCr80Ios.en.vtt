00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 I saw the little video I received from 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.770
 my friend and I really wanted 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.340
 share this video with you 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.469
 You can make mush, by the way, you use 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.299
 the whole corn the corn ear for 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.670
 make your recipes 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.689
 only they take those gorgeous corn hair 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.609
 It is very difficult not to peel the corn 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.750
 already difficult to remove hair from corn is 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.720
 very difficult too 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.119
 so watch this video that will make it easier 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.119
 Your life in 100% looks cool 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:40.910
 it then you will cut the funding of 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.480
 Corn roughly one centimeter quarter 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.310
 funding 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.470
 so vile a very sharp knife 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:50.660
 dinha quiet 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:52.730
 then you take the corn out of that 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.560
 shape your hair 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.700
 There you talk about more profit like that. 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.220
 it's possible 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.410
 it is possible because before that it was 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.630
 for microwaves and he went to the 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.800
 microwaves a few minutes how many 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:09.110
 minutes to see 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.200
 efe how many minutes each 30 seconds more 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.670
 or less 40 seconds in the microwave 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.210
 put it there the way it was closed 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.360
 dinho 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.240
 Then you cut it and you pull it. 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.650
 He is whole without those hairs. 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.310
 watch again to see how you 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.700
 does 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.850
 puts the microwave then gets 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.400
 microwave about 40 minutes 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.869
 it's 40 seconds right 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.550
 leave a minute to ensure good not 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.000
 will burn if it does not cut funding 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.550
 He cut his funding there, you pull the 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.399
 another tip is squeezing and he leaves 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.800
 would have breasts hair people look that 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.020
 wonder is in your house 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.610
 logical depending on the power of your 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.319
 micro waves you may need a 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.200
 a little more time 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.149
 Okay then 40 seconds from the one arrow 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.610
 moderate power but suddenly people 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.140
 can not move puts the minute to 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.270
 a minute and a half more or less 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.270
 Good too, my dear.
