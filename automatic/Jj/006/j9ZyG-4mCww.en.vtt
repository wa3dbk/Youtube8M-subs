00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.440
 These teeth 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.370
 It Oh Barre If there is no loss 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:25.230
 Yes there are many who put everyone on it We released info second 3 in the outside pond 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:28.650
 From the Japanese version of boo-boo this time I think it might be a bit of a real situation for Japan 2nd 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:33.850
 It is to say Datte got to what does not bridge the story to masu 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:38.720
 I would like to introduce the fur that this hero has 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:43.850
 The power It is this hero by advancing the story 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:46.760
 Be put in to their four power do I'll I finally can go is to get 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:51.920
 I can introduce you to the four places of super 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:55.580
 Well after a little only first saw you I want you to do it left of the meter like a you a view of the world 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.340
 It's not right, the brown guy under this rocket on the left 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:02.320
 This is that power 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.100
 Well it's a meter, but I'm using less and it's better to hit and hit 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.729
 It will decrease 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.630
 Tara rocket-to-Kachotto little strong beam like a Ittsu' you say rocket 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.320
 like this 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:17.080
 When the rocket's marked white rocket mark decreases 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:20.530
 If you absorb the fur and collect it, you 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.910
 2 games are appropriate 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.910
 I Tteyuu Saki communication 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.399
 Jammer 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.250
 It's a map, but I think everyone already cares about it and it's pretty big 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:36.720
 There are 82 islands 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.720
 deko seems to be connected 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:46.200
 I tried a little experiment I think I wonder if go map that was used to first but it is like that 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.920
 But there is also a map that comes out for a little while at the beginning, but there is 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.530
 A place where you should not 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.570
 It is such a feeling 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.430
 In 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.530
 Now it feels like it shows power , first of all it's called smoke power 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.369
 Ne 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.390
 It's impossible to wear Japanese clothes and it's impossible to smoke and let the city 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.390
 If you move 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:13.880
 It is the place where Chinese say that I think oh well the most this of the best places 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.090
 As this is the first store, this exhaust outlet is from here 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:21.010
 Enter this 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.610
 In examples where you cool it wonderful wonderful yo 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.360
 Say in my head is a pawn 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.360
 It looks like this 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.960
 Friendship and Neato it is is using the Cosmo power 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:38.190
 Full cheap pond This refers to the way path Kedomo I can slip through the wall 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:43.050
 Twin can not kick 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.810
 8 I would like to say a specific place like a place with a bonus 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.930
 Hmm 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.640
 8 For example, I guess this is empty 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.790
 It was so unreasonable. 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.520
 Guy I Ikeru live absolutely say Oh It is there 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:03.910
 Also hydrofluoric but I've used this saying under surveillance 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:10.020
 It's like this, I wonder if I will use this power to fight against the enemies 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.020
 Rather go to because the me I because would show it to the other Ichida would show suddenly 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.590
 Such power 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.590
 It will be lost if it doesn't rain 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.000
 Deathblow 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.000
 At once 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.180
 Normal normal attack with qualifications 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.460
 It looks like 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.550

 Hey hey my special move was not cool if you could do something cool 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.790

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:14.060
 Big 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.060
 You can do it like this in a city where you live 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.690

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:35.409
 It does not mean that you want to kill 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:39.879
 Well there is this game justice and evil 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:40.980
 The main character is chosen as the story goes on 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:45.810

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.480
 Especially if there is nothing else to do next with sumo wrestling power 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.960
 Hmm 

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:34.370
