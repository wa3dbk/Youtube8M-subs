00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.640 
thing should not be happening at all in
any<00:02:21.310> game<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:23.470> know<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:24.570> from

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
any game you know and from

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.130 
any game you know and from
the<00:02:27.220> looks<00:02:27.579> of<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.939> chat<00:02:28.269> people<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:29.019> know

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
the looks of the chat people you know

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.080 
the looks of the chat people you know
it's<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.470> stuff<00:02:29.920> like<00:02:30.159> how<00:02:30.400> many<00:02:30.579> counts<00:02:30.970> the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
it's a stuff like how many counts the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.360 
it's a stuff like how many counts the
unpacking<00:02:31.540> I'm<00:02:32.319> guessing<00:02:32.799> that<00:02:32.950> this<00:02:33.040> isn't

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
unpacking I'm guessing that this isn't

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.149 
unpacking I'm guessing that this isn't
his<00:02:33.459> first<00:02:33.670> count<00:02:34.060> so<00:02:34.780> obviously<00:02:35.379> vac<00:02:35.920> is

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
his first count so obviously vac is

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.910 
his first count so obviously vac is
doing<00:02:36.700> that<00:02:37.269> its<00:02:37.569> job<00:02:37.870> well<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:38.439> know<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:38.709> has

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
doing that its job well you know it has

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.210 
doing that its job well you know it has
got<00:02:39.159> a<00:02:39.189> band<00:02:39.489> in<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.760> past<00:02:40.120> aye<00:02:40.890> sir<00:02:41.890> either

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
got a band in the past aye sir either

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.380 
got a band in the past aye sir either
there's<00:02:42.819> some<00:02:43.030> sort<00:02:43.150> of<00:02:43.239> bypass<00:02:43.450> with<00:02:44.200> but<00:02:44.650> I'm

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
there's some sort of bypass with but I'm

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.740 
there's some sort of bypass with but I'm
gonna<00:02:46.390> assume<00:02:47.379> the<00:02:48.280> more<00:02:48.459> likely<00:02:48.970> is<00:02:49.180> he<00:02:49.510> just

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
gonna assume the more likely is he just

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.149 
gonna assume the more likely is he just
bought<00:02:50.049> another<00:02:50.439> account<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:53.159> started

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
bought another account and started

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.530 
bought another account and started
hacking<00:02:54.579> again<00:02:55.120> which<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.450> something<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:56.500> I

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
hacking again which is something that I

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.020 
hacking again which is something that I
really<00:02:58.540> think<00:02:59.159> that<00:03:00.450> valve<00:03:01.450> yeah<00:03:02.700> vac<00:03:03.700> is

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
really think that valve yeah vac is

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.789 
really think that valve yeah vac is
doing<00:03:04.420> a<00:03:04.450> really<00:03:04.720> good<00:03:04.900> job<00:03:04.959> but<00:03:05.379> the<00:03:05.470> problem

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
doing a really good job but the problem

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.869 
doing a really good job but the problem
is<00:03:06.150> for<00:03:07.150> a<00:03:07.480> lot<00:03:07.750> of<00:03:07.870> games<00:03:08.079> you<00:03:08.670> know<00:03:09.670> for

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
is for a lot of games you know for

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.550 
is for a lot of games you know for
pretty<00:03:10.060> much<00:03:10.120> every<00:03:10.480> game<00:03:10.629> it's<00:03:10.959> just<00:03:11.319> as

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
pretty much every game it's just as

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.099 
pretty much every game it's just as
simple<00:03:11.709> as<00:03:11.980> buying<00:03:12.220> your<00:03:12.489> account<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:13.109> making

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
simple as buying your account of making

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.759 
simple as buying your account of making
you<00:03:14.200> account<00:03:14.470> by<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.680> game<00:03:14.980> again<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:16.769> it

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
you account by the game again and it

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.240 
you account by the game again and it
puts<00:03:18.099> games<00:03:18.579> like<00:03:18.970> tf2<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:19.810> other<00:03:20.500> free<00:03:20.980> games

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
puts games like tf2 and other free games

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.440 
puts games like tf2 and other free games
like<00:03:21.790> that<00:03:22.120> at<00:03:22.359> complete<00:03:23.290> risk<00:03:23.620> because<00:03:24.450> you

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
like that at complete risk because you

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.960 
like that at complete risk because you
know<00:03:25.569> basically<00:03:26.379> it's<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.769> free<00:03:27.010> game<00:03:27.220> there's

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
know basically it's a free game there's

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.640 
know basically it's a free game there's
nothing<00:03:28.150> stopping<00:03:28.599> you<00:03:28.870> from<00:03:28.930> making<00:03:29.079> a<00:03:29.439> new

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
nothing stopping you from making a new

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.039 
nothing stopping you from making a new
account<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:30.220> just<00:03:30.900> going<00:03:31.900> crazy<00:03:32.079> again<00:03:33.000> so

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
account and just going crazy again so

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.409 
account and just going crazy again so
they<00:03:35.049> really<00:03:35.560> need<00:03:35.889> to<00:03:36.010> do<00:03:36.129> something<00:03:36.459> yeah

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
they really need to do something yeah

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.809 
they really need to do something yeah
whether<00:03:37.870> it<00:03:38.019> be<00:03:38.139> like<00:03:38.379> some<00:03:39.340> sort<00:03:39.549> of<00:03:39.609> thing

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
whether it be like some sort of thing

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.180 
whether it be like some sort of thing
with<00:03:40.060> your<00:03:40.209> IP<00:03:40.419> where<00:03:40.870> if<00:03:41.049> you<00:03:41.199> make<00:03:41.410> multiple

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
with your IP where if you make multiple

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.240 
with your IP where if you make multiple
accounts<00:03:42.699> you<00:03:43.150> know<00:03:43.409> for<00:03:44.409> example<00:03:44.500> tak<00:03:45.069> is

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
accounts you know for example tak is

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.449 
accounts you know for example tak is
going<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.489> look<00:03:45.639> at<00:03:45.730> you<00:03:45.849> more<00:03:46.780> yeah<00:03:47.590> closely

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
keep it close right because something

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.559 
keep it close right because something
like<00:03:51.549> this<00:03:51.819> should<00:03:52.180> not<00:03:52.840> even<00:03:53.049> be

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
like this should not even be

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.180 
like this should not even be
he's<00:03:55.569> got<00:03:55.870> his<00:03:56.020> crazy<00:03:56.410> headshot<00:03:56.980> feed<00:03:57.280> off<00:03:58.030> the

ridiculous<00:04:03.430> you<00:04:03.550> know<00:04:03.610> I<00:04:03.700> don't<00:04:03.819> even<00:04:04.120> think

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
ridiculous you know I don't even think

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.460 
ridiculous you know I don't even think

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
you could shoot through half of those

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.790 
you could shoot through half of those
surfaces<00:04:05.830> but<00:04:06.489> um<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:07.750> know<00:04:07.900> it's<00:04:08.319> completely

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
surfaces but um you know it's completely

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.190 
surfaces but um you know it's completely
ridiculous<00:04:08.920> what<00:04:09.610> he<00:04:09.700> can<00:04:09.849> there<00:04:11.580> you<00:04:12.580> know
