00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
want to get the golden spork so i have a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.609 
want to get the golden spork so i have a
tutorial<00:00:26.640> on<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.570> you'll<00:00:28.109> be<00:00:28.320> able<00:00:28.439> to

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
tutorial on that and you'll be able to

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.769 
tutorial on that and you'll be able to
get<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.920> higher<00:00:29.220> round<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:30.300> achieve<00:00:30.630> this

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
get to a higher round to achieve this

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.950 
get to a higher round to achieve this
much<00:00:31.109> easier<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:32.520> once<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.030> get<00:00:33.300> all<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.719> 30

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
much easier so once you get all the 30

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.229 
much easier so once you get all the 30
kills<00:00:34.320> there'll<00:00:34.950> be<00:00:34.980> an<00:00:35.219> indication<00:00:35.760> where

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
kills there'll be an indication where

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.810 
kills there'll be an indication where
you<00:00:36.420> did<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.930> didn't<00:00:37.710> hear<00:00:37.860> one<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.489> maybe

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
you did it I didn't hear one so maybe

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.569 
you did it I didn't hear one so maybe
you<00:00:39.059> will<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.540> really<00:00:40.230> don't<00:00:40.440> know<00:00:40.500> but<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.160> just

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
you will I really don't know but I just

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.819 
you will I really don't know but I just
had<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.760> check<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.420> see<00:00:42.480> if<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.870> was<00:00:42.989> able<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.350> do

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
had to check and see if I was able to do

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.520 
had to check and see if I was able to do
this<00:00:44.010> second<00:00:44.579> part<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.809> second<00:00:46.200> part<00:00:46.379> is

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
this second part so the second part is

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.770 
this second part so the second part is
