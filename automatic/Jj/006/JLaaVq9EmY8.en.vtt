were<00:01:40.619> definitely<00:01:40.860> going<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> make<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.460> cut

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
were definitely going to make the cut

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.999 
were definitely going to make the cut
and<00:01:41.939> possibly<00:01:42.840> score<00:01:43.170> points<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.740> know<00:01:43.799> you

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
getting 22nd that first moto I believe

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.450 
getting 22nd that first moto I believe
if<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.200> wasn't<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.619> much<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.799> fitness<00:01:50.280> that

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
if it wasn't so much a fitness that

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.370 
if it wasn't so much a fitness that
could<00:01:50.759> definitely<00:01:51.030> been<00:01:51.390> something<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.290> you

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
could definitely been something that you

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.350 
could definitely been something that you
could<00:01:52.530> achieve<00:01:52.890> not<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:53.729> much<00:01:53.850> fitness<00:01:54.210> but

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
could achieve not so much fitness but

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.649 
could achieve not so much fitness but
comfortability<00:01:54.869> out<00:01:55.229> there<00:01:55.470> yeah<00:01:56.040> for<00:01:56.399> sure

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
50 for the weekend so I think as long as

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.580 
50 for the weekend so I think as long as
we<00:02:44.270> pretty<00:02:44.450> much<00:02:44.540> finished<00:02:44.810> that<00:02:45.110> first<00:02:45.350> one

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
we pretty much finished that first one

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.260 
we pretty much finished that first one
and<00:02:45.830> we<00:02:46.370> should<00:02:46.550> have<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:46.820> wrapped<00:02:46.940> up<00:02:47.240> so

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
and we should have it wrapped up so

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.060 
and we should have it wrapped up so
luckily<00:02:48.110> I<00:02:48.170> had<00:02:48.350> that<00:02:48.470> little<00:02:48.590> bit<00:02:48.800> of<00:02:48.830> cushion

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
luckily I had that little bit of cushion

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.370 
luckily I had that little bit of cushion
