me<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.320> can't<00:01:28.619> get<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.130> get

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
me and I can't get it so I get

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.620 
me and I can't get it so I get
frustrated<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.090> I'm<00:01:30.150> gonna<00:01:30.240> start<00:01:30.420> running

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
frustrated so I'm gonna start running

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.450 
frustrated so I'm gonna start running
out<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.810> flank<00:01:31.140> here<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.560> as<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.280> see<00:01:32.430> I

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
out the flank here and as you can see I

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.679 
out the flank here and as you can see I
choose<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.970> go<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> left<00:01:33.360> side<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
choose to go to the left side of the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.710 
choose to go to the left side of the
train<00:01:34.220> sometimes<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> mistake<00:01:36.450> you

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
train sometimes it can be a mistake you

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.210 
train sometimes it can be a mistake you
gotta<00:01:36.930> watch<00:01:37.170> your<00:01:37.409> radar

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
gotta watch your radar

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.800 
gotta watch your radar
sometimes<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.939> works<00:01:39.060> writing<00:01:39.329> your<00:01:39.450> favorite

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
sometimes it works writing your favorite

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.600 
sometimes it works writing your favorite
but<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.229> ultimately<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> zombies<00:01:41.189> decision

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
but it ultimately the zombies decision

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.100 
but it ultimately the zombies decision
because<00:01:41.759> they<00:01:41.939> jump<00:01:42.299> off<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.570> building<00:01:42.689> land

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
because they jump off the building land

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.450 
because they jump off the building land
on<00:01:43.290> top<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.649> train<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.040> they<00:01:44.100> can<00:01:44.220> kind<00:01:44.340> of

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
on top of the train and they can kind of

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.550 
on top of the train and they can kind of
land<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.880> whichever<00:01:45.240> side<00:01:45.360> they<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.290> land

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
land on whichever side they like to land

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.010 
land on whichever side they like to land
on<00:01:46.710> if<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.759> understand<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.810> can<00:01:48.990> see

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
on if you understand that so you can see

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.270 
on if you understand that so you can see
they're<00:01:49.259> jumping<00:01:49.530> on<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.680> train<00:01:49.860> here<00:01:50.070> some

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
they're jumping on the train here some

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.499 
they're jumping on the train here some
of<00:01:50.310> them<00:01:50.490> are<00:01:50.549> going<00:01:50.670> straight<00:01:50.939> for<00:01:51.240> us<00:01:51.270> but

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
of them are going straight for us but

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.120 
of them are going straight for us but
the<00:01:51.570> other<00:01:51.600> ones<00:01:51.869> are<00:01:51.960> kind<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.140> dropping<00:01:52.979> down

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
the other ones are kind of dropping down

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.740 
the other ones are kind of dropping down
into<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> train<00:01:53.790> carts<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.270> weaving<00:01:54.600> in<00:01:54.720> and

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
into the train carts and weaving in and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.300 
into the train carts and weaving in and
out<00:01:54.899> just<00:01:55.170> as<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.350> were<00:01:55.649> cuz<00:01:55.920> they're<00:01:56.040> using

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
out just as we were cuz they're using

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.389 
out just as we were cuz they're using
that<00:01:56.369> line<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.700> sight<00:01:57.290> blockers<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.829> kind

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
that line of sight blockers on the kind

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.700 
that line of sight blockers on the kind
of<00:01:59.430> different<00:01:59.790> lanes<00:02:00.000> there<00:02:00.329> do<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
of different lanes there do get to the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.139 
of different lanes there do get to the
humans<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:02.369> really<00:02:02.520> after<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.820> zombies

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
humans so it's really after the zombies

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.520 
humans so it's really after the zombies
that<00:02:03.299> they<00:02:03.479> want<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.719> do<00:02:03.810> for<00:02:03.840> their<00:02:04.140> strategy

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
that they want to do for their strategy

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.780 
that they want to do for their strategy
but<00:02:04.649> they<00:02:04.740> want<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.950> run<00:02:05.100> straight<00:02:05.340> at<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.579> or

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
but they want to run straight at you or

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.740 
but they want to run straight at you or
use<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.270> sides

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
use the sides

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.850 
use the sides
ultimately<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.849> would<00:02:08.849> kind<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.869> would

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
ultimately I would kind of I would

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.350 
ultimately I would kind of I would
suggest<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.370> get<00:02:11.489> two<00:02:11.670> groups<00:02:12.000> one<00:02:12.270> on

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
suggest that you get two groups one on

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.400 
suggest that you get two groups one on
this<00:02:12.480> side<00:02:12.690> one<00:02:12.870> on<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.989> left<00:02:13.230> side

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
this side one on the left side

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.620 
this side one on the left side
over<00:02:13.620> there<00:02:14.280> just<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:15.000> kind<00:02:15.270> of<00:02:15.300> shoot<00:02:15.510> down

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
over there just to kind of shoot down

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.850 
over there just to kind of shoot down
the<00:02:15.720> zombies<00:02:15.870> little<00:02:16.230> land<00:02:16.410> with<00:02:16.560> various

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
the zombies little land with various

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.650 
the zombies little land with various
lanes<00:02:17.100> here<00:02:17.370> as<00:02:17.460> you<00:02:17.550> can<00:02:17.580> see<00:02:17.700> who<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.360> lot

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
lanes here as you can see who that a lot

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.000 
lanes here as you can see who that a lot
of<00:02:18.750> people<00:02:18.930> over<00:02:19.080> here<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.500> zombies<00:02:19.800> aren't

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
of people over here so zombies aren't

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.090 
of people over here so zombies aren't
gonna<00:02:20.370> get<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.910> our<00:02:21.120> door<00:02:21.360> from<00:02:21.630> this<00:02:21.720> side<00:02:22.100> but

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
gonna get to our door from this side but

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.860 
gonna get to our door from this side but
we<00:02:23.250> get<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> double<00:02:23.670> kill<00:02:23.700> move<00:02:24.120> in<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.630> the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
we get a double kill move in to the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.960 
we get a double kill move in to the
second<00:02:25.470> phase<00:02:25.590> right<00:02:25.800> here<00:02:25.980> which<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:26.730> kind<00:02:26.940> of

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
second phase right here which is kind of

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.630 
second phase right here which is kind of
like<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.240> loading<00:02:27.660> station<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.440> train<00:02:28.770> not

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
like the loading station of a train not

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.760 
like the loading station of a train not
a<00:02:29.670> cargo<00:02:30.120> loading<00:02:30.510> but<00:02:30.720> kind<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.200> passenger

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
a cargo loading but kind of a passenger

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.110 
a cargo loading but kind of a passenger
loading<00:02:32.010> this<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:32.460> where<00:02:32.580> maybe<00:02:32.730> some

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
loading this is where maybe some

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.420 
loading this is where maybe some
passengers<00:02:33.660> like<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.110> VIP<00:02:34.470> passengers<00:02:35.190> would

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
passengers like the VIP passengers would

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.690 
passengers like the VIP passengers would
get<00:02:35.580> on<00:02:35.670> top<00:02:35.850> of<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.000> Train<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.680> go<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.430> jump

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
get on top of the Train and go and jump

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.510 
get on top of the Train and go and jump
in<00:02:38.850> with<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.330> rest<00:02:39.990> of<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.170> passengers<00:02:40.650> but

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
in with the rest of the passengers but

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.340 
in with the rest of the passengers but
this<00:02:41.880> is<00:02:41.970> where<00:02:42.120> maybe<00:02:42.240> they<00:02:42.450> had<00:02:42.540> roll<00:02:42.720> load

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
this is where maybe they had roll load

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.960 
this is where maybe they had roll load
passengers<00:02:43.950> in<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.160> carts<00:02:44.430> where<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.820> other

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
passengers in the carts where the other

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.390 
passengers in the carts where the other
places<00:02:45.270> like<00:02:45.570> where<00:02:45.750> they<00:02:45.840> had<00:02:45.930> load<00:02:46.110> cargo<00:02:46.400> as

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
places like where they had load cargo as

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
places like where they had load cargo as
you<00:02:47.520> can<00:02:47.640> see<00:02:47.760> right<00:02:47.910> here<00:02:47.970> though<00:02:48.240> there's

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
you can see right here though there's

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.060 
you can see right here though there's
two<00:02:48.660> kind<00:02:49.080> of<00:02:49.110> operative<00:02:49.500> parts<00:02:49.800> are<00:02:49.920> there

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
two kind of operative parts are there

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.680 
two kind of operative parts are there
zombies<00:02:50.670> will<00:02:50.820> eventually<00:02:51.210> come<00:02:51.390> from<00:02:51.570> there

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.050 
take a look at my perspective right here
as<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:13.980> can<00:03:14.130> see<00:03:14.220> I'm<00:03:14.460> already<00:03:14.730> on<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.000> other

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
as you can see I'm already on the other

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.810 
as you can see I'm already on the other
side<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.540> tracks<00:03:15.980> I've<00:03:16.980> jumped<00:03:17.310> over<00:03:17.580> gone

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
side of the tracks I've jumped over gone

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.190 
side of the tracks I've jumped over gone
in<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.120> little<00:03:18.390> kind<00:03:18.630> of<00:03:18.750> hole<00:03:18.990> in<00:03:19.140> the

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
in that little kind of hole in the

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.990 
in that little kind of hole in the
middle<00:03:19.440> which<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.709> very<00:03:20.010> scary<00:03:20.490> to<00:03:20.640> go<00:03:20.790> and

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
middle which is very scary to go and

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.610 
middle which is very scary to go and
because<00:03:21.270> Ami's<00:03:21.600> can<00:03:21.750> fall<00:03:21.930> down<00:03:21.959> from<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.320> top

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
because Ami's can fall down from the top

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.949 
because Ami's can fall down from the top
so<00:03:22.890> it's<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.100> little<00:03:23.400> bit<00:03:23.580> risky<00:03:24.510> what<00:03:24.870> I'm

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
so it's a little bit risky what I'm

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.600 
so it's a little bit risky what I'm
doing<00:03:25.200> here<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.650> I<00:03:25.709> start<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.070> move<00:03:26.160> back<00:03:26.220> but

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
doing here and I start to move back but

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.800 
doing here and I start to move back but
you<00:03:26.670> can<00:03:26.790> see<00:03:26.970> that<00:03:27.120> kind<00:03:27.240> of<00:03:27.330> ledge<00:03:27.510> up<00:03:27.690> there

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
you can see that kind of ledge up there

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.420 
you can see that kind of ledge up there
that<00:03:27.990> wall<00:03:28.140> calls<00:03:28.350> even<00:03:28.530> zombies<00:03:29.010> will<00:03:29.190> start

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
that wall calls even zombies will start

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.220 
that wall calls even zombies will start
spawning<00:03:29.640> up<00:03:29.880> there<00:03:30.030> from<00:03:30.570> either<00:03:30.720> side<00:03:30.840> maybe

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
spawning up there from either side maybe

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.540 
spawning up there from either side maybe
on<00:03:31.410> top<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.740> you<00:03:31.920> or<00:03:32.100> on<00:03:32.160> top<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.459> other

on top of you or on top of the other

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.070 
on top of you or on top of the other
side<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:32.910> they<00:03:32.970> will<00:03:33.060> jump<00:03:33.360> down<00:03:33.540> straight

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
side and they will jump down straight

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.770 
side and they will jump down straight
into<00:03:34.440> your<00:03:34.650> side<00:03:34.920> of<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.250> tracks<00:03:35.580> and<00:03:35.940> it<00:03:36.690> will

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
into your side of the tracks and it will

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.330 
into your side of the tracks and it will
become<00:03:37.170> difficult<00:03:37.200> luckily<00:03:37.920> we<00:03:38.040> had<00:03:38.160> somebody

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:29.629 
their weakest point and then you move

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:30.640 
their weakest point and then you move
back<00:04:29.689> when<00:04:30.050> they<00:04:30.110> start<00:04:30.289> getting<00:04:30.409> more
