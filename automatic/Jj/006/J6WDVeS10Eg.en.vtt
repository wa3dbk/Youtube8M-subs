line<00:00:07.140> speaker<00:00:10.490> I'm<00:00:11.490> using<00:00:12.019> Sketchup<00:00:13.019> if<00:00:13.410> you

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
line speaker I'm using Sketchup if you

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.020 
line speaker I'm using Sketchup if you
don't<00:00:13.889> have<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.370> need<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.519> google<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.000> and

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
don't have it you need to google it and

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.740 
don't have it you need to google it and
get<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:16.730> semi<00:00:17.730> learn<00:00:18.029> how<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.270> use<00:00:18.510> it

basically<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.350> line<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:20.160> transmission<00:00:20.730> line

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
basically the line the transmission line

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.200 
basically the line the transmission line
gets<00:00:21.270> no<00:00:21.510> smaller<00:00:21.960> than<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:23.340> any<00:00:23.880> one<00:00:24.180> given

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
gets no smaller than in any one given

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
six five squared inches and I discussed

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.380 
six five squared inches and I discussed
this<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.480> my<00:00:30.630> last<00:00:30.840> video<00:00:31.489> so<00:00:32.489> if<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.969> take<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
this in my last video so if you take the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.180 
this in my last video so if you take the
measurement<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.960> height<00:00:34.170> four<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.829> fifteen

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
measurement the height four and fifteen

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.760 
measurement the height four and fifteen
sixteenths<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.149> multiply<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.690> by<00:00:36.840> n<00:00:37.410> I

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
sixteenths and you multiply it by n I

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.569 
sixteenths and you multiply it by n I
chose<00:00:38.040> an<00:00:38.340> eleven<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.940> half<00:00:38.969> inch<00:00:40.250> depth<00:00:41.250> on

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
chose an eleven and a half inch depth on

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.540 
chose an eleven and a half inch depth on
my<00:00:41.910> box<00:00:42.379> that's<00:00:43.379> fifty<00:00:43.770> six<00:00:44.010> point<00:00:44.219> seven

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
my box that's fifty six point seven

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.770 
my box that's fifty six point seven
eight<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.420> it's<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:45.899> over<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:48.329> drivers

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
eight so it's just over the the drivers

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.170 
eight so it's just over the the drivers
radiating<00:00:49.440> area<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.520> smallest<00:00:50.789> portion

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
radiating area on the smallest portion

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.860 
radiating area on the smallest portion
of<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> channel<00:00:53.300> some<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> other<00:00:54.600> things

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
of the channel some of the other things

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.369 
of the channel some of the other things
that<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.050> did<00:00:55.410> was<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.750> was<00:00:57.750> originally<00:00:58.199> going<00:00:58.320> to

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
that I did was I was originally going to

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.029 
that I did was I was originally going to
have<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> box<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.070> would<00:01:00.649> come<00:01:01.649> down<00:01:01.829> like

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
have a box that would come down like

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.280 
have a box that would come down like
this<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.730> speaker<00:01:03.030> would<00:01:03.180> be<00:01:03.300> here<00:01:04.460> and

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
this like the speaker would be here and

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.880 
this like the speaker would be here and
then<00:01:07.290> go<00:01:07.740> into<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.040> smaller<00:01:08.369> channel<00:01:08.790> however<00:01:09.240> I

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
then go into a smaller channel however I

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.410 
then go into a smaller channel however I
thought<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.220> air<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:12.000> would<00:01:12.210> come

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
thought that the air that would come

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.660 
thought that the air that would come
down<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.900> side<00:01:13.310> should<00:01:14.310> be<00:01:14.460> able<00:01:14.549> to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
down on this side should be able to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.990 
down on this side should be able to
bounce<00:01:14.880> off<00:01:15.259> at<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.350> 45<00:01:16.950> degree<00:01:17.130> angle<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.850> then

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
bounce off at a 45 degree angle and then

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.570 
bounce off at a 45 degree angle and then
start<00:01:18.360> tapering<00:01:18.740> same<00:01:19.740> here<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.159> there's<00:01:20.340> air

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
start tapering same here if there's air

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.690 
start tapering same here if there's air
over<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.360> coming<00:01:21.689> down<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:22.700> able

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
over here and it's coming down it's able

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.490 
over here and it's coming down it's able
to<00:01:23.850> actually<00:01:24.270> go<00:01:24.420> into<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.659> next<00:01:24.960> channel<00:01:25.320> and

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
to actually go into the next channel and

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.950 
to actually go into the next channel and
then<00:01:25.619> slowly<00:01:25.950> taper<00:01:26.310> down<00:01:26.640> rather<00:01:27.450> than<00:01:27.630> just

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
then slowly taper down rather than just

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.899 
then slowly taper down rather than just
being<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.439> was<00:01:28.979> afraid<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.310> if<00:01:29.549> there<00:01:29.790> was<00:01:29.850> a

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
being I was afraid that if there was a

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.520 
being I was afraid that if there was a
channel<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.509> come<00:01:30.689> down<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.049> way

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
channel that come down this way

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.679 
channel that come down this way
air<00:01:31.770> would<00:01:33.320> come<00:01:34.320> down<00:01:34.500> off<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.920> speaker

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
air would come down off of the speaker

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.020 
air would come down off of the speaker
come<00:01:36.689> off<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> 45<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.950> then<00:01:38.310> reflect<00:01:38.729> back

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
come off on a 45 and then reflect back

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.359 
come off on a 45 and then reflect back
and<00:01:39.360> then<00:01:39.720> come<00:01:39.930> back<00:01:39.960> out<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.439> face<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
and then come back out the face of the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.389 
and then come back out the face of the
speaker<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.909> didn't<00:01:42.210> want<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:43.579> the<00:01:44.579> 45<00:01:44.909> s<00:01:45.390> in

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
speaker I didn't want that the 45 s in

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.219 
speaker I didn't want that the 45 s in
the<00:01:47.399> corners<00:01:47.790> are<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.329> reflect<00:01:48.720> all<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:48.960> air

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the corners are to reflect all the air

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.100 
the corners are to reflect all the air
to<00:01:49.799> try<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.159> make<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.310> smoother<00:01:51.110> I've

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
to try and make it smoother I've

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.240 
to try and make it smoother I've
calculated<00:01:52.530> my<00:01:53.189> centerline<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
calculated my centerline of the

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.209 
calculated my centerline of the
transmission<00:01:56.250> line<00:01:56.460> as<00:01:56.820> follows<00:01:58.040> this<00:01:59.040> is

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
transmission line as follows this is

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.280 
transmission line as follows this is
four<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.610> fifteen<00:01:59.729> sixteenth<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.869> channel

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
four and fifteen sixteenth this channel

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.050 
four and fifteen sixteenth this channel
I'm<00:02:01.649> going<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.950> draw<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> center<00:02:02.460> line<00:02:02.579> through

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
I'm going to draw a center line through

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.850 
I'm going to draw a center line through
it<00:02:04.130> so<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.520> knew<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> wanted<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:07.020> area<00:02:07.649> to

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
it so I knew that I wanted this area to

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.919 
it so I knew that I wanted this area to
be<00:02:07.979> at<00:02:08.099> least<00:02:08.250> four<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.910> fifteen<00:02:09.330> sixteenths

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
be at least four and fifteen sixteenths

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.410 
be at least four and fifteen sixteenths
so<00:02:10.800> when<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.009> made<00:02:11.250> these<00:02:11.430> forty<00:02:11.760> fives<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.239> drew

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
so when I made these forty fives I drew

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.580 
so when I made these forty fives I drew
a<00:02:12.450> line

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
a line

for the 45 perpendicular to it for in
1516<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:19.160> then<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.190> come<00:02:20.459> up<00:02:20.610> like<00:02:20.819> this

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
1516 and then I come up like this

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.430 
1516 and then I come up like this
parallel<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.040> 45<00:02:23.670> line<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.239> that's<00:02:25.050> I

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
parallel to this 45 line and that's I

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.619 
parallel to this 45 line and that's I
made<00:02:26.250> sure<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.489> there<00:02:26.819> was<00:02:26.849> enough<00:02:26.970> room<00:02:27.599> for

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
made sure that there was enough room for

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.210 
made sure that there was enough room for
to<00:02:28.290> keep<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.739> four<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.430> fifteen<00:02:30.209> sixteenths

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
to keep a four and fifteen sixteenths

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.759 
to keep a four and fifteen sixteenths
channel<00:02:32.220> all<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.760> way<00:02:32.879> through<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.660> box<00:02:33.870> and

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
channel all the way through the box and

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.320 
channel all the way through the box and
what<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.010> would<00:02:35.129> do<00:02:35.370> is<00:02:35.519> I<00:02:35.640> took<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:36.000> center

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
what I would do is I took the center

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:58.860 
what I would do is I took the center
line<00:02:36.510> like<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:40.069> would<00:02:41.069> mark<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:41.519> out

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.580 

and<00:03:00.430> that<00:03:01.430> would<00:03:01.610> be<00:03:01.910> this<00:03:02.720> would<00:03:02.930> be<00:03:02.990> factored

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
and that would be this would be factored

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.100 
and that would be this would be factored
factored<00:03:04.070> into<00:03:04.220> my<00:03:04.340> line<00:03:04.670> length<00:03:04.970> so<00:03:05.780> when<00:03:06.080> I

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
factored into my line length so when I

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.780 
factored into my line length so when I
measured<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.650> line<00:03:06.860> length<00:03:07.100> it<00:03:07.340> wasn't<00:03:07.640> from

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
measured the line length it wasn't from

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.760 
measured the line length it wasn't from
here<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:08.750> 45<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.740> the<00:03:09.830> 45<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.420> 45<00:03:11.870> it

here to the 45 to the 45 to the 45 it
was<00:03:12.950> actually<00:03:13.310> across<00:03:14.120> this<00:03:14.390> way<00:03:14.630> down<00:03:15.500> on<00:03:15.740> a

I've actually already deleted the

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.730 
I've actually already deleted the
geometry<00:03:23.900> but<00:03:24.080> it<00:03:24.200> ended<00:03:24.470> up<00:03:24.530> looking

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
geometry but it ended up looking

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.970

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.500 

another<00:03:30.980> trick<00:03:31.340> that<00:03:31.370> you<00:03:31.670> can<00:03:31.850> use<00:03:32.090> when<00:03:32.390> you

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
another trick that you can use when you

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.120 
another trick that you can use when you
design<00:03:32.990> your<00:03:33.020> box<00:03:33.410> is<00:03:33.740> you<00:03:33.860> can<00:03:34.010> actually

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
design your box is you can actually

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.190 
design your box is you can actually
close<00:03:34.490> it<00:03:34.730> off<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:36.190> then<00:03:37.190> click<00:03:37.370> on<00:03:37.670> draw<00:03:38.209> our

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
close it off and then click on draw our

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.030 
close it off and then click on draw our
tools<00:03:40.150> text<00:03:41.150> click<00:03:42.050> on<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.230> inside<00:03:42.830> of<00:03:42.980> the

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
tools text click on the inside of the

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.970 
tools text click on the inside of the
box<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.970> it<00:03:44.600> actually<00:03:44.750> gives<00:03:45.080> you<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.320> square

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
box and it actually gives you the square

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.780 
box and it actually gives you the square
feet<00:03:46.520> and<00:03:46.820> if<00:03:47.570> you<00:03:47.660> multiply<00:03:47.840> that<00:03:48.470> by<00:03:49.780> the

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
feet and if you multiply that by the

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.600 
feet and if you multiply that by the
amount<00:03:52.790> of<00:03:53.240> feet<00:03:53.900> that<00:03:54.140> your<00:03:54.320> box<00:03:54.650> is<00:03:54.980> in<00:03:55.340> depth

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
amount of feet that your box is in depth

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.530 
amount of feet that your box is in depth
you<00:03:56.480> can<00:03:56.510> actually<00:03:56.840> get<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.380> cubic<00:03:58.040> feet<00:03:58.250> so

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
you can actually get the cubic feet so

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.500 
you can actually get the cubic feet so
in<00:03:59.540> my<00:03:59.690> case<00:04:00.280> my<00:04:01.280> box<00:04:01.520> was<00:04:01.730> 11<00:04:02.270> and<00:04:02.390> a<00:04:02.480> half

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
in my case my box was 11 and a half

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:11.620 
in my case my box was 11 and a half
inches<00:04:03.440> deep<00:04:04.280> so<00:04:09.280> 11<00:04:10.280> and<00:04:10.430> a<00:04:10.459> half<00:04:10.510> divided<00:04:11.510> by

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
inches deep so 11 and a half divided by

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.550 
inches deep so 11 and a half divided by
12<00:04:11.989> to<00:04:12.470> convert<00:04:12.860> to<00:04:13.070> feet<00:04:13.390> which<00:04:14.390> is<00:04:14.500> 0.95

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
12 to convert to feet which is 0.95

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.680 
12 to convert to feet which is 0.95
eight<00:04:15.830> and<00:04:16.070> then<00:04:16.340> you<00:04:16.370> multiply<00:04:16.459> that<00:04:16.940> by<00:04:17.150> your

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
eight and then you multiply that by your

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.920 
eight and then you multiply that by your
five<00:04:17.959> point<00:04:18.320> one<00:04:18.500> eight<00:04:18.769> seven<00:04:19.130> eight<00:04:22.930> four

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
need to shorten your box you know that

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.510 
need to shorten your box you know that
there's<00:05:25.020> three<00:05:25.319> channels<00:05:25.740> in<00:05:25.889> it<00:05:26.039> in<00:05:26.189> this

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
there's three channels in it in this

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.909 
there's three channels in it in this
case<00:05:27.259> all<00:05:28.259> you<00:05:28.469> would<00:05:28.710> have<00:05:28.830> to<00:05:29.009> do<00:05:29.159> is<00:05:30.919> create

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
case all you would have to do is create

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.100 
case all you would have to do is create
a<00:05:31.979> line<00:05:32.279> if<00:05:32.699> you<00:05:33.120> knew<00:05:33.240> your<00:05:33.389> box<00:05:33.629> had<00:05:33.900> to<00:05:34.020> be

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
a line if you knew your box had to be

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.769 
a line if you knew your box had to be
shortened<00:05:34.529> by<00:05:34.650> three<00:05:34.979> inches<00:05:35.389> then<00:05:36.389> you<00:05:36.419> know

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:36.779 
shortened by three inches then you know

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:41.119 
shortened by three inches then you know
that<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.259> entire<00:05:38.629> model<00:05:39.629> can<00:05:40.590> be<00:05:40.620> shortened

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:41.129 
that the entire model can be shortened

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.219 
that the entire model can be shortened
by<00:05:41.159> one<00:05:41.430> inch<00:05:41.639> and<00:05:41.939> that<00:05:42.120> would<00:05:42.300> equal<00:05:42.330> three

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
by one inch and that would equal three

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.890 
by one inch and that would equal three
inches<00:05:43.589> across<00:05:44.310> the<00:05:44.909> entire<00:05:45.180> transmission

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
inches across the entire transmission

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.329 
inches across the entire transmission
line<00:05:46.050> because<00:05:46.319> it<00:05:46.439> intersects<00:05:46.889> it<00:05:47.039> at<00:05:47.129> three

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:47.339 
line because it intersects it at three

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:52.790 
line because it intersects it at three
different<00:05:47.639> points<00:05:50.960> so<00:05:51.960> what<00:05:52.110> I<00:05:52.139> could<00:05:52.259> do<00:05:52.469> here

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
different points so what I could do here

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.019 
different points so what I could do here
now<00:05:52.830> is<00:05:53.039> draw<00:05:53.550> another<00:05:53.789> line<00:05:54.439> one<00:05:55.439> inch<00:05:55.589> over

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:56.029 
now is draw another line one inch over

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:02.839 
now is draw another line one inch over
one<00:05:57.029> inch<00:05:57.210> down<00:06:00.650> and<00:06:01.650> all<00:06:02.009> we<00:06:02.039> have<00:06:02.279> to<00:06:02.430> do<00:06:02.610> is

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
one inch down and all we have to do is

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:12.879 
one inch down and all we have to do is
remove<00:06:03.270> these<00:06:03.599> Center<00:06:04.349> lines

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.320 

once<00:06:13.889> we<00:06:14.070> remove<00:06:14.250> the<00:06:14.430> centerline's

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
once we remove the centerline's

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.430 
once we remove the centerline's
you<00:06:15.570> can<00:06:15.750> select<00:06:16.940> this<00:06:17.940> half<00:06:18.270> and<00:06:18.750> using<00:06:19.320> the

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
you can select this half and using the

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.580 
you can select this half and using the
move<00:06:19.919> tool<00:06:19.949> slide<00:06:20.880> it<00:06:21.150> over<00:06:21.419> now<00:06:22.350> we've<00:06:22.560> just

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
move tool slide it over now we've just

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.830 
move tool slide it over now we've just
reduced<00:06:23.220> the<00:06:23.370> size<00:06:23.639> of<00:06:23.790> our<00:06:23.910> box<00:06:24.060> by<00:06:24.389> three

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
reduced the size of our box by three

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.820 
reduced the size of our box by three
inches<00:06:26.600> now<00:06:27.600> for<00:06:27.840> the<00:06:27.930> tapered<00:06:28.320> section<00:06:28.530> of

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
inches now for the tapered section of

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.520 
inches now for the tapered section of
this<00:06:28.979> box<00:06:29.449> what<00:06:30.449> I<00:06:30.479> had<00:06:30.720> to<00:06:30.870> do<00:06:32.720> was<00:06:33.720> simply

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
this box what I had to do was simply

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:41.870 
this box what I had to do was simply
redraw<00:06:35.040> the<00:06:35.100> taper<00:06:38.840> like<00:06:39.840> so<00:06:40.669> remove<00:06:41.669> the

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 
redraw the taper like so remove the

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:50.390 
redraw the taper like so remove the
centerline<00:06:42.360> and<00:06:44.300> your<00:06:45.300> box<00:06:45.540> is<00:06:45.930> now<00:06:49.400> three

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
centerline and your box is now three

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.940 
centerline and your box is now three
inches<00:06:50.700> smaller<00:06:51.150> than<00:06:51.389> it<00:06:51.479> was<00:06:51.740> and<00:06:52.740> that's

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:52.950 
inches smaller than it was and that's

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.520 
inches smaller than it was and that's
how<00:06:53.160> I<00:06:53.190> fine-tune<00:06:53.850> that<00:06:54.120> now<00:06:54.780> if<00:06:54.960> you<00:06:55.020> if<00:06:55.350> you

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
how I fine-tune that now if you if you

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.050 
how I fine-tune that now if you if you
really<00:06:55.710> wanted<00:06:56.070> to<00:06:56.160> get<00:06:56.250> anal<00:06:56.580> with<00:06:56.729> it<00:06:56.940> you

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.060 
really wanted to get anal with it you

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.879 
really wanted to get anal with it you
could<00:06:57.470> use<00:06:58.470> the<00:06:58.710> tools<00:06:59.180> text<00:07:00.410> redo<00:07:01.410> the<00:07:01.560> cubic

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:01.889 
could use the tools text redo the cubic

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:03.980 
could use the tools text redo the cubic
feet<00:07:02.100> but<00:07:02.490> I<00:07:02.520> found<00:07:02.850> that<00:07:03.030> after<00:07:03.270> you've<00:07:03.690> done

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990 
feet but I found that after you've done

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.890 
feet but I found that after you've done
that<00:07:04.260> once<00:07:04.680> or<00:07:04.830> twice<00:07:05.330> the<00:07:06.330> design<00:07:06.720> is

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 
that once or twice the design is

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.570 
that once or twice the design is
actually<00:07:07.020> close<00:07:07.440> enough<00:07:07.770> that<00:07:07.800> it<00:07:08.250> doesn't

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580 
actually close enough that it doesn't

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:17.980 
actually close enough that it doesn't
really<00:07:08.850> change<00:07:08.940> the<00:07:09.300> parameters<00:07:09.810> that<00:07:10.050> much

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:17.990 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.050
