00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.660 
you have that right it's not going to
work<00:03:24.019> so<00:03:25.019> that's<00:03:25.230> just<00:03:25.350> one<00:03:25.500> command<00:03:26.010> I'm

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
work so that's just one command I'm

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.890 
work so that's just one command I'm
going<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.850> exit<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.209> setup<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.660> saves

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
going to exit the setup it saves

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.509 
going to exit the setup it saves
automatically<00:03:28.410> when<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:28.980> go<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.280> device

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
automatically when you go to the device

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.520 
automatically when you go to the device
i<00:03:29.700> just<00:03:29.880> made<00:03:30.090> which<00:03:30.570> i<00:03:30.690> believe<00:03:30.750> it's<00:03:31.260> this

one<00:03:31.970> sonic<00:03:32.970> man<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.989> it<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:34.320> then<00:03:35.010> when<00:03:35.130> hit

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
one sonic man to it and then when hit

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.259 
one sonic man to it and then when hit
power<00:03:35.489> you<00:03:35.640> want<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.820> make<00:03:35.910> sure<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.120> have

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
power you want to make sure you have

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.630 
power you want to make sure you have
your<00:03:36.300> red<00:03:36.600> our<00:03:36.720> device<00:03:36.959> somewhere<00:03:37.590> where<00:03:38.430> it

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
your red our device somewhere where it

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.530 
your red our device somewhere where it
can<00:03:39.470> access<00:03:40.470> send<00:03:40.980> signals<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.670> your<00:03:41.820> tvs<00:03:42.239> and

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540

there so you guys one thing on a lie tvs
up<00:03:50.730> there<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:50.970> watching<00:03:51.269> food<00:03:51.420> network<00:03:52.370> and

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
up there and watching food network and

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
up there and watching food network and
when<00:03:53.489> hit<00:03:53.640> power<00:03:53.820> on<00:03:53.970> hopefully<00:03:54.480> this<00:03:54.660> works

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
when hit power on hopefully this works

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.410 
when hit power on hopefully this works
yeah<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.900> there<00:03:58.170> you<00:03:58.260> go<00:03:58.320> tease<00:03:58.680> turned<00:03:59.130> off

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
yeah and there you go tease turned off

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.180 
yeah and there you go tease turned off
dogging<00:04:00.420> systems<00:04:00.840> on<00:04:01.230> i<00:04:01.500> can<00:04:01.769> turn<00:04:01.920> that<00:04:02.040> off

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
dogging systems on i can turn that off

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.509 
dogging systems on i can turn that off
to<00:04:02.400> watch<00:04:02.760> this<00:04:03.000> guy's<00:04:03.680> let's<00:04:04.680> go<00:04:04.800> back<00:04:05.010> mitts

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
to watch this guy's let's go back mitts

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.920 
to watch this guy's let's go back mitts
docking<00:04:06.030> system<00:04:06.450> send<00:04:07.080> to<00:04:07.230> man<00:04:08.570> see<00:04:09.570> if<00:04:09.810> you

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
docking system send to man see if you
