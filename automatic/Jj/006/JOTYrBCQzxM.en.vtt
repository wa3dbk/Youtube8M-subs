00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160 

I<00:00:00.439> think<00:00:01.439> um<00:00:01.650> that<00:00:02.899> oftentimes<00:00:03.899> it's<00:00:04.080> the

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
I think um that oftentimes it's the

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.789 
I think um that oftentimes it's the
groupings<00:00:05.069> and<00:00:05.720> pairings<00:00:06.720> and<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.379> being

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
groupings and pairings and and being

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.200 
groupings and pairings and and being
able<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:09.170> find<00:00:10.250> students<00:00:11.250> who<00:00:11.280> can<00:00:11.639> work<00:00:11.940> well

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
able to find students who can work well

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.530 
able to find students who can work well
together<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:13.700> support<00:00:14.700> each<00:00:14.880> other<00:00:15.059> because

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
together and support each other because

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.570 
together and support each other because
sometimes<00:00:16.020> they<00:00:16.320> they<00:00:16.590> do<00:00:16.770> well<00:00:17.220> with<00:00:17.400> that

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
sometimes they they do well with that

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.660 
sometimes they they do well with that
and<00:00:17.730> they<00:00:17.820> thrive<00:00:18.230> being<00:00:19.230> able<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.529> help<00:00:20.430> each

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
and they thrive being able to help each

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.429 
and they thrive being able to help each
other<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.210> sometimes<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.840> doesn't<00:00:22.020> work<00:00:22.140> as

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
other and sometimes it doesn't work as

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.990 
other and sometimes it doesn't work as
well<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.010> change<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:24.119> but<00:00:25.080> that

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
well and you change that but that

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.099 
well and you change that but that
definitely<00:00:27.000> there<00:00:27.330> are<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.539> groupings<00:00:27.930> and

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
definitely there are the groupings and

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.580 
definitely there are the groupings and
pairings<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.849> big<00:00:30.119> part<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.720> in

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
pairings is a is a big part of that in

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.560 
pairings is a is a big part of that in
addition<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.009> groupings<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.850> pairings<00:00:33.239> I

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
addition to groupings and pairings I

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.950 
addition to groupings and pairings I
also<00:00:33.989> focus<00:00:34.320> on<00:00:34.620> rope<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.700> my<00:00:36.300> case<00:00:36.540> with<00:00:36.809> it

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
also focus on rope and my case with it

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.510 
also focus on rope and my case with it
interpreter<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.680> room<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.040> have<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.370> focus

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
interpreter in the room I have to focus

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.729 
interpreter in the room I have to focus
on<00:00:38.820> preferential<00:00:39.510> seating<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.530> learner

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
on preferential seating for that learner

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.900 
on preferential seating for that learner
that<00:00:40.980> has<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.219> need<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.500> fortunately<00:00:43.500> enough

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
that has a need and fortunately enough

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.360 
that has a need and fortunately enough
he<00:00:44.910> has<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.570> system<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.440> allows<00:00:46.829> him<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.039> hear

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
he has a system that allows him to hear

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.549 
he has a system that allows him to hear
learners<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.210> are<00:00:48.329> very<00:00:48.510> close<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.930> him<00:00:49.110> so

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
learners that are very close to him so

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.850 
learners that are very close to him so
he's<00:00:49.770> able<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.070> participate<00:00:50.539> quite<00:00:51.860> easily

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
he's able to participate quite easily

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.240 
he's able to participate quite easily
with<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.699> learners<00:00:54.000> around<00:00:54.300> him<00:00:54.770> when<00:00:55.770> we're

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
with the learners around him when we're

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.920 
with the learners around him when we're
talking<00:00:56.370> discourse<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.480> then<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
talking discourse and then we have the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.959 
talking discourse and then we have the
sign<00:00:58.109> interpreter<00:00:58.620> for<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.280> whole<00:00:59.460> class

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
sign interpreter for the whole class

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.930 
sign interpreter for the whole class
so<00:01:01.039> preferential<00:01:02.039> seating<00:01:02.190> as<00:01:02.579> well<00:01:02.850> as

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
so preferential seating as well as

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.729 
so preferential seating as well as
grouping<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.870> think<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> grouping<00:01:04.500> just

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
grouping and I think the grouping just

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.500 
grouping and I think the grouping just
to<00:01:04.860> stayed<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> little<00:01:05.250> bit<00:01:05.460> more<00:01:05.640> about<00:01:06.270> that

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
to stayed a little bit more about that

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.480 
to stayed a little bit more about that
it's<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:06.990> important<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.740> try<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.250> think

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
it's really important to try and think

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.570 
it's really important to try and think
about<00:01:08.760> how<00:01:08.909> learners<00:01:09.210> learn<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.530> who<00:01:11.369> they

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
about how learners learn and who they

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.280 
about how learners learn and who they
can<00:01:11.640> learn<00:01:11.880> best<00:01:12.270> from<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.780> class<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.229> I

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
can learn best from in the class and I

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.700 
can learn best from in the class and I
find<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:14.509> identifying<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:16.049> know<00:01:16.080> kind<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.590> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
find that identifying you know kind of a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.100 
find that identifying you know kind of a
little<00:01:17.549> group<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.299> learners<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.750> really

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
little group of learners that really

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.960 
little group of learners that really
work<00:01:19.290> well<00:01:19.530> together<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.920> then<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.250> move

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
work well together and then I can move

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.870 
work well together and then I can move
those<00:01:21.210> kids<00:01:21.509> around<00:01:21.780> throughout<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.439> year

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
those kids around throughout the year

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.840 
those kids around throughout the year
and<00:01:23.880> after<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.330> period<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.630> time<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.869> can<00:01:25.850> very

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
and after a period of time you can very

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.700 
and after a period of time you can very
well<00:01:26.939> make<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.420> sometimes<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.259> self-select

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
well make it sometimes to self-select

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.100 
well make it sometimes to self-select
where<00:01:29.189> their<00:01:29.549> shoulder<00:01:29.850> partner<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.270> just<00:01:30.720> to

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
where their shoulder partner is just to

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.319 
where their shoulder partner is just to
kind<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.560> get<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> gauge<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.579> who<00:01:33.060> are<00:01:33.210> they

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
kind of get a gauge of who are they

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.670 
kind of get a gauge of who are they
comfortable<00:01:33.570> working<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.380> if<00:01:34.470> it's

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
comfortable working with and if it's

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.950 
comfortable working with and if it's
working<00:01:35.040> for<00:01:35.400> them<00:01:35.460> academically<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.630> also

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
working for them academically and also

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.240 
working for them academically and also
emotionally<00:01:37.560> because<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.950> they<00:01:38.040> feel<00:01:38.220> safe

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
emotionally because that they feel safe

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.370 
emotionally because that they feel safe
with<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.060> person<00:01:39.540> then<00:01:40.079> they're<00:01:40.200> going<00:01:40.290> to

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
with this person then they're going to

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.179 
with this person then they're going to
feel<00:01:40.530> comfortable<00:01:40.710> sharing<00:01:41.420> their<00:01:43.189> ideas

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
feel comfortable sharing their ideas

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.920 
feel comfortable sharing their ideas
whether<00:01:44.549> they're<00:01:44.820> correct<00:01:44.970> or<00:01:45.210> incorrect<00:01:45.360> and

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
whether they're correct or incorrect and

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.190 
whether they're correct or incorrect and
so<00:01:46.430> seating<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.579> definitely<00:01:48.149> an<00:01:48.750> important

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
so seating is definitely an important

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.800 
so seating is definitely an important
part<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.299> also<00:01:51.479> think<00:01:51.720> that

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
part of that but I also think that

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.719 
part of that but I also think that
multiple<00:01:52.110> representations<00:01:52.920> lends<00:01:53.280> itself<00:01:53.610> to

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
multiple representations lends itself to

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.469 
multiple representations lends itself to
that<00:01:53.990> if<00:01:54.990> you're<00:01:55.229> working<00:01:55.439> on<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:56.310> word<00:01:56.969> problem

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
that if you're working on a word problem

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.850 
that if you're working on a word problem
and<00:01:57.659> you're<00:01:57.810> asking<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.290> students<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.829> show

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
and you're asking the students to show

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.840 
and you're asking the students to show
their<00:01:59.040> work<00:01:59.659> algebraically<00:02:00.710> or<00:02:01.850> actually

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
their work algebraically or actually

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.899 
their work algebraically or actually
restate<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.689> words<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:05.310> students<00:02:05.729> then

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
restate it in words the students then

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.960 
restate it in words the students then
has<00:02:06.090> options<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.229> how<00:02:08.009> they<00:02:08.250> show<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.610> their

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
has options of how they show you their

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.600 
has options of how they show you their
understanding

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
understanding

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.760 
understanding
of<00:02:09.940> what<00:02:10.210> you're<00:02:10.360> working<00:02:10.509> on<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.080> so<00:02:11.680> the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
of what you're working on and so the

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.200 
of what you're working on and so the
multiple<00:02:12.010> representations<00:02:12.610> recites<00:02:13.060> the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
multiple representations recites the

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.090 
multiple representations recites the
mathematical<00:02:13.810> part<00:02:13.990> also<00:02:14.470> allows<00:02:14.830> there<00:02:15.070> to

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
mathematical part also allows there to

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.180 
mathematical part also allows there to
be<00:02:15.310> some<00:02:15.520> differentiation<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:16.300> Frenchy<00:02:16.720> ation

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
be some differentiation to Frenchy ation

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.510 
be some differentiation to Frenchy ation
for<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.250> students<00:02:19.470> yeah<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.650> agree<00:02:20.830> with<00:02:21.370> all

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
for the students yeah I I agree with all

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.220 
for the students yeah I I agree with all
I<00:02:21.670> think<00:02:21.730> grouping<00:02:22.270> is<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.450> really<00:02:22.720> really

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
I think grouping is a really really

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.640 
I think grouping is a really really
important<00:02:24.090> strategy<00:02:25.090> for<00:02:25.120> how<00:02:25.990> to<00:02:26.050> pet<00:02:26.470> it

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
important strategy for how to pet it

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.460 
important strategy for how to pet it
address<00:02:27.240> diversity<00:02:28.240> in<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.390> classroom<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:29.260> I

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
address diversity in the classroom and I

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.280 
address diversity in the classroom and I
also<00:02:29.620> think<00:02:30.010> private<00:02:31.000> think<00:02:31.240> time<00:02:31.300> is<00:02:31.750> really

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
also think private think time is really

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.560 
also think private think time is really
important<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:33.010> get<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.460> lot<00:02:33.670> like<00:02:34.000> especially

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
important I get a lot like especially

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:35.940 
important I get a lot like especially
where<00:02:34.720> I<00:02:34.750> teach<00:02:34.840> there's<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.260> lot<00:02:35.410> of<00:02:35.530> students

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
where I teach there's a lot of students

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.130 
where I teach there's a lot of students
where<00:02:36.130> they<00:02:36.790> raise<00:02:37.240> their<00:02:37.450> hand<00:02:37.480> really<00:02:37.900> quick

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
where they raise their hand really quick

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.750 
where they raise their hand really quick
they<00:02:38.350> know<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.620> answer<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.370> then<00:02:39.610> when<00:02:39.730> I

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
they know the answer and then when I

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.010 
they know the answer and then when I
asked<00:02:39.970> them<00:02:40.090> why<00:02:40.150> they<00:02:40.300> have<00:02:40.570> a<00:02:40.600> hard<00:02:40.870> time

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
asked them why they have a hard time

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.210 
asked them why they have a hard time
explaining<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.830> they'll<00:02:41.950> tell<00:02:42.190> you

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
explaining it and they'll tell you

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.250 
explaining it and they'll tell you
they'll<00:02:42.760> tell<00:02:42.880> you<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.300> class<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:44.050> know

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
they'll tell you to the class I I know

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.500 
they'll tell you to the class I I know
it<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:44.650> just<00:02:45.160> can't<00:02:45.490> explain<00:02:45.880> it<00:02:46.150> in<00:02:46.360> their<00:02:46.480> own

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
it I just can't explain it in their own

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.110 
it I just can't explain it in their own
way<00:02:46.810> so<00:02:47.380> I<00:02:47.410> think<00:02:48.040> private<00:02:48.310> thing<00:02:48.610> time<00:02:48.820> giving

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
way so I think private thing time giving

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.970 
way so I think private thing time giving
them<00:02:49.209> time<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.450> process<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:50.050> and<00:02:50.440> then<00:02:50.620> sharing

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
them time to process it and then sharing

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.470 
them time to process it and then sharing
with<00:02:51.190> your<00:02:51.310> partner<00:02:51.670> before<00:02:51.850> they<00:02:52.090> share<00:02:52.300> out

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
with your partner before they share out

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.850 
with your partner before they share out
that's<00:02:52.989> made<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.260> lot<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.590> them<00:02:53.709> more

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
that's made a lot of them more

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.190 
that's made a lot of them more
comfortable<00:02:54.150> with<00:02:55.150> sharing<00:02:55.180> when<00:02:56.050> they're

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
comfortable with sharing when they're

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.380 
comfortable with sharing when they're
when<00:02:56.440> they're<00:02:56.489> when<00:02:57.489> maybe<00:02:57.730> language<00:02:58.150> is<00:02:58.270> an

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
when they're when maybe language is an

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.010 
when they're when maybe language is an
issue<00:02:58.570> or<00:02:59.020> something<00:02:59.470> else<00:02:59.590> is<00:02:59.739> an<00:02:59.860> issue
