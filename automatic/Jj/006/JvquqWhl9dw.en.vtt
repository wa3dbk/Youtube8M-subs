00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
you can do so that's pretty much it like

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.310 
you can do so that's pretty much it like
that<00:03:09.410> so<00:03:09.620> there<00:03:09.950> it<00:03:10.070> is<00:03:10.160> so<00:03:10.570> if<00:03:11.570> you<00:03:11.810> have<00:03:12.170> some
