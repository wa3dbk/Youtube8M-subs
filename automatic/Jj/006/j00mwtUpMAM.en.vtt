know it's it's a high quality piece but
it's<00:03:36.489> not<00:03:36.700> because<00:03:37.359> it's<00:03:37.660> wood<00:03:37.930> it's<00:03:38.170> not<00:03:38.350> it

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
it's not because it's wood it's not it

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.270

metal piece and I can tell you that I

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.460 
metal piece and I can tell you that I

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
can move it up and down on the wood just

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.920 
can move it up and down on the wood just
a<00:03:47.769> smidge<00:03:48.130> you<00:03:48.459> know<00:03:48.579> maybe<00:03:48.880> not<00:03:49.660> even<00:03:49.780> a

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
a smidge you know maybe not even a

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.319 
a smidge you know maybe not even a
millimeter<00:03:50.200> but<00:03:50.530> I<00:03:50.590> can<00:03:50.769> feel<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.730> wood<00:03:51.910> kind

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
millimeter but I can feel the wood kind

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.120 
millimeter but I can feel the wood kind
of<00:03:52.389> moving<00:03:52.690> in<00:03:52.930> so<00:03:53.290> maybe<00:03:53.560> I<00:03:53.680> will<00:03:53.739> take<00:03:54.040> it

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
of moving in so maybe I will take it

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.629 
of moving in so maybe I will take it
apart<00:03:54.310> put<00:03:54.489> those<00:03:54.670> those<00:03:55.540> vital<00:03:55.959> pieces<00:03:56.290> on

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
apart put those those vital pieces on

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.160 
apart put those those vital pieces on
and<00:03:57.639> then<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:58.000> last<00:03:58.209> part<00:03:58.600> is<00:03:58.750> once<00:03:58.989> you<00:03:59.049> get

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
and then the last part is once you get

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.259 
and then the last part is once you get
that<00:03:59.319> in<00:03:59.380> you<00:03:59.950> can<00:04:00.100> just<00:04:00.250> drop<00:04:00.459> in<00:04:00.730> this<00:04:00.910> metal

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
that in you can just drop in this metal

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.940 
that in you can just drop in this metal
backing<00:04:01.780> I<00:04:01.989> wasn't<00:04:02.410> sure<00:04:02.530> if<00:04:02.620> this<00:04:02.739> was<00:04:02.799> a

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
backing I wasn't sure if this was a

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.410 
backing I wasn't sure if this was a
piece<00:04:03.220> that<00:04:03.250> had<00:04:03.579> to<00:04:03.670> be<00:04:03.760> installed<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:04.269> then

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
piece that had to be installed and then

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.059 
piece that had to be installed and then
was<00:04:04.540> hauled<00:04:04.690> on<00:04:04.840> by<00:04:04.959> the<00:04:05.019> case<00:04:05.260> but<00:04:05.500> like<00:04:05.950> I

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
was hauled on by the case but like I

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.490 
was hauled on by the case but like I
said<00:04:06.280> it<00:04:06.430> is<00:04:06.579> just<00:04:06.609> adhesive<00:04:07.329> it<00:04:07.810> sticks<00:04:08.319> right

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
said it is just adhesive it sticks right

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.470 
said it is just adhesive it sticks right
to<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.739> back<00:04:08.889> like<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.220> leather<00:04:09.459> like<00:04:10.209> a<00:04:10.239> vinyl

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
to the back like a leather like a vinyl

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.840 
to the back like a leather like a vinyl
skin<00:04:10.870> it<00:04:11.680> is<00:04:12.250> a<00:04:12.730> good<00:04:13.420> fit<00:04:13.690> but<00:04:14.230> obviously<00:04:14.850> you

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
skin it is a good fit but obviously you

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.330 
skin it is a good fit but obviously you
can<00:04:16.030> see<00:04:16.060> that<00:04:16.600> my<00:04:16.750> phone<00:04:17.289> back<00:04:17.709> is<00:04:17.950> peeking

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
can see that my phone back is peeking

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.029 
can see that my phone back is peeking
through<00:04:18.370> here<00:04:18.789> so<00:04:19.000> again<00:04:19.120> not<00:04:19.720> exactly<00:04:20.039> the

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
through here so again not exactly the

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.730 
through here so again not exactly the
most<00:04:21.280> precise<00:04:21.820> fit<00:04:22.120> in<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.360> world

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
most precise fit in the world

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.809 
most precise fit in the world
but<00:04:22.860> looks<00:04:23.520> nice<00:04:23.819> and<00:04:24.470> for<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.560> money<00:04:25.860> it's<00:04:26.400> a

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:26.819 
but looks nice and for the money it's a

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:29.540 
but looks nice and for the money it's a
pretty<00:04:27.240> good<00:04:27.419> value<00:04:27.979> the<00:04:28.979> cutout<00:04:29.250> here<00:04:29.460> is<00:04:29.520> a

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
pretty good value the cutout here is a

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.290 
pretty good value the cutout here is a
little<00:04:29.880> weird

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
little weird

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.480 
little weird
I'm<00:04:30.780> not<00:04:31.050> sure<00:04:31.259> why<00:04:31.470> I<00:04:31.500> think<00:04:31.830> it's<00:04:32.130> kind<00:04:32.460> of

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
I'm not sure why I think it's kind of

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.939 
I'm not sure why I think it's kind of
their<00:04:32.669> logo<00:04:32.880> or<00:04:33.120> something<00:04:33.470> as<00:04:34.470> you<00:04:34.620> can<00:04:34.740> see

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
their logo or something as you can see

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.159 
their logo or something as you can see
it's<00:04:35.130> kind<00:04:35.400> of<00:04:35.460> in<00:04:35.550> that<00:04:35.669> shape<00:04:35.970> but<00:04:36.210> it's<00:04:36.569> it's

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
it's kind of in that shape but it's it's

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.670 
it's kind of in that shape but it's it's
a<00:04:37.259> little<00:04:37.590> funky<00:04:37.830> right<00:04:38.699> around<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.680> flash

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
a little funky right around the flash

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.120 
a little funky right around the flash
there<00:04:41.009> so<00:04:41.520> anyway<00:04:41.789> this<00:04:42.319> element<00:04:43.319> case<00:04:43.620> wood

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
there so anyway this element case wood

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.150 
there so anyway this element case wood
and<00:04:44.310> metal<00:04:44.720> the<00:04:45.720> metal<00:04:45.900> finishes<00:04:46.710> really<00:04:46.919> what

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
and metal the metal finishes really what

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.279 
and metal the metal finishes really what
kind<00:04:47.370> of<00:04:47.400> varies<00:04:47.759> if<00:04:48.300> you<00:04:48.449> order<00:04:48.900> this<00:04:49.080> online

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
kind of varies if you order this online

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.559 
kind of varies if you order this online
you<00:04:49.530> can<00:04:49.830> get<00:04:49.949> them<00:04:50.039> in<00:04:50.130> a<00:04:50.190> gunmetal<00:04:50.550> I<00:04:50.910> think

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:51.569 
you can get them in a gunmetal I think

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.070 
you can get them in a gunmetal I think
even<00:04:51.750> a<00:04:51.870> black<00:04:52.340> so<00:04:53.340> that's<00:04:53.849> how<00:04:54.630> it<00:04:54.720> looks<00:04:54.930> but

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
even a black so that's how it looks but

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.290 
even a black so that's how it looks but
I<00:04:55.289> really<00:04:55.680> think<00:04:55.830> it's<00:04:56.099> a<00:04:56.220> nice<00:04:56.370> case<00:04:56.669> like<00:04:57.240> I

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
I really think it's a nice case like I

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.610 
I really think it's a nice case like I
said<00:04:57.479> for<00:04:57.630> the<00:04:57.720> money<00:04:57.900> you're<00:04:58.380> probably

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
said for the money you're probably

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.490 
said for the money you're probably
looking<00:04:58.979> at<00:04:59.039> about<00:04:59.099> 30<00:04:59.610> bucks<00:04:59.880> and<00:05:00.500> overall

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
looking at about 30 bucks and overall

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.320 
looking at about 30 bucks and overall
it's<00:05:01.770> kind<00:05:02.250> of<00:05:02.340> unique<00:05:02.460> and<00:05:02.789> I<00:05:02.849> haven't<00:05:03.090> really

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330
