00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.730
 Find Home Value for 3 in Issue 4.356 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.190
 When I think of the household value of a number 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.720
 If you have gained sufficient experience through resolving issues, this will be 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.600
 A second nature, when I see such a thing 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.320
 It would be best to analyze the number, if I could be re-written 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.880
 Issue 4.356 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.940
 I will write it 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.210
 Different colors 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:33.420
 If 4.356 equals, think how 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.360
 I speak 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:48.190
 4000 + 300 + 50 + 6 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.600
 The solution can be found by pronouncing numbers 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.810
 Four thousand, three hundred, and sixty-five 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.060
 Another way to think about it is 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:07.520
 To say 4 thousand + 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:16.880
 3 hundred + 50, or can say 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.040
 5 + 6 scores 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.420
 Or we can say 6 individual 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.570
 +6 Individual 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.620
 If we go back to the original number 4.356, it will be 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.440
 It's the same 4, I'll write it here 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.230
 I will write it like this 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:51.020
 It is the same 4 thousand, 3 hundred, 5 dozen 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.670
 Then 6 individual 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.820
 The question is what is the household value of 3 in number 4.356 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.120
 Now we are interested in number 3 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.260
 And worth home 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.090
 It is in the status of hundreds 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.970
 If put 4 place 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.850
 It will also be 4 in the status of hundreds 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.850
 Or 5, will be 5 hundred 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.260
 Its location is in the third position on the right 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.410
 This is the status of the individual 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.500
 6 in the status of the individual, 5 in the status of tens, and 3 in the status of hundreds 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.190
 If the answer would be that the household value of 3 is rated hundreds
