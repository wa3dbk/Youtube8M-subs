00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
guys again I have a lot of pausing here

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.979 
guys again I have a lot of pausing here
and<00:02:08.550> slow<00:02:08.789> down<00:02:08.970> basically<00:02:09.390> based<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:09.899> the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
and slow down basically based on the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.080 
and slow down basically based on the
size<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.370> computer<00:02:11.370> specs<00:02:11.610> are<00:02:11.760> pretty<00:02:11.940> good

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
size a computer specs are pretty good

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.550 
size a computer specs are pretty good
i'll<00:02:12.180> probably<00:02:12.360> post<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.989> in<00:02:13.140> the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
i'll probably post that in the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.949 
i'll probably post that in the
the<00:02:14.520> description<00:02:15.090> part<00:02:15.300> of<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.450> video<00:02:15.690> but

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
the description part of the video but

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.960 
the description part of the video but
they<00:02:16.319> decide<00:02:16.650> not<00:02:16.680> not<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.220> charge<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.880> I

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
they decide not not the charge in and I

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.300 
they decide not not the charge in and I
don't<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.390> see<00:02:18.870> why<00:02:19.020> because<00:02:19.380> we<00:02:19.530> basically<00:02:19.770> set

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
don't I see why because we basically set

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.750 
don't I see why because we basically set
our<00:02:21.230> we<00:02:22.230> basically<00:02:22.470> set<00:02:22.950> our<00:02:23.069> yari<00:02:23.520> actually

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
our we basically set our yari actually

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.940 
our we basically set our yari actually
Garth<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.209> spearmen<00:02:24.870> formation<00:02:25.410> which<00:02:25.860> is

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
Garth to spearmen formation which is

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.470 
Garth to spearmen formation which is
when<00:02:26.099> they're<00:02:26.280> absolutely<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.030> strongest

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
when they're absolutely the strongest

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.330 
when they're absolutely the strongest
against<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.170> charging<00:02:28.830> force<00:02:29.069> especially

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
against the charging force especially

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.970 
against the charging force especially
when<00:02:29.819> that<00:02:29.910> charging<00:02:30.330> courses<00:02:30.780> is<00:02:31.349> cavalry

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
when that charging courses is cavalry

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.050 
when that charging courses is cavalry
but<00:02:32.760> our<00:02:33.060> mistake<00:02:33.450> basically<00:02:33.690> turned<00:02:34.380> into<00:02:34.920> a

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
but our mistake basically turned into a

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.729 
but our mistake basically turned into a
pro<00:02:36.060> for<00:02:36.300> us<00:02:36.420> because<00:02:36.660> they<00:02:37.319> see<00:02:37.380> the

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
pro for us because they see the

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.589 
pro for us because they see the
retreating<00:02:38.099> samurai<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.790> receiving<00:02:39.120> Bowman

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
retreating samurai and receiving Bowman

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.630 
retreating samurai and receiving Bowman
and<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.200> think<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.680> oh<00:02:40.769> and<00:02:41.010> me<00:02:41.190> back<00:02:41.340> side

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
and I think that oh and me back side

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.300 
and I think that oh and me back side
let's<00:02:41.910> just<00:02:42.060> charge<00:02:42.300> in<00:02:42.569> well<00:02:43.410> we<00:02:43.980> can<00:02:44.130> see

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
let's just charge in well we can see

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.440 
let's just charge in well we can see
what<00:02:44.430> happens<00:02:44.459> here<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.269> would<00:02:45.420> be

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
what happens here and that would be

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.710 
what happens here and that would be
probably<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:46.110> good<00:02:46.290> time<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.590> use<00:02:46.799> the<00:02:47.720> slow

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
probably a good time to use the slow

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.620 
probably a good time to use the slow
motion<00:02:49.170> feature<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.940> let's<00:02:51.120> go<00:02:51.269> ahead<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.510> do

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
motion feature so let's go ahead and do

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.250 
motion feature so let's go ahead and do
that<00:02:51.920> something<00:02:52.920> artistic<00:02:53.420> so<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.690> charging

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
that something artistic so in charging

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.960 
that something artistic so in charging
they<00:02:56.010> basically<00:02:56.220> just<00:02:59.540> clip<00:03:00.830> our<00:03:01.830> unit<00:03:02.670> here

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
they basically just clip our unit here

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.890 
they basically just clip our unit here
and<00:03:03.780> immediately<00:03:05.090> they<00:03:06.090> get<00:03:06.269> stuck<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:08.900> the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
and immediately they get stuck and the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.190 
and immediately they get stuck and the
unit<00:03:10.170> engages<00:03:10.860> see<00:03:11.310> one<00:03:11.489> guy<00:03:11.670> right<00:03:11.849> here

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
unit engages see one guy right here

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.890

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
we'll explore that in a second but

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.170 
we'll explore that in a second but
basically<00:03:47.280> it's<00:03:47.519> going<00:03:47.670> to<00:03:47.730> be<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.970> same

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
basically it's going to be the same

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.660 
basically it's going to be the same
thing<00:03:48.450> we<00:03:48.660> were<00:03:48.690> putting<00:03:49.260> up<00:03:49.470> Riario<00:03:50.130> Tsugaru

got our cavalry forces stationed here

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.129 
got our cavalry forces stationed here
the<00:03:56.220> bulk<00:03:56.430> of<00:03:56.609> them<00:03:56.760> actually<00:03:56.970> which<00:03:57.660> is<00:03:57.840> quite

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
the bulk of them actually which is quite

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.860 
the bulk of them actually which is quite
a<00:03:58.200> lot<00:03:58.410> of<00:03:58.440> units<00:03:58.859> it's<00:03:59.010> about<00:03:59.250> six<00:03:59.519> units<00:03:59.880> both

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
a lot of units it's about six units both

a lot of units it's about six units both
sides<00:04:01.139> have<00:04:01.350> six<00:04:01.590> units<00:04:01.859> so<00:04:02.010> they've<00:04:02.160> decided

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
sides have six units so they've decided

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.789 
sides have six units so they've decided
to<00:04:02.639> split<00:04:02.970> their<00:04:03.150> force<00:04:03.420> here<00:04:03.630> but<00:04:04.350> our

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
to split their force here but our

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.140 
to split their force here but our
strategy<00:04:05.220> here<00:04:05.400> is<00:04:05.489> going<00:04:05.609> to<00:04:05.700> be<00:04:05.790> much<00:04:05.970> the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
strategy here is going to be much the

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.349 
strategy here is going to be much the
same<00:04:06.359> but<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:08.220> cavalry<00:04:08.880> will<00:04:09.030> come<00:04:09.209> into

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
same but the the cavalry will come into

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.270 
same but the the cavalry will come into
play<00:04:09.540> a<00:04:09.630> little<00:04:09.840> later<00:04:11.720> and<00:04:12.720> this<00:04:13.709> unit<00:04:14.130> of

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
play a little later and this unit of

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.300 
play a little later and this unit of
enemy<00:04:14.609> forces<00:04:14.790> is<00:04:15.180> basically<00:04:15.780> almost<00:04:16.470> routed

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
enemy forces is basically almost routed

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.180 
enemy forces is basically almost routed
as<00:04:17.750> they<00:04:18.750> get<00:04:18.900> abused<00:04:19.289> by<00:04:19.500> spearmen<00:04:20.039> and

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
as they get abused by spearmen and

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.070 
as they get abused by spearmen and
archers<00:04:20.910> so<00:04:21.329> we'll<00:04:21.450> take<00:04:21.630> this<00:04:21.750> opportunity

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
archers so we'll take this opportunity

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.479 
archers so we'll take this opportunity
now<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.770> uh<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.820> save<00:04:24.030> this<00:04:24.180> video
