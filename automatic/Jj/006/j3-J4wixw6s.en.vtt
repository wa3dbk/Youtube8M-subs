00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
advertiser who then spends a little bit

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.920 
advertiser who then spends a little bit
of<00:01:27.460> it<00:01:27.610> on<00:01:27.730> me<00:01:27.940> or<00:01:28.150> they<00:01:28.300> give<00:01:28.420> it<00:01:28.510> directly<00:01:28.600> to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
of it on me or they give it directly to

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.130 
of it on me or they give it directly to
me<00:01:29.080> I<00:01:29.350> think<00:01:29.950> it's<00:01:30.070> better<00:01:30.280> if<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.840> just

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
me I think it's better if you just

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.170 
me I think it's better if you just
directly<00:01:32.620> fund<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:32.950> show<00:01:33.130> because<00:01:33.910> then

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
directly fund the show because then

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.960 
directly fund the show because then
you're<00:01:34.300> paying<00:01:34.540> for<00:01:34.720> what<00:01:34.840> you<00:01:35.020> get<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:36.310> again

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
you're paying for what you get and again

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.790 
you're paying for what you get and again
not<00:01:37.930> everybody<00:01:38.260> can<00:01:38.380> do<00:01:38.500> that<00:01:38.650> and<00:01:38.740> I

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
not everybody can do that and I

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.320 
not everybody can do that and I
understand<00:01:39.160> maybe<00:01:39.430> this<00:01:39.670> model<00:01:39.970> won't<00:01:40.180> work

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
understand maybe this model won't work

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.710
