00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
arms that were used for grasping prey so

somewhere between 70 and 80 knife-like
teeth<00:00:37.700> today<00:00:38.700> we're<00:00:38.940> working<00:00:39.030> on<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
teeth today we're working on the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.840 
teeth today we're working on the
Allosaurus<00:00:39.930> which<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.500> on<00:00:40.620> exhibit<00:00:41.070> here<00:00:41.820> at

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
Allosaurus which is on exhibit here at

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.479 
Allosaurus which is on exhibit here at
the<00:00:42.030> Smithsonian<00:00:42.950> the<00:00:43.950> amount<00:00:44.160> was<00:00:44.219> put<00:00:44.430> up

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the Smithsonian the amount was put up

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.860 
the Smithsonian the amount was put up
about<00:00:44.640> 1981<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:46.399> what<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.460> due<00:00:47.610> for<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> nice

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
about 1981 and what is due for is a nice

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.220 
about 1981 and what is due for is a nice
new<00:00:49.110> pose<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.710> bit<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.370> an<00:00:50.460> overhaul

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.709 

the<00:00:54.769> mounts<00:00:55.219> that<00:00:55.250> were<00:00:55.489> used<00:00:55.760> in<00:00:56.089> the<00:00:56.449> hall

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
the mounts that were used in the hall

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.660 
the mounts that were used in the hall
have<00:00:57.289> been<00:00:57.559> in<00:00:57.739> their<00:00:57.920> same<00:00:58.129> postures

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
have been in their same postures

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.459 
have been in their same postures
basically<00:00:59.210> since<00:00:59.480> they<00:00:59.780> were<00:00:59.839> mounted

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
basically since they were mounted

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.369 
basically since they were mounted
anywhere<00:01:00.739> from<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:01.670> early<00:01:02.149> 1900s

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
anywhere from the early 1900s

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.420 
anywhere from the early 1900s
through<00:01:04.180> 1940s<00:01:05.180> 50s<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:05.720> 60s<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:06.409> since<00:01:07.189> then

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
through 1940s 50s and 60s and since then

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.190 
through 1940s 50s and 60s and since then
we've<00:01:07.580> learned<00:01:07.790> a<00:01:07.880> lot<00:01:08.000> about<00:01:08.270> dinosaur

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
we've learned a lot about dinosaur

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.960 
we've learned a lot about dinosaur
Anatomy<00:01:09.290> we<00:01:09.979> found<00:01:10.250> out<00:01:10.399> a<00:01:10.430> lot<00:01:10.610> more<00:01:10.850> about

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
Anatomy we found out a lot more about

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.700 
Anatomy we found out a lot more about
their<00:01:11.149> postures<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:11.750> their<00:01:11.869> physiology<00:01:12.530> and

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
their postures and their physiology and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.620 
their postures and their physiology and
so<00:01:12.890> we<00:01:13.100> need<00:01:13.310> to<00:01:13.340> update<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.789> information

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
so we need to update the information

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.389 
so we need to update the information
that's<00:01:14.720> in<00:01:14.869> our<00:01:15.020> paleo<00:01:15.560> halls<00:01:15.799> to<00:01:16.039> reflect

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
that's in our paleo halls to reflect

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.600 
that's in our paleo halls to reflect
current<00:01:16.670> knowledge<00:01:17.060> of<00:01:17.270> paleo<00:01:17.840> biology<00:01:18.460> we<00:01:19.460> do

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
current knowledge of paleo biology we do

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.670 
current knowledge of paleo biology we do
a<00:01:19.820> little<00:01:20.060> bit<00:01:20.180> of<00:01:20.270> tracking<00:01:21.080> on<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.289> bone<00:01:21.439> so

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
a little bit of tracking on the bone so

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.010 
a little bit of tracking on the bone so
soon<00:01:22.070> LED<00:01:22.250> Zack<00:01:22.460> was<00:01:22.670> going<00:01:22.939> to<00:01:23.090> each<00:01:23.360> case<00:01:23.720> and

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
soon LED Zack was going to each case and

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.870 
soon LED Zack was going to each case and
each<00:01:24.140> crate<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:24.860> then<00:01:25.450> its<00:01:26.450> label<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:26.869> mark

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
each crate and then its label to mark

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.749 
each crate and then its label to mark
the<00:01:28.880> basic<00:01:29.270> idea<00:01:29.659> is<00:01:29.899> to<00:01:30.250> dismantle<00:01:31.250> it<00:01:31.580> in

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
the basic idea is to dismantle it in

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.940 
the basic idea is to dismantle it in
reverse<00:01:32.090> order<00:01:32.330> that<00:01:32.420> it<00:01:32.630> was<00:01:32.750> assembled<00:01:33.110> on

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
reverse order that it was assembled on

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.770 
reverse order that it was assembled on
the<00:01:34.159> hall<00:01:34.340> so<00:01:34.610> generally<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.179> head<00:01:35.360> comes<00:01:35.630> off

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
the hall so generally the head comes off

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.120 
the hall so generally the head comes off
first<00:01:36.140> you<00:01:36.289> got<00:01:36.409> to<00:01:36.500> figure<00:01:36.590> out<00:01:36.710> how<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:36.950> head

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
first you got to figure out how the head

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.609 
first you got to figure out how the head
was<00:01:37.280> attached<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:37.970> then<00:01:38.690> the<00:01:38.810> tail<00:01:39.049> and<00:01:39.409> then

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
was attached and then the tail and then

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.090 
was attached and then the tail and then
you<00:01:39.740> just<00:01:39.950> kind<00:01:40.130> of<00:01:40.190> work<00:01:40.369> your<00:01:40.549> way<00:01:40.580> in

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.370 

for<00:01:45.670> dismantling<00:01:46.090> to<00:01:46.750> be<00:01:46.870> shipped<00:01:47.170> to<00:01:47.260> another

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
for dismantling to be shipped to another

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.370 
for dismantling to be shipped to another
place<00:01:47.770> you<00:01:47.979> want<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.190> get<00:01:48.340> pieces<00:01:48.790> off<00:01:49.090> in<00:01:49.479> sort

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
place you want to get pieces off in sort

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.050 
place you want to get pieces off in sort
of<00:01:50.440> bigger<00:01:50.650> chunk<00:01:51.040> as<00:01:51.220> possible<00:01:51.760> like<00:01:51.909> an

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
of bigger chunk as possible like an

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.719 
of bigger chunk as possible like an
entire<00:01:52.570> rim<00:01:52.900> bone<00:01:53.110> might<00:01:53.350> come<00:01:53.560> off<00:01:53.740> as<00:01:53.950> one

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
entire rim bone might come off as one

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.990 
entire rim bone might come off as one
unit<00:01:55.090> then<00:01:55.270> be<00:01:55.420> packed<00:01:55.690> up<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:57.610> a<00:01:57.700> couple<00:01:57.880> of

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
unit then be packed up and a couple of

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.210 
unit then be packed up and a couple of
points<00:01:58.300> of<00:01:58.450> look<00:01:58.960> like<00:01:58.990> we're<00:01:59.560> coming<00:01:59.920> to<00:02:00.100> the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
points of look like we're coming to the

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.130 
points of look like we're coming to the
actual<00:02:00.760> fossil<00:02:01.210> but<00:02:01.300> but<00:02:01.660> it<00:02:01.750> wasn't<00:02:01.990> it<00:02:02.050> was

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
actual fossil but but it wasn't it was

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.440 
actual fossil but but it wasn't it was
gas<00:02:02.320> material<00:02:02.830> how<00:02:03.369> it<00:02:03.430> was<00:02:03.550> mounted<00:02:04.060> they

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
gas material how it was mounted they

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.109 
gas material how it was mounted they
they<00:02:04.840> ran<00:02:05.020> a<00:02:05.050> steel<00:02:05.380> armature<00:02:05.680> through<00:02:06.430> the

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
they ran a steel armature through the

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.790 
they ran a steel armature through the
centre<00:02:07.450> of<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.600> bone<00:02:07.780> so<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.320> grows<00:02:08.590> on<00:02:08.770> a

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
centre of the bone so it grows on a

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.919
