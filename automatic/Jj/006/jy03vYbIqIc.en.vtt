00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 so that's my point b 88 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.330
 with the gps i was very dissatisfied with it 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.429
 just does not work 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:17.160
 despite setting gps config setting 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.730
 and so was the adaptation to all nothing 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.560
 brought 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.970
 Now I have come up with the idea here 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.609
 just a head-to-head slide 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:32.910
 attach a tree to the gbs angeli 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:34.950
 taped and the system completely new 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.739
 put on and quite simply in addition to the 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.680
 efficiency of new antennas too 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.969
 So I'm going to test that easily now 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.670
 Build together and then we'll meet 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.530
 outside again so we are now 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.070
 out there in the car and wanted the test 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.950
 do 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.039
 as I said this is one 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.120
 So it's a rebuilt system 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.660
 there is nothing available 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.289
 neither parties nor the gps config file 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.379
 is also here in the system does not exist 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.720
 So he does not know where he is 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:10.170
 WiFi and a mobile connection 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.260
 does not exist we now switch the gps 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.260
 on 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.740
 so turn on and start gps test 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.990
 immediately found in it first 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.119
 why is there 10 ? 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.119
 he does not know where he is 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:53.880
 We see ourselves acting better now 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.880
 second third 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.190
 5 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.740
 and fixed 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:49.430
 as I said many have problems with 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:51.650
 your gps despite epo and mobile 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.440
 connection and customized confectionery 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.590
 does not work, it usually 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.870
 Here is a little guide meat for it 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:08.600
 and as a little excitement as it is 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:10.370
 Maybe I could improve 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.560
 I will stop the test now I hope 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.070
 One or the other I could because 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.070
 I help
