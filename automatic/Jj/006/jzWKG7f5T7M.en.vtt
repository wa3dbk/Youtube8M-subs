00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
first touchdown when I personally I've

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.819

never<00:00:45.149> seen<00:00:45.480> Doria<00:00:45.780> go<00:00:46.230> up<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> ball<00:00:46.710> like

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
never seen Doria go up for a ball like

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.160

he<00:00:46.980> did<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.280> first<00:00:47.579> one<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.420> obviously

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
he did on that first one so obviously

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.810 
he did on that first one so obviously
that's<00:00:49.440> something<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:50.010> wanted<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.309> take

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
that's something we wanted to take

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.279 
that's something we wanted to take
advantage<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> rest<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.750> game<00:00:51.930> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
advantage of the rest of the game and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.380 
advantage of the rest of the game and
really<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.280> was<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.579> was<00:00:53.699> both<00:00:53.879> sides<00:00:54.149> that

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
really it was it was both sides that

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.209 
really it was it was both sides that
those<00:00:54.660> split<00:00:55.289> ends<00:00:55.440> him<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.710> l'Damian<00:00:56.129> were

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
those split ends him and l'Damian were

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.310 
those split ends him and l'Damian were
there<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:57.090> never<00:00:57.360> running<00:00:57.660> by<00:00:57.840> guy<00:00:58.050> so

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
there just never running by guy so

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.599 
there just never running by guy so
that's<00:00:58.590> what<00:00:58.710> we<00:00:58.800> want<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.039> take<00:00:59.129> advantage<00:00:59.309> of

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
that's what we want to take advantage of

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.700
