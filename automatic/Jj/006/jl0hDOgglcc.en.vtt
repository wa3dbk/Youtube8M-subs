far as putting them on the ski you want
to<00:00:19.199> make<00:00:19.289> sure<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.220> base<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.970> ski<00:00:21.180> is

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
to make sure that the base of the ski is

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.019 
to make sure that the base of the ski is
is<00:00:22.350> free<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.740> any<00:00:22.859> snow<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:25.039> again<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.640> last

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
is free of any snow and again the last

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.730 
is free of any snow and again the last
blue<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.480> have<00:00:27.630> exposed<00:00:28.050> at<00:00:28.289> one<00:00:28.439> time<00:00:28.710> I

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
blue you have exposed at one time I

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.550 
blue you have exposed at one time I
think<00:00:29.099> makes<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.369> lot<00:00:29.519> easier<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:31.380> try

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
think makes a lot easier so I just try

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.030 
think makes a lot easier so I just try
and<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:31.949> pull<00:00:32.309> them<00:00:32.369> apart<00:00:33.469> as<00:00:34.469> far<00:00:34.530> as<00:00:34.860> my

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
and I just pull them apart as far as my

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.830 
and I just pull them apart as far as my
arm<00:00:35.190> will<00:00:35.309> reach<00:00:35.340> for<00:00:36.180> starters<00:00:38.690> put<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
arm will reach for starters put the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.049 
arm will reach for starters put the
c-clip<00:00:40.290> through<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.739> tip<00:00:40.980> hole<00:00:41.219> there<00:00:44.059> and

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
c-clip through the tip hole there and

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.650 
c-clip through the tip hole there and
then<00:00:45.180> I'll<00:00:45.300> line<00:00:45.539> up<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.930> top<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> skin

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
then I'll line up that top of the skin

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.450 
then I'll line up that top of the skin
and<00:00:48.660> get<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.289> then<00:00:49.410> now<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.770> can<00:00:50.070> use<00:00:50.100> two

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
and get that and then now I can use two

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.060 
and get that and then now I can use two
hands<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.030> can<00:00:51.210> pull<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.570> rest<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.070> so

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
hands and I can pull the rest of this so

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.100 
hands and I can pull the rest of this so
if<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> glue<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:54.210> strong<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.809> makes<00:00:54.840> it

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
if the glue is this strong it makes it

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.819 
if the glue is this strong it makes it
easy<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.410> use<00:00:56.300> just<00:00:57.300> put<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> tip<00:00:57.840> away<00:00:58.440> from

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
easy to use just put the tip away from

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.380 
easy to use just put the tip away from
you<00:01:01.280> make<00:01:02.280> sure<00:01:02.460> it's<00:01:02.609> lined<00:01:02.820> up<00:01:03.000> right<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
you make sure it's lined up right in the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.520 
you make sure it's lined up right in the
center<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.840> skin<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:06.020> with<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> k2

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
center of the skin and with the k2

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.140 
center of the skin and with the k2
schemes<00:01:07.890> there's<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.580> hook<00:01:08.790> goes<00:01:08.970> on

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
schemes there's that the hook goes on

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.880 
schemes there's that the hook goes on
the<00:01:09.270> top<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.750> ski<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.260> comes<00:01:10.470> over

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the top of this ski so that comes over

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.310 
the top of this ski so that comes over
the<00:01:10.979> top<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.490> through<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.390> hole<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:13.170> way

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the top and through the hole that way

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.600 
the top and through the hole that way
you<00:01:13.409> don't<00:01:13.500> have<00:01:13.650> anything<00:01:13.860> dragging<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.490> it

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
you don't have anything dragging on it

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.640 
you don't have anything dragging on it
and<00:01:15.420> then<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.630> last<00:01:15.810> thing<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.200> do<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.470> just

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
and then the last thing to do is just

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.719 
and then the last thing to do is just
make<00:01:16.830> sure<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:18.799> glue<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.950> fresh<00:01:20.250> down<00:01:20.520> all

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
make sure it's glue is fresh down all

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.280 
make sure it's glue is fresh down all
the<00:01:20.850> way<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.570> you're<00:01:21.659> ready<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.960> go

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
the way and you're ready to go

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.929 
the way and you're ready to go
simple<00:01:22.860> as<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> technique<00:01:26.820> a

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
simple as that so this is a technique a

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.359 
simple as that so this is a technique a
friend<00:01:27.180> show<00:01:27.360> me<00:01:27.509> that's<00:01:27.979> for<00:01:28.979> taking<00:01:29.130> your

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
friend show me that's for taking your

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.069 
friend show me that's for taking your
skins<00:01:29.640> off<00:01:29.790> especially<00:01:30.299> when<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.570> windy<00:01:30.780> I

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
skins off especially when it's windy I

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.690 
skins off especially when it's windy I
can<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.829> do<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.040> all<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.250> time<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.490> because

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
can to do it all the time just because

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.789 
can to do it all the time just because
it's<00:01:33.000> super<00:01:33.240> easy<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.229> get<00:01:34.350> an<00:01:34.470> exact

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
it's super easy and you get an exact

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.609 
it's super easy and you get an exact
fold<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.970> key<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.180> think<00:01:36.299> when<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.439> windy

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
fold but the key I think when it's windy

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.190 
fold but the key I think when it's windy
especially<00:01:38.000> is<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.060> not<00:01:39.329> have<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.750> much<00:01:39.900> glue

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
especially is to not have so much glue

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.319 
especially is to not have so much glue
exposed<00:01:40.740> at<00:01:41.189> one<00:01:41.400> time<00:01:41.700> if<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
exposed at one time if you have the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.240 
exposed at one time if you have the
whole<00:01:42.540> skin<00:01:42.899> off<00:01:43.079> then<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.920> got<00:01:44.390> 180

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
whole skin off then you got 180

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.499 
whole skin off then you got 180
centimeters<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.399> glue<00:01:47.640> waiting<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.149> stick<00:01:48.390> to

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
centimeters of glue waiting to stick to

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.899 
centimeters of glue waiting to stick to
something<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.140> I'll<00:01:49.979> pull<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.430> first<00:01:50.670> half

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
something so I'll pull the first half

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.030 
something so I'll pull the first half
off

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.670 

just<00:01:54.520> pull<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:54.820> up<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.120> midway<00:01:55.450> point<00:01:55.680> you

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
just pull it up to the midway point you

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.010 
just pull it up to the midway point you
got<00:01:56.830> to<00:01:56.860> put<00:01:57.070> the<00:01:57.160> skinny<00:01:57.490> tip<00:01:57.820> on<00:01:58.330> your<00:01:58.510> hip<00:01:58.720> so

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
got to put the skinny tip on your hip so

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.260 
got to put the skinny tip on your hip so
it<00:01:59.140> sits<00:01:59.380> there<00:01:59.650> so<00:02:00.310> you<00:02:00.400> can<00:02:00.520> use<00:02:00.730> both<00:02:00.940> hands

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
it sits there so you can use both hands

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.630 
it sits there so you can use both hands
okay<00:02:01.800> and<00:02:02.800> then<00:02:02.890> I<00:02:02.950> just<00:02:02.980> want<00:02:03.310> to<00:02:03.370> find<00:02:03.550> the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
okay and then I just want to find the

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.690 
okay and then I just want to find the
midway<00:02:04.000> point<00:02:04.270> as<00:02:05.110> I'm<00:02:05.380> pulling<00:02:05.560> this<00:02:05.770> up<00:02:05.830> this

just fold it right back down on top of
itself<00:02:12.300> okay<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:14.230> then<00:02:14.380> from<00:02:14.560> there<00:02:15.000> just

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
itself okay and then from there just

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.080 
itself okay and then from there just
slowly<00:02:16.210> peel<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.930> up
