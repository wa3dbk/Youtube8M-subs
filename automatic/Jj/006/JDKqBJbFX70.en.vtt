00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 for 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.750
 emblematic series of an era 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.980
 today gone shinobi is far 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.170
 to have said his last word 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.270
 testify they arrived on 3ds 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.430
 like to remind us that going out a 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.439
 ultra hardcore game on a super console 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.320
 general public it is possible and not 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.449
 inconsistent the bet is daring the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.970
 result also but not always in the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.320
 good sense of the term 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.210
 it must be said that we will have to have the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.860
 hung heart to undergo the experiment 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.690
 shinobi on 3ds 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.330
 they do not have the game to be bad 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.690
 far from it but the game of sega risk of 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.070
 put your nerves to the test 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.129
 it's simple in case of premature death 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.410
 you will systematically start again 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.120
 a mission from the very beginning when 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.390
 you lost in front of the end boss of 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.390
 level 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.590
 shinobi is indeed a game that does not 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.320
 forgive and the progression can not 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.210
 what to do by failure 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.340
 by default the difficulty limits your 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.200
 progression to some life without 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.310
 possibility to resume at a checkpoint 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.050
 even happily removed 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.390
 developers of griptonite games have 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.000
 thought to make life unlimited in 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.070
 going into beginner mode already well-bodied 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.050
 the gameplay is necessarily adapted to these 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.000
 extreme difficulties with a character 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.070
 certainly with a wide range of 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.200
 movements but still struggling 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.789
 to jump correctly or to move 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.590
 like a real ninja the game is slow there 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.600
 will not be rare to fall into the void 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.990
 because a projectile will have appeared as 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.990
 by magic 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.410
 the developers wanted so much 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.300
 stick to the games of yesteryear it's a 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:52.200
 real torture to walk around 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.270
 levels the game loses its charm 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.820
 so even if the purists will find it 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.710
 many qualities 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.150
 on the other side graphic design is not 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.770
 really the panacea with a 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.380
 very cubic modeling of 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.360
 characters from the very empty sets of 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.190
 mechanical and character animations 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.190
 a little rude design damage 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.490
