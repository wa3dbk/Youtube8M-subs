00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hi friends today i have for you 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.359
 review on this one here is loose powder 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.870
 from art visage 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.610
 shade 01 small backstory I have long 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.530
 I wanted to sell loose powder because 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.960
 that this is one of those products that 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.250
 many people praise and she uses that 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.770
 to secure the flour you eat it 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.800
 apply concealer concealer all 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.039
 the rest then Nastya loose powder 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.980
 should make makeup more matte and 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.939
 let him stay on his face longer 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.949
 the usual for these funds I use 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.120
 ordinary compact powder because i 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.700
 it seemed that it should not be painted 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.950
 and most confused I tried from 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.739
 luxury to mass market and everything does not work 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.480
 about the same with a little bit matting and 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.059
 through now about my street starts 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.289
 shine and during the day secret cream 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.850
 most often slips on his face because 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.610
 that is not very very oily skin 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.480
 but I thought that if I tried 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.579
 loose powder 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.070
 Vosyuya art will send domestic 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.809
 manufacturer and it is quite inexpensive in 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.250
 they are on the website of the present 220 rubles 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.280
 shops it costs more but you can 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.619
 A look at the site is truly a save and so 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.070
 this powder she is very light on this 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.810
 shade 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.890
 she will demonstrate it now 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.409
 almost white that is she is very 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.090
 very light if you have light skin then 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.670
 I know that often there is a problem to find 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.009
 enough light powder and that is exactly 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.020
 she she is very very light there is more 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.280
 dark shade 02 he was so beige 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.450
 there is still shimmering powder but this is not 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.600
 I know this for an amateur 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.189
 on as I have very oily skin and 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.570
 she shines by itself better 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.390
 something matt so i took the first 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.610
 shade and now when the beginning of spring I 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.400
 still very very light for me this 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.229
 just so she herself powder she is very 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.530
 small in structure and therefore 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.970
 very easy to falls on the skin it is 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.950
 unlike some poods does not create 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.890
 the effect of someone on a chicken face then 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.909
 have it lays down just perfect and i 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.570
 noticed that very many tonal 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.159
 facilities 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.960
 I have a lot of stress 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.030
 you eat well too 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.189
 Something too visible on flax 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.860
 some too vice versa translucent 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.719
 some stress pores and this one 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.960
 powder wonderfully attacking what 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.940
 leveling foundation 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.080
 that is, the effect on the skin is obtained 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.640
 much more than some good even 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.530
 smooth not to mention that matt 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.060
 I'm not at the expense of what is happening 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.040
 interesting in incarnation because I 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.690
 it seemed that the powder can not on it especially 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.550
 influence however it turned out that I was right 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.550
 she can she does most sick 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.190
 Klimov much better new skin that no 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.110
 powder alone has never done this 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.530
 In terms of haze, she first 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.020
 immediately makes the face more dull and 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.000
 matt she stays for several hours 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.590
 longer than usual that is if usually 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.560
 me or that and provide in two 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.060
 then there are four or five hours and sometimes I am 6 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.010
 I can walk and not worry about that 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.400
 I'm afraid of greasy appeared 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.800
 so this powder surprised me very much 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.350
 for its rich qualities still called 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.519
 it so mats and allows 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.890
 foundation longer hold on 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.470
 face and moreover is alluding 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.110
 look better on your face well, that is how 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.970
 you can say no to that plus she 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.290
 very inexpensive as I said before 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.950
 I think you will not find anywhere 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.030
 more budget loose powder in 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.040
 mostly this 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.530
 but is it worth as much as ordinary powder 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.950
 either but the order is more expensive and here everything is very 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.470
 budget ie she speaks at 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.680
 the quality of powder that would fix 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.510
 makeup is just a great way i and 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.530
 very very satisfied and i'm sure that 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.720
 more 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.100
 no loose powder to use 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.670
 I will not because it is just so much 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.340
 well 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.350
 it contains no could not find 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.980
 volume so now we take a look 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:46.570
 the volume in this powder is six and a half 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.100
 grams is valid until the age of 18 I think that 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.060
 I gave enough for a while because 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.620
 it is full of powder that is 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.720
 it will be quite economical 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.549
 used also during the day there 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.829
 for example, I am at home and I do not use 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.600
 compact powder but I suddenly need 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.269
 to powder my face again in the evening i 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.980
 I apply it again and again, unlike 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.959
 some powder which during the day 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.120
 when cosmos is fat but due to bad and 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.750
 generally begin to smear tonalnik by 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.060
 to your face 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.890
 it cheerfully that doesn't make it beautiful 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.269
 lies on top and during these hours then 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.889
 there is it in principle suitable for 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.419
 to make up during the day 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.079
 just hardly any of you will 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.330
 search 1 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.569
 that girlfriends bags but if you want something 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.280
 she does a great job i mean i don't 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:29.020
 I rule out that I would wear it in 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.430
 the bag simply that during the day I was 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.710
 I am sure that if I correct 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.840
 makeup he will go fine and worse 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.460
 will not and the skin will come again smooth 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:42.490
 even and good color so i was 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.129
 very happy so i can read that 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.650
 promises to translate thanks to color.id and 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:49.120
 its ultra-thin texture based on 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.650
 natural mineral components 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.000
 growing up absolutely not weighing 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.979
 natural makeup gives the skin 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.039
 silky and well-groomed appearance 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.449
 unique natural filler 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:01.030
 provides a great concealer 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.430
 matting properties inorganic wi-fi 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.289
 it helps create a comprehensive defense 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.270
 from the impact advances left very 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:08.860
 wisely does not interfere with skin breathing 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.330
 thanks to its hypoallergenic and 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.909
 suitable for all skin types up to 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.039
 the most sensitive and i can 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:15.340
 confirm that in fact the way it is 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.319
 there is 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.810
 by the way the powder came with this here 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:22.990
 powder coat you can apply powder 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.460
 she is just even because I have a very 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.210
 oily skin for me it will not be very 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.979
 hygienically 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.529
 because you know there are no pimples 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.879
 not generally not preferred 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:32.979
 wear a brush can first it seems to me 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:36.129
 that histidine inflict distributes much 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:38.110
 easier to lay it straight + brush I 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:40.270
 I can wash when I want and accordingly 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.339
 it is more safer way 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.650
 applying powder for problem skin 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:46.930
 such garbage if your skin is normal 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.580
 it is possible for you to pass and sport in general 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.960
 powder is fine and again devi filter 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.629
 which is always a big plus 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.219
 and if you want to protect your skin 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:56.800
 because often creams that 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:58.479
 contain her filters they are very fat 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.490
 skin tone tools your filters 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:02.289
 living water too zhirnovat and when it 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.270
 filter have your loose powder like 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:06.460
 would you kill two birds with one fell swoop in 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:10.000
 you have UV protection 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:12.729
 rays and she is absolutely not weighty and not 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.889
 increase the weight of your makeup is always fun 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.089
 so this powder I'm not thinking 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:18.190
 put five plus 

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:21.699
 5 points is a wonderful thing 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:23.169
 budget is very successful and I would say 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:24.520
 what is the best powder that ever 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.129
 tried especially to fix 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.620
 makeup is just she has no equal so 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:32.740
 do i advise i eat you yes definitely 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.370
 whatever skin you take i take 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.199
 sure that 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.520
 you will regret to choose from two 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.760
 shades that also make storms 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.160
 universal and in general you get mine 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.020
 good art-make-up beautiful job very 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.000
 Very good powder I will definitely and 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.669
 I will only buy it later 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.040
 and and so thank you very much for watching 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:53.040
 I hope that was interesting and love axes
