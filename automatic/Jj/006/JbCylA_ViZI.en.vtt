bubbles<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.930> then<00:01:25.650> using<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.040> skewer<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:27.030> just

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
bubbles and then using a skewer I'm just

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.520 
bubbles and then using a skewer I'm just
kind<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.450> swirling<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:29.100> loopy<00:01:29.610> kind<00:01:29.850> of

kind of swirling it in a loopy kind of
pattern<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:33.000> because<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.570> have<00:01:33.659> even<00:01:33.960> amount

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
pattern and because we have even amount

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.219 
pattern and because we have even amount
of<00:01:34.259> colors<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.650> there<00:01:34.860> it'll<00:01:35.990> blend<00:01:36.990> through

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229

the<00:01:43.320> top<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.860> cake<00:01:44.070> just<00:01:44.700> by<00:01:44.820> scoring

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
the top of the cake just by scoring

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.429 
the top of the cake just by scoring
around<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.360> cake<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.810> make<00:01:46.020> sure<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.320> have

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
around the cake to make sure that I have

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.990 
around the cake to make sure that I have
a<00:01:46.470> line<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:47.250> guide<00:01:47.399> need<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.759> make<00:01:47.850> sure<00:01:47.880> that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
a line to guide need to make sure that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.740 
a line to guide need to make sure that
cuts<00:01:48.350> evenly<00:01:49.790> cut<00:01:50.790> off<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> top<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.329> then<00:01:51.630> do

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
cuts evenly cut off the top and then do

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.840 
cuts evenly cut off the top and then do
the<00:01:51.869> exact<00:01:52.170> same<00:01:52.310> for<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> middle<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
the exact same for the middle of the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.770 
the exact same for the middle of the
cake<00:01:54.030> now<00:01:55.490> you<00:01:56.490> have<00:01:56.700> two<00:01:56.880> slices<00:01:57.210> they'll<00:01:57.689> be

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
cake now you have two slices they'll be

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.709 
cake now you have two slices they'll be
slick<00:01:58.020> slices<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.590> cake<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.979> total<00:01:59.540> and<00:02:00.540> add<00:02:00.689> a

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
slick slices of cake in total and add a

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.969 
slick slices of cake in total and add a
little<00:02:00.869> bit<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.079> buttercream<00:02:01.290> onto<00:02:01.649> my<00:02:01.770> cake

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
little bit of buttercream onto my cake

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.980 
little bit of buttercream onto my cake
board<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.430> attach<00:02:02.790> my<00:02:02.820> first<00:02:03.570> layer<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.780> cake

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
board and attach my first layer of cake

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.420 
board and attach my first layer of cake
and<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.290> was<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.500> top<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.920> cake<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.280> saw

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
and that was the top of the cake I saw

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.150 
and that was the top of the cake I saw
at<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.549> bottom<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.329> it's<00:02:06.479> nice<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.689> flat<00:02:07.160> and

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
at the bottom so it's nice and flat and

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.949 
at the bottom so it's nice and flat and
I<00:02:08.250> press<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.489> down<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.090> adheres<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.869> then

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
I press that down so it adheres and then

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.140 
I press that down so it adheres and then
adding<00:02:10.259> my<00:02:10.410> buttercream<00:02:10.920> frosting

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
adding my buttercream frosting

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.420 
adding my buttercream frosting
into<00:02:12.299> the<00:02:12.390> middle<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.689> the<00:02:12.810> cake<00:02:12.959> there<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:14.370> I

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
into the middle of the cake there and I

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.679 
into the middle of the cake there and I
thought<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.730> was<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.849> little<00:02:14.909> bit<00:02:15.090> uneven<00:02:15.329> so<00:02:15.629> I

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
thought it was a little bit uneven so I

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.330 
thought it was a little bit uneven so I
went<00:02:15.840> through<00:02:16.049> with<00:02:16.200> my<00:02:16.230> spatula<00:02:16.709> just<00:02:17.159> to

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
went through with my spatula just to

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.190 
went through with my spatula just to
even<00:02:17.489> it<00:02:17.670> out<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.819> bit<00:02:17.909> because<00:02:18.599> it<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.959> tall

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
even it out a bit because it is a tall

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.259 
even it out a bit because it is a tall
cake<00:02:19.379> you<00:02:19.560> want<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:19.799> make<00:02:19.920> sure<00:02:20.099> that<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.519> get

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
cake you want to make sure that you get

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.050 
cake you want to make sure that you get
the<00:02:21.890> evenness<00:02:22.890> down<00:02:23.069> pat<00:02:23.310> from<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.549> beginning

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
the evenness down pat from the beginning

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.699 
the evenness down pat from the beginning
otherwise<00:02:24.659> you'll<00:02:24.870> end<00:02:24.900> up<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.170> bit<00:02:25.439> more<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.650> a

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
otherwise you'll end up a bit more of a

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.979 
otherwise you'll end up a bit more of a
lopsided<00:02:25.920> cake<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.730> try<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:27.659> keep<00:02:27.689> an<00:02:27.870> eye<00:02:27.959> on

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
lopsided cake so try and keep an eye on

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:35.229 
lopsided cake so try and keep an eye on
that<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.790> continue<00:02:30.239> building<00:02:30.359> the<00:02:30.720> layers<00:02:30.840> on

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.610 

at<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.510> very<00:02:36.540> end<00:02:36.989> we're<00:02:37.140> going<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.290> add<00:02:37.439> the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
at the very end we're going to add the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.860 
at the very end we're going to add the
top<00:02:37.859> cake<00:02:38.760> which<00:02:39.060> was<00:02:39.239> with<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.480> flat<00:02:39.689> side

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
top cake which was with a flat side

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.809 
top cake which was with a flat side
facing<00:02:39.930> up<00:02:40.349> and<00:02:40.530> I'm<00:02:40.980> going<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.129> put<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.519> nice

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
facing up and I'm going to put a nice

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.110 
facing up and I'm going to put a nice
crumb<00:02:42.689> coat<00:02:42.959> around<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.500> hole<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.220> pink<00:02:44.489> I

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.059 

flattened<00:02:48.120> at<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.269> top<00:02:48.510> clean<00:02:49.319> my<00:02:49.560> cake<00:02:49.829> board

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
flattened at the top clean my cake board

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.960 
flattened at the top clean my cake board
and<00:02:50.159> then<00:02:50.310> I'll<00:02:50.430> go<00:02:50.579> in<00:02:50.849> with<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:52.970> buttercream

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
and then I'll go in with the buttercream

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.339 
and then I'll go in with the buttercream
so<00:02:54.090> I'm<00:02:54.329> using<00:02:54.510> some<00:02:54.690> yellow<00:02:55.109> buttercream

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
so I'm using some yellow buttercream

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.649 
so I'm using some yellow buttercream
here<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.739> I<00:02:55.799> colored<00:02:56.099> it<00:02:56.220> with<00:02:56.400> some<00:02:57.060> gel<00:02:57.450> food

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
here and I colored it with some gel food

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.099 
here and I colored it with some gel food
colour<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:59.209> using<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.359> piping<00:03:00.900> bag<00:03:01.079> fitted

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
colour and using a piping bag fitted

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.009 
colour and using a piping bag fitted
with<00:03:01.439> a<00:03:01.889> basket<00:03:02.639> weave<00:03:02.760> nozzle<00:03:03.150> I'm<00:03:03.780> going<00:03:03.930> to

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
with a basket weave nozzle I'm going to

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.839 
with a basket weave nozzle I'm going to
pipe<00:03:04.290> two<00:03:04.620> layers<00:03:04.859> all<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.340> way<00:03:05.489> around<00:03:05.760> the

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
pipe two layers all the way around the

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.890 
pipe two layers all the way around the
cake<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:08.760> could<00:03:08.909> probably<00:03:09.120> just<00:03:09.329> use<00:03:09.450> a

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
cake and you could probably just use a

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.379 
cake and you could probably just use a
circle<00:03:10.829> nozzle<00:03:11.579> for<00:03:11.730> this<00:03:11.819> as<00:03:12.000> well<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.150> don't

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
circle nozzle for this as well I don't

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.960 
circle nozzle for this as well I don't
really<00:03:12.480> think<00:03:12.569> it's<00:03:12.870> um<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.889> need<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.280> basket

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
really think it's um you need the basket

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.339 
really think it's um you need the basket
weave<00:03:15.090> but<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.239> used<00:03:15.450> because<00:03:15.569> I<00:03:15.720> found<00:03:15.959> that<00:03:16.139> I

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
weave but I used because I found that I

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.259 
weave but I used because I found that I
know<00:03:16.829> maybe<00:03:16.980> it's<00:03:17.160> bit<00:03:17.340> neater<00:03:17.549> could<00:03:18.000> be<00:03:18.090> my

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
know maybe it's bit neater could be my

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.589 
know maybe it's bit neater could be my
head<00:03:18.810> but<00:03:18.989> anyway<00:03:19.980> going<00:03:20.849> to<00:03:20.970> put<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.269> some

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
head but anyway going to put in some

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.839 
head but anyway going to put in some
regular<00:03:22.470> colored<00:03:22.859> buttercream<00:03:23.699> frosting

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
regular colored buttercream frosting

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.580 
regular colored buttercream frosting
into<00:03:24.329> what<00:03:24.449> was<00:03:24.569> left<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.900> our<00:03:25.109> yellow<00:03:25.319> and

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
into what was left of our yellow and

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.930 
into what was left of our yellow and
that<00:03:25.739> just<00:03:25.949> makes<00:03:26.129> the<00:03:26.250> shade<00:03:26.459> lighter<00:03:26.730> each

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
that just makes the shade lighter each

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.509
