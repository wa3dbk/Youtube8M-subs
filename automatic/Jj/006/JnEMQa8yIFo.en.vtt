deep fountain today and basically a

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.009 
deep fountain today and basically a
fountain<00:00:09.960> encompasses<00:00:10.559> some<00:00:10.920> leaves<00:00:11.190> and

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
fountain encompasses some leaves and

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.439 
fountain encompasses some leaves and
Whittle<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:14.869> this<00:00:15.869> is<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.139> 3d<00:00:16.470> win<00:00:17.369> 4-3<00:00:18.240> beat

down<00:00:19.490> and<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.970> kind<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.270> do<00:00:21.420> mine<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> little<00:00:21.810> bit

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
down and I kind of do mine a little bit

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.210 
down and I kind of do mine a little bit
differently<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.530> see<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.830> lot<00:00:22.950> of<00:00:23.010> people

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
differently I see a lot of people

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.000 
differently I see a lot of people
throwing<00:00:23.700> in<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:24.000> really<00:00:24.300> distinct

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
throwing in this really distinct

throwing in this really distinct
windmill<00:00:26.010> into<00:00:26.340> their<00:00:26.460> fountains<00:00:26.990> kind<00:00:27.990> of

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
windmill into their fountains kind of

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.280 
windmill into their fountains kind of
thing<00:00:28.290> I<00:00:28.940> just<00:00:29.940> kind<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.180> carried<00:00:30.780> my<00:00:30.900> hands

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.290 
thing I just kind of carried my hands

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.310 
thing I just kind of carried my hands
over<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:32.390> don't<00:00:33.390> know<00:00:33.450> if<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.600> cut<00:00:33.870> out<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.170> way

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
over I don't know if I cut out the way

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.980 
over I don't know if I cut out the way
mellor<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:35.000> kind<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.090> inclusion<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.750> there

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:36.990 
mellor it's kind of inclusion in there

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.890 
mellor it's kind of inclusion in there
but<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.850> just<00:00:38.850> keep<00:00:39.150> my<00:00:39.180> hands<00:00:39.570> together<00:00:39.660> and

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
but I just keep my hands together and

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.500 
but I just keep my hands together and
come<00:00:40.110> over<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.500> top<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.460> basically<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.329> any

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
come over the top and basically with any

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.470 
come over the top and basically with any
fountain<00:00:42.960> you've<00:00:43.920> got<00:00:44.190> four<00:00:45.090> different

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
fountain you've got four different

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.069 
fountain you've got four different
positions<00:00:46.020> where<00:00:47.149> for<00:00:48.149> two<00:00:48.390> you're<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:49.020> to

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
positions where for two you're going to

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.630 
positions where for two you're going to
be<00:00:49.140> spinning<00:00:49.470> in<00:00:49.560> front<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.890> your<00:00:49.950> body<00:00:50.130> after

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
be spinning in front of your body after

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.160 
be spinning in front of your body after
the<00:00:50.700> other<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.910> your<00:00:51.239> spinning<00:00:51.660> behind<00:00:51.989> your

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
the other to your spinning behind your

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.370 
the other to your spinning behind your
mind<00:00:52.399> so<00:00:53.399> as<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.610> watch<00:00:53.880> a<00:00:54.060> 3d<00:00:54.480> I'm<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.079> front

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
mind so as you watch a 3d I'm in front

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.710 
mind so as you watch a 3d I'm in front
behind<00:00:56.600> coming<00:00:57.600> from<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.350> then<00:00:58.530> I'm<00:00:58.680> bond<00:00:59.720> so

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
behind coming from and then I'm bond so

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.380 
behind coming from and then I'm bond so
there's<00:01:00.930> your<00:01:01.550> four<00:01:02.550> different<00:01:02.910> positions

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
there's your four different positions

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.350 
there's your four different positions
and<00:01:03.540> I<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.960> kind<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.259> position<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:05.360> twelve

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
and I like to kind of position on twelve

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.770 
and I like to kind of position on twelve
o'clock<00:01:06.780> six<00:01:07.140> o'clock<00:01:07.760> is<00:01:08.760> going<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.240> be<00:01:09.299> nine

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
o'clock six o'clock is going to be nine

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.870 
o'clock six o'clock is going to be nine
o'clock<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.380> at<00:01:10.530> three<00:01:10.770> o'clock<00:01:10.880> just

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
o'clock for you at three o'clock just

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.940 
o'clock for you at three o'clock just
because<00:01:12.150> those<00:01:12.299> are<00:01:12.479> simple<00:01:12.810> places<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.530> when

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
because those are simple places but when

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.380 
because those are simple places but when
in<00:01:14.070> reality<00:01:14.190> your<00:01:14.610> hands<00:01:14.850> are<00:01:15.030> really<00:01:15.060> moving

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
in reality your hands are really moving

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.160 
in reality your hands are really moving
through<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:17.820> do<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.540> five<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.930> found

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
through that so to do the five be found

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.840 
through that so to do the five be found
you're<00:01:19.440> going<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.650> want<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.830> know<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.520> three

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
you're going to want to know the three

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.890 
you're going to want to know the three
be<00:01:21.000> found<00:01:21.770> obviously<00:01:23.600> you're<00:01:24.600> going<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.780> want

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
be found obviously you're going to want

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.370 
be found obviously you're going to want
to<00:01:24.990> know<00:01:25.140> all<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.619> your<00:01:26.010> 5<00:01:26.250> beat<00:01:26.520> weaves

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
to know all of your 5 beat weaves

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.340 
to know all of your 5 beat weaves
there's<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.470> forward<00:01:29.010> one<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:31.080> a<00:01:32.010> reverse<00:01:32.340> one

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
there's a forward one and a reverse one

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.440 
there's a forward one and a reverse one
and<00:01:34.350> be<00:01:34.710> able<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.979> transition<00:01:35.549> between<00:01:36.060> them

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
and be able to transition between them

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.060 
and be able to transition between them
that<00:01:37.140> kind<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.560> thing<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:39.890> something<00:01:40.890> that's

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
that kind of thing and something that's

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.740 
that kind of thing and something that's
helpful<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.760> know<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.180> don't<00:01:42.390> think<00:01:42.540> it's

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
helpful to know but I don't think it's

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.100 
helpful to know but I don't think it's
essential<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.680> know<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> four<00:01:44.610> beat

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
essential that you know is a four beat

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:51.190 
essential that you know is a four beat
windmill

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.679 

because<00:01:52.100> at<00:01:52.250> least<00:01:52.369> concepts<00:01:53.149> from<00:01:53.270> that<00:01:53.509> or

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
because at least concepts from that or

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.499 
because at least concepts from that or
every<00:01:53.899> worked<00:01:54.140> into<00:01:54.469> it<00:01:54.619> but<00:01:55.030> like<00:01:56.030> I<00:01:56.090> said<00:01:56.270> I

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
every worked into it but like I said I

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.560 
every worked into it but like I said I
don't<00:01:56.570> put<00:01:56.930> it<00:01:57.049> very<00:01:57.200> distinct<00:01:57.770> fountain<00:01:58.189> or

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
don't put it very distinct fountain or

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.419 
don't put it very distinct fountain or
windmill<00:01:59.570> into<00:01:59.840> my<00:01:59.929> mountains<00:02:00.380> so<00:02:00.649> I<00:02:00.950> don't

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
windmill into my mountains so I don't

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.039 
windmill into my mountains so I don't
think<00:02:01.579> that's<00:02:01.700> necessarily<00:02:02.299> essential<00:02:02.960> to

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
think that's necessarily essential to

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.319 
think that's necessarily essential to
learn<00:02:03.229> it<00:02:03.409> so<00:02:04.159> basically<00:02:04.549> to<00:02:04.759> go<00:02:04.880> from<00:02:05.090> your

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
learn it so basically to go from your

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.889 
learn it so basically to go from your
three<00:02:05.929> be<00:02:06.110> found<00:02:06.740> into<00:02:07.070> a<00:02:07.100> 5b<00:02:07.520> fountain<00:02:07.899> you

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
three be found into a 5b fountain you

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.650 
three be found into a 5b fountain you
just<00:02:09.110> put<00:02:09.349> that<00:02:10.250> extra<00:02:10.429> wrist<00:02:10.910> rotation<00:02:11.209> at

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
just put that extra wrist rotation at

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.440 
just put that extra wrist rotation at
all<00:02:11.840> for<00:02:12.140> those<00:02:12.349> locations<00:02:13.150> here's<00:02:14.150> back

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
all for those locations here's back

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.619 
all for those locations here's back
front<00:02:15.200> back<00:02:16.000> front<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:20.180> just<00:02:20.360> kind<00:02:20.599> of

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
front back front and you just kind of

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.160 
front back front and you just kind of
smoothly<00:02:20.959> move<00:02:21.319> your<00:02:21.560> hands<00:02:22.569> around<00:02:23.569> while

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
smoothly move your hands around while

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.350 
smoothly move your hands around while
you<00:02:24.319> do<00:02:24.440> this<00:02:24.620> I'd<00:02:25.430> normally<00:02:25.730> be<00:02:26.030> going<00:02:26.269> a

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
you do this I'd normally be going a

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.789 
you do this I'd normally be going a
little<00:02:26.480> higher<00:02:26.660> but<00:02:26.720> my<00:02:27.110> ceiling<00:02:27.500> is<00:02:27.620> like

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
little higher but my ceiling is like

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.759 
little higher but my ceiling is like
right<00:02:28.010> here<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:29.079> compared<00:02:30.079> with<00:02:30.230> me<00:02:30.410> on<00:02:30.530> that

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
right here so compared with me on that

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.520 
right here so compared with me on that
one<00:02:30.920> but<00:02:31.510> it's<00:02:32.510> not<00:02:32.690> really<00:02:32.959> that<00:02:33.079> hard<00:02:33.290> once

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
one but it's not really that hard once

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.960 
one but it's not really that hard once
you<00:02:33.680> know<00:02:33.829> your<00:02:33.860> five<00:02:34.220> deep<00:02:34.430> we've<00:02:34.610> some

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
you know your five deep we've some

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.150 
you know your five deep we've some
transitioning<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:35.930> your<00:02:36.799> three<00:02:37.040> beat

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
transitioning and your three beat

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.740 
transitioning and your three beat
fountain<00:02:37.579> it's<00:02:37.819> just<00:02:38.120> kind<00:02:38.299> of<00:02:38.360> putting<00:02:38.599> it

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
fountain it's just kind of putting it

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.110 
fountain it's just kind of putting it
all<00:02:38.900> together<00:02:39.049> and<00:02:39.560> you'll<00:02:40.430> notice<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:40.819> the

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
all together and you'll notice that the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.050 
all together and you'll notice that the
five<00:02:41.360> beat<00:02:41.709> fountain<00:02:42.709> is<00:02:42.829> a<00:02:42.860> really<00:02:43.280> slow<00:02:43.730> move

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
five beat fountain is a really slow move

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.960 
five beat fountain is a really slow move
I<00:02:44.390> don't<00:02:44.959> actually<00:02:45.319> use<00:02:45.349> it<00:02:45.739> very<00:02:45.890> often<00:02:46.160> just

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
I don't actually use it very often just

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.850 
I don't actually use it very often just
because<00:02:47.239> it<00:02:47.360> takes<00:02:47.540> so<00:02:47.690> long<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.019> execute<00:02:48.739> it

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
because it takes so long to execute it

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.550 
because it takes so long to execute it
and<00:02:48.920> i<00:02:48.980> think<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.370> 3d<00:02:49.959> flows<00:02:50.959> a<00:02:50.989> little<00:02:51.410> better

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
and i think the 3d flows a little better

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.870 
and i think the 3d flows a little better
because<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.579> can<00:02:52.760> just<00:02:52.790> do<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.299> quickly<00:02:54.880> but

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
because you can just do it quickly but

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.199 
because you can just do it quickly but
the<00:02:56.209> five<00:02:56.450> beat<00:02:56.720> also<00:02:57.230> works<00:02:57.530> in<00:02:58.160> its<00:02:58.970> own

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
the five beat also works in its own

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:06.250 
the five beat also works in its own
little<00:02:59.600> world<00:03:00.139> and<00:03:04.630> i'll<00:03:05.630> give<00:03:05.780> you<00:03:05.900> a<00:03:05.959> quick

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
little world and i'll give you a quick

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.020 
little world and i'll give you a quick
little<00:03:06.410> exercise<00:03:07.069> that<00:03:07.370> might<00:03:07.609> help<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:08.000> a

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
little exercise that might help you a

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.020 
little exercise that might help you a
little<00:03:08.239> bit<00:03:08.510> on<00:03:08.630> fountains<00:03:09.609> basically<00:03:10.609> I

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
little bit on fountains basically I

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.580 
little bit on fountains basically I
don't<00:03:11.480> really<00:03:11.600> have<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.840> name<00:03:12.019> for<00:03:12.079> it<00:03:12.319> called

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
don't really have a name for it called

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.650 
don't really have a name for it called
like<00:03:12.709> cyclical<00:03:13.220> weeds<00:03:13.670> or<00:03:14.030> something<00:03:14.389> stupid

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
like cyclical weeds or something stupid

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.420 
like cyclical weeds or something stupid
that<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:14.959> made<00:03:15.200> up<00:03:15.489> basically<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.950> just<00:03:18.980> move

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
that I made up basically you just move

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.300 
that I made up basically you just move
it<00:03:19.639> around<00:03:20.440> when<00:03:21.440> you're<00:03:21.590> on<00:03:21.769> one<00:03:21.920> side<00:03:22.160> you

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
it around when you're on one side you

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.349 
it around when you're on one side you
come<00:03:22.489> up<00:03:22.639> and<00:03:22.819> when<00:03:23.000> you're<00:03:23.120> on<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:23.329> other

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
come up and when you're on the other

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.870 
come up and when you're on the other
side<00:03:23.569> you<00:03:23.959> come<00:03:24.200> down<00:03:24.410> so<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.310> work<00:03:25.519> that<00:03:25.730> in

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
side you come down so to work that in

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.490 
side you come down so to work that in
with<00:03:26.030> five<00:03:26.870> beats<00:03:27.230> I<00:03:28.690> know<00:03:29.690> this<00:03:29.959> looks<00:03:30.019> kind

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
with five beats I know this looks kind

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.110 
with five beats I know this looks kind
of<00:03:30.530> cool<00:03:30.680> on<00:03:30.889> its<00:03:31.069> own<00:03:31.280> in<00:03:31.910> certain<00:03:32.359> ways<00:03:32.569> work

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
of cool on its own in certain ways work

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.520 
of cool on its own in certain ways work
and<00:03:35.120> it<00:03:35.420> doesn't<00:03:35.570> matter<00:03:35.720> which<00:03:36.200> way<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:36.560> go

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
and it doesn't matter which way to go

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.550 
and it doesn't matter which way to go
just<00:03:39.530> work<00:03:40.430> that<00:03:40.670> motion<00:03:41.090> in<00:03:41.210> there<00:03:41.420> you<00:03:42.320> cross

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
just work that motion in there you cross

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.440 
just work that motion in there you cross
over<00:03:42.830> at<00:03:43.070> the<00:03:43.160> top<00:03:43.400> and<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:43.700> bottom<00:03:43.850> and<00:03:44.240> when

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
over at the top and the bottom and when

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.750 
over at the top and the bottom and when
you're<00:03:44.600> weaving<00:03:44.900> on<00:03:45.200> each<00:03:46.130> side<00:03:46.430> you're

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
you're weaving on each side you're

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.390 
you're weaving on each side you're
moving<00:03:47.120> either<00:03:47.390> up<00:03:47.660> or<00:03:47.810> down<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.350> that<00:03:49.130> helps

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
moving either up or down and that helps

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.970 
moving either up or down and that helps
you<00:03:49.490> get<00:03:49.610> kind<00:03:49.850> of<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.030> hand<00:03:50.270> flow<00:03:50.600> of<00:03:50.780> it<00:03:50.980> but

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
you get kind of the hand flow of it but

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.590 
you get kind of the hand flow of it but
when<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:52.340> work<00:03:52.520> into<00:03:52.850> your<00:03:53.000> regular<00:03:53.150> fountain

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
when you work into your regular fountain

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.480 
when you work into your regular fountain
you<00:03:54.290> saw<00:03:54.500> that<00:03:54.530> way<00:03:54.860> you<00:03:54.920> had<00:03:55.160> two<00:03:55.370> different

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
you saw that way you had two different

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.190 
you saw that way you had two different
directions<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:56.180> can<00:03:56.210> go<00:03:56.540> for<00:03:57.380> your<00:03:57.560> fountain

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
directions you can go for your fountain

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.810 
directions you can go for your fountain
you're<00:04:00.200> always<00:04:00.410> going<00:04:00.890> to<00:04:00.950> continue<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.700> way

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
you're always going to continue the way

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.150 
you're always going to continue the way
the<00:04:02.000> ploy<00:04:02.209> or<00:04:02.240> spinning<00:04:02.930> because<00:04:03.560> you<00:04:03.770> see<00:04:03.980> now

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
the ploy or spinning because you see now

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.830 
the ploy or spinning because you see now
they're<00:04:04.459> tending<00:04:04.910> to<00:04:05.030> spin<00:04:05.300> up<00:04:05.510> on<00:04:05.750> the

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
they're tending to spin up on the

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.460 
they're tending to spin up on the
outside<00:04:06.580> so<00:04:07.580> I<00:04:07.610> come<00:04:08.000> around<00:04:08.150> here<00:04:08.690> I'm<00:04:09.290> going

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
outside so I come around here I'm going

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.680 
outside so I come around here I'm going
to<00:04:09.560> follow<00:04:09.770> the<00:04:10.070> pouring<00:04:10.459> if<00:04:11.180> you<00:04:11.390> go<00:04:11.510> the

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
to follow the pouring if you go the

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.120 
to follow the pouring if you go the
other<00:04:11.720> way<00:04:12.370> we're<00:04:13.370> doing<00:04:13.489> the<00:04:13.700> Mantis<00:04:14.090> book

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
other way we're doing the Mantis book

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.539 
other way we're doing the Mantis book
which<00:04:16.130> is<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.370> little<00:04:16.519> bit<00:04:16.700> harder<00:04:17.000> to<00:04:17.030> do<00:04:17.329> and

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
which is a little bit harder to do and

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.940 
which is a little bit harder to do and
five<00:04:19.549> beat<00:04:19.790> them<00:04:20.000> isn't<00:04:20.299> helping<00:04:20.780> it<00:04:20.930> be<00:04:21.799> any

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
five beat them isn't helping it be any

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.159 
five beat them isn't helping it be any
easier<00:04:22.400> but<00:04:22.460> that's<00:04:22.880> that's<00:04:23.630> something<00:04:24.050> else

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
easier but that's that's something else
