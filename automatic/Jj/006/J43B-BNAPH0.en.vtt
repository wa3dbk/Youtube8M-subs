00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
of the park and then that's what in the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.700 
of the park and then that's what in the
end<00:01:59.149> of<00:01:59.240> spring<00:01:59.390> weeks<00:01:59.539> about<00:01:59.659> is<00:02:00.020> his<00:02:00.500> guys

end of spring weeks about is his guys

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.550 
end of spring weeks about is his guys
going<00:02:01.159> to<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.310> nail<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:01.880> back<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:03.020> forth<00:02:03.289> and

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
going to the nail and back and forth and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.130 
going to the nail and back and forth and
you<00:02:03.860> know<00:02:04.670> sliders<00:02:05.240> clearing<00:02:05.719> only<00:02:05.960> by

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
you know sliders clearing only by

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.840 
you know sliders clearing only by
quarter<00:02:06.829> of<00:02:06.920> an<00:02:07.009> inch<00:02:07.100> that's<00:02:07.369> all<00:02:07.579> it<00:02:07.700> takes

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
quarter of an inch that's all it takes

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.160 
quarter of an inch that's all it takes
and<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.539> think<00:02:08.780> there's<00:02:08.929> a<00:02:08.989> lot<00:02:09.140> of

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
and I think there's a lot of

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.389 
and I think there's a lot of
back-and-forth<00:02:09.380> racing<00:02:09.830> without<00:02:10.039> a<00:02:10.190> lot<00:02:10.369> of

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
back-and-forth racing without a lot of

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.339 
back-and-forth racing without a lot of
touching<00:02:10.729> tonight<00:02:10.970> up<00:02:11.120> front<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:11.630> had<00:02:12.260> it

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
touching tonight up front and had it

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.630 
touching tonight up front and had it
been<00:02:12.440> fun<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.709> watch<00:02:12.739> it<00:02:13.069> was<00:02:13.190> fun<00:02:13.310> from<00:02:13.459> where

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
been fun to watch it was fun from where

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.289 
been fun to watch it was fun from where
I<00:02:13.670> was<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:15.920> know<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.280> was<00:02:16.880> hoping<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.180> come

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
I was and you know I was hoping to come

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:18.400 
I was and you know I was hoping to come
out<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:17.540> see<00:02:17.660> that<00:02:17.780> come<00:02:17.959> around<00:02:18.049> four<00:02:18.380> and

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
out and see that come around four and

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.539 
out and see that come around four and
see<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.680> checkered<00:02:19.010> instead<00:02:19.250> of<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.400> yellow

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
see the checkered instead of the yellow

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.460 
see the checkered instead of the yellow
there<00:02:19.819> at<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.030> end<00:02:20.180> but<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.959> guess<00:02:21.440> that's

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
there at the end but I guess that's

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.040 
there at the end but I guess that's
racin
