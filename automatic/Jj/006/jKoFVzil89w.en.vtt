00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
constantly boiling pots and pots and

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.540 
constantly boiling pots and pots and
pots<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.190> water<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:42.080> hot<00:02:43.080> 20<00:02:43.980> odd<00:02:44.070> pots<00:02:44.370> of

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
pots of water and hot 20 odd pots of

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.960 
pots of water and hot 20 odd pots of
water<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.820> think<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.300> I<00:02:45.540> done<00:02:46.260> or<00:02:46.410> more<00:02:46.730> or<00:02:47.730> far

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
water I think I I done or more or far

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.870 
water I think I I done or more or far
more<00:02:48.120> in<00:02:48.239> fact<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:49.620> was<00:02:49.770> 180<00:02:50.340> minute<00:02:50.670> burn

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
more in fact so that was 180 minute burn

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.560 
more in fact so that was 180 minute burn
time<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:53.540> 190<00:02:54.540> grams<00:02:55.340> 90<00:02:56.340> grams<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:57.000> most<00:02:57.420> to

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
time and 190 grams 90 grams so most to

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.229 
time and 190 grams 90 grams so most to
make<00:02:57.690> commits<00:02:58.080> estimate<00:02:58.620> for<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:59.030> net1<00:03:00.030> there

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
make commits estimate for the net1 there

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.110 
make commits estimate for the net1 there
as<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:00.510> should<00:03:00.660> have<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.870> burn<00:03:01.110> time<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:02.120> 90

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
as it should have a burn time of 90

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.979 
as it should have a burn time of 90
minutes<00:03:03.270> this<00:03:03.660> one<00:03:03.840> here<00:03:04.730> because

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
minutes this one here because

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.900 
minutes this one here because
approximately<00:03:06.989> half<00:03:07.200> so<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.310> probably<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.730> burn

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
approximately half so so probably a burn

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.410 
approximately half so so probably a burn
rate<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.299> about<00:03:09.540> um<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:10.310> gram<00:03:14.150> or<00:03:15.150> just<00:03:15.299> under

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
rate of about um a gram or just under

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.340 
rate of about um a gram or just under
gram<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.780> minute<00:03:16.110> but<00:03:17.450> really<00:03:18.450> interesting<00:03:19.260> we

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
gram a minute but really interesting we

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.140 
gram a minute but really interesting we
experimental<00:03:19.950> done<00:03:20.070> there<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:20.880> that's<00:03:21.030> a

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
experimental done there so that's a

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.490 
experimental done there so that's a
different<00:03:21.420> size<00:03:21.600> now<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:21.900> can't<00:03:22.140> get<00:03:22.350> these

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
different size now you can't get these

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.520 
different size now you can't get these
sizes<00:03:22.769> anymore<00:03:23.250> they<00:03:23.519> are<00:03:23.700> not<00:03:24.000> made<00:03:24.209> anymore

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
sizes anymore they are not made anymore

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.750 
sizes anymore they are not made anymore
what<00:03:25.530> you've<00:03:25.680> got<00:03:25.920> is<00:03:26.100> all<00:03:26.250> you've<00:03:26.400> got<00:03:26.430> you're

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
what you've got is all you've got you're

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.250 
what you've got is all you've got you're
going<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:26.970> get<00:03:27.090> no<00:03:27.239> more<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:27.660> if<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.810> find<00:03:27.959> some

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
going to get no more so if you find some

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.910 
going to get no more so if you find some
of<00:03:28.290> these<00:03:29.989> and<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.230> want<00:03:31.380> to<00:03:31.530> sort<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.769> keep

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
of these and you want to sort of keep

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.080 
of these and you want to sort of keep
your<00:03:32.100> kept<00:03:32.340> together<00:03:32.489> as<00:03:32.820> an<00:03:32.940> original

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
your kept together as an original

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.610 
your kept together as an original
condition<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:33.660> don't<00:03:33.840> use<00:03:34.049> them<00:03:34.200> very<00:03:34.260> often

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
condition you don't use them very often

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.020 
condition you don't use them very often
but<00:03:35.280> because<00:03:35.580> I've<00:03:35.730> got<00:03:35.910> three<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.209> them<00:03:38.030> one

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
do now is find out what that belongs to

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.120 
do now is find out what that belongs to
and<00:04:08.630> I'll<00:04:09.630> try<00:04:09.989> and<00:04:10.140> find<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.380> guest<00:04:10.590> caster<00:04:10.980> for

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
and I'll try and find a guest caster for

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.220 
and I'll try and find a guest caster for
that<00:04:11.220> old<00:04:11.370> baby<00:04:11.640> there<00:04:12.170> that'll<00:04:13.170> be

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
that old baby there that'll be

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.320 
that old baby there that'll be
interesting<00:04:13.319> too<00:04:13.739> so<00:04:14.130> if<00:04:14.220> we<00:04:14.370> click<00:04:14.610> some<00:04:14.880> old

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
interesting too so if we click some old

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.030 
interesting too so if we click some old
geezers<00:04:15.900> your<00:04:16.830> fridge<00:04:17.190> collection

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
geezers your fridge collection

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.540 
geezers your fridge collection
and<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:19.870> I<00:04:20.080> might<00:04:20.290> just<00:04:20.320> fire<00:04:20.680> this<00:04:20.860> thing<00:04:20.920> up<00:04:21.370> I

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:21.550 
and so I might just fire this thing up I

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.660 
and so I might just fire this thing up I
just<00:04:22.210> put<00:04:22.390> that<00:04:22.510> on<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:22.720> frame<00:04:22.960> then<00:04:23.170> air<00:04:25.200> and

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
just put that on the frame then air and

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.720 
just put that on the frame then air and
fire<00:04:27.670> up<00:04:27.940> for<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:29.040> is<00:04:30.040> it<00:04:30.220> awkward<00:04:30.310> this<00:04:30.550> one

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
it's a bit old these things don't like

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:40.340 
it's a bit old these things don't like
