that<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.580> cool<00:01:27.110> ok<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.170> yeah<00:01:28.500> when<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.890> when

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
that is so cool ok so yeah when you when

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.249

is<00:01:31.380> compatible<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.840> I'm<00:01:33.840> thinking<00:01:34.259> I'd

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
is compatible with it I'm thinking I'd

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.800 
is compatible with it I'm thinking I'd
rather<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.220> where<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.210> assign<00:01:36.570> it

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
rather have it where you assign it

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.950 
rather have it where you assign it
individually<00:01:38.060> yourself<00:01:39.060> instead<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.689> having

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
individually yourself instead of having

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.440 
individually yourself instead of having
the<00:01:40.200> game<00:01:40.380> assign<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.400> armored<00:01:42.030> eyes<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.360> your

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
the game assign the armored eyes to your

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.810 
the game assign the armored eyes to your
armor<00:01:42.720> for<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.140> maybe<00:01:43.829> that's<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.340> an<00:01:44.549> alpha

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
armor for you maybe that's just an alpha

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.270 
armor for you maybe that's just an alpha
thing<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.450> think<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:45.960> would<00:01:46.079> be<00:01:46.110> much<00:01:47.070> much

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
thing but I think it would be much much

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.520 
thing but I think it would be much much
better<00:01:47.490> if<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.880> could<00:01:48.060> customize<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.659> but

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
better if you could customize it but

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.410 
better if you could customize it but
