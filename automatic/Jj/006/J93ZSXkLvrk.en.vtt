00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
techniques on how to use a motorized

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:14.190 
techniques on how to use a motorized
slider<00:01:06.720> for<00:01:07.320> video

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.080 

alright<00:01:15.200> guys<00:01:15.440> let's<00:01:15.770> check<00:01:16.310> out<00:01:16.549> the<00:01:16.820> first

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
alright guys let's check out the first

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.690 
alright guys let's check out the first
trick<00:01:17.659> that<00:01:17.840> I<00:01:17.869> have<00:01:17.960> for<00:01:18.440> you<00:01:18.590> we<00:01:19.250> all<00:01:19.430> know

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
trick that I have for you we all know

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.370 
trick that I have for you we all know
the<00:01:19.909> technique<00:01:20.390> where<00:01:20.750> we<00:01:20.810> can<00:01:21.080> film

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
the technique where we can film

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.399 
the technique where we can film
ourselves<00:01:21.619> twice<00:01:22.430> and<00:01:22.790> then<00:01:23.450> blend<00:01:23.840> those<00:01:24.140> two

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
ourselves twice and then blend those two

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.740 
ourselves twice and then blend those two
clips<00:01:24.710> together<00:01:25.159> to<00:01:25.610> create<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:26.180> duplication

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
clips together to create a duplication

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.100 
clips together to create a duplication
effect<00:01:27.320> now<00:01:28.190> the<00:01:28.520> problem<00:01:29.060> is<00:01:29.210> that<00:01:29.659> we<00:01:29.930> need

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
effect now the problem is that we need

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.850 
effect now the problem is that we need
two<00:01:30.470> camera<00:01:30.979> shots<00:01:31.250> that<00:01:31.610> cannot<00:01:32.149> move<00:01:32.630> if<00:01:32.990> we

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
two camera shots that cannot move if we

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.130 
two camera shots that cannot move if we
are<00:01:34.040> going<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.550> move<00:01:34.759> the<00:01:34.970> camera<00:01:35.270> then<00:01:35.960> they

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
are going to move the camera then they

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.620 
are going to move the camera then they
also<00:01:36.350> have<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.860> move<00:01:37.070> both<00:01:37.460> exactly<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.479> same

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
also have to move both exactly the same

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.859 
also have to move both exactly the same
and<00:01:39.350> that's<00:01:40.280> something<00:01:40.640> we<00:01:41.000> can<00:01:41.210> do<00:01:41.390> with<00:01:41.420> a

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
and that's something we can do with a

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.039 
and that's something we can do with a
motorized<00:01:42.590> slider<00:01:43.240> align<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.420> camera<00:01:44.869> to<00:01:45.020> the

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
motorized slider align the camera to the

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.590 
motorized slider align the camera to the
beginning<00:01:45.560> by<00:01:45.920> bumping<00:01:46.490> on<00:01:46.670> one<00:01:47.030> end<00:01:47.270> of<00:01:47.479> the

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
beginning by bumping on one end of the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.770 
beginning by bumping on one end of the
slider<00:01:47.960> then<00:01:48.649> film<00:01:49.039> the<00:01:49.250> first<00:01:49.520> piece<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:50.060> do

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
slider then film the first piece and do

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.100 
slider then film the first piece and do
the<00:01:50.929> same<00:01:51.200> for<00:01:51.530> your<00:01:51.679> second<00:01:52.159> shot<00:01:52.429> in<00:01:53.110> the

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
the same for your second shot in the

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.230 
the same for your second shot in the
post-production<00:01:54.530> you<00:01:55.220> will<00:01:55.340> see<00:01:55.580> that<00:01:55.789> both

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
post-production you will see that both

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.020 
post-production you will see that both
movements<00:01:56.750> will<00:01:57.259> match<00:01:57.560> perfectly<00:01:58.030> because

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
movements will match perfectly because

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.590 
movements will match perfectly because
we<00:01:59.330> are<00:01:59.420> using<00:01:59.690> a<00:01:59.960> motorized<00:02:00.560> movement<00:02:01.600> the

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
we are using a motorized movement the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.690 
we are using a motorized movement the
next<00:02:02.899> trick<00:02:03.140> is<00:02:03.170> an<00:02:03.409> advantage<00:02:03.800> we<00:02:04.220> have<00:02:04.399> with

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
next trick is an advantage we have with

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.180 
next trick is an advantage we have with
the<00:02:04.819> Canova's<00:02:05.420> motorized<00:02:05.960> system<00:02:06.470> their

in<00:02:10.039> other<00:02:10.700> words<00:02:11.090> a<00:02:11.360> smooth<00:02:11.959> start<00:02:12.410> and<00:02:12.709> a

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
in other words a smooth start and a

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.300 
in other words a smooth start and a
smooth<00:02:13.489> ending<00:02:14.080> which<00:02:15.080> we<00:02:15.290> can<00:02:15.440> set<00:02:15.680> on<00:02:15.890> how

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
smooth ending which we can set on how

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.819 
smooth ending which we can set on how
long<00:02:16.670> that<00:02:16.880> has<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.209> take<00:02:17.450> when<00:02:18.410> we<00:02:18.560> try<00:02:18.799> to

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
long that has to take when we try to

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.670 
long that has to take when we try to
film<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.489> close<00:02:19.880> object<00:02:20.540> it's<00:02:21.019> not<00:02:21.140> always<00:02:21.440> that

film a close object it's not always that

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.699 
film a close object it's not always that
easy<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.459> start<00:02:22.820> ends<00:02:23.269> and<00:02:23.420> smoothly<00:02:23.989> by<00:02:24.350> hand

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709

great<00:03:43.860> advantages<00:03:44.040> of<00:03:44.820> a<00:03:45.030> motorized<00:03:45.690> slider

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
great advantages of a motorized slider

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.310 
great advantages of a motorized slider
one<00:03:47.130> is<00:03:47.310> that<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.850> controller<00:03:48.300> can<00:03:48.630> slide<00:03:48.990> to

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
one is that the controller can slide to

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.590 
one is that the controller can slide to
a<00:03:49.350> certain<00:03:49.890> height<00:03:49.920> that<00:03:50.730> I<00:03:51.150> can<00:03:51.360> no<00:03:51.570> longer

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
a certain height that I can no longer

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.620 
a certain height that I can no longer
reach<00:03:52.170> and<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:53.250> second<00:03:53.700> thing<00:03:53.910> is<00:03:54.090> that<00:03:54.120> the

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
reach and the second thing is that the

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.740 
reach and the second thing is that the
sliding<00:03:54.990> will<00:03:55.320> go<00:03:55.500> very<00:03:55.830> smoothly<00:03:56.340> and

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
sliding will go very smoothly and

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.840 
sliding will go very smoothly and
constant<00:03:57.750> you'll<00:03:58.560> find<00:03:58.950> out<00:03:59.190> that<00:03:59.520> when

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
constant you'll find out that when

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.030 
constant you'll find out that when
you're<00:03:59.970> going<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.270> do<00:04:00.510> a<00:04:00.540> slight<00:04:01.050> vertical<00:04:01.860> it

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
you're going to do a slight vertical it

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.310 
you're going to do a slight vertical it
won't<00:04:02.790> be<00:04:02.940> that<00:04:03.120> easy<00:04:03.150> when<00:04:03.840> you're<00:04:03.960> going<00:04:04.170> to

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
won't be that easy when you're going to

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.820
