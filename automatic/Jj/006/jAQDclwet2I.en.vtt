00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.390
 it is seven o'clock local time on Friday evening and then two years ago 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.390
 all the first parquet 2 went over the counter 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:13.290
 the ball is in the away game tomorrow 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.960
 it is still a bit too early for an extensive review, but I still want to give you a moment 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.439
 let you enjoy with 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.470
 the very first images 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.060
 let's go see the needle right away 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.740
 we are going to start of course with that feeling I grabbed him 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.460
 A court states that that 30 percent is thinner and the joke is that you feel with 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.160
 a 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.570
 the and that is not only because they actually want to race but that is 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.770
 also because it is made differently from the ipad and a spotted look when you look 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.840
 to the exhaustion 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.900
 this is a separation on the side and you can feel it immediately 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.490
 grasping walnuts, you see that there is the eyepet 2 there it can 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.520
 rounding all the way to the edge making it the actually much thin 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.920
 looks if looks now than it already is 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.010
 what maybe 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.590
 I have noticed that the poem is just a little bit 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.420
 avoid light in the emo way maybe in combination with one that the 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.480
 new president 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.930
 you will feel a lot lighter and easier than the ipad perpignan 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.760
 and that a great improvement we manage this against 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.330
 the 3g model with 64 gigabytes 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.530
 then 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.530
 well as a to look a lot further 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.430
 and we explain that he is next to it 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.450
 a 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.830
 only a few problems 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.130
 my know both put the work on 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.759
 Then it looks like the display's exhaustion 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.410
 the side 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.440
 that one is the basement for the exhaustion but yes there it is 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.790
 of course also have to do with it and that we have had the away game for a while 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.520
 use after week nail is new 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.550
 a 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.670
 well what stands out there are of course immediately the new neat to the animals 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.190
 namely find his two stand and 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.680
 camera 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.030
 photo above after the tea are that we all know from the ai van 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.110
 camera surveillance looks exactly the same as the camera even if the camera tip 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.110
 but on the iphone 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.799
 you can't do the bobbled even with the camera on the back of the pet 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.529
 focus you get to see such a square but that is only because the 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:23.169
 colors and the brightness 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:27.729
 but both cameras do not focus, so I do not expect that 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:31.739
 the ipad 2 that you can do well with that or that you can film well 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.239
 you will be disappointed 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.709
 of course, those cameras are primarily intended for video 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.719
 then we are going to have a photo album 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.650
 what falls on it beh 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.140
 outside of course again the bad camera is that the effect is 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.029
 incredibly fast 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:50.669
 work so you can see all the effects are possible see my photo above 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:55.479
 directly in front of you and they also do it live when it comes to your neck 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:59.340
 of course because of the new powerful ach five processor 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.370
 go take a look at 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.680
 and hard work there is of the ipad 2 namely the 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:06.499
 spyker 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:07.559
 well 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:11.699
 that is different than in the ipad one leaves but his forehead and retention difference 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:12.339
 in 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:15.739
 you can hear them put the two away games side by side 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.209
 the old 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:24.929
 9 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:30.609
 the 

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:34.919
 nl the new 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.919
 gamble 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.169
 stijn what stands out more 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.969
 just put a little on the table and the old one actually sounds better, but that will come 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:47.590
 because the speaker is therefore the design 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.810
 especially with the new spyker site at the back which means if you put it more 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.810
 sound a bit hollow but I still want you on 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.249
 that actually sounds better than on the a like that 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:59.249
 well then there is one thing about the ipad 2 

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:03.129
 but it is not surprising to pay a lot of attention to it, so we have to take that along too 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.809
 to do 

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:05.599
 the smart buyer 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.689
 this is the rotary members 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.179
 and there he has ds 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:15.059
 that you simply had him close to the facts and that he would naturally 

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:17.739
 in the right way 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.469
 and indeed he does 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:22.900
 what if I keep the smart heads around a bit 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.319
 it immediately clicked on the side 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:27.569
 the screen is also going to limit that the screen 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:29.409
 but falls out and 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:31.699
 as soon as you grow up 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:32.979
 goes the screen job 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.069
 the cia and marco sag further you naturally you can m 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:37.159
 the zoo 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.650
 turn around 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.740
 so you can pittem well that goes on itself and now is a bit loose but on 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.669
 I am quite happy to do it there 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.990
 I can put it down like that and that has us watching 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.300
 what is useful on this shore 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.300
 whether improvement is also that it goes better 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.539
 with the suitcase that it got at the old oudijk I could easily get away with it 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.880
 put side but that always wanted a bit this seems much stronger 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:02.550
 stand 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.010
 the spark of years that seems to me a real must and to include 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:09.949
 always all the stuff 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:15.250
 unbelievable more exciting the project for out of bed but also clearly one 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.029
 a place where 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:18.990
 and I brought you 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.280
 one with buying an out of bed then the ipad 2 is definitely worth it 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:26.689
 But don't think you are with the night of the bands with you 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:28.539
 became allard 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.879
 well that's where all we meet 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:34.249
 so soon to come out from the second have to say about it 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:37.229
 device especially keep an eye on lambert because it is still there 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.069
 have a lot about labor 2
