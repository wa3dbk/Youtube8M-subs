and to manipulate so anyway and then
then<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.640> finish<00:02:48.000> they'd<00:02:48.569> very<00:02:49.230> unique<00:02:49.650> we

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
then the finish they'd very unique we

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.069 
then the finish they'd very unique we
went<00:02:50.430> through<00:02:50.730> many<00:02:50.940> incarnations<00:02:51.209> with<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
went through many incarnations with the

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.110 
went through many incarnations with the
skin<00:02:52.319> tone<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.769> skin<00:02:52.860> skin<00:02:53.549> tone<00:02:53.730> is<00:02:53.849> kind<00:02:54.060> of

skin tone the skin skin tone is kind of

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.880 
skin tone the skin skin tone is kind of
a<00:02:54.180> brighter<00:02:54.480> blue<00:02:54.780> than<00:02:55.079> you<00:02:55.230> then<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.680> think

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
a brighter blue than you then you think

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.130 
a brighter blue than you then you think
it<00:02:56.069> is<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.549> it's<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.420> little<00:02:57.450> darker<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.079> a

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
it is and it's a little darker and a

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.390 
it is and it's a little darker and a
little<00:02:58.200> brighter<00:02:58.620> than<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.040> think<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.370> is

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
little brighter than you think it is

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.990 
little brighter than you think it is
more<00:02:59.700> color<00:02:59.940> saturation<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:01.459> to<00:03:02.459> get<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.790> it

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
more color saturation so to get that it

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.240 
more color saturation so to get that it
was<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.120> special<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.930> was<00:03:03.989> a<00:03:04.049> special<00:03:04.470> resin

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
was a special it was a special resin

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.089 
was a special it was a special resin
formula<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.750> think<00:03:07.140> we<00:03:07.260> were<00:03:07.349> able<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.590> to

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
formula and I think we were able to to

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.069 
formula and I think we were able to to
nail<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.730> then<00:03:09.030> on<00:03:09.120> top<00:03:09.329> of<00:03:09.390> that<00:03:09.599> it's<00:03:09.810> it

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
nail it and then on top of that it's it

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.370 
nail it and then on top of that it's it
the<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:11.099> figures<00:03:11.850> airbrushed<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.810> then

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
the the the figures airbrushed and then

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.289 
the the the figures airbrushed and then
hand<00:03:13.620> painted<00:03:13.709> so<00:03:14.489> there's<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.760> lot<00:03:14.940> of<00:03:14.970> hand

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
hand painted so there's a lot of hand

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.629 
hand painted so there's a lot of hand
work<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.810> goes<00:03:15.930> into<00:03:16.200> these<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:17.040> make<00:03:17.400> them

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
work that goes into these to make them

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.449 
work that goes into these to make them
all<00:03:17.850> very<00:03:18.209> very<00:03:18.540> special<00:03:19.049> so<00:03:19.500> anyway<00:03:20.280> they're
