00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
all right what is up guys in my hands

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.030 
all right what is up guys in my hands
right<00:00:02.550> now<00:00:02.790> I<00:00:03.030> have<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.419> Mach<00:00:03.689> 5<00:00:03.720> livery<00:00:04.350> which

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
right now I have the Mach 5 livery which

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.980 
right now I have the Mach 5 livery which
in<00:00:05.279> case<00:00:05.430> you<00:00:05.609> didn't<00:00:05.970> know<00:00:06.089> what<00:00:06.720> it<00:00:06.810> does

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
in case you didn't know what it does

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.379 
in case you didn't know what it does
essentially<00:00:07.529> is<00:00:07.680> take<00:00:08.069> your<00:00:08.220> AT&amp;T<00:00:08.670> cellular

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
essentially is take your AT&amp;T cellular

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.589 
essentially is take your AT&amp;T cellular
signal<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.610> basically<00:00:11.610> converts<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.120> into<00:00:12.269> a

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
signal and basically converts it into a

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.110 
signal and basically converts it into a
Wi-Fi<00:00:13.110> signal<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.740> sends<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.460> out<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.849> any

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
Wi-Fi signal and sends that out to any

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.790 
Wi-Fi signal and sends that out to any
of<00:00:15.570> your<00:00:15.660> devices<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.379> can<00:00:16.470> connect

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
of your devices that you can connect

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.980 
of your devices that you can connect
with<00:00:16.890> Wi-Fi<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:18.090> connect<00:00:18.359> up<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.600> 10

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
with Wi-Fi and you connect up to 10

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.250 
with Wi-Fi and you connect up to 10
devices<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:20.369> also<00:00:20.520> connects<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.510> 4G<00:00:22.020> in

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
devices on it it also connects to 4G in

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.900 
devices on it it also connects to 4G in
case<00:00:22.439> you're<00:00:22.590> wondering<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.340> get<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.609> very

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
case you're wondering so you get a very

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.109 
case you're wondering so you get a very
very<00:00:23.970> high<00:00:24.390> speeds<00:00:24.720> especially<00:00:25.529> me<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:26.699> this

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
very high speeds especially me in this

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.730 
very high speeds especially me in this
particular<00:00:27.420> spot<00:00:27.960> because<00:00:28.260> they<00:00:28.349> get<00:00:28.500> full

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
particular spot because they get full

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.740 
particular spot because they get full
service<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.460> 4G<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:30.060> can<00:00:30.359> tell<00:00:30.539> which<00:00:30.720> is

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
service of 4G you can tell which is

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.510 
service of 4G you can tell which is
great<00:00:31.199> because<00:00:31.470> they're<00:00:31.830> just<00:00:31.980> great<00:00:32.369> great

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
great because they're just great great

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.080 
great because they're just great great
speeds

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
speeds

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.209 
speeds
I<00:00:33.630> haven't<00:00:34.200> actually<00:00:34.350> gotten<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.770> test<00:00:35.070> out

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
I haven't actually gotten to test out

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.760 
I haven't actually gotten to test out
the<00:00:35.340> speeds<00:00:35.610> yet<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.570> will<00:00:37.140> probably<00:00:37.380> do

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
the speeds yet but I will probably do

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.010 
the speeds yet but I will probably do
that<00:00:37.920> further<00:00:38.160> review<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.420> front<00:00:39.660> here<00:00:39.870> it

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
that further review on the front here it

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.500 
that further review on the front here it
is<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> 2.8<00:00:41.010> inch<00:00:41.280> screen<00:00:41.850> which<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.270> always

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
is a 2.8 inch screen which is always

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.750 
is a 2.8 inch screen which is always
measured<00:00:43.050> diagonally<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:44.360> that's<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:46.020> is

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
measured diagonally so that's that it is

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.979 
measured diagonally so that's that it is
using<00:00:47.760> my<00:00:47.879> five<00:00:48.120> technology<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.750> case<00:00:48.899> you

11 hours I haven't gotten 11 hours so
far<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.560> will<00:01:19.830> continue<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.280> test<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
far but I will continue to test that and

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.679 
far but I will continue to test that and
see<00:01:21.900> how<00:01:21.930> much<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.560> do<00:01:22.650> get<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:23.189> average<00:01:23.570> but<00:01:24.570> it

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
see how much I do get on average but it

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.530 
see how much I do get on average but it
is<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> very<00:01:25.140> big<00:01:25.380> batteries<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.009> tale<00:01:26.540> compare

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
is a very big batteries you tale compare

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.660 
is a very big batteries you tale compare
it<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.900> rest<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.290> device<00:01:28.560> very<00:01:29.369> big

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
it to the rest of the device very big

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.210 
it to the rest of the device very big
and<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:31.049> far<00:01:31.259> as<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.500> know<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:31.950> only

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
and as far as I know this is the only

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.660 
and as far as I know this is the only
touchscreen<00:01:33.530> mobile<00:01:34.530> hotspot<00:01:35.009> on<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.310> market

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
touchscreen mobile hotspot on the market

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.030 
touchscreen mobile hotspot on the market
so<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.030> very<00:01:36.240> cool<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:37.259> know<00:01:37.290> it's

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
so that is very cool and you know it's

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.649 
so that is very cool and you know it's
very<00:01:38.460> small<00:01:38.759> but<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.119> really<00:01:39.360> don't<00:01:39.509> need<00:01:39.600> a

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
very small but you really don't need a

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.899 
very small but you really don't need a
big<00:01:39.840> touchscreen<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:41.009> just<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.520> mobile

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
big touchscreen for just a mobile

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.620 
big touchscreen for just a mobile
hotspot<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:44.280> yeah<00:01:44.430> something<00:01:45.149> that's<00:01:45.360> really

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
hotspot so yeah something that's really

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.200 
hotspot so yeah something that's really
cool<00:01:45.840> about<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.409> micro<00:01:47.130> SD<00:01:47.430> card<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.030> any

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
cool about the micro SD card is that any

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.789 
cool about the micro SD card is that any
device<00:01:48.540> that's<00:01:48.689> connected<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.579> device

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
device that's connected to this device

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.830 
device that's connected to this device
this<00:01:52.799> devices<00:01:53.220> connection<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:54.299> will<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.540> able

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
on that micro SD card which I thought

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.360 
on that micro SD card which I thought
was<00:02:18.030> really<00:02:18.269> cool<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.920> let's<00:02:19.950> go<00:02:20.129> ahead<00:02:20.190> and

don't<00:03:05.010> know<00:03:05.129> why<00:03:05.310> you'd<00:03:05.489> turn<00:03:05.670> off<00:03:05.790> the

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
don't know why you'd turn off the

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
cellular data because you know that's

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.470 
cellular data because you know that's
basically<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.340> main<00:03:08.549> point<00:03:08.909> to<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.150> device

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
basically the main point to this device

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.610 
basically the main point to this device
but<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.260> guess<00:03:10.560> if<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.739> want<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:10.950> do<00:03:11.040> that<00:03:12.620> going

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
but I guess if you want to do that going

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.990 
but I guess if you want to do that going
back<00:03:13.890> here<00:03:14.099> you<00:03:14.220> can<00:03:14.280> check<00:03:14.430> your<00:03:14.579> messages

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
back here you can check your messages

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.030 
back here you can check your messages
you<00:03:15.329> do<00:03:15.480> file<00:03:15.750> sharing<00:03:16.169> you're<00:03:16.769> gonna<00:03:16.859> do
