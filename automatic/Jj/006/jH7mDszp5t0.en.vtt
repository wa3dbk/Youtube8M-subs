00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.000 
Saturday night idea and I'm not sure
about<00:01:51.570> because<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.680> Taylor<00:01:52.860> Swift

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
about because of the Taylor Swift

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.390 
about because of the Taylor Swift
