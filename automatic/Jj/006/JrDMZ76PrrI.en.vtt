00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 good hello everyone today I'm going to show you 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.830
 a tutorial we are worth 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.830
 a light 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.830
 like everything down to have the floor 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.599
 1 a guatemala knows 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.860
 well we put it in contact 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.840
 no position is operating the light 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.060
 Well now she is hurt by that not in a 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.410
 weapon 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.640
 can not see 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.640
 but not all the exhibition 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.159
 as well 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.159
 how is it 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.550
 good what you have to do is 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:57.930
 very easy you just have to get this 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.469
 part of the good motorcycle and search 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.469
 the two little heads 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.970
 long 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.920
 of that focus are the cables milestones 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:19.479
 positive and negative and what they are going to do 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.880
 is to grab two wires not connected to a 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.579
 little bit 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.700
 a small lamp tell us that very 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:30.060
 large usually merits 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.380
 to the two bulbs 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.420
 the site notes of fire and 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.710
 connect them to the position light of the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.420
 motorcycle 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.270
 then when you turn on a 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.040
 evolution is going to transfer current 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.600
 by the overhead light cable and the 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.810
 light up those cables I want 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.000
 the trick is there 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.220
 understand this course of learning point 1 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.200
 execution we will look for here below 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.200
 or a warrior motorcycle 110 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.220
 and it's very easy 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.950
 They provoke us a little dish of light that 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.929
 you want to fly blue red green 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.209
 etc 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.909
 It is very easy and simple to put new 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.150
 cables next to not cut the wires 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:19.520
 that 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.620
 he has neither in health nor this light 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.360
 so it is always better to those of 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:29.650
 position because less risk if they break 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.810
 these lights in the cinema a motorcycle 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.770
 and good if it's very easy 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.770
 and we are going to do 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.380
 position position in the first 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.250
 position in the first and of course not 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.760
 come in the long run 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.760
 do not 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.210
 and the long and short cuts 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.740
 in an exhibition 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.920
 I do not know that with those sites you stick to 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.920
 month 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.300
 this is very simple 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.410
 and night student very well then we go 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.600
 let's see 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.290
 and good absolute calculation 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.290
 do not
