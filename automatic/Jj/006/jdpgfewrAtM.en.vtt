00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.150
 ah 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.389
 ah 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.660
 it's as if it 's another new one in the 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.340
 title triads of libri series in large 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.050
 5 cars that then I'm going 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.150
 to teach is a small and this king the 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.710
 which we will find it in a short part 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.840
 I'm going to talk about what great neighbor 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.789
 point 5 and its location is right here ok 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.590
 where is this type of varga and 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.199
 this pitchers that's what it's called 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.879
 right in this corner ok then 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.350
 Now I'm going to move away from the map to 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.290
 that can see where on the map 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.519
 it's right here ok then one time 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.650
 that have already seen what you are doing 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.089
 this and if you are wondering why I bring 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.070
 in this mode and I do not bring it what's going 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.300
 doing the online mode because I do not know 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.470
 found in the online mode eur and is 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.540
 I am going to check them in fact to me 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.850
 as a character he already leaves it already and look 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.470
 Now let me leave it like that for 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.850
 that people do not panic and I will say 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.909
 to see how the big triads 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.620
 point 5 how is that then we go 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.659
 to give it here we're going to give it here and we're going 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.890
 to put the camera and in Kuwait they are 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.680
 watching is also not what he's doing 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.409
 those boxes and next to you will see what is going 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.000
 making a triad truck that were the 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.520
 that commonly appeared to great effect 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.920
 3 big auto libri city stories that was 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.600
 of playstation 2 and psp and big cars 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.790
 chinatown wars ok that game 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.210
 they developed in the city of grand 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:29.090
 photo libri city which had a 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.070
 evolution when it came out big fauto 4 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.930
 gay but in point 4 they disappeared 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.110
 the triads because I do not remember but 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.390
 I think they existed but they did not have everything 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.369
 this they had as it was in the others 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.619
 three mentioned that was the big photo 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.600
 three libri city stories and chinatown wars 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.240
 that as you know the chainarong guard will be 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.220
 roughly written for the for the 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.570
 part of chinatown and what was in the 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.880
 Syrian ivry there is here as they see it 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.619
 they will be seeing images next to what 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.600
 see being the triads and the band 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.340
 criminal that this was ok was like a 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.960
 kind of mafia but they came with fish 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.420
 then they had their trucks there and 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.340
 I remember where they were more or 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.860
 less the exit to the second city of 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.479
 great free car and city stories by 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.580
 under the bridge he was there as his 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.260
 winery that in a mission had to 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.060
 enter and you have to kill them and destroy 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.860
 the trucks something like that was and then you had 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.360
 that destroy their trucks and they were several 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.709
 things the truth that it was a very game 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.590
 well I recommend them if they have 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.970
 portable playstation pcpe i les them 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.920
 I recommend to the free and it would be history if 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.049
 the vice the stories that are the best 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.530
 psp games ok then once said 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.240
 this 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.520
 I'm going to show you the location to 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.740
 that can come here I leave here 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.180
 again so that they are simply going to 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.770
 take a turn and now I'm going to 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.240
 prove that this is not so great 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.970
 fortune and then let's give it here 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.200
 gta online and they will see that this is not 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.510
 find then it 's something pretty 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.340
 curious that I do not know why they disappear what 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.770
 that is becoming 100 by invitation and 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.930
 let's go to session by invitation and go 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.180
 to see that this is not there I do not know why 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.860
 disappear and they notice the arrangement that 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.770
 is next that is like a tea 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.209
 we miss or rest peace is it 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.190
 maintains but what everyone is doing 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.750
 the servants disappears right that 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.120
 there are also quite a few things here 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.830
 you miss along with everything that's there 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.390
 how well is it like a triad base 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.070
 as abandoned because there's enough 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.019
 trash and crash what I 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.090
 remember they were as very sorted by 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.830
 say it like that and as you see here I am in what 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.720
 that is making big auto online and 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.870
 I have my character in this location ok 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.400
 to see that there is no such interest 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.620
 that what I do online look 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.180
 here is what I was saying with pink love 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.790
 rest in peace and then it's just ok 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.170
 they also come here as I say here 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.220
 is where they're supposed to appear 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.780
 the boxes but 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.180
 it would seem that we found several things 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.270
 a little weirder than they come 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.440
 showing how they see it there is here what 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.150
 that was doing the character of grand 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.520
 theft auto 4 of the lost and damned to me 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.400
 it seems I think you decide and look here not 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.530
 more things do not come out refreshments 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.140
 They leave bags do not leave several things ok 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.910
 and as they see it, a lot of garbage comes out and it was 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.670
 something weird not here makes me think that 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.140
 maybe it was here where the triads as 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.210
 they had what their business was doing 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.950
 because there you see the boxes but look 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.610
 curiously like there is not one without 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.660
 will maybe it 's a hold of 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.730
 drug traffickers or moseng that they have 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.260
 some narcotic or have anything 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.790
 and peron like they have it hidden 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.110
 then you tell me in the 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.850
 comments what do you think of this interest 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.080
