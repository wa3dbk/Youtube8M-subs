00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.169 
on Android I mean you may remember I use

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.929 
on Android I mean you may remember I use
that<00:00:29.349> game<00:00:29.560> as<00:00:29.829> a<00:00:29.890> benchmark<00:00:30.310> for<00:00:30.669> just<00:00:30.819> about

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
that game as a benchmark for just about

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.000 
that game as a benchmark for just about
every<00:00:31.419> single<00:00:31.449> new<00:00:31.899> Android<00:00:32.290> device<00:00:32.529> I<00:00:32.710> got

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
every single new Android device I got

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.800 
every single new Android device I got
and<00:00:33.280> this<00:00:33.670> is<00:00:33.880> probably<00:00:34.060> going<00:00:34.330> to<00:00:34.450> be<00:00:34.540> the<00:00:34.660> new

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810 
and this is probably going to be the new

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.540 
and this is probably going to be the new
benchmark<00:00:35.020> because<00:00:35.440> I<00:00:35.620> have<00:00:35.740> to<00:00:35.860> say<00:00:35.980> it'll

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:43.830 
have to think about where you're going
to<00:01:42.159> throw<00:01:42.189> it<00:01:42.549> and<00:01:42.850> figure<00:01:43.359> out<00:01:43.389> how<00:01:43.689> you're

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
to throw it and figure out how you're

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.510 
to throw it and figure out how you're
actually<00:01:43.990> gonna<00:01:44.259> get<00:01:44.499> to<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.829> pigs<00:01:45.130> before

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
actually gonna get to the pigs before

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.219 
actually gonna get to the pigs before
you<00:01:45.639> actually<00:01:45.789> throw<00:01:46.149> it<00:01:46.329> so<00:01:46.869> why<00:01:46.959> don't<00:01:47.170> you

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
you actually throw it so why don't you

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.469 
you actually throw it so why don't you
say<00:01:47.409> it<00:01:47.439> kind<00:01:47.920> of<00:01:47.979> works<00:01:48.249> here<00:01:48.549> however<00:01:49.299> I

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
say it kind of works here however I

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.419 
say it kind of works here however I
would<00:01:49.779> say<00:01:49.990> it's<00:01:50.139> quite<00:01:50.350> easy<00:01:50.560> so<00:01:50.770> even<00:01:51.219> if<00:01:51.310> you

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
would say it's quite easy so even if you

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:52.769 
would say it's quite easy so even if you
sort<00:01:51.670> of<00:01:51.700> mess<00:01:51.880> up<00:01:52.060> a<00:01:52.149> couple<00:01:52.329> of<00:01:52.450> shots<00:01:52.659> you

00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:52.779 
sort of mess up a couple of shots you

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.719 
sort of mess up a couple of shots you
can<00:01:53.049> still<00:01:53.319> get<00:01:53.499> perfect<00:01:53.950> score<00:01:54.249> and<00:01:54.429> I<00:01:54.579> wish

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
can still get perfect score and I wish

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.999 
can still get perfect score and I wish
they'd<00:01:54.909> turn<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.270> up<00:01:55.329> a<00:01:55.479> bit<00:01:55.659> so<00:01:56.499> the<00:01:56.590> next<00:01:56.770> one

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
they'd turn it up a bit so the next one

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.639 
they'd turn it up a bit so the next one
is<00:01:57.039> Red<00:01:57.459> Bull<00:01:57.729> Air<00:01:58.029> Race<00:01:58.359> and<00:01:58.810> this<00:01:59.079> is<00:01:59.229> a<00:01:59.259> sort

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
is Red Bull Air Race and this is a sort

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.249

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.460 
honestly I'm not a massive fan of but it
does<00:02:48.950> sort<00:02:49.220> of<00:02:49.310> look<00:02:49.639> okay<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.810> sounds<00:02:51.230> kind

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
does sort of look okay the sounds kind

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.720 
does sort of look okay the sounds kind
of<00:02:51.530> sound<00:02:51.769> a<00:02:51.859> little<00:02:51.980> bit<00:02:52.190> grainy<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:52.670> a

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.580 
of sound a little bit grainy and a
little<00:02:52.909> bit<00:02:53.030> muffled<00:02:53.209> but<00:02:53.720> you<00:02:54.260> know<00:02:54.409> that

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
little bit muffled but you know that

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.440 
little bit muffled but you know that
they'll<00:02:54.769> suffice<00:02:55.159> I<00:02:55.519> guess<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:55.909> all<00:02:56.030> adds<00:02:56.239> to
