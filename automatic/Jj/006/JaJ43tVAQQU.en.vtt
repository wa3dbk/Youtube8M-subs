00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
members of course the graphics on the

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.300 
members of course the graphics on the
ps2<00:05:29.450> are<00:05:29.810> nice<00:05:30.080> but<00:05:30.320> the<00:05:30.440> ps3<00:05:30.830> version<00:05:30.860> is<00:05:31.280> a

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
ps2 are nice but the ps3 version is a

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.280 
ps2 are nice but the ps3 version is a
lot<00:05:31.580> better<00:05:31.790> ever<00:05:32.210> since<00:05:32.330> it's<00:05:32.720> an<00:05:32.810> HD<00:05:33.169> of

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
lot better ever since it's an HD of

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.920 
lot better ever since it's an HD of
course<00:05:33.730> alright<00:05:34.730> so<00:05:34.970> this<00:05:35.120> review<00:05:35.419> isn't<00:05:35.600> over

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
course alright so this review isn't over

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.409 
course alright so this review isn't over
until<00:05:35.960> i<00:05:36.230> get<00:05:36.380> my<00:05:36.440> final<00:05:36.830> verdict<00:05:37.220> so<00:05:37.850> the

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
until i get my final verdict so the

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.330 
until i get my final verdict so the
story<00:05:38.690> is<00:05:38.810> very<00:05:39.050> different<00:05:39.290> from<00:05:39.440> other<00:05:39.890> sly

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
story is very different from other sly

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.030 
story is very different from other sly
cooper<00:05:40.580> games<00:05:40.970> and<00:05:41.290> the<00:05:42.290> gameplay<00:05:42.710> still<00:05:42.950> the

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
cooper games and the gameplay still the

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.790 
cooper games and the gameplay still the
same<00:05:43.220> but<00:05:43.400> has<00:05:43.610> some<00:05:43.850> neat<00:05:44.480> little<00:05:44.840> mechanics

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
same but has some neat little mechanics

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.190 
same but has some neat little mechanics
that<00:05:45.860> they<00:05:46.070> ended<00:05:46.370> in<00:05:46.550> and<00:05:46.820> of<00:05:47.780> course<00:05:47.810> the

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
that they ended in and of course the

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.650 
that they ended in and of course the
graphics<00:05:48.530> are<00:05:48.650> been<00:05:48.800> on<00:05:48.950> a<00:05:48.980> ps3<00:05:49.630> overall<00:05:50.630> i

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
graphics are been on a ps3 overall i

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.420 
graphics are been on a ps3 overall i
think<00:05:50.810> this<00:05:51.140> is<00:05:51.320> another<00:05:51.650> great<00:05:51.770> sly<00:05:52.190> cooper

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
think this is another great sly cooper

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.310 
think this is another great sly cooper
game<00:05:52.760> but<00:05:52.970> in<00:05:53.060> my<00:05:53.210> opinion<00:05:53.300> the<00:05:53.750> second<00:05:54.110> one<00:05:54.200> is

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
game but in my opinion the second one is

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.960 
game but in my opinion the second one is
still<00:05:54.530> the<00:05:54.710> best<00:05:54.740> just<00:05:55.040> because<00:05:55.130> of<00:05:55.400> its<00:05:55.550> story

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
still the best just because of its story

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.720 
still the best just because of its story
so<00:05:56.810> the<00:05:57.200> guys<00:05:57.380> watching<00:05:57.800> another<00:05:58.190> review<00:05:58.580> made
