00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
I believe I think that is a lot on the

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.770 
I believe I think that is a lot on the
time<00:03:24.160> of<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.459> year<00:03:24.489> what<00:03:25.030> they<00:03:25.150> how<00:03:25.389> they<00:03:25.540> look

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
time of the year what they how they look

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.259 
time of the year what they how they look
like<00:03:25.930> how<00:03:26.620> they're<00:03:26.889> colored<00:03:27.340> up<00:03:27.519> and<00:03:27.910> also

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
like how they're colored up and also

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.690 
like how they're colored up and also
maybe<00:03:28.510> on<00:03:28.810> their<00:03:29.109> growing<00:03:29.470> conditions<00:03:30.190> you

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
maybe on their growing conditions you

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.050 
maybe on their growing conditions you
can<00:03:30.880> depend<00:03:31.209> on<00:03:31.389> norm<00:03:31.630> Olay<00:03:31.959> to<00:03:32.019> be<00:03:32.340> very<00:03:33.340> very

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
can depend on norm Olay to be very very

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.629 
can depend on norm Olay to be very very
striking<00:03:34.660> especially<00:03:35.349> late<00:03:35.590> summer<00:03:35.919> and<00:03:36.190> in

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:36.639 
striking especially late summer and in

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.159 
striking especially late summer and in
the<00:03:36.669> fall<00:03:36.819> where<00:03:37.299> you<00:03:37.329> can<00:03:37.480> get<00:03:37.540> some<00:03:37.690> very

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
the fall where you can get some very

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.620 
the fall where you can get some very
orange<00:03:38.859> coloring<00:03:39.400> on<00:03:39.730> that<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.269> they<00:03:40.480> get

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
orange coloring on that and they get

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.220 
orange coloring on that and they get
that<00:03:40.810> nice<00:03:41.079> pink<00:03:41.590> backside<00:03:42.519> or<00:03:43.049> underside<00:03:44.049> on

that nice pink backside or underside on

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.680 
that nice pink backside or underside on
that<00:03:44.470> so<00:03:44.709> take<00:03:45.190> a<00:03:45.220> look<00:03:45.430> for<00:03:45.609> the<00:03:45.730> lucra

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
that so take a look for the lucra

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.990 
that so take a look for the lucra
marmalade<00:03:47.410> of<00:03:47.620> course<00:03:48.310> I've<00:03:48.549> mentioned<00:03:48.940> this

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
marmalade of course I've mentioned this

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.680 
marmalade of course I've mentioned this
before

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
before

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.740 
before
this<00:03:50.500> is<00:03:50.680> obsidian<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:51.549> think<00:03:51.760> it's<00:03:51.910> one<00:03:52.150> of<00:03:52.329> the

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
this is obsidian I think it's one of the

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.729 
this is obsidian I think it's one of the
darkest<00:03:53.639> purpley<00:03:54.660> darkest<00:03:55.660> leaf<00:03:56.200> on<00:03:56.440> that

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
darkest purpley darkest leaf on that

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.460 
darkest purpley darkest leaf on that
also<00:03:57.340> has<00:03:57.489> a<00:03:57.519> bigger<00:03:58.060> leaf<00:03:58.419> on<00:03:58.629> there<00:03:58.870> so<00:03:59.109> it

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
also has a bigger leaf on there so it

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.770 
also has a bigger leaf on there so it
tends<00:03:59.889> to<00:04:00.010> kind<00:04:00.430> of<00:04:00.549> I<00:04:00.730> want<00:04:01.090> to<00:04:01.120> say<00:04:01.180> stretch<00:04:01.750> a

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780
