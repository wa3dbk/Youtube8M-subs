00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.389
 a few days ago the state of são paulo 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.610
 decided that it could not be more 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.160
 teacher thus making me one of the 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.230
 employees in this world and like 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.510
 negative event I went through the phase 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:24.640
 pressure and mussum and aids 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.640
 and by the phase of revolt 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.150
 but just as the drm and so many others 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.520
 anti-piracy system none of this 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.840
 then he decided why I did not 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.970
 I thought about this before 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.360
 to teach geography through the internet through 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.309
 of youtube joining games and teaching 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.320
 finally, in a deeper analysis of the 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.540
 people see that it will not change much 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.400
 I will continue to have little attention only 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.140
 that instead of being face- to- face will be 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.390
 through the boy number 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.580
 views on the channel much less 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.170
 and I will continue to receive a 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.310
 misery with the payment only that maybe 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:15.130
 either by the state will be by youtube 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.930
 but then you wonder why the hell 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.020
 He wants to ruin my fun with 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.869
 games putting school in the middle 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.390
 The answer is quite simple. There are people who 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.640
 think you can train and learn and 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.800
 tactic of war and attack on school with 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.560
 game why not learn something 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.880
 want you to learn and since you 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.710
 will have to learn or at least 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.910
 pretend to be learning 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.640
 why not do this with something you 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.500
 like at least certainly much better 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.750
 than sitting 50 minutes in your 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.080
 room looking at the ceiling and pretending 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.560
 paying attention and that is why 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.810
 begins the series geography with games and 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.270
 this first false video of the formation of 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.670
 earth because geography is like call of 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.440
 duty modern warfare o mass effect 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.670
 It's no good if you start at the end because 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.920
 You're not going to understand what happened. 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.560
 in the first chapters 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.989
 You have to start from the beginning. 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.880
 in our case then with the earth 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:11.230
 she's not exactly as we know 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.849
 today 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.890
 initially the land does not have the 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.650
 divided continents 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.959
 it's all a single continent 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.920
 and this continent is called Bambam 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.780
 filled or paid if you look 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.819
 attention will realize that in fact the 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.400
 continents lecture in ways that 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.290
 fit each other as if the world 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.050
 was a great coach and judged by the 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.810
 cloud with the pieces scattered around 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.510
 was observed as the format of the 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.670
 continents seemed to fit that playing 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.430
 cartographers began to outline the 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.530
 what we call drift theory today 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.390
 continental 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.730
 this theory says that the continents are 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.769
 drifting adrift 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.780
 the ocean to wash and put the 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.459
 supermaiô platforms floating on 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.370
 to wash 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.830
 each future board on one side following the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.750
 movement of the lava until we have 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:09.780
 we have nowadays with each 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:12.549
 contingent there in its due locality 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.160
 to this floating piece of land 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.140
 on the lava is given the name of plates 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.480
 tectonic 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.000
 each future plate a direction following 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.190
 a lava movement just below 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.900
 What happens to a but not board 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.319
 when a low tectonic plate in the 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.129
 other one can earthquakes training 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.410
 of mountains and volcanic options and 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.540
 under the tsunami ocean like those 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.849
 which has hit Asia and even affect 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.519
 You here in Brazil making the 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.120
 hds prices rise 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:51.700
 considerably since the large 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:54.060
 Most are produced in Asia where the nurse 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.329
 a low plate from the other is called a 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.940
 convergent boundary with the kan plates 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:03.010
 same local place at the same time what 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.980
 happens is a board can end up coming up 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.349
 on top of the other forming in judgments 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.400
 of the relief, thus beginning the formation of 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.430
 mountains 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.650
 in the case of the Andes mountain range where 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.840
 meeting of two tectonic plates comes 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.180
 provoking over hundreds of thousands of 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.280
 thousands of years a board trial 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.440
 tectonics forming the mountains of 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.810
 mountain range 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.550
 so we can risk saying that 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.740
 for example is situated in an area 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.180
 convergence of tectonic plates already 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.349
 that we have a mountain range that 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.639
 cut a game map 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:39.729
 another possibility is that a plaque 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:43.120
 tectonics moves parallel to the other 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.770
 how they were rubbing those 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.650
 areas are called boundaries. 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.960
 transforming one of the limits 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.630
 turning the most famous ones into 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.419
 United States and is known as failure 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.250
 de san andrés and no no I'm not 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.710
 talking about no gta bug 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.240
 but I felt a huge fault in the relief in the 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.789
 united states where the pacific plate 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.440
 moves north and the plate 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:08.020
 North American dead 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.210
 with each one falling on one side and 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.940
 playing this way the result can only 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.210
 be a scar in relief and 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.650
 possible earthquakes in this region and 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.750
 That's why in Brazil we do not have 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.220
 major earthquake or 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.320
 active volcanoes 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.080
 the country lies in the middle of the plate 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:30.310
 tectonics away from the edges 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.900
 the country is free of these activities but 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.670
 as well as in areas where imm 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.560
 contains areas where the plates 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.460
 apart from each other 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.740
 in these places we call boundaries 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.660
 divergent boundaries within the 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.880
 The plates move away leaving a 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.710
 where you can 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.400
 occur a volcanic activity called 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.680
 basaltic spill this spill 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.780
 basaltic is not that cool thing that 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.120
 is seen when we talk about volcanoes with lava 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:01.360
 and stones flying everywhere is something 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.830
 simpler less imposing with lava 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.450
 being simply shed by the 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.630
 open fissure 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:10.270
 one of the most famous divergent boundaries 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.560
 between africa and brazil in the middle of 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.740
 Atlantic Ocean 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.980
 is the same Atlantic call or 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.230
 still dorsal even oceanic 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.690
 it consists of a range of mountains 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.640
 submersed by cooling 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.669
 of the lava being shipped by the 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.419
 slit open through the plates 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:30.730
 esteem that we are moving away 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:33.010
 of Africa about two centimeters 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:36.340
 due to this divergence between the 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:39.130
 tectonic plates in a few hundred 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.260
 thousands of years we can assume that 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.750
 should arise a new continent between 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.210
 South America and Africa due to 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.970
 exactly this basaltic effusion of 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.410
 dorsal even Atlantic 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:54.100
 so let's recap what we people 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:57.669
 saw in this video the land before for having only 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:59.770
 a continent called panchayat the 

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:01.750
 theory of continental drift states that 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.570
 this continent the only one divided 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:07.390
 forming the continents we have today 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:09.520
 continental drift theory 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:12.240
 states that this division was only possible 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.650
 because there are tectonic plates 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:18.560
 Giant earth masses floating over 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:20.990
 he washes the tectonic plates in turn 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.330
 can collide with one another the limit 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.560
 convergence by creating large 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.320
 mountains 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.690
 they can also rub one in the 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.750
 other the transforming limit creating 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:35.330
 faults in the relief or stop can 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:37.880
 diverge from each other the divergent limit 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:41.240
 cracking and spilling 

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.919
 basaltic and so we go 

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.900
 closing the first videos of the 

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:47.540
 geography series with games 

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.550
 Do not forget to study five hours. 

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:53.169
 by day it's a pain in the bag wait until 

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:53.169
 works eight hours every day
