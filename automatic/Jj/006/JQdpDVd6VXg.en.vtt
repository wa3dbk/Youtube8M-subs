00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 So there we are again new with 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.120
 justin john hughes book philipp lame 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.599
 lust and ozan kahn is also new 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.860
 Round new luck easily you like 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:21.350
 here we have the as in single 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:23.609
 with jud age at a capped kevin 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.769
 so if mine can be clear myself 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.769
 You may have seen my opponents 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.460
 age that can give you some leaves 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.260
 stand there why pension was in quite that 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.540
 even kevin is 99 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.620
 so he is with us why are you running then 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.559
 stay with that one again 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:57.100
 counting can thus recognize again 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:57.100
 is not bad kevin that's great 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.650
 oh that can not even say well 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.440
 let's change the best 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:25.120
 the water in the chat I wrote to 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.380
 let's talk about the weapons best 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.450
 is or in my opinion is 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.640
 parabolic microphone compels because very many 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.170
 people play with silencers and we 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.180
 have an advantage if the stop 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.160
 Shoot because you do not recognize it when 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.980
 put your ears on a bit 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.570
 splashes and listen carefully you drive two 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:51.280
 times but shoot you see him exactly 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:54.300
 not that such a small problem 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.520
 I also find it important 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.020
 normally but like 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.440
 said because of the parabolic microphones 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.310
 can do that even today kink 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.750
 silencer it does not stop now 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.400
 guarantee that you do not hear or 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.649
 not on the map looks like it used to be 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.649
 in any case, a guarantee but now 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.680
 now it is not so protective what 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.260
 I think that is good as 1 1 for the 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.170
 melee but from far who is to 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.400
 good red dot does not have to be 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.409
 always his first weapons 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.299
 You can dress better without a red dot 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:41.310
 With red dot strangely enough 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.720
 quick access is always said 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.079
 that you can recommend it 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.370
 well with fast access I have now 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.730
 Hardly experienced and rightly so 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.340
 his 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:03:00.840
 I'll take care of myself 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.079
 go completely unbelievable 611 years 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.010
 as I said 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.959
 At the moment you can not count on me 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.090
 that something breaks something 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.840
 Great skills should always be done 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:16.040
 be inside 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:18.389
 If I have a chance if all to us 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.510
 Well, what I find more important than 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:26.599
 leper is so recently that the 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.599
 map firstly knows and secondly that one 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.110
 pay attention to the map 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.239
 this is more important than a weapon 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.980
 which brings no good weapon or 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.840
 There is no good weapon for it at all 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.590
 depends on the person even if you are 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.760
 Feels good when shooting with a weapon 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.010
 then she was good for you though 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.750
 there are also weapons that are for the 1 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:53.030
 his building the weapon scan and dialog 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:55.010
 if this was really shit was his 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.049
 can make the last movie or 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.819
 has made to the last cabbage and 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.879
 beats with joy in the air that 's it 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.160
 with another round 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:07.360
 see you next time out on 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.360
 Of course, twitter will continue
