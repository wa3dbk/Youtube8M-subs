00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:04.689 
alright so this is my rocket stove here

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:07.889 
alright so this is my rocket stove here
going<00:00:05.970> finally<00:00:06.970> got<00:00:07.120> it<00:00:07.240> to<00:00:07.359> somewhat<00:00:07.749> work

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:07.899 
going finally got it to somewhat work

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.220 
going finally got it to somewhat work
it's<00:00:08.140> still<00:00:08.320> blowing<00:00:08.500> back<00:00:08.770> a<00:00:08.800> little<00:00:08.980> bit<00:00:09.160> but

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
it's still blowing back a little bit but

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.420 
it's still blowing back a little bit but
it's<00:00:11.230> outside<00:00:11.590> the<00:00:11.650> greenhouse<00:00:12.100> oh<00:00:12.250> that's

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.430 
it's outside the greenhouse oh that's

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:21.540 
it's outside the greenhouse oh that's
okay<00:00:16.950> doesn't<00:00:17.950> show<00:00:18.130> up<00:00:18.160> very<00:00:18.460> well<00:00:20.430> but<00:00:21.430> it's

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
okay doesn't show up very well but it's

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.060 
okay doesn't show up very well but it's
actually<00:00:21.670> got<00:00:22.060> a<00:00:22.090> sideways<00:00:22.510> burn<00:00:23.050> and<00:00:23.410> it

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
actually got a sideways burn and it

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.460 
actually got a sideways burn and it
pulls<00:00:24.400> it<00:00:24.610> in<00:00:24.730> there<00:00:27.690> so<00:00:28.690> no<00:00:28.900> flame<00:00:29.260> should

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
pulls it in there so no flame should

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.249 
pulls it in there so no flame should
actually<00:00:29.680> come<00:00:29.860> back<00:00:30.430> out<00:00:30.699> here<00:00:30.730> or<00:00:31.150> smoke<00:00:31.750> all

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
actually come back out here or smoke all

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:55.180 
actually come back out here or smoke all
the<00:00:32.619> current<00:00:32.920> go<00:00:33.280> through<00:00:33.730> the<00:00:33.999> actual<00:00:34.629> to

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.660 

this<00:00:55.850> is<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.149> barrel<00:00:57.160> the<00:00:58.160> tube<00:01:00.100> comes<00:01:01.100> out<00:01:01.399> it

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
this is the barrel the tube comes out it

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.020 
this is the barrel the tube comes out it
comes<00:01:01.910> over<00:01:02.300> and<00:01:02.480> up<00:01:02.839> in<00:01:03.019> here<00:01:03.350> like<00:01:03.500> a.j<00:01:04.430> shape

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
comes over and up in here like a.j shape

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.270 
comes over and up in here like a.j shape
and<00:01:05.299> then<00:01:06.049> this<00:01:06.229> is<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.470> barrel<00:01:06.830> that's<00:01:06.950> over

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
and then this is the barrel that's over

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.590 
and then this is the barrel that's over
top<00:01:07.549> of<00:01:07.580> it<00:01:08.680> what<00:01:09.680> happens<00:01:10.070> is<00:01:10.220> the<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:11.299> draw

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
top of it what happens is the the draw

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.249 
top of it what happens is the the draw
starts<00:01:12.080> over<00:01:12.290> there<00:01:12.500> comes<00:01:13.460> up<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.110> then<00:01:15.110> it

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
starts over there comes up and then it

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.170 
starts over there comes up and then it
comes<00:01:15.470> down<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.950> I<00:01:19.130> have<00:01:19.340> right<00:01:19.520> here<00:01:19.549> is<00:01:19.790> just

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
comes down and I have right here is just

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.889 
comes down and I have right here is just
a<00:01:20.390> this<00:01:20.830> is<00:01:21.830> just<00:01:22.100> cob<00:01:22.369> and<00:01:22.700> then<00:01:23.630> it<00:01:23.750> actually

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
a this is just cob and then it actually

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:25.990 
a this is just cob and then it actually
just<00:01:24.229> kind<00:01:24.470> of<00:01:24.530> settles<00:01:24.860> in<00:01:25.009> here<00:01:25.369> and<00:01:25.580> get

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
just kind of settles in here and get

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.270 
just kind of settles in here and get
sucked<00:01:26.420> out<00:01:26.659> through<00:01:26.990> a<00:01:27.289> pipe<00:01:27.530> and<00:01:27.710> then<00:01:28.039> goes

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
sucked out through a pipe and then goes

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.890 
sucked out through a pipe and then goes
out<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.640> greenhouse

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.080 

what<00:01:34.530> I'm<00:01:34.650> testing<00:01:35.130> right<00:01:35.280> now<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.760> I<00:01:35.880> want<00:01:35.910> to

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
what I'm testing right now is I want to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.780 
what I'm testing right now is I want to
take<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.420> black<00:01:36.750> tube<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.440> want<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.340> wrap<00:01:38.550> it

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
take this black tube I want to wrap it

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.830 
take this black tube I want to wrap it
around<00:01:38.910> here<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.660> it<00:01:39.720> will<00:01:39.810> heat<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.050> water

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
around here so it will heat the water

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.510 
around here so it will heat the water
what<00:01:42.840> I'm<00:01:42.960> noticing<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.770> thing<00:01:44.010> so<00:01:44.220> far

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
what I'm noticing with this thing so far

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.600 
what I'm noticing with this thing so far
is<00:01:44.730> that<00:01:44.810> just<00:01:45.810> with<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:47.070> high<00:01:47.250> tunnel

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
is that just with this this high tunnel

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.990 
is that just with this this high tunnel
that<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.760> have<00:01:48.710> there's<00:01:49.710> no<00:01:49.980> way<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.400> loses<00:01:50.730> heat

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
that I have there's no way it loses heat

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.270 
that I have there's no way it loses heat
way<00:01:51.330> too<00:01:51.390> fast<00:01:51.780> at<00:01:52.050> night<00:01:52.260> so<00:01:52.590> I'm<00:01:53.010> not<00:01:53.130> going

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
way too fast at night so I'm not going

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.620 
way too fast at night so I'm not going
to<00:01:53.340> be<00:01:53.460> able<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.700> actually<00:01:53.850> keep<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
to be able to actually keep the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.930 
to be able to actually keep the
greenhouse<00:01:55.080> but<00:01:55.410> that's<00:01:55.590> not<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.980> main<00:01:56.160> main

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
greenhouse but that's not the main main

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.790 
greenhouse but that's not the main main
reason<00:01:57.240> for<00:01:57.270> heating<00:01:57.720> I<00:01:57.810> need<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.380> need<00:01:58.680> the

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
reason for heating I need the I need the

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.940 
reason for heating I need the I need the
water<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.280> be<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> lot<00:02:00.330> warmer<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:00.900> what<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.800> want

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
water to be a lot warmer so what I want

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.890 
water to be a lot warmer so what I want
to<00:02:01.980> do<00:02:02.160> is<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.370> want<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.580> take<00:02:02.760> this<00:02:02.790> just<00:02:03.420> piping

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
to do is I want to take this just piping

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.380 
to do is I want to take this just piping
and<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.170> wrap<00:02:04.410> it<00:02:04.440> around<00:02:04.680> here<00:02:05.119> run<00:02:06.119> water

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
and just wrap it around here run water

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.419 
and just wrap it around here run water
through<00:02:06.510> it<00:02:06.720> and<00:02:06.869> heat<00:02:07.050> the<00:02:07.170> water<00:02:07.200> as<00:02:08.070> long<00:02:08.250> as

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
through it and heat the water as long as

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.300 
through it and heat the water as long as
the<00:02:08.580> water<00:02:08.820> is<00:02:09.810> nice<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.229> warm<00:02:10.530> but<00:02:10.890> tilapia

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
the water is nice and warm but tilapia

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.890 
the water is nice and warm but tilapia
will<00:02:11.400> be<00:02:11.459> nice<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.850> nice<00:02:12.240> and<00:02:12.450> warm<00:02:12.660> and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
will be nice and nice and warm and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.199 
will be nice and nice and warm and
that's<00:02:13.290> all<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:13.500> matters<00:02:16.820> and<00:02:17.820> then<00:02:17.910> up<00:02:18.060> in

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
that's all that matters and then up in

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.070 
that's all that matters and then up in
here<00:02:20.060> just<00:02:21.060> going<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.270> try<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.510> see<00:02:21.780> if<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:21.930> can

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
here just going to try and see if I can

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.199 
here just going to try and see if I can
boil<00:02:22.290> some<00:02:22.500> water<00:02:22.610> seeing<00:02:23.610> other<00:02:23.790> people<00:02:24.090> do

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
boil some water seeing other people do

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.120 
boil some water seeing other people do
it<00:02:24.240> figure<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:25.020> might<00:02:25.800> as<00:02:25.860> well<00:02:26.010> be

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
it figure it I might as well be

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.780 
it figure it I might as well be
something<00:02:26.520> with<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.790> but<00:02:27.540> this<00:02:28.080> is

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
something with this but this is

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.340 
something with this but this is
extremely<00:02:29.790> hot<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.690> could<00:02:30.840> definitely<00:02:30.959> cook

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
extremely hot you could definitely cook

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.850 
extremely hot you could definitely cook
on<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:32.130> this<00:02:32.820> right<00:02:33.090> here<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:34.620> lot

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
on that and this right here is a lot

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.850 
on that and this right here is a lot
hotter<00:02:36.350> so<00:02:37.350> I'm<00:02:38.250> testing<00:02:38.459> right<00:02:38.700> now<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:39.860> how

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
hotter so I'm testing right now is how

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.770 
hotter so I'm testing right now is how
fast<00:02:41.130> this<00:02:41.280> will<00:02:41.459> melt<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:41.820> but<00:02:42.150> I'm

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
fast this will melt this but I'm

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.040 
fast this will melt this but I'm
figuring<00:02:42.959> it's<00:02:43.290> my<00:02:43.440> run<00:02:43.920> cold<00:02:44.519> water<00:02:45.050> through

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
figuring it's my run cold water through

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:55.420 
figuring it's my run cold water through
this<00:02:46.290> pipe<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.769> should<00:02:46.800> be<00:02:47.010> just<00:02:47.040> fine

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.400 

that'll<00:02:56.430> be<00:02:56.490> tomorrow<00:02:56.900> see<00:02:57.900> how<00:02:58.050> this<00:02:58.200> thing

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
that'll be tomorrow see how this thing

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.040 
that'll be tomorrow see how this thing
all<00:02:58.590> works<00:02:58.830> out
