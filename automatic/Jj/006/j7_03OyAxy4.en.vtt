00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
a primary weapon and that's a challenge

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.620 
a primary weapon and that's a challenge
because<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.609> brings<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.820> lot<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:23.939> desks<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.449> it

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
an area dies it's trouble so but let's

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.110 
an area dies it's trouble so but let's
try<00:00:31.439> leveraging<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.130> power<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.790> social

network as they'd say at work and and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.490 
network as they'd say at work and and
make<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> difference<00:00:36.480> here<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.840> Robert<00:00:37.170> bowling
