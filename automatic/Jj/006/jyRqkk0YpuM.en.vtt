slightly better it's just two point
three<00:02:31.520> gigahertz<00:02:32.520> which<00:02:32.910> don't<00:02:33.240> only<00:02:33.390> make<00:02:33.660> a

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
three gigahertz which don't only make a

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.710 
three gigahertz which don't only make a
big<00:02:33.990> difference<00:02:34.170> but<00:02:34.530> anyway<00:02:37.490> yeah<00:02:38.490> so<00:02:38.760> and
