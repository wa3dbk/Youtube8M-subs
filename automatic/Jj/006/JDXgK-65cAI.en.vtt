00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
anyway I have the first one that I had

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.150 
anyway I have the first one that I had
given<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:19.060> me<00:02:19.210> was<00:02:19.900> this<00:02:20.140> little<00:02:20.350> automatic

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
given to me was this little automatic

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.510 
given to me was this little automatic
knife<00:02:22.060> which<00:02:22.480> I<00:02:22.660> really<00:02:23.170> think<00:02:23.440> is<00:02:23.620> cool<00:02:24.420> but

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
knife which I really think is cool but

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.600 
knife which I really think is cool but
it<00:02:27.520> doesn't<00:02:27.850> have<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:28.000> lock<00:02:28.240> on<00:02:28.270> it

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
it doesn't have a lock on it

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.130 
it doesn't have a lock on it
therefore<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:31.270> can't<00:02:31.540> carry<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:31.990> in<00:02:32.080> your

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
therefore you can't carry it in your

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.580 
therefore you can't carry it in your
