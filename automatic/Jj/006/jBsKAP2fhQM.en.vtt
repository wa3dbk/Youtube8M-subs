00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.900
 It was called the Sun Well. 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.640
 A Sacred Source of Unspeakable Power. 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.650
 It fed every part of our soul. 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.970
 With the spring of the spring we flourished. 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.610
 Before the shadow of death came upon us. 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.900
 Only after the Sun Well was destroyed, 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.320
 we realized 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.120
 how much we depend on her magic. 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.690
 How much we needed to feed her. 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.420
 When we awoke, I named our people Sin'dorei. 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.170
 Bloody elves. 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.160
 My people demanded a response from me. 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.280
 I promised them a cure. 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.450
 It's strange, 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.720
 but we found deliverance with the demon Illidan. 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.200
 Illidan offered us new sources of raw magic. 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.820
 So I joined him in Outland with a promise, 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.760
 that I will return once and lead our people for lost glory. 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.590
 But Illidan only had plans for himself. 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.280
 I was secretly impatient 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.920
 he began to collect as much energy as possible. 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.860
 For a moment I felt what the power was! 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.410
 Before she was removed from me again. 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.850
 But not everything is lost. 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.190
 The core of the Sun Wells Thanks to Those 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.860
 who sought him to protect him. 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.020
 Now I came back with some knowledge 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.520
 and before we can claim it, 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.630
 we have to sacrifice something that belongs to us. 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.600
 I have created a new alliance. 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.340
 Soon the Sun Well will shine as before 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.530
 to bring this world to this world 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.860
 who will save us all. 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:13.430
