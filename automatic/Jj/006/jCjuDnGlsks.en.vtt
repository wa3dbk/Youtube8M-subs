00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
mutilated but that's the greater

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.410 
mutilated but that's the greater
momentum<00:00:20.750> momentum<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:23.460> lesser<00:00:23.820> omentum<00:00:23.850> is

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
momentum momentum the lesser omentum is

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.630 
momentum momentum the lesser omentum is
this<00:00:24.600> well<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.410> less<00:00:25.769> f<00:00:26.010> right<00:00:26.400> there

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
this well that and less f right there

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:38.819 
this well that and less f right there
okay<00:00:28.010> and<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:31.050> esophagus<00:00:31.800> is

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.970 

we<00:00:39.399> need<00:00:39.550> to<00:00:39.730> stay<00:00:39.969> right<00:00:40.120> there<00:00:40.920> okay<00:00:41.920> so

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
we need to stay right there okay so

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.599 
we need to stay right there okay so
often<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.989> so<00:00:44.050> this<00:00:44.800> thing<00:00:45.609> is<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:45.909> stomach

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
often and so this thing is the stomach

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.789 
often and so this thing is the stomach
this<00:00:48.609> is<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:48.879> cardiac<00:00:49.359> region<00:00:49.809> okay<00:00:50.350> then

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:50.799 
this is the cardiac region okay then

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:58.469 
this is the cardiac region okay then
body<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:53.440> this<00:00:54.280> would<00:00:54.609> be<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:56.369> pylorus<00:00:57.479> okay

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479 
body and this would be the pylorus okay

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:03.630 
body and this would be the pylorus okay
and<00:00:59.760> then<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:01.719> pylorus<00:01:02.229> speaker<00:01:02.619> is<00:01:02.949> is<00:01:03.369> right

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
and then the pylorus speaker is is right

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.060 
and then the pylorus speaker is is right
in<00:01:03.820> here<00:01:06.179> that's<00:01:07.179> the<00:01:07.420> duodenum<00:01:07.899> okay<00:01:08.770> you

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
in here that's the duodenum okay you

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.960 
in here that's the duodenum okay you
want<00:01:09.310> them<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:12.520> goes<00:01:12.729> into<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.179> genome<00:01:14.789> 10m<00:01:15.789> to

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
want them it goes into the genome 10m to

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.779 
want them it goes into the genome 10m to
genoa<00:01:16.270> genom<00:01:18.780> switches<00:01:19.780> into<00:01:20.049> the<00:01:20.459> ileum<00:01:21.459> yeah

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
genoa genom switches into the ileum yeah

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.809 
genoa genom switches into the ileum yeah
hey<00:01:22.060> Lance<00:01:22.209> a<00:01:22.479> Liam<00:01:23.039> so<00:01:24.039> just<00:01:24.369> goes<00:01:24.549> to<00:01:24.729> the

00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:24.819 
hey Lance a Liam so just goes to the

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:31.410 
hey Lance a Liam so just goes to the
ileum<00:01:25.209> and<00:01:26.490> then<00:01:27.490> we<00:01:27.940> get<00:01:30.030> really<00:01:31.030> cold<00:01:31.209> metal

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
ileum and then we get really cold metal

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.359 
ileum and then we get really cold metal
belt<00:01:31.750> this<00:01:31.959> is<00:01:32.110> the<00:01:32.200> ileocecal<00:01:32.619> valve<00:01:32.830> right

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
belt this is the ileocecal valve right

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.370 
belt this is the ileocecal valve right
here<00:01:33.429> and<00:01:34.030> then<00:01:34.509> this<00:01:35.039> sacrum<00:01:37.140> secrecy<00:01:38.140> come

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
here and then this sacrum secrecy come

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.240 
here and then this sacrum secrecy come
chica<00:01:38.920> chica<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:42.369> would<00:01:42.520> be<00:01:44.009> hard<00:01:45.009> if

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
chica chica so that would be hard if

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.050 
chica chica so that would be hard if
Elodie<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:46.440> ascending

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
Elodie the ascending

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:59.160 
Elodie the ascending
the<00:01:50.250> transverse<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:52.600> descending<00:01:58.170> sigmoid

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
the transverse the descending sigmoid

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.740 
the transverse the descending sigmoid
yeah<00:01:59.560> he's<00:02:00.070> right<00:02:00.280> in<00:02:00.460> there<00:02:00.490> so<00:02:01.119> it<00:02:01.180> goes<00:02:01.360> into

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
yeah he's right in there so it goes into

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.839 
yeah he's right in there so it goes into
the<00:02:01.869> final<00:02:02.530> story<00:02:02.759> okay<00:02:04.409> liver<00:02:05.409> the<00:02:06.280> liver<00:02:06.429> the

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
the final story okay liver the liver the

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:15.750 
the final story okay liver the liver the
liver<00:02:09.849> is<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:12.269> right<00:02:13.769> lateral<00:02:14.769> flow<00:02:15.190> right

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
liver is the right lateral flow right

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
liver is the right lateral flow right

is the trachea well it would be it would
be<00:03:43.160> down<00:03:43.400> here<00:03:43.430> where<00:03:43.760> it<00:03:43.850> splits<00:03:44.239> and

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
be down here where it splits and

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.720 
be down here where it splits and
probably<00:03:45.260> one<00:03:46.100> right<00:03:46.310> there<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:47.840> that's<00:03:47.959> what

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
probably one right there and that's what

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.130 
probably one right there and that's what
okay<00:03:49.730> rocky<00:03:50.000> one<00:03:50.390> right<00:03:50.540> there<00:03:50.750> which<00:03:50.930> goes

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
okay rocky one right there which goes
