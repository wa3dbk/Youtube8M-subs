00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.330
 the intelligent networked home is 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.180
 of course a huge topic here on the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.320
 ifa 2014 in berlin big problem for many 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.119
 smart home solutions are not 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.529
 Compatible with other solutions and 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.629
 equipment but there is an exception 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.059
 digitalstrom heister and stands next to me 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.110
 the ceo of digitalstrom ag martin 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.610
 vespers hello mr vesper 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.080
 so now tell me that 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.550
 key mystery of her 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.500
 key is this fan pinch you up 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.510
 can turn six things on electricity 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.970
 dimming the current measure there is a calculator 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.800
 to save on data 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.449
 communicates with it via the power line 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.489
 i can get all the electrical appliances in 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.510
 network your house and make it smart 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.739
 that sounds a bit for now 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.970
 they have to be complicated 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.540
 little bit more to witness football 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.220
 everything to us 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.019
 We are here in the bedroom now 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.460
 I 'll just do the light 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.080
 that impresses me first little can 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.670
 I was in my bedroom and so what 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.110
 But she can not be there with one 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.909
 double-click for example a plugged 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.130
 light on with that we do 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.930
 here about the chip, that's why I am 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.670
 in a position further identify the locally 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.720
 But at the same time the light in the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.580
 make room 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.280
 I can also use the second button 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.140
 Here my curtain serve because just 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.450
 everything is networked that goes on then 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.950
 that it is synonymous for an audio system 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.900
 it is possible that i transfer my music over 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.830
 a button starts and if I then 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.740
 be visited 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.570
 then lights can blink or even 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.850
 the ringing sound from an audio system 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.590
 play all this networked but still 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.850
 we are now in our home what 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.650
 happens because if i use the whole system 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.060
 now the world opens then I have 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.320
 of course, more possibilities because 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.909
 simply more computing power to 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.440
 The hail , for example, is available 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.820
 warning this is a computational model 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.130
 needs a lot of computing power and 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.659
 if you then recognize a hail warning 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.250
 then the awning can be on this 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.020
 access information or also 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.020
 the blind and then start up 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:19.359
 half green and one red each 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.359
 Clean paprika pepper Wash small 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.470
 the faucet is very nice area 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.730
 the most interesting thing is there 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.750
 right now it's like now 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.380
 by ghost hand the faucet 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.510
 addressed 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.210
 Exactly we have networked everything here too 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.950
 including the water fittings and now 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.870
 is there an algorithm of the cook bot 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.390
 the recipes reads and then the instruction 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.890
 is what man should do and 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.090
 just instructions to the 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.710
 appropriate devices 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.910
 that means the software that that 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.830
 whole controls that does not come out 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.350
 your home no that is such a chef 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.250
 the development is not from us and such 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.650
 the customer also able 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.380
 various software to use its 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.460
 optimal its best around in this case 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.290
 for example, to cook fresh 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.000
 Ultimately, therefore, always the newest 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.890
 software without buying new hardware 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.780
 Exactly it always remains the same kitchen 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.640
 and whether he is cooking or something else 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.230
 it would not matter to him 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.730
 He can always choose the best 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.360
 That's the advantage of being open 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.710
 interfaces 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.710
 First one has yet continue times 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.400
 so first now I make time making 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.390
 You do not really like volunteering 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.830
 makes I go now time to 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.430
 following situation put me in the 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.080
 wheelchair 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.460
 I can also control it quite normally 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.990
 here and there with this joystick 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.350
 But what does he have with her house? 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.290
 do 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.910
 he is also networked in this 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.770
 house in and with smart 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.410
 algorithms are now in a position 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.840
 from the wheelchair in the house everything too 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.520
 control lighting blinds or just 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.450
 as here in the kitchen also water 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.330
 that works with this too 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.920
 joystick I'll try it out here 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.090
 and can now with me, for example 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.280
 out that can pour water 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.080
 exactly and it is just important that 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.640
 it is exactly a glass of water so now 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.410
 not on and off but must 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.330
 through the intelligence of the system exactly 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.920
 this amount just comes out so that it 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.810
 easy for these people too 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.810
 remains operable and is not pemper 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.770
 intelligent algorithms control so 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.120
 our entire house is fixed 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.500
 now see different examples 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.630
 they can help us, too 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.700
 at the installation or exactly by it 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.980
 that the digital system is itself 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.930
 first networked it is now about 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.940
 the configuration and there you can too 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.500
 intelligent algorithm already help 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.470
 The electrician really just has to 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:39.470
 Describe what he needs to install 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:41.990
 now to scanner terminal that is the 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.470
 Ceiling light in the bathroom she has 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.660
 a maximum of 40 watts and an e14 detection 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.820
 so he has now described exactly so 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.620
 In the bathroom, this light is what it is 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.180
 for the version, maximum output has that 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.510
 important for the chip to limit that 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.430
 can 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.530
 this information is now in our 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.450
 Beck stored and stands for 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.400
 A car configuration is available 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.840
 so happy if the electrician now all 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.820
 has installed as started 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.410
 then the car configuration the small one 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.840
 just do it over his smartphone 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.520
 By starting the process there it starts 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.800
 All information will be the terminal 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.570
 taken next to our installation 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.600
 guidelines ultimately the system 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.380
 knows and more information 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.940
 summarized and then on the 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.350
 appartement transfer so then 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.870
 everything as desired 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.370
 also configured at the moment and 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.260
 the resident of the apartment so that 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.140
 intelligent house can do it all 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.430
 quite comfortably via smartphone tablet 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.430
 you never have to control yourself 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.810
 fuse box go no 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.470
 configuration change 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.600
 Control options are always over 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.130
 means that are in software 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.960
 that's why you can do that yourself and 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.320
 does not need new electricians 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.700
 pick up 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.920
 and that works with all devices 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.570
 which in some form can be smartly networked 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.160
 or intelligent are wonderful thing 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.160
 thank you so much
