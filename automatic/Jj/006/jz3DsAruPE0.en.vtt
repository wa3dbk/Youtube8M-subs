00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
well this acts as anti-inflammatory it

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.570 
well this acts as anti-inflammatory it
can<00:01:20.729> help<00:01:20.939> protect<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> liver<00:01:25.580> increases

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
can help protect to the liver increases
