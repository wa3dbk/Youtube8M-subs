black and red and color this two of them
in<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:29.030> so<00:01:30.030> what<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.360> do<00:01:30.570> with<00:01:30.720> those

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
in you so what you do with those

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.550 
in you so what you do with those
connectors<00:01:32.689> is<00:01:35.630> get<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.750> black<00:01:37.049> connector

isn't pin number one this is a pin

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.300 
isn't pin number one this is a pin
number<00:01:45.570> two<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.350> then<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.560> got<00:01:46.740> four<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
number two and then you got four on the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.800 
number two and then you got four on the
bottom<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:47.909> there's<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.360> space<00:01:48.630> in

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
bottom this is there's a space in

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.020 
bottom this is there's a space in
between<00:01:48.840> make<00:01:49.799> sure<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.250> connect<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.820> into

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
between make sure you connect it into

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.160 
between make sure you connect it into
this<00:01:51.360> left<00:01:51.750> front<00:01:52.259> one<00:01:53.540> where<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.689> weather<00:01:55.049> is

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
this left front one where the weather is

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.160 
this left front one where the weather is
left<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.799> right<00:01:55.829> one<00:01:56.159> point<00:01:56.430> metaphor<00:01:57.170> so

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
left and a right one point metaphor so

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.230 
left and a right one point metaphor so
this<00:01:58.469> left<00:01:58.740> front<00:01:59.130> one

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
this left front one

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.990 
this left front one
is<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.320> diagnostic<00:02:03.229> pin<00:02:04.490> you<00:02:05.490> get<00:02:05.729> one<00:02:05.909> of

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
is the diagnostic pin you get one of

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.900 
is the diagnostic pin you get one of
those<00:02:06.180> red<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:07.190> actually<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.310> black<00:02:08.610> and

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
those red and actually it's black and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.010 
those red and actually it's black and
red<00:02:09.860> black<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.130> red<00:02:11.840> pins<00:02:13.790> wires<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:15.510> let<00:02:15.900> me

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
red black and red pins wires so let me

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.160 
red black and red pins wires so let me
then<00:02:16.200> i<00:02:16.230> zoom<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.769> in<00:02:17.720> set<00:02:18.720> this<00:02:18.840> thing<00:02:19.019> over

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
then i zoom it in set this thing over

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.500 
then i zoom it in set this thing over
here<00:02:20.209> okay<00:02:21.209> now<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:22.200> got<00:02:22.380> this<00:02:23.030> will<00:02:24.030> connect

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
here okay now you got this will connect

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.020 
here okay now you got this will connect
there's<00:02:25.260> two<00:02:25.440> wires<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:26.220> we<00:02:26.250> connect<00:02:26.700> one<00:02:27.000> of

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
there's two wires so we connect one of

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:41.210 
there's two wires so we connect one of
them<00:02:27.260> so<00:02:28.260> what<00:02:28.380> we<00:02:28.500> do<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:32.120> connect<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:40.040> once<00:02:41.040> we

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
them so what we do is connect it once we

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.110 
them so what we do is connect it once we
connect<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:42.680> there's<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.799> wire<00:02:44.640> right<00:02:44.850> here

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
connect it there's a wire right here

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.110 
connect it there's a wire right here
that<00:02:45.299> goes<00:02:45.330> inside<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.989> pin<00:02:46.200> pin<00:02:46.880> we'll<00:02:47.880> turn

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
that goes inside the pin pin we'll turn

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.289 
that goes inside the pin pin we'll turn
the<00:02:48.269> ignition<00:02:48.330> off<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:50.150> when<00:02:51.150> we<00:02:51.180> do<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:53.299> the

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
the ignition off and when we do that the

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.570 
the ignition off and when we do that the
airbag<00:02:54.750> light<00:02:55.080> should<00:02:55.440> blink<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:56.819> code<00:02:58.580> so

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
airbag light should blink the code so

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:08.780 
airbag light should blink the code so
it's<00:02:59.730> off<00:02:59.880> one<00:03:01.250> two<00:03:02.959> three<00:03:04.220> four<00:03:05.720> five<00:03:07.400> six<00:03:08.400> one

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
it's off one two three four five six one

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.229 
it's off one two three four five six one
two<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:10.650> that's<00:03:10.890> 62<00:03:13.280> six<00:03:14.280> long<00:03:14.549> ones<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.060> two

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
two so that's 62 six long ones and two

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.500 
two so that's 62 six long ones and two
short<00:03:15.510> ones<00:03:15.660> means<00:03:15.989> 62<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:17.090> you<00:03:18.090> can<00:03:18.239> always

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
short ones means 62 and you can always

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.620 
short ones means 62 and you can always
double<00:03:18.840> check<00:03:19.019> if<00:03:19.829> it<00:03:20.040> repeats<00:03:20.220> 62<00:03:21.120> like<00:03:21.299> 6

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
double check if it repeats 62 like 6

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.199 
double check if it repeats 62 like 6
into<00:03:21.870> 2<00:03:21.989> again<00:03:22.320> that<00:03:22.920> means<00:03:23.100> 62<00:03:23.790> there's<00:03:24.030> no

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
into 2 again that means 62 there's no

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.420 
into 2 again that means 62 there's no
other<00:03:24.450> codes<00:03:24.870> if<00:03:25.019> it<00:03:25.109> has<00:03:25.200> other<00:03:25.410> codes<00:03:25.769> got<00:03:26.310> to

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
other codes if it has other codes got to

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.610 
other codes if it has other codes got to
write<00:03:26.609> all<00:03:26.820> of<00:03:26.850> them<00:03:27.120> down<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:27.600> check<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.560> out

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
write all of them down and check it out

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.340 
write all of them down and check it out
in<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:28.920> trouble<00:03:29.310> codes<00:03:29.579> I<00:03:29.790> have<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:30.299> on<00:03:30.420> on<00:03:31.109> my

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
in the trouble codes I have it on on my

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.559 
in the trouble codes I have it on on my
website<00:03:31.829> the<00:03:32.280> trouble<00:03:32.640> codes<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:33.000> definition

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
website the trouble codes the definition

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.539 
website the trouble codes the definition
so<00:03:33.810> now<00:03:34.530> that<00:03:34.590> we<00:03:34.890> know<00:03:35.100> it's<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.900> left<00:03:37.549> seat

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
so now that we know it's the left seat

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.880 
so now that we know it's the left seat
belt<00:03:38.850> because<00:03:39.090> 62<00:03:40.019> is<00:03:40.170> for<00:03:40.319> the<00:03:40.410> left<00:03:40.620> seat

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
here for the seat belt what I do what

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:06.740 
here for the seat belt what I do what
you'll<00:04:06.389> do

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
you'll do

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.060 
you'll do
it's<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:07.859> 3<00:04:08.190> ohm<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.669> got<00:04:08.850> a<00:04:08.880> 3<00:04:09.180> ohm<00:04:09.560> resistors<00:04:10.560> you

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
it's a 3 ohm I got a 3 ohm resistors you

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.820 
it's a 3 ohm I got a 3 ohm resistors you
can<00:04:11.250> buy<00:04:11.459> them<00:04:11.639> at<00:04:11.989> RadioShack

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
can buy them at RadioShack

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.760 
can buy them at RadioShack
1/4<00:04:14.460> watt<00:04:14.730> is<00:04:15.120> you<00:04:15.870> put<00:04:16.110> three<00:04:16.320> of<00:04:16.410> them<00:04:16.620> if<00:04:16.680> you

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
1/4 watt is you put three of them if you

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:22.340 
1/4 watt is you put three of them if you
buy<00:04:16.890> 10<00:04:17.190> 10<00:04:17.550> ohm<00:04:17.730> so<00:04:18.390> I<00:04:18.420> put<00:04:19.910> three<00:04:20.910> 10<00:04:21.180> ohms<00:04:21.420> 1/4

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
buy 10 10 ohm so I put three 10 ohms 1/4

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.730 
buy 10 10 ohm so I put three 10 ohms 1/4
watt<00:04:22.590> this<00:04:23.490> is<00:04:23.700> kind<00:04:23.880> of<00:04:23.940> like<00:04:24.090> an<00:04:24.210> air<00:04:24.420> bag<00:04:24.740> so

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
watt this is kind of like an air bag so

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:33.290 
watt this is kind of like an air bag so
once<00:04:26.070> you<00:04:26.220> put<00:04:26.430> in<00:04:26.550> a<00:04:26.730> good<00:04:29.570> resistor<00:04:32.150> plug<00:04:33.150> it

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
once you put in a good resistor plug it

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.250 
once you put in a good resistor plug it
in<00:04:33.420> there<00:04:33.600> pretty<00:04:33.870> good

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
in there pretty good

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.740 
in there pretty good
as<00:04:34.320> you<00:04:35.190> can<00:04:35.340> see<00:04:35.520> one<00:04:35.760> side<00:04:36.000> from<00:04:36.270> one<00:04:36.480> side

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
as you can see one side from one side

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.200 
as you can see one side from one side
another<00:04:36.990> make<00:04:37.290> sure<00:04:37.470> they<00:04:38.070> do<00:04:38.130> not<00:04:38.250> touch<00:04:38.670> each

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
another make sure they do not touch each

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.910 
another make sure they do not touch each
other<00:04:39.480> from<00:04:39.660> left<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:39.990> right<00:04:41.960> this<00:04:42.960> is<00:04:43.350> kind<00:04:43.830> of

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
other from left to right this is kind of

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.490 
other from left to right this is kind of
like<00:04:44.100> a<00:04:44.130> temporary<00:04:44.640> will<00:04:45.420> basically<00:04:45.990> test<00:04:46.260> the

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
like a temporary will basically test the

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.190 
like a temporary will basically test the
circuit<00:04:47.070> make<00:04:47.520> sure<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:48.270> circuit<00:04:48.750> is<00:04:48.870> fine

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
circuit make sure the circuit is fine

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.130 
circuit make sure the circuit is fine
and<00:04:49.530> if<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.860> air<00:04:50.160> bag<00:04:50.400> light<00:04:50.730> goes<00:04:51.450> off<00:04:51.720> that

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
and if the air bag light goes off that

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.660 
and if the air bag light goes off that
means<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.470> SIBO<00:04:52.770> needs<00:04:52.980> to<00:04:53.070> be<00:04:53.190> replaced

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
means the SIBO needs to be replaced

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.350 
means the SIBO needs to be replaced
pretty<00:04:54.360> simple<00:04:54.980> let's<00:04:55.980> see<00:04:56.250> let's<00:04:56.970> disconnect

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
pretty simple let's see let's disconnect

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.400 
pretty simple let's see let's disconnect
this<00:04:57.660> pan<00:04:57.900> right<00:04:57.930> here<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.960> let's<00:05:00.960> put<00:05:01.260> the

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
this pan right here and let's put the

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.660 
this pan right here and let's put the
ignition<00:05:01.500> off

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
ignition off

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.000 
ignition off
and<00:05:03.510> then<00:05:04.230> put<00:05:05.040> it<00:05:05.130> back<00:05:05.160> on<00:05:06.470> the<00:05:07.470> car<00:05:07.740> is

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
and then put it back on the car is
