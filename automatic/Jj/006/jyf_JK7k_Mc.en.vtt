bounce<00:00:37.829> off<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:39.170> will<00:00:40.170> draw<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.530> few<00:00:40.739> shapes<00:00:41.070> that

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
bounce off I will draw a few shapes that

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.030 
bounce off I will draw a few shapes that
I<00:00:41.610> will<00:00:41.910> be<00:00:42.030> masking<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:43.079> use<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.469> some<00:00:43.680> sort<00:00:43.920> of

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
I will be masking to use a some sort of

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.990 
I will be masking to use a some sort of
guidance<00:00:45.440> now<00:00:46.440> let's<00:00:47.129> start<00:00:47.460> painting

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
guidance now let's start painting

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.569 
guidance now let's start painting
I<00:00:48.239> will<00:00:49.050> pick<00:00:49.260> some<00:00:49.559> color<00:00:49.860> French

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
I will pick some color French

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.090 
I will pick some color French
ultramarine<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:52.230> will<00:00:52.379> start<00:00:52.770> painting

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
ultramarine and we will start painting

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.779 
ultramarine and we will start painting
on<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.030> paper<00:00:54.379> to<00:00:55.379> compare<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.100> differences

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
on the paper to compare the differences

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.720 
on the paper to compare the differences
of<00:00:57.090> masking<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.109> not<00:00:58.320> masking<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.070> will<00:00:59.609> be

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
of masking and not masking I will be

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.260 
of masking and not masking I will be
just<00:00:59.940> painting<00:01:00.449> around<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.260> first<00:01:01.500> shape<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
just painting around the first shape and

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.690 
just painting around the first shape and
this<00:01:03.270> may<00:01:03.690> take<00:01:03.930> longer<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:05.040> have<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.460> be

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
this may take longer you have to be

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.340 
this may take longer you have to be
careful<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.020> apply<00:01:07.770> paint<00:01:08.220> around<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.630> shape

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
careful and apply paint around the shape

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.399 
careful and apply paint around the shape
that's<00:01:11.220> why<00:01:11.580> using<00:01:12.180> masking<00:01:12.570> techniques<00:01:13.049> may

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
that's why using masking techniques may

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.660 
that's why using masking techniques may
save<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.890> some<00:01:14.159> time<00:01:16.070> now<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.100> am<00:01:17.430> removing

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
save you some time now I am removing

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.179 
save you some time now I am removing
some<00:01:18.390> excess<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.350> paint<00:01:19.590> from<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
some excess of the paint from the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.810 
some excess of the paint from the
masking<00:01:20.729> tape

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.389 

by<00:01:25.820> tearing<00:01:26.150> apart<00:01:26.530> little<00:01:27.530> pieces<00:01:27.740> of<00:01:28.130> the

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
by tearing apart little pieces of the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.940 
by tearing apart little pieces of the
masking<00:01:28.790> tape<00:01:28.820> I<00:01:29.329> will<00:01:29.420> create<00:01:29.869> a<00:01:30.259> shape<00:01:30.710> of

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
masking tape I will create a shape of

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.359 
masking tape I will create a shape of
the<00:01:31.520> circle<00:01:32.240> well<00:01:33.229> you<00:01:33.530> of<00:01:33.649> course<00:01:33.890> could<00:01:34.130> use

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
the circle well you of course could use

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.210 
the circle well you of course could use
scissors<00:01:34.759> to<00:01:35.299> make<00:01:35.689> a<00:01:35.750> perfect<00:01:36.320> shape<00:01:36.590> but<00:01:36.979> I

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
scissors to make a perfect shape but I

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.760 
scissors to make a perfect shape but I
think<00:01:37.490> if<00:01:37.700> you're<00:01:38.000> doing<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.539> by<00:01:38.720> hand<00:01:38.770> by

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
think if you're doing it by hand by

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.249 
think if you're doing it by hand by
applying<00:01:40.130> little<00:01:41.119> pieces<00:01:41.450> by<00:01:41.600> little<00:01:41.869> pieces

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
applying little pieces by little pieces

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.219 
applying little pieces by little pieces
you<00:01:42.950> will<00:01:43.130> create<00:01:43.460> a<00:01:43.789> more<00:01:44.119> natural<00:01:44.750> look<00:01:45.259> the

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
you will create a more natural look the

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.020 
you will create a more natural look the
beauty<00:01:48.229> of<00:01:48.500> using<00:01:48.740> different<00:01:49.670> kinds<00:01:49.970> of

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
beauty of using different kinds of

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.779 
beauty of using different kinds of
masking<00:01:50.509> is<00:01:50.659> that<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:51.530> can<00:01:51.710> paint<00:01:52.039> right<00:01:52.549> on

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
masking is that you can paint right on

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.690 
masking is that you can paint right on
top<00:01:53.179> of<00:01:53.390> it<00:01:53.570> and<00:01:53.780> not<00:01:54.350> to<00:01:54.590> worry<00:01:54.860> about<00:01:55.220> being

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
top of it and not to worry about being

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.660 
top of it and not to worry about being
precise

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
precise

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.789 
precise
another<00:01:58.670> way<00:01:58.940> of<00:01:59.119> masking<00:01:59.420> is<00:02:00.080> to<00:02:00.380> use<00:02:00.560> a

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
another way of masking is to use a

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.139 
another way of masking is to use a
masking<00:02:01.310> fluid<00:02:03.069> there<00:02:04.069> are<00:02:04.250> different<00:02:04.700> kinds

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
masking fluid there are different kinds

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.199 
masking fluid there are different kinds
of<00:02:05.240> masking<00:02:05.780> available<00:02:06.500> on<00:02:06.709> the<00:02:06.890> market<00:02:07.280> don't

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
of masking available on the market don't

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.240 
of masking available on the market don't
shake<00:02:08.569> it<00:02:08.600> too<00:02:08.780> much<00:02:09.110> as<00:02:09.590> it<00:02:09.830> will<00:02:09.979> create

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
shake it too much as it will create

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.199 
shake it too much as it will create
bubbles<00:02:10.759> and<00:02:11.350> get<00:02:12.350> ready<00:02:12.650> it<00:02:13.280> stinks

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
bubbles and get ready it stinks

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
the areas that you need to mask you can

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.530 
the areas that you need to mask you can
reapply<00:03:20.540> more<00:03:21.350> intense<00:03:21.739> colors<00:03:22.250> over<00:03:23.180> the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
where again you need to be careful to

paint around the area that you do not

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.270 
paint around the area that you do not
mask<00:03:31.090> which<00:03:31.630> of<00:03:31.930> course<00:03:31.960> takes<00:03:32.530> more<00:03:32.890> of<00:03:32.950> your

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
mask which of course takes more of your

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.950 
mask which of course takes more of your
time<00:03:35.220> when<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.460> are<00:03:36.640> controlling<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.630> flow

of the paint by tilting your paper

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.380 
of the paint by tilting your paper
vertically<00:03:41.350> there<00:03:41.950> is<00:03:42.100> always<00:03:42.490> a<00:03:42.730> risk<00:03:42.940> that

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
vertically there is always a risk that

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.560 
vertically there is always a risk that
beings<00:03:44.290> will<00:03:44.620> drop<00:03:44.920> over<00:03:45.460> the<00:03:45.640> area<00:03:46.000> that<00:03:46.240> you

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
beings will drop over the area that you

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.410 
beings will drop over the area that you
did<00:03:46.750> not<00:03:46.960> mask<00:03:47.260> when<00:03:48.250> masking<00:03:48.790> will<00:03:49.030> remain

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
did not mask when masking will remain

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.000 
did not mask when masking will remain
clean<00:03:50.640> now<00:03:51.670> that<00:03:52.060> I<00:03:52.240> waited<00:03:52.720> for<00:03:53.050> paper<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:53.710> dry

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
clean now that I waited for paper to dry

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.050 
clean now that I waited for paper to dry
I<00:03:54.430> will<00:03:54.880> be<00:03:55.150> removing<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:56.080> masking<00:03:56.640> so<00:03:57.640> you

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
I will be removing the masking so you

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.020 
I will be removing the masking so you
could<00:03:58.270> rub<00:03:58.630> it<00:03:58.840> with<00:03:59.290> your<00:03:59.320> finger<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.340> areas

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
could rub it with your finger the areas

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.350 
could rub it with your finger the areas
that<00:04:01.330> were<00:04:02.020> masked<00:04:02.470> with<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.770> masking<00:04:03.130> fluid

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
that were masked with the masking fluid

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.410 
that were masked with the masking fluid
so<00:04:04.360> here<00:04:04.690> as<00:04:04.900> well<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:06.790> need<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.210> make<00:04:07.390> sure
