detailing<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.149> them<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.390> thought<00:01:03.510> they<00:01:03.570> added

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
detailing on them I thought they added

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.600 
detailing on them I thought they added
something<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.379> little<00:01:04.470> bit<00:01:04.619> different<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.430> make

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
something a little bit different to make

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.250 
something a little bit different to make
army<00:01:06.060> boots<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.360> little<00:01:06.570> bit<00:01:06.659> more<00:01:06.780> dressier

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
army boots a little bit more dressier

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.690 
army boots a little bit more dressier
but<00:01:07.619> yeah<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> reason<00:01:08.100> why<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.220> got<00:01:08.460> them<00:01:08.610> is

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
but yeah the reason why I got them is

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.580 
but yeah the reason why I got them is
because<00:01:08.850> they<00:01:09.150> remind<00:01:09.299> me<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.600> Mad<00:01:09.900> Max<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.500> if

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
because they remind me of Mad Max so if

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.899 
because they remind me of Mad Max so if
you've<00:01:10.710> seen<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.100> movie<00:01:11.430> you'll<00:01:11.580> know<00:01:11.700> what

they<00:03:36.360> had<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.510> really<00:03:36.690> cool<00:03:36.930> sale<00:03:37.140> on<00:03:37.320> where<00:03:37.470> you

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590

for half price so I thought that was
pretty<00:03:40.890> good<00:03:41.100> but<00:03:41.370> now<00:03:41.489> that<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:41.700> actually<00:03:41.880> look

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709
