00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.640 

that<00:00:52.790> looks<00:00:53.210> like<00:00:53.300> the<00:00:53.390> Samsung<00:00:53.780> came<00:00:53.930> out<00:00:54.110> as

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
that looks like the Samsung came out as

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:55.330 
that looks like the Samsung came out as
the<00:00:54.770> winner<00:00:54.890> there

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
the winner there

the winner there
it<00:00:55.700> wasn't<00:00:56.060> obviously<00:00:56.360> as<00:00:56.540> fast<00:00:56.990> as<00:00:57.290> it<00:00:58.190> was

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
it wasn't obviously as fast as it was

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.430 
it wasn't obviously as fast as it was
previously<00:00:58.550> in<00:00:58.880> terms<00:00:58.910> of<00:00:59.240> the<00:00:59.330> big<00:00:59.540> gap<00:00:59.750> but

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
home ones and then we'll do the actual

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.800 
home ones and then we'll do the actual
scanner<00:01:26.140> afterwards<00:01:26.650> so<00:01:27.159> turn<00:01:27.340> on<00:01:27.490> turn<00:01:27.940> it<00:01:28.210> on

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810

like<00:01:44.969> the<00:01:45.119> was<00:01:45.240> previously<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.229> I'm

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
like the was previously it's like I'm

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:47.419 
like the was previously it's like I'm
gonna<00:01:46.469> lose<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.679> power<00:01:46.890> button<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.340> my

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
gonna lose the power button to my

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.170 
gonna lose the power button to my
sternum<00:01:47.579> on<00:01:47.789> this<00:01:47.909> way

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
sternum on this way

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.090 
sternum on this way
so<00:01:49.810> again<00:01:50.050> in<00:01:50.620> three<00:01:51.550> two<00:01:52.030> one

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
so again in three two one

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.730 
so again in three two one
the<00:01:54.760> iPhone<00:01:55.060> seemed<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.360> announcer<00:01:55.990> is<00:01:56.470> kind

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
the iPhone seemed to announcer is kind

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.780 
the iPhone seemed to announcer is kind
of<00:01:56.770> like<00:01:56.890> three<00:01:57.250> to<00:01:57.430> one

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
of like three to one

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.960 
of like three to one
so<00:01:58.420> it<00:01:58.660> does<00:01:58.900> work<00:01:59.100> yes<00:02:00.100> I<00:02:00.370> know<00:02:00.580> call<00:02:00.790> there's

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
so it does work yes I know call there's

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.700 
so it does work yes I know call there's
four<00:02:01.120> people<00:02:01.420> are<00:02:01.510> saying<00:02:01.720> are<00:02:01.870> they<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.500> city

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
four people are saying are they the city

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.140 
four people are saying are they the city
-<00:02:02.830> it<00:02:02.920> doesn't<00:02:03.100> do<00:02:03.160> anything<00:02:03.370> it<00:02:03.910> does<00:02:04.030> look

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
- it doesn't do anything it does look

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.670 
- it doesn't do anything it does look
like<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.390> iPhone<00:02:04.720> is<00:02:04.870> probably<00:02:05.200> a<00:02:05.290> little<00:02:05.530> bit

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
like the iPhone is probably a little bit

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.280 
like the iPhone is probably a little bit
faster<00:02:06.190> at<00:02:06.520> doing<00:02:06.850> this<00:02:07.000> if<00:02:07.840> you<00:02:07.930> want<00:02:08.140> to<00:02:08.200> do

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
faster at doing this if you want to do

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.350 
faster at doing this if you want to do
once<00:02:08.740> more<00:02:08.890> time<00:02:09.250> for<00:02:09.429> a<00:02:09.460> third<00:02:09.729> time<00:02:09.880> look<00:02:10.179> it

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
once more time for a third time look it

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.540 
once more time for a third time look it
then<00:02:10.660> I<00:02:10.750> will<00:02:10.810> do<00:02:11.080> its<00:02:12.040> let<00:02:12.160> me<00:02:12.250> only<00:02:12.340> comment

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
then I will do its let me only comment

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.530 
then I will do its let me only comment
down<00:02:12.700> below<00:02:12.820> and<00:02:12.940> I'll<00:02:13.060> see<00:02:13.150> if<00:02:13.210> I<00:02:13.300> can<00:02:13.420> head

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
down below and I'll see if I can head

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.850 
down below and I'll see if I can head
back<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.720> Samsung<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.230> do<00:02:14.410> that<00:02:14.500> in<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.680> future

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
back to Samsung and do that in a future

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.100 
back to Samsung and do that in a future
one<00:02:15.130> but<00:02:15.670> in<00:02:15.760> terms<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.420> fingerprint

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
one but in terms of the fingerprint

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.430 
one but in terms of the fingerprint
scanner

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
scanner

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.890 
scanner
they've<00:02:17.980> both<00:02:18.190> already<00:02:18.640> fast<00:02:18.850> and<00:02:19.630> I'm<00:02:19.750> very

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
they've both already fast and I'm very

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.270 
they've both already fast and I'm very
impressed<00:02:20.170> but<00:02:20.410> Samsung<00:02:20.830> have<00:02:20.920> enough<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.190> do

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
impressed but Samsung have enough to do

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.400 
impressed but Samsung have enough to do
in<00:02:21.460> a<00:02:21.550> different<00:02:21.700> kind<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.120> style<00:02:22.420> born<00:02:22.750> but

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
in a different kind of style born but

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.740 
in a different kind of style born but
again<00:02:23.560> touch<00:02:23.770> ID<00:02:23.980> is<00:02:24.280> -<00:02:24.430> Ajay<00:02:24.640> D<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.540> works

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
again touch ID is - Ajay D and it works

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.350 
again touch ID is - Ajay D and it works
and<00:02:26.470> now<00:02:26.650> something<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.070> managed<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.340> there<00:02:28.270> is

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.330 
and now something I managed to there is
a<00:02:28.450> replicator<00:02:29.110> because<00:02:29.800> I<00:02:29.860> spun<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.070> on<00:02:30.280> the
