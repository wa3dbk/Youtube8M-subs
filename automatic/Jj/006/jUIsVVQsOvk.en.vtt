I'll show you some voicings and give you
some<00:00:53.070> examples<00:00:53.190> here<00:00:54.860> if<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.610> were<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.910> play

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090

let's<00:00:57.539> say<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.859> 251<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.340> key<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.640> E<00:00:59.730> flat

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
let's say a 251 and the key of E flat

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.299 
let's say a 251 and the key of E flat
those<00:01:02.010> cords<00:01:02.489> would<00:01:02.609> include<00:01:02.879> F<00:01:03.120> minor<00:01:04.280> B<00:01:05.280> flat

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
those cords would include F minor B flat

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.310 
those cords would include F minor B flat
7<00:01:06.650> and<00:01:07.650> an<00:01:07.830> E<00:01:07.950> flat<00:01:08.130> major<00:01:08.369> Center<00:01:09.260> and<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
7 and an E flat major Center and the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.679 
7 and an E flat major Center and the
voicings<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.830> typically<00:01:11.189> would<00:01:11.400> use

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
voicings that I typically would use

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.980 
voicings that I typically would use
would<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.960> F<00:01:13.260> neroon

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
would be F neroon

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.760 
would be F neroon
the<00:01:15.500> minor<00:01:15.740> third<00:01:16.119> and<00:01:17.290> flatted<00:01:18.290> 7<00:01:18.670> right<00:01:19.670> so

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
the minor third and flatted 7 right so

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.929 
the minor third and flatted 7 right so
not<00:01:21.770> using<00:01:21.950> the<00:01:22.070> fifth<00:01:22.310> because<00:01:22.670> that<00:01:22.820> doesn't

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
not using the fifth because that doesn't

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.070 
not using the fifth because that doesn't
really<00:01:23.090> tell<00:01:23.299> me<00:01:23.330> a<00:01:23.450> whole<00:01:23.600> lot<00:01:23.659> about<00:01:23.960> the

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
really tell me a whole lot about the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.039 
really tell me a whole lot about the
cord<00:01:24.350> but<00:01:25.280> with<00:01:25.430> these<00:01:25.549> three<00:01:25.850> notes<00:01:26.090> I<00:01:26.360> have

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
cord but with these three notes I have

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.170 
cord but with these three notes I have
all<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.320> information<00:01:27.560> I<00:01:27.950> need<00:01:27.979> okay<00:01:28.939> whether

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
all the information I need okay whether

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.700 
all the information I need okay whether
it's<00:01:29.330> nine<00:01:29.570> or<00:01:29.930> minor<00:01:30.530> 7<00:01:31.009> or<00:01:31.250> F<00:01:31.610> minor<00:01:32.119> 11

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
it's nine or minor 7 or F minor 11

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.830 
it's nine or minor 7 or F minor 11
doesn't<00:01:33.710> really<00:01:33.830> matter<00:01:34.450> because<00:01:35.450> all<00:01:35.810> of

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
doesn't really matter because all of

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.249 
doesn't really matter because all of
those<00:01:36.020> chords<00:01:36.470> include<00:01:37.009> have<00:01:37.929> flat<00:01:38.929> a<00:01:38.960> third

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
those chords include have flat a third

those chords include have flat a third
oh<00:01:40.060> that's<00:01:41.060> mmm<00:01:41.689> okay

oh that's mmm okay

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.429 
oh that's mmm okay
I<00:01:44.399> move<00:01:45.399> that<00:01:45.430> voicing<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:46.750> five<00:01:46.990> chord

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
I move that voicing to the five chord

I move that voicing to the five chord

5<00:02:44.069> we<00:02:44.849> don't<00:02:44.909> have<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.150> find<00:02:45.329> this<00:02:45.510> court<00:02:45.840> so

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959

this<00:02:46.109> is<00:02:46.260> going<00:02:46.409> to<00:02:46.500> work<00:02:46.590> for<00:02:46.680> all<00:02:47.069> of<00:02:47.489> those

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:47.639 
this is going to work for all of those

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:52.910 
this is going to work for all of those
sports<00:02:48.109> D<00:02:49.109> flat<00:02:49.349> 7<00:02:49.579> could<00:02:50.579> be<00:02:50.700> me<00:02:50.849> flat<00:02:51.090> 13<00:02:51.920> flat

13 B flat 7 flat 9 again all of that
stuff<00:02:58.709> doesn't<00:02:59.639> really<00:02:59.790> matter<00:03:00.120> this<00:03:00.450> voicing

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
stuff doesn't really matter this voicing

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.179 
stuff doesn't really matter this voicing
is<00:03:00.989> going<00:03:01.139> to<00:03:01.200> work<00:03:01.349> perfectly<00:03:01.379> for<00:03:02.040> those

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
is going to work perfectly for those

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:04.670 
is going to work perfectly for those
chords<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.959> then<00:03:04.109> we're<00:03:04.230> going<00:03:04.319> to<00:03:04.379> resolve

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
chords and then we're going to resolve

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:12.319 
chords and then we're going to resolve
to<00:03:05.519> e<00:03:05.879> flat<00:03:06.419> major<00:03:06.480> 7<00:03:07.049> right<00:03:10.129> if<00:03:11.129> we<00:03:11.370> want<00:03:11.939> it<00:03:12.090> to

to e flat major 7 right if we want it to

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.780 
to e flat major 7 right if we want it to
or<00:03:12.750> if<00:03:12.840> we<00:03:12.959> had<00:03:13.169> a<00:03:13.200> moment<00:03:13.919> where<00:03:14.250> e<00:03:14.489> flat<00:03:14.730> major

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
or if we had a moment where e flat major

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.509 
or if we had a moment where e flat major
7<00:03:15.299> was<00:03:15.989> going<00:03:16.169> to<00:03:16.230> land<00:03:16.469> and<00:03:16.739> resolve<00:03:17.099> for<00:03:17.340> two

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
7 was going to land and resolve for two

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.599 
7 was going to land and resolve for two
measures<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:18.090> might<00:03:18.329> leave<00:03:18.959> line<00:03:19.379> major<00:03:19.620> 7<00:03:20.099> and

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
measures I might leave line major 7 and

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.940 
measures I might leave line major 7 and
then<00:03:20.760> move<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.150> major<00:03:21.419> 7th<00:03:21.840> down<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.680> whole

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
then move the major 7th down a whole

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.599 
then move the major 7th down a whole
step<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.909> the<00:03:24.000> sixth<00:03:24.419> so<00:03:24.780> now<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:24.930> have<00:03:25.079> D<00:03:25.620> flat<00:03:25.919> G

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
step to the sixth so now I have D flat G

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.120 
step to the sixth so now I have D flat G
and<00:03:26.760> C

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
and C

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:51.010 
and C
okay<00:03:46.720> 251<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:47.840> E<00:03:47.930> flat<00:03:48.140> okay<00:03:49.130> now<00:03:49.880> the<00:03:50.840> way<00:03:50.930> the

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
okay 251 and E flat okay now the way the

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.830 
okay 251 and E flat okay now the way the
guitar<00:03:51.290> setup<00:03:51.700> is<00:03:52.700> that<00:03:52.970> you<00:03:53.540> need<00:03:53.720> to<00:03:53.780> know

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
guitar setup is that you need to know

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.720 
guitar setup is that you need to know
how<00:03:53.990> to<00:03:54.020> play<00:03:54.260> 251<00:03:56.110> then<00:03:57.250> begins<00:03:58.250> and<00:03:58.460> ends<00:03:58.580> on

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
how to play 251 then begins and ends on

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.850 
how to play 251 then begins and ends on
the<00:03:58.790> fifth<00:03:59.630> string<00:03:59.690> with<00:04:00.350> the<00:04:00.470> roots<00:04:00.650> on<00:04:00.800> the

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
the fifth string with the roots on the

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.900 
the fifth string with the roots on the
fifth<00:04:01.040> string<00:04:01.070> and<00:04:02.060> and<00:04:02.620> a<00:04:03.620> 251<00:04:04.250> that<00:04:04.580> begins

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
fifth string and and a 251 that begins

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.230 
fifth string and and a 251 that begins
and<00:04:05.120> ends<00:04:05.240> with<00:04:05.360> a<00:04:05.480> root<00:04:05.690> on<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.590> sixth<00:04:06.800> string

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
and ends with a root on the sixth string

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.440 
and ends with a root on the sixth string
so<00:04:08.240> here's<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:08.600> same<00:04:08.840> approach<00:04:09.850> about<00:04:10.850> a<00:04:10.880> 25<00:04:11.210> 1

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
so here's the same approach about a 25 1

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.730 
so here's the same approach about a 25 1
and<00:04:11.600> g<00:04:11.780> 2<00:04:13.420> 5<00:04:14.420> 1<00:04:14.600> and<00:04:14.720> G<00:04:14.840> would<00:04:15.050> include<00:04:15.290> a<00:04:15.500> minor

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
and g 2 5 1 and G would include a minor

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.840 
and g 2 5 1 and G would include a minor
7<00:04:17.440> g<00:04:18.440> 7

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:25.689

why i use my thumb I idolized Hendrix
own<00:05:29.499> kit<00:05:29.830> and<00:05:30.099> so<00:05:30.249> of<00:05:30.339> course<00:05:30.399> I<00:05:30.610> can't<00:05:30.819> turn

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:30.969 
own kit and so of course I can't turn

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:32.609 
own kit and so of course I can't turn
that<00:05:31.119> off<00:05:31.300> but<00:05:31.599> it<00:05:32.050> really<00:05:32.199> comes<00:05:32.439> in<00:05:32.589> handy

00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:32.619 
that off but it really comes in handy

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:38.730 
that off but it really comes in handy
especially<00:05:33.839> with<00:05:34.839> the<00:05:34.960> style<00:05:35.229> of<00:05:35.349> copy<00:05:37.619> and<00:05:38.619> we

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
especially with the style of copy and we

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.850 
especially with the style of copy and we
move<00:05:38.889> from<00:05:39.099> d7<00:05:39.819> onto<00:05:40.240> g<00:05:40.389> major<00:05:40.539> step<00:05:40.860> right

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
move from d7 onto g major step right

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.139 
move from d7 onto g major step right
again<00:05:42.159> I<00:05:42.189> the<00:05:42.279> route<00:05:42.659> now<00:05:43.659> I<00:05:43.689> have<00:05:44.520> major<00:05:45.520> 7<00:05:46.029> and

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:46.149 
again I the route now I have major 7 and

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:49.290 
again I the route now I have major 7 and
F<00:05:46.240> sharp<00:05:46.919> and<00:05:47.919> B<00:05:48.339> is<00:05:48.520> the<00:05:48.610> third<00:05:48.819> of<00:05:48.849> the<00:05:48.969> corner

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
F sharp and B is the third of the corner

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.239 
F sharp and B is the third of the corner
now<00:05:50.080> like<00:05:50.559> in<00:05:50.680> the<00:05:50.770> last<00:05:50.919> example<00:05:53.219> there<00:05:54.219> are

00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:54.249 
now like in the last example there are

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:57.659 
now like in the last example there are
often<00:05:54.639> times<00:05:54.879> where<00:05:55.059> we<00:05:55.149> know<00:05:55.240> 25<00:05:55.719> 1<00:05:56.050> and<00:05:56.979> the<00:05:57.490> 1

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
often times where we know 25 1 and the 1

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.829 
often times where we know 25 1 and the 1
chord<00:05:58.119> will<00:05:58.509> will<00:05:59.110> sit<00:05:59.919> for<00:06:00.219> two<00:06:00.729> measures<00:06:00.909> and

00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:01.839 
chord will will sit for two measures and

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:04.350 
chord will will sit for two measures and
if<00:06:01.990> that's<00:06:02.020> the<00:06:02.289> case<00:06:02.379> then<00:06:02.919> what<00:06:03.789> I'll<00:06:03.939> do<00:06:04.119> is

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
if that's the case then what I'll do is

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.570 
if that's the case then what I'll do is
is<00:06:04.629> change<00:06:05.409> this<00:06:06.059> major<00:06:07.059> 7th<00:06:07.509> chord<00:06:08.369> to<00:06:09.369> major

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
is change this major 7th chord to major

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.879 
is change this major 7th chord to major
6th<00:06:09.999> chord

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889
