black patent platform less shoes so

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.130 
black patent platform less shoes so
these<00:02:36.760> have<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:37.000> platform<00:02:37.569> and<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.840> other<00:02:37.959> one

most<00:02:40.420> shoes<00:02:40.690> because<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:41.709> makes<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.069> little

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
most shoes because it makes you a little

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.640 
most shoes because it makes you a little
bit<00:02:42.459> taller<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:43.209> it's<00:02:43.660> just<00:02:43.930> better<00:02:44.140> for<00:02:44.470> my
