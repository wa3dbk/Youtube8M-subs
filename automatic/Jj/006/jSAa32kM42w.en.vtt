00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
pop a console forward pull down and it's

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.670 
pop a console forward pull down and it's
out<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:54.630> as<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.899> can<00:01:55.140> see<00:01:55.200> then

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
just down the back as we can see there's

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.999 
just down the back as we can see there's
a<00:02:04.600> ball<00:02:04.840> here<00:02:05.490> I've<00:02:06.490> taken<00:02:06.700> these<00:02:07.000> out<00:02:07.270> ready

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
a ball here I've taken these out ready

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.100 
a ball here I've taken these out ready
I've<00:02:09.009> gone<00:02:09.190> for<00:02:09.399> replacement<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.830> then<00:02:13.110> it's

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
I've gone for replacement and then it's

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.350 
I've gone for replacement and then it's
a<00:02:14.170> ball<00:02:14.440> here<00:02:14.950> just<00:02:15.700> beyond<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.150> heater

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
a ball here just beyond the heater

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.350 
a ball here just beyond the heater
mechanism<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.560> what<00:02:17.710> you<00:02:17.830> do<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.940> can<00:02:19.120> twist

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
mechanism so what you do you can twist

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.900 
mechanism so what you do you can twist
that<00:02:19.570> look<00:02:19.810> twist<00:02:20.260> it<00:02:20.410> down<00:02:20.490> just<00:02:21.490> on<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.730> back

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
that look twist it down just on the back

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.290 
that look twist it down just on the back
here<00:02:22.090> look<00:02:22.300> or<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.260> can<00:02:23.410> twist<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:24.300> govern

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
here look or you can twist it govern

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.180 
here look or you can twist it govern
what<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.510> twist<00:02:25.720> it<00:02:25.840> all<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.050> way<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.170> hop<00:02:26.530> and

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
what you twist it all the way to hop and

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.860 
what you twist it all the way to hop and
that<00:02:27.340> allows<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:28.000> get<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.300> this<00:02:28.420> one<00:02:28.630> down

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
that allows you to get to this one down

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.949 
that allows you to get to this one down
the<00:02:29.080> back<00:02:29.290> slightly<00:02:30.280> awkward<00:02:30.580> book<00:02:31.120> nothing
