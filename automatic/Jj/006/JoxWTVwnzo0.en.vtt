00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200 

I<00:00:00.089> would<00:00:00.690> say<00:00:00.840> my<00:00:01.110> first<00:00:01.410> impression<00:00:01.860> is<00:00:02.210> big

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
I would say my first impression is big

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.950 
I would say my first impression is big
disappointment<00:00:03.959> because<00:00:04.790> there's<00:00:05.790> no<00:00:05.960> civil

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
disappointment because there's no civil

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.770 
disappointment because there's no civil
war<00:00:07.140> and<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.950> end<00:00:08.069> of<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.309> season<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.820> that's

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
war and the end of the season and that's

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.829 
war and the end of the season and that's
the<00:00:10.010> main<00:00:11.010> thing<00:00:11.570> after<00:00:13.280> was<00:00:14.280> not<00:00:14.519> been<00:00:14.839> as

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
the main thing after was not been as

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.250 
the main thing after was not been as
consistent<00:00:16.379> as<00:00:17.010> we<00:00:17.609> would<00:00:17.820> like<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.779> be<00:00:19.080> but

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
consistent as we would like to be but

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.140 
consistent as we would like to be but
there<00:00:22.260> was<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> good<00:00:22.680> season<00:00:22.859> but<00:00:23.150> without

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
there was a good season but without

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.169 
there was a good season but without
everywhere<00:00:26.029> I'd<00:00:27.029> already<00:00:27.560> liked<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:29.179> your

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
everywhere I'd already liked it your

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.299 
everywhere I'd already liked it your
actual<00:00:30.900> season<00:00:31.410> for<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.590> personally<00:00:31.830> as<00:00:32.279> a

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
actual season for you personally as a

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.370 
actual season for you personally as a
player<00:00:32.640> has<00:00:32.850> been<00:00:33.090> very<00:00:33.719> much<00:00:33.989> like<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
player has been very much like the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.049 
player has been very much like the
team's<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.890> seems<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.309> be<00:00:35.460> great<00:00:35.910> at<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
team's it seems to be great at the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.729 
team's it seems to be great at the
beginning<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.600> great<00:00:36.780> at<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.020> end<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.469> and

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
beginning and great at the end of it and

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.040 
beginning and great at the end of it and
a<00:00:37.829> difficult<00:00:38.280> period<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.760> between<00:00:38.820> not<00:00:39.809> just

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
a difficult period in between not just

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.780 
a difficult period in between not just
you<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.829> know<00:00:40.950> what<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.100> mean<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.280> little

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
you but you know what I mean a little

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.670 
you but you know what I mean a little
bit<00:00:41.910> like<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.180> yeah<00:00:42.540> but<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.309> would<00:00:44.309> say<00:00:44.520> that

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
bit like that yeah but I would say that

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.410 
bit like that yeah but I would say that
it's<00:00:46.680> normal<00:00:47.000> when<00:00:48.980> especially<00:00:49.980> after<00:00:50.420> walk

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
it's normal when especially after walk

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.310 
it's normal when especially after walk
up<00:00:51.750> here<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:53.030> then<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.480> go<00:00:54.690> straight

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
up here and then you have to go straight

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.910 
up here and then you have to go straight
forward<00:00:55.770> come<00:00:56.520> back<00:00:57.440> for<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> next<00:00:58.710> season

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
forward come back for the next season

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.869 
forward come back for the next season
start<00:00:59.550> trying<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.870> think<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.469> did<00:01:01.920> pretty

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
start trying and I think we did pretty

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.390 
start trying and I think we did pretty
well<00:01:03.390> at<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:04.140> beginning<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:04.739> had<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.890> bad

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
well at the beginning we had a bad

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.460 
well at the beginning we had a bad
precision<00:01:07.189> but<00:01:08.189> we<00:01:08.400> started<00:01:08.610> there<00:01:08.970> well<00:01:09.210> the

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
precision but we started there well the

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.320 
precision but we started there well the
season<00:01:10.470> we've<00:01:10.680> lost<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.189> community<00:01:12.090> shield

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
season we've lost the community shield

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.469 
season we've lost the community shield
but<00:01:12.650> for<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.770> league<00:01:13.950> we<00:01:14.189> were<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.490> almost

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
but for the league we were the almost

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.800 
but for the league we were the almost
perfect<00:01:15.960> start<00:01:16.759> after<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.790> was<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> more

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
perfect start after I was a more

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.469 
perfect start after I was a more
difficult<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.680> would<00:01:19.920> say<00:01:20.130> by<00:01:20.549> November<00:01:21.270> and

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
difficult I would say by November and

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.140 
difficult I would say by November and
December<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:22.110> get<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:23.400> result<00:01:23.880> who<00:01:24.030> were

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
December to get the result who were

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.130 
December to get the result who were
expected<00:01:24.860> but<00:01:25.860> i<00:01:26.250> would<00:01:26.610> say<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:27.140> we've

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
expected but i would say that we've

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.190 
expected but i would say that we've
places<00:01:28.530> some<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.460> our<00:01:30.090> best<00:01:30.570> games<00:01:30.960> during

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
places some of our best games during

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.679 
places some of our best games during
that<00:01:31.470> period<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.189> didn't<00:01:32.460> get<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.790> result

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
that period but we didn't get the result

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.890 
that period but we didn't get the result
i<00:01:33.840> think<00:01:34.409> about<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.829> birmingham<00:01:35.509> game<00:01:36.509> lots

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
i think about the birmingham game lots

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.069 
i think about the birmingham game lots
of<00:01:37.079> games<00:01:37.350> where<00:01:37.680> we<00:01:38.610> were<00:01:38.729> considered<00:01:39.240> early

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
of games where we were considered early

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.280 
of games where we were considered early
goals<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.530> then<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:41.100> were<00:01:41.280> pushing<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.659> come

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
goals and then we were pushing to come

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.740 
goals and then we were pushing to come
back<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.460> didn't<00:01:44.700> get<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.299> result

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
back and and we didn't get the result

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.080 
back and and we didn't get the result
because<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.530> always<00:01:46.950> need<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.430> win<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.939> that

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
because you always need to win in that

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.840 
because you always need to win in that
league<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.570> i<00:01:49.079> think<00:01:49.500> that's<00:01:49.680> what<00:01:49.979> made<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
league and i think that's what made the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.100 
league and i think that's what made the
difference<00:01:51.110> at<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.409> end<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.799> season<00:01:53.060> I

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
difference at the end of the season I

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.370 
difference at the end of the season I
think<00:01:55.110> all<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.820> top<00:01:56.820> teams<00:01:56.850> had<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:58.079> bad<00:01:58.530> moment

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
think all the top teams had a bad moment

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.350 
think all the top teams had a bad moment
