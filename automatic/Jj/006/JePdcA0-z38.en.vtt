00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.400 

hello<00:00:23.980> YouTube<00:00:24.460> shrug<00:00:25.300> here<00:00:25.570> welcome<00:00:26.200> to<00:00:26.380> a

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
hello YouTube shrug here welcome to a

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.430 
hello YouTube shrug here welcome to a
new<00:00:26.439> kind<00:00:26.830> of<00:00:26.980> redstone<00:00:27.730> video<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:29.380> today

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:29.440 
new kind of redstone video so today

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.729 
new kind of redstone video so today
we're<00:00:30.070> going<00:00:30.160> to<00:00:30.220> showing<00:00:30.520> off<00:00:30.640> my<00:00:30.820> new<00:00:31.739> 16

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
we're going to showing off my new 16

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.790 
we're going to showing off my new 16
byte<00:00:32.980> memory<00:00:33.760> bank<00:00:34.000> again<00:00:34.840> well<00:00:35.230> not<00:00:35.500> again

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
byte memory bank again well not again

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.740 
byte memory bank again well not again
this<00:00:35.950> is<00:00:36.100> a<00:00:36.129> different<00:00:36.550> one<00:00:36.870> but<00:00:37.870> it's<00:00:38.559> named

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
this is a different one but it's named

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.290 
this is a different one but it's named
USM<00:00:40.750> which<00:00:41.559> stands<00:00:41.890> for<00:00:41.980> ultra<00:00:42.730> speeding

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
USM which stands for ultra speeding

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.540 
USM which stands for ultra speeding
memory<00:00:44.159> bonobos<00:00:46.379> because<00:00:47.379> it<00:00:47.530> it's<00:00:48.190> ultra

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
memory bonobos because it it's ultra

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.240 
memory bonobos because it it's ultra
speed<00:00:48.760> this<00:00:49.030> has<00:00:49.180> been<00:00:49.210> there<00:00:49.540> so<00:00:50.320> anyway<00:00:51.220> it's

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
speed this has been there so anyway it's

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.840 
speed this has been there so anyway it's
much<00:00:51.550> like<00:00:51.790> the<00:00:51.820> old<00:00:52.089> memory<00:00:52.510> but<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:55.420> is

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
much like the old memory but it is

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.020 
much like the old memory but it is
speedier<00:00:57.850> and<00:00:58.089> I've<00:00:58.830> inverted<00:00:59.830> the<00:01:00.339> input<00:01:00.670> so

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
speedier and I've inverted the input so

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.880 
speedier and I've inverted the input so
now<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.460> input<00:01:03.460> is<00:01:03.610> at<00:01:03.760> top<00:01:04.030> and<00:01:04.680> output<00:01:05.680> is

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
now the input is at top and output is

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.700 
now the input is at top and output is
down<00:01:06.460> below<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:08.170> say<00:01:09.420> room<00:01:10.420> to<00:01:10.540> let<00:01:10.690> go<00:01:10.900> it's

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
down below so say room to let go it's

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.760 
down below so say room to let go it's
just<00:01:11.890> joshing<00:01:12.310> around<00:01:12.430> mama<00:01:13.619> yeah<00:01:14.619> it's

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
just joshing around mama yeah it's

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.200 
just joshing around mama yeah it's
really<00:01:14.950> adds<00:01:15.189> a<00:01:15.930> deal<00:01:16.930> with<00:01:17.049> no<00:01:17.200> cross<00:01:17.439> it<00:01:17.619> it's

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
really adds a deal with no cross it it's

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.709 
really adds a deal with no cross it it's
just<00:01:19.210> probably<00:01:19.390> as<00:01:19.869> you<00:01:20.560> can<00:01:20.710> see<00:01:20.950> i'm<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:22.240> the

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
just probably as you can see i'm on the

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:29.609 
just probably as you can see i'm on the
server<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:25.380> someone<00:01:26.380> send<00:01:26.740> stuff<00:01:28.619> okay

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
server and someone send stuff okay

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.740 
server and someone send stuff okay
anyway<00:01:30.250> yeah<00:01:30.609> i'm<00:01:30.909> on<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.149> ODF<00:01:31.390> silver<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:33.750> as

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
anyway yeah i'm on the ODF silver and as

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.649 
anyway yeah i'm on the ODF silver and as
you<00:01:34.930> can<00:01:35.079> see<00:01:35.109> i<00:01:35.320> spend<00:01:35.649> up<00:01:35.770> some<00:01:35.950> impressive

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
you can see i spend up some impressive

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.929 
you can see i spend up some impressive
creations<00:01:37.659> around<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.560> anyway<00:01:41.829> let's<00:01:42.039> stop<00:01:42.280> or

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
creations around so anyway let's stop or

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.810 
creations around so anyway let's stop or
I'll<00:01:43.179> get<00:01:43.390> a<00:01:43.799> memory<00:01:44.799> block<00:01:45.070> number<00:01:45.399> seven

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
I'll get a memory block number seven

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
I'll get a memory block number seven
which<00:01:46.030> is<00:01:47.340> number<00:01:48.340> five<00:01:48.670> min<00:01:48.939> which<00:01:49.539> is<00:01:49.659> this

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
which is number five min which is this

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.389 
which is number five min which is this
one<00:01:50.020> right<00:01:50.079> here<00:01:50.259> and<00:01:52.920> let's<00:01:53.920> just<00:01:54.009> write

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
one right here and let's just write

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.429 
one right here and let's just write
whatever<00:01:54.640> we<00:01:54.969> put<00:01:55.630> air<00:01:55.929> into<00:01:56.109> it<00:01:56.640> there<00:01:57.640> you<00:01:57.729> go

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
whatever we put air into it there you go

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.459 
whatever we put air into it there you go
yep<00:01:59.439> this<00:01:59.859> look<00:02:00.640> here<00:02:00.969> is<00:02:01.090> it<00:02:01.210> or<00:02:01.299> not<00:02:01.469> it's

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
yep this look here is it or not it's

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.609 
yep this look here is it or not it's
still<00:02:03.070> going<00:02:03.399> through<00:02:03.600> testing<00:02:04.600> stages<00:02:04.960> at

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
still going through testing stages at

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.779 
still going through testing stages at
the<00:02:05.740> moment<00:02:07.350> but<00:02:08.350> ninety<00:02:09.310> percent<00:02:09.369> of<00:02:09.670> the

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
the moment but ninety percent of the

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.970 
the moment but ninety percent of the
parts<00:02:10.119> work<00:02:11.430> same<00:02:12.430> here<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:13.140> five<00:02:14.140> yeah<00:02:14.950> I

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
parts work same here and five yeah I

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.730 
parts work same here and five yeah I
have<00:02:15.190> been<00:02:15.400> having<00:02:15.700> problems<00:02:15.940> who<00:02:16.240> father

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
have been having problems who father

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:24.650 
have been having problems who father
 it<00:02:19.250> yeah<00:02:20.250> anyway<00:02:21.770> so<00:02:23.450> we've<00:02:24.450> got<00:02:24.630> a

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
 it yeah anyway so we've got a

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.220 
 it yeah anyway so we've got a
mirror<00:02:24.930> image<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.500> what<00:02:25.920> we<00:02:26.130> put<00:02:26.730> up<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.810> input

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
mirror image of what we put up the input

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.510 
mirror image of what we put up the input
stand<00:02:28.710> on<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.550> output<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:31.250> as<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.400> probably

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
stand on the output and as you probably

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:41.060 
stand on the output and as you probably
saw<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.540> was<00:02:35.360> really<00:02:36.360> fast<00:02:39.830> we<00:02:40.830> hit<00:02:41.040> it

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
saw it it was really fast we hit it

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.810 
saw it it was really fast we hit it
again<00:02:42.560> yeah<00:02:43.560> strange<00:02:44.600> or<00:02:45.600> we<00:02:45.810> could<00:02:46.020> and

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
again yeah strange or we could and

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.200 
again yeah strange or we could and
remember<00:02:47.820> look<00:02:47.940> at<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.510> at<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:49.620> is

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
remember look at this this is at this is

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:56.060 
remember look at this this is at this is
sending<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.570> signal<00:02:52.460> all<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:53.760> way<00:02:54.830> down<00:02:55.830> to

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
sending the signal all the way down to

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.400 
sending the signal all the way down to
here<00:02:57.650> so<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:59.010> has<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.220> send<00:03:00.210> it<00:03:00.330> over<00:03:00.570> here<00:03:00.840> has

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
here so it has to send it over here has

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.400 
here so it has to send it over here has
to<00:03:01.590> go<00:03:01.770> through<00:03:02.010> all<00:03:02.070> this<00:03:02.250> logic<00:03:03.410> which

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
to go through all this logic which

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.540 
to go through all this logic which
whilst<00:03:04.740> and<00:03:05.100> commercial<00:03:05.520> show<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:07.550> compared

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
whilst and commercial show is compared

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.530 
whilst and commercial show is compared
to<00:03:08.970> my<00:03:09.180> own<00:03:09.930> memory<00:03:10.710> units<00:03:11.130> I'm<00:03:11.670> not<00:03:11.940> using<00:03:12.240> a

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
to my own memory units I'm not using a

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.270 
to my own memory units I'm not using a
vertical<00:03:13.050> RS<00:03:14.270> more<00:03:15.270> lunch<00:03:15.570> I'm<00:03:16.410> in<00:03:16.560> fact<00:03:16.890> using

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
vertical RS more lunch I'm in fact using

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.680 
vertical RS more lunch I'm in fact using
a<00:03:17.640> horizontal<00:03:18.630> one<00:03:19.430> as<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.610> kind<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.030> experiment

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
a horizontal one as a kind of experiment

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.200 
a horizontal one as a kind of experiment
and<00:03:21.870> it's<00:03:22.020> it's<00:03:22.650> working<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.370> lot<00:03:23.640> better<00:03:23.970> than

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
and it's it's working a lot better than

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:32.180 
and it's it's working a lot better than
I<00:03:24.300> expected<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:25.490> so<00:03:27.380> anyway<00:03:29.630> ok<00:03:30.680> back<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.710> here

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
I expected to so anyway ok back to here

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.820 
I expected to so anyway ok back to here
so<00:03:33.290> now<00:03:34.290> I'll<00:03:34.620> show<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.920> an<00:03:35.190> example<00:03:35.820> of

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
so now I'll show you an example of

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:43.640 
so now I'll show you an example of
working<00:03:37.830> from<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:39.110> first<00:03:41.450> module<00:03:42.450> or<00:03:42.990> the

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
working from the first module or the

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:51.080 
working from the first module or the
first<00:03:43.890> bite<00:03:44.130> or<00:03:44.640> yeah<00:03:45.600> so<00:03:46.440> okay<00:03:47.210> so<00:03:49.820> as<00:03:50.820> you<00:03:50.940> can

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
first bite or yeah so okay so as you can

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.309 
first bite or yeah so okay so as you can
see

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:06.460 

it<00:03:58.690> changed<00:03:59.690> numbers<00:04:00.110> so<00:04:01.510> you<00:04:02.510> can<00:04:03.010> work<00:04:04.010> a<00:04:05.470> big

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
it changed numbers so you can work a big

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:15.130 
it changed numbers so you can work a big

but ok let's go here alright so we've
got<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.020> top<00:04:27.290> end<00:04:27.590> gate<00:04:27.860> which<00:04:28.760> is<00:04:29.290> powering

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
got the top end gate which is powering

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.750 
got the top end gate which is powering
all<00:04:31.760> we've<00:04:32.330> got<00:04:32.950> and<00:04:33.950> put<00:04:34.130> one<00:04:34.310> at<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.729> end

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
all we've got and put one at the end

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.980 
all we've got and put one at the end

input of 10 what the RS / this RS latch

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:04.810 
input of 10 what the RS / this RS latch
also<00:04:56.660> has<00:04:56.979> as<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:03.470> other<00:05:03.710> I'm<00:05:04.039> in<00:05:04.250> the<00:05:04.400> reset

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
also has as the other I'm in the reset

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.310 
also has as the other I'm in the reset
is<00:05:05.500> the<00:05:06.500> slime<00:05:06.830> here<00:05:07.250> and<00:05:07.600> has<00:05:08.600> a<00:05:08.660> torch<00:05:09.110> in

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
is the slime here and has a torch in

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.150 
is the slime here and has a torch in
there<00:05:09.650> which<00:05:10.479> when<00:05:11.479> risk<00:05:11.780> then<00:05:12.289> the<00:05:12.440> reset<00:05:13.039> is

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
there which when risk then the reset is

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.790 
there which when risk then the reset is
activated<00:05:13.820> it<00:05:14.000> how's<00:05:14.479> the<00:05:14.900> opposite<00:05:15.380> end<00:05:15.590> of

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
activated it how's the opposite end of

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.840 
activated it how's the opposite end of
the<00:05:16.250> area<00:05:16.669> /<00:05:17.950> now<00:05:18.950> we<00:05:19.010> come<00:05:19.310> down<00:05:19.520> to<00:05:19.729> the

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
the area / now we come down to the

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.290 
the area / now we come down to the
output<00:05:20.360> the<00:05:21.350> output<00:05:21.430> layer<00:05:22.430> is<00:05:22.880> along<00:05:23.150> the

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
output the output layer is along the

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.200 
output the output layer is along the
bottom<00:05:23.510> here<00:05:23.690> and<00:05:24.370> a<00:05:26.050> head<00:05:27.760> is<00:05:28.760> probably<00:05:29.120> a

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
bottom here and a head is probably a

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.360 
bottom here and a head is probably a
better<00:05:29.330> way<00:05:29.539> to<00:05:29.600> do<00:05:29.780> this<00:05:29.810> but<00:05:30.229> I<00:05:30.470> just<00:05:30.919> live

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
better way to do this but I just live

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.760 
better way to do this but I just live
with<00:05:31.400> repeaters<00:05:31.940> as<00:05:32.500> it<00:05:34.300> I'm<00:05:35.350> having<00:05:36.350> problems

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
with repeaters as it I'm having problems

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.640 
with repeaters as it I'm having problems
with<00:05:37.039> these<00:05:37.250> blocks<00:05:37.610> here<00:05:37.910> powering<00:05:41.650> powering

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
with these blocks here powering powering

it that like now okay yeah anyway
there's<00:05:53.960> a<00:05:54.050> end<00:05:54.440> gate<00:05:55.070> here<00:05:55.669> input<00:05:55.970> 1<00:05:56.419> and<00:05:58.510> then

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
there's a end gate here input 1 and then

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.980 
there's a end gate here input 1 and then
put<00:05:59.750> 2<00:05:59.960> is<00:06:00.020> coming<00:06:00.350> off<00:06:00.680> of<00:06:01.450> this<00:06:02.450> here
