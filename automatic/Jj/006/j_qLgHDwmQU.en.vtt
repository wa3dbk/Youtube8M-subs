00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.120
 welcome to a new demovic tutorial to the net point in this case we are going to 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.820
 explain how to release a blackberry 85 20 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:12.909
 in this case of this by width we have already freed it from 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.089
 of vodafone here we are looking for how to lead the worst years 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:20.829
 There are two blackberry's of similar instructions 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:24.669
 in this case to release the abl agÃ¼erri 85 20 we have to go ja 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.890
 the menu 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.929
 options 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.020
 Advanced Options 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.400
 and now sim card as we see the screen appears blank 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.400
 we must activate a cult menu for that 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.250
 we have to mark the letters 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.250
 that does not appear on the screen but you have to follow them by checking 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.460
 and when I checked the b automatically, it did not hide 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.770
 as we see 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.560
 the second active PT category you have to disable the 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.690
 by dialing the release code for it we must mark again n de madrid 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.710
 in Spain p from Pamplona 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.830
 and now the 2 more we keep pressed the high press the 2 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.390
 ends no longer requests to write rees merck code 10 attempts 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.580
 let's proceed to mark the code in this case is 5 3 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.100
 6 9 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.240
 8 1 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.900
 5 9 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.810
 6 6 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.840
 1 4 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.840
 8 2 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.530
 3 7 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.500
 the central block block villa already puts us code accepted and as you can see the network 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.580
 ega game deactivated 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.420
 from that moment you can percent use it yours show the 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.290
 count on any operator 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.070
 and if you want to use blackberry email services something 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.490
 important you must call the new operator to change the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.190
 incoming blackberry mail server 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.800
