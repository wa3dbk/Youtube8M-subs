00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:33.859 
that site but yet it's still near the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:35.319 
that site but yet it's still near the
top<00:01:34.130> there<00:01:34.340> but<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.549> other<00:01:34.639> day<00:01:34.850> I<00:01:34.880> had<00:01:35.119> it

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
top there but the other day I had it

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.029 
top there but the other day I had it
differently<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:36.289> I'm<00:01:36.439> gonna<00:01:36.649> have<00:01:36.770> to<00:01:36.859> put

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
differently so I'm gonna have to put

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:38.950 
differently so I'm gonna have to put
some<00:01:37.219> support<00:01:37.639> under<00:01:37.880> that<00:01:37.999> side<00:01:38.329> I<00:01:38.359> think<00:01:38.509> I

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
some support under that side I think I

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.899 
some support under that side I think I
think<00:01:39.889> actually<00:01:40.159> it's<00:01:40.460> gonna<00:01:40.549> have<00:01:40.759> to<00:01:40.819> be

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
think actually it's gonna have to be

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.980 
think actually it's gonna have to be
lift<00:01:41.210> to<00:01:41.359> do<00:01:41.509> and<00:01:43.060> some<00:01:44.060> support<00:01:44.509> put<00:01:44.749> on<00:01:44.840> that

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
lift to do and some support put on that

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.419 
lift to do and some support put on that
side<00:01:45.259> to<00:01:45.439> lift<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.740> up<00:01:45.829> I<00:01:45.979> think<00:01:46.130> that's<00:01:46.280> where

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
side to lift it up I think that's where

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.580 
side to lift it up I think that's where
the<00:01:46.549> problem<00:01:46.999> lies<00:01:48.249> so<00:01:49.659> yep<00:01:50.659> it's<00:01:51.289> looking

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
the problem lies so yep it's looking

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.879 
the problem lies so yep it's looking
good

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:51.889
