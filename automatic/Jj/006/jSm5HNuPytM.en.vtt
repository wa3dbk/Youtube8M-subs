00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
a knife fight she just that's the way it

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.020 
a knife fight she just that's the way it
seems<00:04:29.320> in<00:04:29.470> this<00:04:29.590> game<00:04:29.800> everybody<00:04:30.520> just<00:04:30.730> nice

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
seems in this game everybody just nice

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.090 
seems in this game everybody just nice
because<00:04:31.480> it's<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:32.440> only<00:04:32.470> thing<00:04:32.680> this<00:04:32.830> game

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
because it's the only thing this game

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.350 
because it's the only thing this game
that's<00:04:33.340> an<00:04:33.460> insta-kill<00:04:33.730> which<00:04:34.120> is<00:04:34.210> why<00:04:34.300> I

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
that's an insta-kill which is why I

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.820 
that's an insta-kill which is why I
think<00:04:34.450> it's<00:04:34.600> overpowered<00:04:37.620> they<00:04:38.620> should<00:04:38.800> make

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
think it's overpowered they should make

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.250 
think it's overpowered they should make
it<00:04:38.950> so<00:04:39.160> it<00:04:39.250> takes<00:04:39.400> a<00:04:39.520> lot<00:04:39.670> longer<00:04:39.820> because

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
it so it takes a lot longer because

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.420 
it so it takes a lot longer because
seriously<00:04:41.260> how<00:04:41.590> could<00:04:41.770> he<00:04:41.830> be<00:04:41.860> running<00:04:42.310> and

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
seriously how could he be running and

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.280 
seriously how could he be running and
then<00:04:42.490> somehow<00:04:42.850> just<00:04:43.240> pull<00:04:43.510> out<00:04:43.540> a<00:04:43.660> knife<00:04:43.930> when

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
then somehow just pull out a knife when

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.130 
then somehow just pull out a knife when
you're<00:04:44.470> holding<00:04:44.740> I<00:04:44.800> do<00:04:44.860> a<00:04:44.920> gun<00:04:45.160> with<00:04:45.310> two<00:04:45.340> hands

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
you're holding I do a gun with two hands

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.330

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
pulled a knife instantly and just

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.740 
pulled a knife instantly and just
