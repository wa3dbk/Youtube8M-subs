00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
water and sometimes I forget and then

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.370 
water and sometimes I forget and then
you<00:00:57.940> have<00:00:58.090> to<00:00:58.239> catch<00:00:58.420> up<00:00:58.630> like<00:00:58.930> later<00:00:59.110> in<00:00:59.290> the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.200 
you have to catch up like later in the
day<00:00:59.530> I<00:00:59.560> go<00:00:59.800> I<00:01:00.040> didn't<00:01:00.460> drink<00:01:00.579> my<00:01:00.760> water<00:01:00.880> today

a great cleanse and it also makes it a

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.899 
a great cleanse and it also makes it a
little<00:01:06.009> bit<00:01:06.189> easier<00:01:06.340> if<00:01:06.670> you're<00:01:06.790> not
