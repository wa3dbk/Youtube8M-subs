00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.000
 Although it is about a nude tutorial I 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.610
 Always show this nanny 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.740
 Frank does that and I have zebra here 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.279
 look and 1 x leopard misfortune are 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.840
 really two very simple nails 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.400
 tutorials that also want their time 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.890
 and Mainz exists remains is 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.869
 go ahead have fun 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.640
 that needed to this tutorial and indeed 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.140
 if you still have nail polish on it 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.969
 nails have removed were quite 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.070
 just as always with cotton pads and 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.540
 nail polish remover then of course still 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.969
 nail polish I have one now 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.620
 white a black and a pink 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.750
 a blue picked and last but not least 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.820
 Do we still need a doping tool this 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.680
 here is now scarce by essens euro 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.879
 If it was not at home, it could be too 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.629
 quite easy to get a toothpick 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.550
 to grab 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.260
 and now we 're off 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.149
 First of all, I start with the first 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.149
 Layer of white nail polish 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.060
 if then the first layer of white 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.979
 Nail polish is dried after it 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.909
 like that so i still have a second one 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.010
 shift over 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.870
 simply because that knows that nice 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:39.070
 comes to light and the nail polish 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.979
 really covering is so we start with 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.690
 the first animal print and indeed found 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.640
 I with the c block on 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.340
 here I use the black one 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.040
 nail polish and I hope with you 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.080
 the nail polish on the cover of a traffic light 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.910
 nail polish There is no mess and me 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.539
 It can be very easy for you afterwards 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.160
 remove with nail polish again 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.080
 then you take your doping pool and 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.850
 Here he uses the little ball 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.740
 the small side thin side as well 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.670
 always and goes into the black 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.399
 nail polish 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.470
 then he pulls on one easily 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.840
 wavy black lines on one 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.870
 nail and yes that was it 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.870
 beautiful 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.140
 and so you go with all your eagle 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.140
 ford until all are done 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.800
 it continues with the leopard 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.930
 print here you can change the color of 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.239
 colors and the number of colors themselves 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.250
 decide if he takes a color 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.610
 you raised to two colors or too 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.140
 three colors as you just volt and 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.150
 You can also just take it 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.060
 nail polish to hand and dab one 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.530
 swab I say now on the nail 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.360
 on it and that makes the vine too 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.120
 you want a lot of pressure from the plant 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.500
 is full or pipapo is yours completely 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.500
 let alone and yes 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.090
 when you finish all your nails 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.590
 you just wait 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.810
 bit and leave the whole nice 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.670
 dry if the swabs or dabs 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.860
 however he calls it dried 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.680
 are you taking your doping or doing 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.829
 a toothpick at hand and we the 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.319
 black nail polish color now party 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.200
 again just as before take away 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.640
 your toothpick or doping too 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.549
 live.de in the black nail polish and 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.560
 surrounds your blobs in the form of 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.750
 Semicircles so everyone gets clicks 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.389
 framed by two semicircles themselves 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.010
 but do not close and that just makes 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.010
 this leoprint outside 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.430
 and between the blobs 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.970
 Of course she also has a few small ones 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.710
 Gaps 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.320
 you can if you still want to 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.580
 fill a few individual semicircles 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.740
 You do not have to do that if you are 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.820
 that does not want but I think that works 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.200
 then everything a little bit more 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.200

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.750
 what we are now with all the 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.680
 whole nails and then you are too 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.680
 almost done 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.110
 and all around the last artwork 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.960
 To seal , so to speak , we use 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.390
 a top coat or a clear coat and 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.920
 again over please please take care of that 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.600
 your nails are really dry 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.480
 otherwise there is a malheur and you 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.430

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.840
 So wait for all of you on your nails 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.840

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.540

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.670
