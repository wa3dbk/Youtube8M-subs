to<00:02:00.530> stop<00:02:00.800> the<00:02:01.009> uppercut<00:02:01.580> or<00:02:01.759> throw<00:02:02.090> in<00:02:02.149> this

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
to stop the uppercut or throw in this

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.590 
to stop the uppercut or throw in this
Lobby<00:02:03.100> all<00:02:04.100> right<00:02:04.369> on<00:02:04.520> if<00:02:04.819> they<00:02:05.000> uppercut<00:02:05.479> you

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
Lobby all right on if they uppercut you

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.870 
Lobby all right on if they uppercut you
end<00:02:05.750> up<00:02:05.869> focusing<00:02:06.050> and<00:02:06.560> back<00:02:06.679> dashing<00:02:07.220> if<00:02:07.670> they

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
end up focusing and back dashing if they

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.400 
end up focusing and back dashing if they
throw<00:02:08.060> if<00:02:08.270> you<00:02:08.420> throw<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:08.720> actually<00:02:09.229> catch

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
throw if you throw and actually catch

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.650 
throw if you throw and actually catch
them<00:02:09.649> they'll<00:02:09.800> end<00:02:10.039> up<00:02:10.130> checking<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:11.209> if<00:02:11.569> you

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
them they'll end up checking and if you

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.420 
them they'll end up checking and if you
try<00:02:11.810> a<00:02:11.840> meaty<00:02:12.110> they<00:02:12.350> just<00:02:12.560> end<00:02:12.709> up<00:02:12.830> focusing<00:02:13.010> in

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
try a meaty they just end up focusing in

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.260 
try a meaty they just end up focusing in
back<00:02:13.580> dashing<00:02:14.000> through<00:02:14.209> its<00:02:14.390> yep

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.680 

so<00:02:19.270> here<00:02:19.420> we<00:02:19.450> go<00:02:19.540> back<00:02:20.170> Vince<00:02:20.410> bean<00:02:20.680> oh<00:02:21.690> right

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690
