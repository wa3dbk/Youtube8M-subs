newer two-stroke engines have a little
primer<00:00:16.830> bowl<00:00:17.300> some<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.390> them<00:00:18.510> do<00:00:18.720> not<00:00:18.750> but<00:00:19.350> this

primer bowl some of them do not but this
one<00:00:19.800> does<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.840> common<00:00:21.840> problem<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.380> when<00:00:22.619> they

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
one does and common problem is when they

one does and common problem is when they
age<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.930> fuel<00:00:25.170> bowl<00:00:26.480> cracks<00:00:27.480> as<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.140> see

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
age the the fuel bowl cracks as you see

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.710 
age the the fuel bowl cracks as you see
there's<00:00:29.340> nothing<00:00:29.519> left<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> bottom<00:00:30.630> of

this thing

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.410 
this thing
it's<00:00:32.160> totally<00:00:32.579> eating<00:00:32.880> out<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.780> ethanol<00:00:34.350> fuel

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
it's totally eating out the ethanol fuel

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.670 
it's totally eating out the ethanol fuel
definitely<00:00:36.420> shortens<00:00:36.840> life<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.260> these<00:00:37.380> things

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
definitely shortens life in these things

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.580 
definitely shortens life in these things
but<00:00:38.070> luckily<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.390> replace<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.320> really

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
but luckily to replace it it's really

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.459 
but luckily to replace it it's really
using<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.010> part<00:00:41.309> by<00:00:41.610> less<00:00:41.969> than<00:00:42.469> sometimes

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469

this<00:01:12.150> particular<00:01:12.710> Husqvarna<00:01:15.350> backpack

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
this particular Husqvarna backpack

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.440 
this particular Husqvarna backpack
blower<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.189> little<00:01:17.430> bit<00:01:17.549> tricky<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.150> get

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
blower it's a little bit tricky to get

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.359 
blower it's a little bit tricky to get
to<00:01:18.600> those<00:01:18.750> screws<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.590> it's<00:01:19.710> using<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.100> right

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
to those screws so it's using a right

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.240 
to those screws so it's using a right
angle<00:01:20.930> screwdriver<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.009> looked

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
angle screwdriver but I looked

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.820 
angle screwdriver but I looked
underneath<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:24.229> apparently<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.290> gas<00:01:25.530> tank

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
underneath it apparently the gas tank

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.850 
underneath it apparently the gas tank
comes<00:01:26.040> out<00:01:26.220> pretty<00:01:26.340> easy<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.860> guest:i

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
comes out pretty easy so that guest:i

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.890 
comes out pretty easy so that guest:i

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
I have a number three on a ratchet

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.720 
I have a number three on a ratchet
socket<00:01:43.290> comes<00:01:43.620> right<00:01:43.860> out<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.190> a<00:01:44.220> real<00:01:44.490> great

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
socket comes right out is a real great

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.940 
socket comes right out is a real great
to<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:45.080> she<00:01:46.080> really<00:01:46.320> get<00:01:46.470> those<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.860> all

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
to have she really get those in all

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.360 
to have she really get those in all
sizes<00:01:47.190> for<00:01:47.790> anything<00:01:48.330> stuck<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.130> leverage<00:01:50.130> is

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
sizes for anything stuck and leverage is

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.600 
sizes for anything stuck and leverage is
way<00:01:50.520> better<00:01:50.760> than<00:01:51.150> using<00:01:51.300> a<00:01:51.570> screwdriver

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
way better than using a screwdriver

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.930 
way better than using a screwdriver
definitely<00:01:53.610> what<00:01:53.700> strip<00:01:53.970> screw<00:01:54.360> but<00:01:55.880> now<00:01:56.880> we

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
definitely what strip screw but now we

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.160 
definitely what strip screw but now we
have<00:01:57.150> access<00:01:57.600> look<00:01:57.900> at<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:59.930> once<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.020> get

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
have access look at that once you get

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.830 
have access look at that once you get
the<00:02:01.290> four<00:02:01.470> screws<00:02:01.830> out<00:02:02.120> this<00:02:03.120> place<00:02:03.540> it's

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
the four screws out this place it's

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.110 
the four screws out this place it's
going<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.080> be<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> little<00:02:04.380> stuck<00:02:04.850> take<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.880> little

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
going to be a little stuck take a little

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.930 
going to be a little stuck take a little
screw<00:02:06.360> job<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.870> work<00:02:07.080> it<00:02:07.670> won't<00:02:08.670> come<00:02:08.850> off

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
screw job and work it won't come off

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.880 
screw job and work it won't come off
that<00:02:09.000> easy<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:09.810> we<00:02:10.050> stuck<00:02:10.259> on<00:02:10.470> pretty<00:02:10.709> good

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
that easy but we stuck on pretty good

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.460 
that easy but we stuck on pretty good
because<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.580> actually<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.810> fuel<00:02:13.050> little

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
because that actually the fuel little

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.580 
because that actually the fuel little
bulb<00:02:14.400> sack<00:02:15.360> knee<00:02:15.570> has<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.690> sealing<00:02:16.170> surface

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
bulb sack knee has a sealing surface

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.650 
bulb sack knee has a sealing surface
around<00:02:16.920> here<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:17.940> it's<00:02:18.090> going<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.300> be<00:02:18.360> stuck

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
around here so it's going to be stuck
