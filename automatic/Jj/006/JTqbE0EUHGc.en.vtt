00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.140 

I<00:00:08.440> now<00:00:09.440> show<00:00:09.740> you<00:00:09.800> how<00:00:10.130> to<00:00:10.190> do<00:00:10.460> how<00:00:10.850> to<00:00:10.880> use<00:00:11.120> a

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
I now show you how to do how to use a

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.430 
I now show you how to do how to use a
jigsaw<00:00:13.090> you<00:00:14.090> want<00:00:14.299> as<00:00:14.510> little<00:00:14.690> overhang<00:00:15.289> as

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
jigsaw you want as little overhang as

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.680 
jigsaw you want as little overhang as
possible<00:00:15.980> there's<00:00:16.309> the<00:00:16.460> table<00:00:16.850> so<00:00:17.180> get<00:00:17.420> nice

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
possible there's the table so get nice

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.840 
possible there's the table so get nice
and<00:00:17.720> close<00:00:18.110> without<00:00:18.410> cutting<00:00:18.800> the<00:00:18.949> table<00:00:19.310> that

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
and close without cutting the table that

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.150 
and close without cutting the table that
way<00:00:19.970> you<00:00:20.029> don't<00:00:20.270> have<00:00:20.359> flapping<00:00:21.199> so<00:00:22.039> when

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
way you don't have flapping so when

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.140 
way you don't have flapping so when
you're<00:00:22.250> cutting<00:00:22.460> you're<00:00:22.699> holding<00:00:23.060> it<00:00:23.120> down

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
you're cutting you're holding it down

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.980 
you're cutting you're holding it down
and<00:00:24.050> then<00:00:24.440> this<00:00:24.920> is<00:00:25.070> a<00:00:25.100> test<00:00:25.430> piece<00:00:25.580> we<00:00:25.790> got

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
and then this is a test piece we got

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.470 
and then this is a test piece we got
there's<00:00:26.990> an<00:00:27.140> outside<00:00:27.500> curve<00:00:28.060> and<00:00:29.060> inside

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
there's an outside curve and inside

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.430 
there's an outside curve and inside
square<00:00:30.880> an<00:00:31.880> inside<00:00:32.300> curve<00:00:33.100> and<00:00:35.079> this<00:00:36.079> side

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
square an inside curve and this side

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.309 
square an inside curve and this side
will<00:00:36.860> be<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:37.129> finished<00:00:37.489> piece<00:00:37.760> so<00:00:38.750> this<00:00:39.050> side

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:39.319 
will be the finished piece so this side

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:42.340 
will be the finished piece so this side
is<00:00:39.649> the<00:00:39.949> cut<00:00:40.190> piece<00:00:40.809> we're<00:00:41.809> going<00:00:41.899> to<00:00:41.960> do<00:00:42.140> that

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
is the cut piece we're going to do that

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.500 
is the cut piece we're going to do that
is<00:00:42.739> when<00:00:43.640> you're<00:00:43.760> going<00:00:43.909> around<00:00:44.030> a<00:00:44.269> curve

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
is when you're going around a curve

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.380 
is when you're going around a curve
sometimes<00:00:45.469> the<00:00:45.679> blade<00:00:45.920> is<00:00:46.129> too<00:00:46.309> thick<00:00:46.579> to<00:00:46.819> do

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
sometimes the blade is too thick to do

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.840 
sometimes the blade is too thick to do
that<00:00:47.569> tight<00:00:47.809> of<00:00:47.839> a<00:00:48.019> turn<00:00:48.289> so<00:00:49.219> you<00:00:49.309> go<00:00:49.550> a<00:00:49.579> little

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
that tight of a turn so you go a little

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.389 
that tight of a turn so you go a little
bit<00:00:50.120> and<00:00:50.269> if<00:00:50.569> it<00:00:50.690> starts<00:00:50.989> walking<00:00:51.260> off<00:00:51.620> back<00:00:52.100> up

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
bit and if it starts walking off back up

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.790 
bit and if it starts walking off back up
and<00:00:52.639> you<00:00:52.699> bite<00:00:52.999> into<00:00:53.239> it<00:00:53.389> again<00:00:53.749> and<00:00:54.559> when<00:00:54.710> you

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
and you bite into it again and when you

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.009 
and you bite into it again and when you
do<00:00:54.920> an<00:00:55.039> inside<00:00:55.429> turns<00:00:55.729> the<00:00:56.569> way<00:00:56.690> to<00:00:56.749> do<00:00:56.899> an

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
do an inside turns the way to do an

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:58.599 
do an inside turns the way to do an
inside<00:00:57.319> turn<00:00:57.499> is<00:00:57.679> to<00:00:57.829> come<00:00:58.010> right<00:00:58.190> into<00:00:58.399> the

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
inside turn is to come right into the

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.640 
inside turn is to come right into the
corner<00:00:59.030> and<00:00:59.350> cut<00:01:00.350> like<00:01:00.559> that<00:01:00.739> to<00:01:01.069> the<00:01:01.190> corner

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
corner and cut like that to the corner

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.630 
corner and cut like that to the corner
then<00:01:03.280> when<00:01:03.580> you<00:01:03.670> come<00:01:03.940> from<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.300> other<00:01:04.480> way

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
then when you come from the other way

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.790 
then when you come from the other way
you<00:01:06.640> bite<00:01:06.880> into<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.300> other<00:01:07.450> corner<00:01:07.810> this

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
you bite into the other corner this

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.830 
you bite into the other corner this
piece<00:01:09.040> will<00:01:09.190> fall<00:01:09.430> away<00:01:09.580> and<00:01:10.120> you'll<00:01:10.660> have<00:01:10.750> a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
piece will fall away and you'll have a

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.140 
piece will fall away and you'll have a
triangle<00:01:11.410> in<00:01:11.500> there<00:01:11.710> that<00:01:12.370> you<00:01:12.520> can<00:01:12.700> then<00:01:12.880> cut

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
triangle in there that you can then cut

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:41.620 
triangle in there that you can then cut
straight<00:01:13.480> across

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:03:01.130 

Oh

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.440 

that's<00:03:02.140> it<00:03:02.580> that's<00:03:03.580> how<00:03:03.820> you<00:03:03.880> doing<00:03:04.270> inside

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
that's it that's how you doing inside

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.130 
that's it that's how you doing inside
square<00:03:04.990> and<00:03:05.850> inside<00:03:06.850> and<00:03:07.000> outside<00:03:07.210> Kurtz<00:03:07.780> I

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
square and inside and outside Kurtz I

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.340 
square and inside and outside Kurtz I
suggest<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.130> do<00:03:09.400> this<00:03:09.610> because<00:03:09.850> every<00:03:10.350> blades

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
suggest you do this because every blades

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.130 
suggest you do this because every blades
different<00:03:12.040> every<00:03:12.820> saw<00:03:13.090> is<00:03:13.300> different<00:03:13.780> your

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
different every saw is different your

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.650 
different every saw is different your
materials<00:03:14.830> different<00:03:15.010> so<00:03:15.970> write<00:03:16.390> it<00:03:16.540> and

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
materials different so write it and

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.570 
materials different so write it and
screw<00:03:16.900> something<00:03:17.200> important<00:03:17.710> up<00:03:17.830> give

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
screw something important up give

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.060 
screw something important up give
yourself<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:18.970> little<00:03:19.000> tough<00:03:19.330> piece<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:22.540> he<00:03:23.070> has

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
yourself a little tough piece so he has

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.890 
yourself a little tough piece so he has
even<00:03:24.430> more<00:03:24.580> of<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.790> challenge<00:03:24.820> I<00:03:25.390> give<00:03:25.690> him<00:03:25.780> a

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
even more of a challenge I give him a

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.680 
even more of a challenge I give him a
tie<00:03:26.170> curve<00:03:26.590> so<00:03:27.250> he<00:03:27.430> will<00:03:27.580> not<00:03:27.790> be<00:03:27.820> able<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.330> keep

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
tie curve so he will not be able to keep

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.890 
tie curve so he will not be able to keep
this<00:03:28.930> curve<00:03:29.290> with<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.460> width<00:03:31.240> of<00:03:31.390> that<00:03:31.540> blade

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
this curve with the width of that blade

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.630 
this curve with the width of that blade
so<00:03:32.170> he's<00:03:32.290> going<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:32.500> have<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.650> back<00:03:32.980> out<00:03:33.250> and

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
so he's going to have to back out and

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.690 
so he's going to have to back out and
come<00:03:34.240> back<00:03:34.270> into<00:03:34.870> it<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:36.370> that's<00:03:36.610> what

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
come back into it and that's what

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.430 
come back into it and that's what
happened<00:03:37.180> with<00:03:37.300> that<00:03:37.510> another<00:03:37.990> thing<00:03:38.290> we're

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
happened with that another thing we're

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.370 
happened with that another thing we're
doing<00:03:38.470> is<00:03:38.980> because<00:03:39.670> every<00:03:40.570> manufacturer<00:03:41.290> is

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
doing is because every manufacturer is

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.130 
doing is because every manufacturer is
different<00:03:45.120> what<00:03:46.120> we're<00:03:46.270> testing<00:03:46.510> is<00:03:46.870> which

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
different what we're testing is which

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.530 
different what we're testing is which
side<00:03:47.410> we<00:03:47.710> should<00:03:47.890> cut<00:03:48.130> from<00:03:48.460> because<00:03:49.330> you<00:03:49.420> get

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
side we should cut from because you get

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.060 
side we should cut from because you get
tear<00:03:49.840> out<00:03:50.080> look<00:03:50.770> how<00:03:50.890> clean<00:03:51.220> that<00:03:51.250> is<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.920> look

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
tear out look how clean that is and look

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.450 
tear out look how clean that is and look
how<00:03:54.190> rough<00:03:54.490> that<00:03:54.730> is<00:03:55.560> so<00:03:56.560> we<00:03:56.770> practicing

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
how rough that is so we practicing

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.480 
how rough that is so we practicing
cotton<00:03:57.850> from<00:03:58.000> both<00:03:58.240> sides<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:59.650> see<00:03:59.890> which<00:04:00.130> way

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
cotton from both sides to see which way

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.020 
cotton from both sides to see which way
we're<00:04:00.700> going<00:04:00.730> to<00:04:00.940> approach<00:04:01.240> this

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.990 

okay<00:04:05.870> so<00:04:05.930> once<00:04:06.230> you're<00:04:06.410> confident<00:04:07.000> doing

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
okay so once you're confident doing

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.400 
okay so once you're confident doing
tight<00:04:08.390> radiuses<00:04:09.310> inside<00:04:10.310> squares<00:04:11.200> next<00:04:12.200> step

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
tight radiuses inside squares next step

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.500 
tight radiuses inside squares next step
is<00:04:12.650> straight<00:04:13.250> cuts<00:04:13.900> so<00:04:14.900> we<00:04:14.990> got<00:04:15.140> a<00:04:15.170> square

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
is straight cuts so we got a square

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.099 
is straight cuts so we got a square
wheel<00:04:17.510> line<00:04:17.870> going<00:04:18.169> down<00:04:18.230> the<00:04:18.500> length<00:04:20.109> the

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
wheel line going down the length the

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.930 
wheel line going down the length the
trick<00:04:21.380> with<00:04:21.530> this<00:04:21.709> is<00:04:21.950> to<00:04:22.100> position<00:04:22.370> yourself

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
trick with this is to position yourself

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.450 
trick with this is to position yourself
we<00:04:23.060> can<00:04:23.240> actually<00:04:23.510> see<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.110> saw<00:04:24.440> blade<00:04:24.860> going

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
we can actually see the saw blade going

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.550 
we can actually see the saw blade going
in<00:04:25.669> this<00:04:26.389> is<00:04:26.540> a<00:04:26.570> finished<00:04:26.990> cutting<00:04:27.260> out<00:04:27.470> of

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
in this is a finished cutting out of

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.379 
in this is a finished cutting out of
roughing<00:04:27.919> cut<00:04:28.130> so<00:04:28.310> that'll<00:04:28.669> be<00:04:28.760> nice<00:04:29.120> and

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
roughing cut so that'll be nice and

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.300 
roughing cut so that'll be nice and
straight<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:29.660> smooth<00:04:30.110> so<00:04:30.380> else<00:04:30.650> can<00:04:30.830> walk<00:04:31.040> off

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
straight and smooth so else can walk off

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.140 
straight and smooth so else can walk off
on<00:04:31.340> you<00:04:32.410> another<00:04:33.410> thing<00:04:33.650> to<00:04:33.680> do<00:04:33.950> is<00:04:34.250> when

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
on you another thing to do is when

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.190 
on you another thing to do is when
you're<00:04:35.389> cutting<00:04:36.290> this<00:04:36.590> long<00:04:38.050> don't<00:04:39.050> want

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
you're cutting this long don't want

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.720 
you're cutting this long don't want
cutting<00:04:39.470> your<00:04:39.530> table<00:04:39.980> so<00:04:40.400> you<00:04:40.460> want<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.700> be

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
cutting your table so you want to be

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.880 
cutting your table so you want to be
hanging<00:04:41.210> off<00:04:41.419> far<00:04:41.660> enough<00:04:41.690> to<00:04:41.960> do<00:04:42.080> that<00:04:42.110> but

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
hanging off far enough to do that but

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.090 
hanging off far enough to do that but
when<00:04:43.850> you<00:04:43.940> get<00:04:44.090> to<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.360> other<00:04:44.570> end<00:04:44.800> it's<00:04:45.800> going

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
when you get to the other end it's going

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.100 
when you get to the other end it's going
to<00:04:46.190> want<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.490> fall<00:04:46.700> down<00:04:46.730> on<00:04:46.970> you<00:04:47.300> and<00:04:47.419> snap<00:04:47.840> off

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
to want to fall down on you and snap off

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.000 
to want to fall down on you and snap off
and<00:04:48.380> ruin<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:48.830> end<00:04:49.040> so<00:04:49.730> when<00:04:49.850> you<00:04:49.910> get<00:04:50.060> to<00:04:50.240> that

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
and ruin the end so when you get to that

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
and ruin the end so when you get to that
you<00:04:52.010> position<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:53.140> line<00:04:54.520> back<00:04:55.520> over<00:04:55.940> the

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
you position the line back over the

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.650 
you position the line back over the
table<00:04:56.479> at<00:04:56.660> an<00:04:56.810> angle<00:04:57.260> so<00:04:58.070> just<00:04:58.400> the<00:04:58.580> far<00:04:59.090> end<00:04:59.450> is

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
table at an angle so just the far end is

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.780 
table at an angle so just the far end is
hanging<00:05:00.050> off<00:05:00.200> and<00:05:00.470> that<00:05:00.590> way<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:00.950> entire<00:05:00.979> cut

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
hanging off and that way the entire cut

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.030 
hanging off and that way the entire cut
that<00:05:01.970> you've<00:05:02.210> just<00:05:02.479> done<00:05:02.750> is<00:05:03.380> being<00:05:03.650> supported

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
that you've just done is being supported

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.370 
that you've just done is being supported
by<00:05:04.250> the<00:05:04.430> table<00:05:04.970> and<00:05:05.330> just<00:05:05.540> that<00:05:05.720> little<00:05:05.900> bit<00:05:06.080> is

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
by the table and just that little bit is

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.070 
by the table and just that little bit is
hanging<00:05:06.770> off<00:05:06.889> and<00:05:07.190> it<00:05:07.520> won't<00:05:07.790> drop<00:05:08.389> off<00:05:08.660> on<00:05:08.900> you

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
hanging off and it won't drop off on you

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.909 
hanging off and it won't drop off on you
and<00:05:09.350> snap<00:05:09.860> that<00:05:10.100> last<00:05:10.400> piece<00:05:10.640> off<00:05:11.740> so<00:05:12.740> what<00:05:12.890> are

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
and snap that last piece off so what are

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.200 
and snap that last piece off so what are
you<00:05:13.040> doing<00:05:13.370> right<00:05:13.550> now<00:05:14.919> figuring<00:05:15.919> out<00:05:16.210> what

you doing right now figuring out what

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.590 
you doing right now figuring out what
the<00:05:17.240> prettiest<00:05:17.750> part<00:05:17.990> of<00:05:18.080> this<00:05:18.169> board<00:05:18.590> is<00:05:19.600> to

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
the prettiest part of this board is to

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.930 
the prettiest part of this board is to
cut<00:05:21.410> for<00:05:21.560> the<00:05:21.680> mountain<00:05:22.070> why<00:05:22.580> are<00:05:22.640> you<00:05:22.760> holding

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
cut for the mountain why are you holding

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.370 
cut for the mountain why are you holding
it<00:05:23.240> up<00:05:23.360> like<00:05:23.600> that<00:05:23.979> because<00:05:26.080> I'm<00:05:27.080> going<00:05:27.229> to<00:05:27.320> be

it up like that because I'm going to be

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.370 
it up like that because I'm going to be
cutting<00:05:27.650> on<00:05:27.890> the<00:05:27.919> back<00:05:28.190> why<00:05:29.060> I'm<00:05:29.990> cutting<00:05:30.260> on

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
cutting on the back why I'm cutting on

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.770 
cutting on the back why I'm cutting on
the<00:05:30.500> back<00:05:30.680> for<00:05:30.890> nice<00:05:31.100> it's<00:05:31.280> nice<00:05:31.669> yeah<00:05:32.479> you<00:05:32.539> get
