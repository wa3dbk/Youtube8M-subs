this<00:00:07.140> car<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.589> faster<00:00:07.980> than<00:00:08.099> what<00:00:08.910> most<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.179> you

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269

this car is faster than what most of you
guys<00:00:09.330> would<00:00:09.599> think<00:00:09.780> it<00:00:09.990> could<00:00:10.320> probably<00:00:10.530> get

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
guys would think it could probably get

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.700 
guys would think it could probably get
to<00:00:11.150> 210<00:00:12.150> miles<00:00:12.330> per<00:00:12.570> hour<00:00:12.660> that's<00:00:13.320> pretty<00:00:13.530> good

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
to 210 miles per hour that's pretty good

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.060 
to 210 miles per hour that's pretty good
for<00:00:13.769> this<00:00:14.009> type<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.190> car<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:15.030> mean<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:15.900> thought<00:00:16.350> it

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
for this type of car I mean I thought it

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.980 
for this type of car I mean I thought it
was<00:00:17.190> gonna<00:00:17.279> maybe<00:00:17.609> hit<00:00:17.880> 200<00:00:18.420> but<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.720> mean<00:00:18.900> it

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
was gonna maybe hit 200 but I mean it

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.290 
was gonna maybe hit 200 but I mean it
got<00:00:19.080> faster<00:00:19.289> than<00:00:19.619> when<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.740> thought<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:19.980> could

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
got faster than when I thought I could

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.740 
got faster than when I thought I could
but<00:00:21.300> that's<00:00:21.600> pretty<00:00:21.750> good<00:00:21.960> um<00:00:22.260> pretty<00:00:23.220> much

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
but that's pretty good um pretty much

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.880 
but that's pretty good um pretty much
what<00:00:24.750> did<00:00:24.840> i<00:00:24.930> do<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.109> know<00:00:25.470> there<00:00:25.650> was<00:00:25.680> something

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.099 
what did i do I know there was something
funky<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.550> had<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.820> do<00:00:26.939> with<00:00:27.210> as<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:28.019> see

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
funky I had to do with as you can see

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.250 
funky I had to do with as you can see
right<00:00:28.140> here<00:00:28.320> with<00:00:28.500> my<00:00:28.590> upgrading<00:00:29.099> arm<00:00:29.310> oh<00:00:30.260> yeah

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
right here with my upgrading arm oh yeah

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.010 
right here with my upgrading arm oh yeah
make<00:00:31.470> sure<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:32.239> replace<00:00:33.239> your<00:00:33.300> engine<00:00:33.809> with

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
make sure you replace your engine with

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.900 
make sure you replace your engine with
the<00:00:34.380> GTO<00:00:34.739> ang<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.190> that's<00:00:35.309> something<00:00:35.489> and

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.040 

honestly<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.239> think<00:00:39.450> that's<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.719> only<00:00:39.750> thing

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
honestly I think that's the only thing

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.420 
honestly I think that's the only thing
they<00:00:40.200> have<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.620> do<00:00:40.739> everything<00:00:41.010> else<00:00:41.309> just

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
they have to do everything else just

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.729 
they have to do everything else just

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
make sure you upgrade to race parts even

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.880 
make sure you upgrade to race parts even

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.229 
the transmission if you you want to
actually<00:00:47.010> upgrade<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.520> if<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.789> leave<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.090> with

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
actually upgrade it if you leave it with

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.920 
actually upgrade it if you leave it with
sports<00:00:48.870> transmission<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.980> won't<00:00:50.250> be<00:00:50.399> as<00:00:50.550> good

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930

um like I thought it look right here I
thought<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.250> wasn't<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.490> tap<00:01:41.670> out<00:01:42.619> honestly

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
thought it wasn't a tap out honestly

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.810 
thought it wasn't a tap out honestly
like<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.950> thought<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.280> was<00:01:44.369> just<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.700> to

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
like I thought it was just going to

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.090 
like I thought it was just going to
stalk<00:01:45.720> from<00:01:45.899> here<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.439> actually<00:01:46.619> kept

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
stalk from here but it actually kept

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.460 
stalk from here but it actually kept
going<00:01:47.490> which<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.909> was<00:01:48.119> really<00:01:48.840> really<00:01:49.020> amazed

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470
