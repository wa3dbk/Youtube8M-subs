00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.270
 how are you doing very well thank you very much 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.930
 a pleasure to be with you many 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.059
 highly demanded interviews was a 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.219
 slide where else where are you going where 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.440
 you took the two tournaments and I think that 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.230
 It was very important to be bad in the tournament 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.490
 local and also to be wrong in the 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.439
 concachampions 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.119
 also when we wanted to wake up I think 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.970
 that it was already late we played everything in the 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.380
 last game difficult for me visitor 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.259
 in costa rica after good at the end 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.610
 we are out and it is also a failure 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:35.380
 you put him we see how he got to go to 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.200
 that world virtually to win a 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.630
 place that you earned it, not because it was 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.730
 very well in the last tournament and in this 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.380
 tournament is not meeting expectations 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.330
 that everyone has about you clear 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.060
 yes as you also say it look like 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.560
 player not when she shows a one 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.440
 roof good people are always going to 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.300
 asking for more does not know what you are capable of and 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.790
 you can not stop doing this situation 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.920
 I'm telling you personally and I'm you 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.780
 Sincere I am a person that every day 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.910
 works to the maximum and that I try to give 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.010
 everything on the court does not discourage you 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.380
 done not have the chance to go to europe 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.020
 that you were looking for that maybe 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.119
 you lowered the performance in this tournament 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.299
 I believe that it is not an excuse nor is it 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.159
 Pretext is certainly something that's good 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.710
 it's been the first time they have two or 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.229
 three times that is the opportunity to 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.659
 saleh to europe and for one reason or another not 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.060
 it has been given as if for the 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.770
 club even tell you what I want as the 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.459
 place 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.170
 I can assure the club I 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:37.539
 he recognized as a footballer how to be 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.640
 human as a person and I have no doubt 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.490
 what do they know 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.920
 the quality that is here and especially the 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.960
 human being who is a person who comes 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.880
 to work from the first day trying 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.750
 of each day grow even more as 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.610
 person but good , and I cross it 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.740
 What's left behind is not the guy who 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.160
 he made mistakes I think he was left behind 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.080
 and now he thinks differently and suddenly 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.479
 that you get all the fame the money the 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.490
 to do things right you change the 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.679
 life and not anyone who gives it to you 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.950
 say I do not think it's a totally 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.020
 lie because it changes your life and of course 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.390
 and personally I accept it, it came to me 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.730
 happen 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.080
 and it was clear very quickly had the help 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.569
 greece god of my father's family 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.160

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.050

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.120
 moment that certainly affects everyone to 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.520
 all of mexico is not a big explanation 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.239

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.860
 descent and good without a doubt for all of us 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.690
