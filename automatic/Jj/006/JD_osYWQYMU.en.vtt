00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
contain game mode switch so as you can

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.770 
contain game mode switch so as you can
see<00:01:13.040> in<00:01:13.220> creative<00:01:13.730> and<00:01:13.910> there's<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:14.630> little

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
see in creative and there's a little

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.420 
see in creative and there's a little
thing<00:01:15.110> down<00:01:15.230> the<00:01:15.380> bottle<00:01:15.620> it<00:01:15.680> says<00:01:15.830> always<00:01:16.190> say

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
thing down the bottle it says always say

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.890 
thing down the bottle it says always say
it<00:01:16.550> looks<00:01:16.730> like<00:01:16.880> it's<00:01:17.270> a<00:01:17.420> switch<00:01:17.660> you<00:01:17.780> could

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
it looks like it's a switch you could

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.260 
it looks like it's a switch you could
turn<00:01:17.990> on<00:01:18.260> and<00:01:18.470> off<00:01:18.620> because<00:01:19.520> right<00:01:19.700> now<00:01:19.760> zero

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
turn on and off because right now zero

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.850 
turn on and off because right now zero
point<00:01:20.540> temprano<00:01:20.900> it's<00:01:21.140> really<00:01:21.470> annoying<00:01:21.740> when

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
point temprano it's really annoying when

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.010 
point temprano it's really annoying when
you're<00:01:22.070> building<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.610> creative<00:01:22.970> you<00:01:23.420> just<00:01:23.810> it

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
you're building and creative you just it

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.750 
you're building and creative you just it
just<00:01:24.320> turns<00:01:24.680> nighttime<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:25.430> then<00:01:25.550> you<00:01:25.610> had<00:01:25.700> to

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
just turns nighttime and then you had to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.670 
just turns nighttime and then you had to
use<00:01:25.970> torches<00:01:26.360> and<00:01:26.660> stuff<00:01:26.810> like<00:01:26.930> that<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.350> you

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
use torches and stuff like that so you

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.730 
use torches and stuff like that so you
can<00:01:27.770> see<00:01:28.040> what<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:28.370> hell<00:01:28.520> you're<00:01:28.730> building<00:01:29.740> so

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
can see what the hell you're building so

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.290 
can see what the hell you're building so
it<00:01:31.010> looks<00:01:31.250> like<00:01:31.430> it's<00:01:31.640> going<00:01:31.850> to<00:01:31.880> be<00:01:32.000> really

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
it looks like it's going to be really

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.360 
it looks like it's going to be really
awesome<00:01:32.600> this<00:01:33.470> feature<00:01:33.680> that<00:01:33.920> they're<00:01:34.070> adding

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
awesome this feature that they're adding

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.610 
awesome this feature that they're adding
which<00:01:34.850> allows<00:01:35.390> you<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.840> have<00:01:35.930> it<00:01:35.990> always<00:01:36.380> day

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
which allows you to have it always day

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.650 
which allows you to have it always day
when<00:01:36.860> you're<00:01:36.950> building<00:01:37.280> in<00:01:37.640> creative<00:01:38.120> and<00:01:38.270> it

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
when you're building in creative and it

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.330 
when you're building in creative and it
looks<00:01:38.870> like<00:01:38.960> for<00:01:39.260> survival<00:01:39.830> I<00:01:39.980> don't<00:01:40.160> think

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
looks like for survival I don't think

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.770 
looks like for survival I don't think
it's<00:01:40.430> going<00:01:40.520> to<00:01:40.580> be<00:01:40.640> an<00:01:40.760> option<00:01:40.940> because<00:01:41.240> for

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
it's going to be an option because for

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.530 
it's going to be an option because for
survival<00:01:42.230> you<00:01:42.350> must<00:01:42.590> have<00:01:42.800> night<00:01:43.270> cycle<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.450> a

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
survival you must have night cycle and a

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.240 
survival you must have night cycle and a
day<00:01:44.690> cycle<00:01:45.200> because<00:01:45.590> you<00:01:45.890> know<00:01:46.010> what's<00:01:46.190> the

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
day cycle because you know what's the

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.280 
day cycle because you know what's the
point<00:01:46.460> of<00:01:46.520> having<00:01:47.210> survival<00:01:47.870> if<00:01:47.990> you're<00:01:48.140> just

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
point of having survival if you're just

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.680 
point of having survival if you're just
going<00:01:48.470> to<00:01:48.560> have<00:01:48.590> always<00:01:49.040> day<00:01:49.310> on<00:01:49.490> so<00:01:50.030> I<00:01:50.450> think

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
going to have always day on so I think

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.870 
going to have always day on so I think
they're<00:01:51.050> thinking<00:01:51.620> of<00:01:51.800> whether<00:01:52.190> or<00:01:52.370> not<00:01:52.520> to<00:01:52.700> do

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
they're thinking of whether or not to do

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.920 
they're thinking of whether or not to do
that<00:01:53.030> but<00:01:53.180> i<00:01:53.240> think<00:01:53.330> it's<00:01:53.600> just<00:01:53.720> going<00:01:53.840> to<00:01:53.870> be

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
that but i think it's just going to be

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.170 
that but i think it's just going to be
for<00:01:54.170> creative<00:01:54.500> only<00:01:54.920> so<00:01:55.400> that<00:01:55.430> is<00:01:55.670> basically<00:01:55.700> a

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
for creative only so that is basically a

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.060 
for creative only so that is basically a
