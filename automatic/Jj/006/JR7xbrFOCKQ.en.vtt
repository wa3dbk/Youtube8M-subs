00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.560
 never sagging in the back 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.180
 gaming industry connoisseurs of the genre 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.280
 collectible card games 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.630
 thanks to diligence 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.940
 incredible popularity 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.040
 and where popularity is usually already there 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.920
 not up to the quality and the first who we 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.439
 of course, experts in quantity 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.930
 Chinese Koreans and other dregs from the east 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.060
 from that we can observe how the market 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.550
 just before the eyes of breeding different 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.699
 card projects where generally do not care what 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.019
 how to make the most important and as loud as possible 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.880
 advertise our next game 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.100
 partly from the same opera 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.110
 Chinese smacks here on every corner 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.719
 but at the same time the game is very controversial to call 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.350
 trash tongue does not turn up much 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.750
 tinsel 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.969
 yes again a lot of functions 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.910
 but it is well drawn enough 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.829
 I voiced qualitatively about music 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.780
 In general, you need to watch carefully which of 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.670
 all this turned out the channel filed 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.989
 presents a video review of the game deck 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.989
 heroes great battle 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.440
 company where already distinguished in the market 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.479
 a series of clash games dashing them 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.700
 card game knows only the most 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.259
 The main Chinese of his companies is his 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.479
 Chinese minions are smaller 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.850
 the essence of the other would like for the health and 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.649
 it happened what happened I do not want to talk 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.380
 bad about the game she in her own way 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.600
 cool she has good grades in the market in 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.640
 overall positive comments but after 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.100
 Hartstone looking for something more 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.170
 Serious of course close to beat 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.330
 impossible but to get a little closer 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.009
 at least slightly away from this Chinese 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.860
 know what i mean by word 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.440
 Chinese open any browser game 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.659
 and understand what I'm all sorts of 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.909
 brilliant rigmarole around some 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.190
 lottery gifts with everything sparkling 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.350
 flashing character though with a see European 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.569
 looks but anyway immediately understand 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.050
 that the Chinese drew them and everything in such 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.659
 the spirit 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.000
 no sense of style or composure 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.979
 did not pass this trouble and back here as 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.049
 eliminated the functions of the player 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.149
 thinking here needs a little more when 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.520
 compiling decks though which decks i 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.649
 I say so simply recruit soldiers and 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.660
 here is the automatism raised on top 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.610
 limit level push fight and 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.370
 enjoy what is happening on the field 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.379
 you can even speed it up in general 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.510
 this card game can be called at all 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.550
 with a stretch dragan just not steamed and 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.440
 just took the heroes and the same figures 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.410
 you get basically the same thing 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.209
 so like as the game is clearly nothing 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.459
 consider it in this inclusion 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.300
 itâ€™s wise to see a friend 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.430
 like a game with some rbg bias with this 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.950
 positions are more or less normal with us 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.319
 there are heroes each has different skills 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.780
 talents and a lot of opportunities for pumping 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.090
 and there are creature cards, too, each with 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.489
 their chips and gadgets and all 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.800
 these creatures are improved in their runes 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.140
 inserted and still held 1001 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.060
 manipulations about what I said at the beginning at 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.580
 Games of this type are most just and 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.739
 annoying start to the game when you immediately 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.990
 all this functionality is thrown away from it 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.180
 you can not for punishment 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.370
 learning in such games is usually not 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.740
 all because it is too superficial and 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.000
 fluently like this 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.310
 us automatically 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.470
 there is almost no sense to turn off automation 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.660
 at least a good half of the game is 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.120
 I'm talking about you and part, but go to the arena 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.820
 with stock creatures it is already akin 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.310
 insanity and recklessness main occupation 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.140
 here is the passage of the right side which 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.810
 does not shine nor the plot not 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.090
 realizations she here and house duel was 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.280
 where how much better implemented and indeed 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.500
 the game is like how and where better along the way 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.660
 passing potiha collect creatures 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.610
 better go already beat the muzzle on the arena 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.680
 to other players, of course, if it works out 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.900
 because donat is not an empty sound here and 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.820
 if he can pull it out 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.100
 pump cool guys uncle eg and 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.440
 beast though gaming methods it 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:50.700
 really so the visa card is not a panacea 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.980
 the biggest plus of this game is 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.110
 artistic implementation here are maps 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.750
 really drawn very cool 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.270
 no questions all with soul all with feeling 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.000
 push once become otherwise no this 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.300
 here and do not look here for an analogue duel or 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.020
 even cooler hearthstone is something else 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.540
 colorful funny 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.460
 but also on and I would give two estimates of this 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.950
 the game for which parts threes for 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.170
 artistic gameplay six but 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.420
 total will be 5 out of 7 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.100
 I hope you can play the game objectively 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.380
 but I would like a little big 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.190
 variability and opportunity requirements 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.280
 from player 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.260
 but it is too casual she sim all with 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.250
 you were kinat and see our other 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.250
