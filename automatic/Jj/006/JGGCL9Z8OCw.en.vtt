with the slit right behind the gill this

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.280 
with the slit right behind the gill this
little<00:00:19.830> thing<00:00:19.980> right<00:00:20.010> here

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.290 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:39.730 

that's<00:00:24.620> pretty<00:00:24.890> nice

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:39.740 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:46.260 

you

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.889 

hey<00:00:47.270> guys<00:00:47.450> I'm<00:00:47.809> Scott<00:00:49.270> Scotty<00:00:50.270> the<00:00:50.420> body<00:00:50.600> class

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
hey guys I'm Scott Scotty the body class

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.950 
hey guys I'm Scott Scotty the body class
case<00:00:51.320> you<00:00:51.440> didn't<00:00:51.710> know

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.650 

which<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.110> attempting<00:00:55.380> to<00:00:55.530> do<00:00:55.740> here<00:00:56.060> is<00:00:57.060> run<00:00:57.630> a

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
which is attempting to do here is run a

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.780 
which is attempting to do here is run a
long<00:00:58.050> spine<00:00:59.540> with<00:01:00.540> very<00:01:00.840> short<00:01:01.500> stabs<00:01:02.370> at

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
long spine with very short stabs at

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.210 
long spine with very short stabs at
first<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.500> reason<00:01:04.770> this<00:01:04.860> looks<00:01:05.100> like

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
first and the reason this looks like

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.290 
first and the reason this looks like
difficult<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.880> because<00:01:07.670> these<00:01:08.670> redfish<00:01:09.090> have

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
difficult is because these redfish have

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.120 
difficult is because these redfish have
big<00:01:09.780> scales<00:01:11.390> see<00:01:12.390> from<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.630> line<00:01:12.950> very<00:01:13.950> big

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
big scales see from this line very big

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.880 
big scales see from this line very big
scale<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:14.940> armor<00:01:15.440> so<00:01:16.440> you<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.770> do

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
scale so it's like armor so you just do

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.260 
scale so it's like armor so you just do
little<00:01:17.100> pokes<00:01:17.370> through<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.790> get<00:01:17.880> those<00:01:18.090> out

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
little pokes through you get those out

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.450 
little pokes through you get those out
of<00:01:18.300> the<00:01:18.420> way<00:01:18.620> and<00:01:19.620> then<00:01:19.740> when<00:01:19.950> she<00:01:20.070> goes<00:01:20.250> all

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
of the way and then when she goes all

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.360 
of the way and then when she goes all
the<00:01:20.580> way<00:01:20.670> down<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> spine<00:01:21.300> to<00:01:21.600> his<00:01:21.720> tail<00:01:22.370> with

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
the way down the spine to his tail with

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.030 
the way down the spine to his tail with
the<00:01:23.460> short<00:01:23.729> little<00:01:23.880> stabs<00:01:24.380> then<00:01:25.380> she<00:01:25.770> starts

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the short little stabs then she starts

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.700 
the short little stabs then she starts
making<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.490> slices<00:01:27.350> through<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.470> fillet

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
making the slices through the fillet

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.249 
making the slices through the fillet
along<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.759> bone<00:01:29.940> she'll<00:01:30.450> feel<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.690> bone<00:01:30.960> with

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
along the bone she'll feel the bone with

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.280 
along the bone she'll feel the bone with
her<00:01:31.410> knife<00:01:31.830> tip<00:01:32.210> and<00:01:33.210> her<00:01:33.270> knife<00:01:33.509> blade<00:01:33.810> as<00:01:34.140> she

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
her knife tip and her knife blade as she

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.680 
her knife tip and her knife blade as she
slices<00:01:34.590> along<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.250> but<00:01:35.910> this<00:01:36.030> initial<00:01:36.450> slice

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
slices along it but this initial slice

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.450 
slices along it but this initial slice
is<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.170> kind<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.560> get<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:37.710> scales<00:01:38.100> out<00:01:38.369> of

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
is just kind of to get the scales out of

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.650 
is just kind of to get the scales out of
the<00:01:38.520> way<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.820> make<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> little<00:01:39.240> cut<00:01:39.479> through

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
the way and make a little cut through

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.749 
the way and make a little cut through
the<00:01:39.750> skin<00:01:39.890> so<00:01:40.890> then<00:01:41.040> she<00:01:41.190> can<00:01:41.310> start<00:01:41.550> working

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the skin so then she can start working

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.520 
the skin so then she can start working
the<00:01:41.940> meat<00:01:42.149> away<00:01:42.270> from<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.600> bone<00:01:45.229> we'll<00:01:46.229> headed

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
the meat away from the bone we'll headed

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.139 
the meat away from the bone we'll headed
this<00:01:46.680> down<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.580> only<00:01:47.670> going<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.970> look

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
this down so it's only going to look

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.990 
this down so it's only going to look
like<00:01:48.330> about<00:01:48.660> 30<00:01:49.020> seconds<00:01:49.619> when<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.490> reality<00:01:50.610> is

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
like about 30 seconds when in reality is

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.340 
like about 30 seconds when in reality is
going<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.210> be<00:01:51.270> closer<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.630> 30<00:01:51.869> minutes<00:01:57.350> mm-hmm

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
going to be closer to 30 minutes mm-hmm

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.200 
going to be closer to 30 minutes mm-hmm
so<00:01:58.830> you'll<00:01:59.010> feel<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.400> rib<00:01:59.580> bones<00:01:59.820> with<00:02:00.060> your

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
so you'll feel the rib bones with your

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.230 
so you'll feel the rib bones with your
tip<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:00.960> once<00:02:01.110> your<00:02:01.229> tip<00:02:01.580> it's<00:02:02.580> not<00:02:02.909> flat

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
tip so once your tip it's not flat

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.300 
tip so once your tip it's not flat
anymore<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.870> it<00:02:04.020> starts<00:02:04.229> going<00:02:04.440> up<00:02:04.680> then<00:02:05.040> just

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
anymore and it starts going up then just

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:17.120 
anymore and it starts going up then just
keep<00:02:05.490> sliding<00:02:05.760> it<00:02:06.030> down

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.820 

let<00:02:17.430> me<00:02:17.520> read<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:21.260> okay<00:02:22.260> through<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.560> skin

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
let me read that okay through the skin

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.360 
let me read that okay through the skin
all<00:02:23.010> right<00:02:23.130> well<00:02:23.310> poke<00:02:27.920> enough<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.040> point<00:02:29.220> that

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
all right well poke enough to point that

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.940 
all right well poke enough to point that
knife<00:02:29.760> tip<00:02:30.060> towards<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.780> cutting<00:02:31.680> board<00:02:31.890> so

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
knife tip towards the cutting board so

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.750 
knife tip towards the cutting board so
it<00:02:32.190> gets<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.460> fillet<00:02:32.700> down<00:02:32.850> though<00:02:34.280> like<00:02:35.280> this

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
it gets the fillet down though like this

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.110 
it gets the fillet down though like this
the<00:02:36.750> fish<00:02:36.930> can<00:02:37.110> stay<00:02:37.380> flat<00:02:37.620> but<00:02:38.250> your<00:02:38.400> point<00:02:39.030> is

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
the fish can stay flat but your point is

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.010 
the fish can stay flat but your point is
playing<00:02:39.570> down<00:02:41.300> I'm<00:02:42.300> not<00:02:42.480> gonna<00:02:42.660> tell<00:02:42.840> them

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
playing down I'm not gonna tell them

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.150 
playing down I'm not gonna tell them
where<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.260> can<00:02:43.290> figure<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.680> out<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:43.890> can<00:02:44.010> do

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
where you can figure it out you can do

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.010 
where you can figure it out you can do
but<00:02:45.060> don't<00:02:45.150> put<00:02:45.360> your<00:02:45.390> hand<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:45.720> front<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.930> the

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
but don't put your hand in front of the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.550 
but don't put your hand in front of the
knife<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:47.060> felt<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.120> awesome<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.440> then

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
knife I felt that awesome that and then

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:59.949 
knife I felt that awesome that and then
