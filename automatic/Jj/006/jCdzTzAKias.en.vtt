00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.500
 he greets everyone knows he 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.250
 should today we find ourselves for 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.960
 my first tutorial so today already 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.300
 the tutorial will be a tutorial 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.740
 will not war so I 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.230
 will show you different ways 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.720
 so how to avoid a ford 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.000
 on your games to prevent your pc 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.980
 freezout and slowdowns then 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.810
 it's going to start right now 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.619
 so already that I can close because in 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.420
 done good short so you do whoever 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.070
 right click on the desktop and you go 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.050
 open down the customize and 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.940
 then 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.809
 there you have that most people have 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.489
 windows like that windows 7 but what 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.410
 who will have to do if you want not 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.600
 not really assaulted your computer lag 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.510
 and you're fed up 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.649
 Too bad for your eyes but the display 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.079
 that you are going to have to take his 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.850
 classic windows so once you 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.410
 do you already have that will save you 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.480
 a lot of ram so you remy frieze 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.320
 so that's the first way 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.350
 for there for me one for me rowed so 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.119
 here and now I'm going to show you 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.470
 a second very very effective way 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.650
 for games like minecraft bompas 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.470
 terraria is the exception but chivalry 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.090
 finally full of 3d games so we go to 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.640
 again do a little right click on the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.610
 office and the to all the owners of 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.400
 nvidia cards so a lot of people have 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.700
 the nvidia is usually for the 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.750
 gaming is nvidia geforce 660 about 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.240
 in these waters 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.990
 and so here you go for our 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.990
 config and nvidia 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.270
 so we are waiting for that which is often done quickly and 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.979
 so that's what would not have 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.450
 nvidia graphics cards that's 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.460
 almost the same kind 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.540
 catalyst this kind of thing it's almost 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.950
 the same thing but but finally me 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.540
 do not really know how I know 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.119
 not how to do with catalyst so 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.630
 that's good if not for 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.430
 nvidia 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.489
 it's simple you're going to go in 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.890
 3d settings so manage that then you 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.190
 will use my preferences 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.580
 to improve 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.690
 2 how by default is between 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.780
 performance and quality 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.850
 but if you prefer your I do not 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.570
 believe you I do not lake well 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.820
 you're going towards performance so 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.630
 voila you do apply and therefore 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:34.210
 general the game finally your games will be 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.430
 more performance oriented but 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.860
 we can do steps we can there are 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.810
 even more advanced settings so there 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.680
 you will be able to even take 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.690
 program settings then there I 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.160
 I will take only wood because board 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:55.600
 lag not there a lot on this computer then 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:03:01.540
 wait i'm going to reset no 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:03.430
 I can not yeah good I'm going to do on 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.740
 another serious sam here is nothing 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.750
 modify stay on sam 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.220
 so now so already acceleration 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.080
 with multiple graphics processors 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.780
 I have a message when we do not care there 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.560
 see later then mode 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.120
 single display performance 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.450
 that one you put the first so 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.670
 it's the best so we do not care 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.850
 we do not care but the main thing is 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.330
 be filtering textures so dropped 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.950
 me it a kite and this is by default 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.450
 so you're going to put high performance 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.000
 so is already there normally you 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.100
 should still see one a 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.739
 difference in the images by 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.709
 second on your games then filtering 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.470
 textures it makes you turn off and 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.880
 texture filtering disabled no no 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.140
 no it's the opposite the two they 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:56.140
 must be enabled use the 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.170
 global barometer you do very 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.209
 linear no that's because he speaks 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.739
 finally the main electro stuff that 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:07.180
 will not you do it anymore these three there 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.110
 I can really persia nothing else 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.110
 normally no 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:16.609
 no it's not that there is still some 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:20.479
 thing to no bah no in fact no so 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:23.060
 here you apply and then 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.370
 so here is your your software is 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.070
 configured and normally it will be oriented 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.540
 for high performance and blow you 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.800
 the approval then there I will go quickly 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:40.220
 actually check if minecraft the rabbit 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:41.780
 then added desktop and minecraft 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.960
 so now here are six civilians and 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.740
 frozen already delivered with others it's 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.720
 everything so that's after I think you 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.220
 have already seen a lot of earlier so 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.620
 you can still improve the 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.580
 performances in the game that I'm not going 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.289
 show it because it's so 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.419
 basic to go into options and to 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.699
 to lower the graphical parameters 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.100
 so here it was a short little tutorial 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:05.570
 quickly that will still be practical 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.090
 because I do not think there is 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.650
 a lot of people who clears tutorial 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.340
 so that's it over 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.340
 Hello everyone
