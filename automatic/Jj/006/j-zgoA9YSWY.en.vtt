00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.879
 hello friends welcome to the review of 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.849
 the action figure of this pawn 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:13.280
 manufactured by Victor this figure has 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.230
 a height of 13 points 5 centimeters 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.050
 here we have a comparison in scale 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.430
 with his brother my girlfriend and we see that 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:27.390
 keeps a good difference in size and 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.900
 here we have goku of that boy arts of 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.020
 band and we can see that this 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.870
 figure clearly does not keep climbing 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.079
 proportional with goku since yes 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.620
 we remember in the movie this pawn was 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.570
 of a height similar to wuhan and goku and 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.270
 before they ask me for when the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.239
 Goku video to avoid going around 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.539
 for December I will be uploading this 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.239
 video the date is still to be determined 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.219
 but I will do it as soon as I can in the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.350
 the month 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.409
 it's worth friends to highlight that 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.670
 there is an articulated model kit of this 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.200
 character 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.840
 also for baby toys but it's pretty 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.750
 hard to get 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.930
 similarly there is a figure of 16 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.930
 inches 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:26.110
 and later this same mold was 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.920
 reused by companies such as kits 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.210
 Bis 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.159
 and irwin toys moms adding this 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.640
 inevitable accessory for any 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.920
 figure of dragon ball firearms there 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.830
 something very particular that I would like 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.020
 talk about this figure and it's your year of 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.049
 manufacture if you seek 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.049
 information on the internet you will find that 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:56.990
 the movie number 13 of dragon ball the 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:02:00.020
 dragon attack is from 1995 and the figure 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:04.880
 of action says it was manufactured in the 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.909
 year of 1989 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.489
 it's as if cheers would have advanced 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.080
 in the future and I knew I was going to try 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.320
 the movie 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.160
 or maybe it 's a stupid mistake of 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:23.300
 production who knows but it's pretty 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.870
 curious that this figure has this year 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.530
 of manufacturing now well entering 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:34.710
 details we see that it has very good 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:39.000
 sculpted into what is the hair 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:44.300
 It has outlined very good and the contour 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.300
 ears this part of the headband here 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:55.280
 the face in my opinion is not even close 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:59.840
 of what the character is originally 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:03.720
 and this is that previously the figures 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.740
 especially in the faces they did not have that 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.530
 remembrance that we can see today 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:13.830
 maybe they consider a limitation of the 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.710
 time to cover that kind of flaws 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.440
 the sculptors focused more on others 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.800
 details of the figure as you can see 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.460
 for example the folds of clothes the 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.460
 ocarina 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.790
 which is very well designed 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.100
 legs and boots 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.280
 the back of the scarf and the 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.190
 sword 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.190
 that you can not remove you have a good 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:51.150
 as it is quite long 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.750
 and also this figure 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.780
 It has the same points of articulation 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:01.939
 typical of the dragonball figures of 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.939
 the time moves the head 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.790
 shoulders 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.890
 and the waist this is all from part of 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.060
 the points of articulation 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.209
 so friends 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.389
 to conclude practically this is the 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.510
 only tapial figure found 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:26.420
 on a scale of 4 to 6 inches 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.760
 and that's why it's going to look good in a 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.600
 irwin jacques collection up 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.630
 inclusive is the chic words for me the 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.690
 low point apart from the joint is 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.630
 the face since he looks like a 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:46.250
 subject tucked into a cosplay face no 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:50.630
 it looks like nothing and still it's a good 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:53.600
 figure and knows the recommended because 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:57.560
 is not a very popular character and the 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.110
 figure is also a little unknown 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.930
 so friends thank you very much for 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.820
 have seen this video and please be 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.400
 attentive to my channel since my next 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.220
 video will be the new alarm of this is worse 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.860
 and remember to leave a thumbs up if 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:17.020
 they found the video informative thanks 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.020
