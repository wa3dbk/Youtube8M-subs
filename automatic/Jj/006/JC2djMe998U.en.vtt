product spotlight today on our rule abid

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.919 
product spotlight today on our rule abid
the<00:00:14.370> rule<00:00:14.580> abid<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.480> bee<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.809> is

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
the rule abid is a bee that is

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.779 
the rule abid is a bee that is
manufactured<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.740> Czech<00:00:17.039> Republic<00:00:17.070> and

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
manufactured in the Czech Republic and

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.370 
manufactured in the Czech Republic and
what<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.140> hold<00:00:19.949> be<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.930> instead

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
what it is is a to hold be that instead

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.400 
what it is is a to hold be that instead
of<00:00:22.439> being<00:00:23.600> tubular<00:00:24.600> shape<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:25.109> holes<00:00:25.320> are

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
of being tubular shape the holes are

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.650 
of being tubular shape the holes are
going<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.650> be<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.160> side<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:27.180> has<00:00:27.359> two

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
going to be on this side so it has two

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.740 
going to be on this side so it has two
holes<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.320> will<00:00:28.650> line<00:00:28.890> up<00:00:28.920> nicely<00:00:29.699> next<00:00:30.660> to

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
holes that will line up nicely next to

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.479 
holes that will line up nicely next to
one<00:00:30.869> another<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.740> measurement<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.340> rule

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
one another the measurement of the rule

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.030 
one another the measurement of the rule
is<00:00:32.700> three<00:00:33.090> by<00:00:33.270> five<00:00:33.600> millimeters<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.920> it's

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
is three by five millimeters so it's

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.580 
is three by five millimeters so it's
going<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.190> be<00:00:35.370> three<00:00:35.730> high<00:00:36.120> by<00:00:36.420> five<00:00:36.780> why<00:00:37.230> and

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
going to be three high by five why and

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.680 
going to be three high by five why and
when<00:00:38.010> you're<00:00:38.129> looking<00:00:38.430> at<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.700> holes<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.270> you

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
when you're looking at the holes and you

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.080 
when you're looking at the holes and you
can<00:00:39.899> get<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.469> can<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:41.100> squeeze<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.460> 20<00:00:41.850> gauge

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
can get you can just squeeze a 20 gauge

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.180 
can get you can just squeeze a 20 gauge
wire<00:00:42.120> through<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.020> hole<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:43.739> depending<00:00:44.070> on

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
wire through the hole so depending on

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.010 
wire through the hole so depending on
what<00:00:44.340> you're<00:00:44.520> working<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.300> most<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
what you're working with it most of the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.090 
what you're working with it most of the
time<00:00:46.110> you're<00:00:46.260> going<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.440> use<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.710> for<00:00:46.739> bead

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
time you're going to use it for bead

exceptions going higher low but that's

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.460 
exceptions going higher low but that's
going<00:02:51.569> to<00:02:51.630> be<00:02:51.720> based<00:02:51.900> on<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.170> different

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
going to be based on the different

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.440 
going to be based on the different
finishes<00:02:52.799> but<00:02:53.519> because<00:02:53.760> they<00:02:53.910> are<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:54.060> larger

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
finishes but because they are a larger

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.090 
finishes but because they are a larger
bead<00:02:54.600> they<00:02:54.720> move<00:02:54.900> really<00:02:55.319> really<00:02:55.530> quickly<00:02:55.799> as

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
bead they move really really quickly as

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.390 
bead they move really really quickly as
compared<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.560> 1500<00:02:58.560> or<00:02:58.769> a<00:02:58.799> delicate<00:02:59.250> bead

compared to a 1500 or a delicate bead

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.699 
compared to a 1500 or a delicate bead
these<00:02:59.940> are<00:03:00.150> going<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.330> be<00:03:00.540> much<00:03:00.900> larger<00:03:01.290> and

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
these are going to be much larger and

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.280 
these are going to be much larger and
because<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.459> that<00:03:02.690> they're<00:03:03.690> going<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.870> string

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
because of that they're going to string

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.710 
because of that they're going to string
on<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.500> lot<00:03:04.890> faster<00:03:05.160> they<00:03:05.849> give<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.030> great<00:03:06.420> look

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
on a lot faster they give a great look

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.449 
on a lot faster they give a great look
that<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:07.019> can<00:03:07.170> stack<00:03:07.530> them<00:03:07.709> kind<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.069> side<00:03:08.280> by

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
that you can stack them kind of side by

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.240 
that you can stack them kind of side by
side<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.090> they<00:03:09.540> look<00:03:09.840> like<00:03:09.989> bricks<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.860> a

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
side and they look like bricks of a
