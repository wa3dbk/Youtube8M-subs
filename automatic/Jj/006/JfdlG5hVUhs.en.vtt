water

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.190 

maybe<00:00:59.850> I'm<00:01:00.420> going<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.570> get<00:01:00.720> Benton<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.050> pick

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
maybe I'm going to get Benton to pick

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.340 
maybe I'm going to get Benton to pick
that<00:01:01.350> thing<00:01:01.410> up<00:01:01.740> and

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
that thing up and

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.140 
that thing up and
works<00:01:03.590> because<00:01:03.920> it<00:01:04.070> gets<00:01:04.610> a<00:01:04.699> little<00:01:04.970> bit<00:01:05.059> of

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
works because it gets a little bit of

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.880 
works because it gets a little bit of
air<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:05.720> then<00:01:05.840> water<00:01:06.080> than<00:01:06.409> air<00:01:06.590> on<00:01:06.770> each

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
air and then water than air on each

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.640 
air and then water than air on each
stroke<00:01:07.450> each<00:01:08.450> rotation<00:01:08.900> I<00:01:09.229> should<00:01:09.409> say

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
stroke each rotation I should say

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.810 
stroke each rotation I should say
and<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.460> uh

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
and so it's uh

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.289 
and so it's uh
see<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.390> water

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.600 

we're<00:01:16.930> going<00:01:17.049> to<00:01:17.110> add<00:01:17.229> some<00:01:17.560> pipes<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:18.189> this

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
we're going to add some pipes to this

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.429 
we're going to add some pipes to this
Peck's<00:01:18.880> line<00:01:19.119> now<00:01:19.329> to<00:01:19.390> see<00:01:19.600> how<00:01:19.750> she<00:01:19.810> performs

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
Peck's line now to see how she performs

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:21.569 
Peck's line now to see how she performs
we're<00:01:20.590> going<00:01:20.710> to<00:01:20.770> do<00:01:20.829> about<00:01:20.890> a<00:01:20.979> 100<00:01:21.280> foot<00:01:21.399> at<00:01:21.520> a

railroad bed here be a railroad bed here
and<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:10.479> just<00:02:10.539> makes<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.290> perfect<00:02:11.799> channel<00:02:12.130> for

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
and it just makes a perfect channel for

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.180 
and it just makes a perfect channel for
the<00:02:13.000> river<00:02:13.180> calm

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.369 

absolutely<00:02:21.310> mr.<00:02:21.519> Archimedes<00:02:22.030> screw<00:02:22.870> look<00:02:23.290> at

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
absolutely mr. Archimedes screw look at

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.080 
absolutely mr. Archimedes screw look at
this<00:02:23.440> things<00:02:23.709> fit<00:02:24.040> in<00:02:24.129> the<00:02:24.190> water<00:02:24.340> up<00:02:24.670> here

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
this things fit in the water up here

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.289 
this things fit in the water up here
I've<00:02:25.900> already<00:02:26.080> got<00:02:26.319> about<00:02:26.560> 20<00:02:27.519> psi<00:02:27.819> right

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
I've already got about 20 psi right

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:28.710 
I've already got about 20 psi right
there

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
there

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:38.990 
there
maybe<00:02:29.200> more

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.050 

so<00:02:39.360> this<00:02:39.570> is<00:02:39.690> going<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.930> take<00:02:40.050> care<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.290> this

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
so this is going to take care of this

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.970 
so this is going to take care of this
locations<00:02:42.060> all<00:02:42.270> their<00:02:42.450> gardening<00:02:42.870> needs<00:02:43.050> they

locations all their gardening needs they

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.370 
locations all their gardening needs they
could<00:02:44.190> filter<00:02:44.460> this<00:02:44.760> if<00:02:44.940> they<00:02:45.060> had<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.540> take

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
could filter this if they had to take

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.460 
could filter this if they had to take
care<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.590> their<00:02:46.740> livestock<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.640> orchards<00:02:48.540> I'm

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
going to pump this into some

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.630 
going to pump this into some
on<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.230> top<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.680> hill<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.010> gravity<00:02:52.430> too

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
on the top of the hill and gravity too

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.120 
on the top of the hill and gravity too
early

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.170

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
five sign off shoot some footage up here

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.110 
five sign off shoot some footage up here
come<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.720> happy<00:03:00.290> campers<00:03:00.710> got<00:03:01.520> their<00:03:01.700> pump<00:03:01.940> in

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
come the happy campers got their pump in

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.470 
come the happy campers got their pump in
the<00:03:02.240> water<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:03.250> it's<00:03:04.250> not<00:03:04.610> so<00:03:04.820> loud<00:03:05.000> up<00:03:05.270> here

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
the water and it's not so loud up here

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
the water and it's not so loud up here
maybe<00:03:05.660> you<00:03:05.780> can<00:03:05.840> hear<00:03:06.110> me<00:03:06.580> but<00:03:07.580> she's<00:03:08.350> full<00:03:09.350> of

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
maybe you can hear me but she's full of

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.440 
maybe you can hear me but she's full of
water<00:03:09.650> now<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.160> she's<00:03:10.640> pumping<00:03:11.000> water<00:03:11.210> we're

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
water now and she's pumping water we're

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.390 
water now and she's pumping water we're
gonna<00:03:11.680> put<00:03:12.680> about<00:03:12.860> a<00:03:12.890> hundred<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.220> twenty

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
gonna put about a hundred and twenty

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.730 
gonna put about a hundred and twenty
feet<00:03:13.730> of<00:03:13.940> lying<00:03:14.300> on<00:03:14.450> it<00:03:14.660> they<00:03:15.170> got<00:03:15.320> a<00:03:15.350> long<00:03:15.530> ways

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
feet of lying on it they got a long ways

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.340 
feet of lying on it they got a long ways
to<00:03:15.950> go<00:03:15.980> but<00:03:16.550> it's<00:03:16.820> not<00:03:17.690> a<00:03:17.720> problem<00:03:17.960> for<00:03:18.140> the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
to go but it's not a problem for the

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.000 
to go but it's not a problem for the
pump<00:03:19.330> so<00:03:20.330> it's<00:03:20.480> kind<00:03:20.660> of<00:03:20.720> a<00:03:20.810> perfect<00:03:21.050> spot<00:03:21.440> to

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
pump so it's kind of a perfect spot to

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.460 
pump so it's kind of a perfect spot to
let<00:03:22.160> her<00:03:22.220> just<00:03:22.430> sit<00:03:22.580> there<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:22.940> work<00:03:23.320> let's<00:03:24.320> go

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
let her just sit there and work let's go

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.980 
let her just sit there and work let's go
see<00:03:24.680> how<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:24.940> water<00:03:25.940> coming<00:03:26.240> at<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.510> end<00:03:26.660> I

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
see how the water coming at the end I

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.110 
see how the water coming at the end I
can<00:03:27.680> do<00:03:27.770> about<00:03:27.920> a<00:03:27.950> gallon<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:28.310> minute<00:03:28.340> at<00:03:28.880> this

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
can do about a gallon a minute at this

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.340 
can do about a gallon a minute at this
speed<00:03:29.590> but<00:03:30.590> we'll<00:03:30.710> measure<00:03:30.890> it<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.700> key<00:03:31.880> is<00:03:32.030> to

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
speed but we'll measure it the key is to

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.630 
speed but we'll measure it the key is to
get<00:03:33.350> to<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.620> top<00:03:33.800> of<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:34.010> hill<00:03:34.130> then<00:03:34.340> take<00:03:34.610> a

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
get to the top of the hill then take a

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.550 
get to the top of the hill then take a
measurement<00:03:35.030> so<00:03:35.350> if<00:03:36.350> you've<00:03:36.770> got<00:03:36.920> a<00:03:36.980> place

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
measurement so if you've got a place

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.050 
measurement so if you've got a place
like<00:03:39.560> this<00:03:39.800> and<00:03:40.070> you<00:03:40.130> probably<00:03:40.700> say<00:03:40.880> hey<00:03:41.030> I

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
like this and you probably say hey I

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.430 
like this and you probably say hey I
know<00:03:41.240> a<00:03:41.330> place<00:03:41.540> that<00:03:41.600> this<00:03:41.930> will<00:03:42.080> work<00:03:42.230> out

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
know a place that this will work out

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.160 
know a place that this will work out
this<00:03:43.430> might<00:03:43.610> be<00:03:43.850> what<00:03:44.480> you<00:03:44.600> need<00:03:44.630> to<00:03:44.900> handle

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
this might be what you need to handle

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.550 
this might be what you need to handle
all<00:03:45.290> your<00:03:45.320> irrigation<00:03:45.650> needs<00:03:46.360> so<00:03:47.360> I<00:03:47.660> think

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
all your irrigation needs so I think

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.290 
all your irrigation needs so I think
that<00:03:48.830> that's<00:03:49.490> about<00:03:49.790> it<00:03:49.910> we're<00:03:50.030> going<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:50.210> do<00:03:50.270> a

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
that that's about it we're going to do a

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.450 
that that's about it we're going to do a
little<00:03:50.510> bit<00:03:50.660> of<00:03:50.920> work<00:03:51.920> I<00:03:52.100> know<00:03:52.160> there's<00:03:52.400> a

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
little bit of work I know there's a

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.130 
little bit of work I know there's a
concern<00:03:52.880> about<00:03:53.060> things<00:03:53.420> coming<00:03:53.840> down<00:03:53.870> the

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
concern about things coming down the

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.380 
concern about things coming down the
river<00:03:54.350> and<00:03:54.560> hitting<00:03:54.890> it<00:03:55.040> but<00:03:55.580> it<00:03:55.700> is<00:03:55.850> it's

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
river and hitting it but it is it's

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.900 
river and hitting it but it is it's
pretty<00:03:56.600> forgiving<00:03:57.080> because<00:03:57.290> it'll<00:03:57.500> move<00:03:57.910> and

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
pretty forgiving because it'll move and

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.320 
pretty forgiving because it'll move and
we've<00:03:59.030> got<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.300> cabled<00:03:59.870> off<00:04:00.080> so<00:04:00.790> it<00:04:01.790> can<00:04:01.850> bump

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
we've got it cabled off so it can bump

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.110 
we've got it cabled off so it can bump
and<00:04:02.600> you<00:04:03.200> know<00:04:03.320> it's<00:04:03.470> pretty<00:04:03.620> tough<00:04:03.940> so<00:04:04.940> we'll

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
and you know it's pretty tough so we'll

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.180 
and you know it's pretty tough so we'll
just<00:04:05.270> have<00:04:05.420> to<00:04:05.570> see<00:04:05.750> if<00:04:05.840> we<00:04:05.990> hear<00:04:06.230> there's<00:04:06.440> 10

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
just have to see if we hear there's 10

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.560 
just have to see if we hear there's 10
inches<00:04:07.490> of<00:04:07.580> rain<00:04:07.610> coming<00:04:07.970> from<00:04:08.240> the<00:04:08.330> puller

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
inches of rain coming from the puller

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.700 
inches of rain coming from the puller
out<00:04:08.780> of<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:08.990> river<00:04:09.940> so<00:04:10.940> that's<00:04:11.410> that's<00:04:12.410> it

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
out of the river so that's that's it
