 said it was the moment 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.090
 today this video on a subject that 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.110
 is really important to me and that I'm going 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.879
 send to community channels because 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.110
 that it's not passed on yet and 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.610
 some already made a video on 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.769
 but I was already aware of 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.120
 file before the person does 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.500
 the video on it so I'll explain myself 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.870
 today i was talking about youtube 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.860
 gaming you must surely not know this 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.269
 that's because it's not yet 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.820
 past qg squad next door so I'm going 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.350
 to send it with qg shots is next f and 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.729
 jÃ©richo 5x did a video on it but 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.440
 that is to say, an acquainted with 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.720
 information before jericho 25 x 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.799
 make a video on it and a view 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.450
 he did not send him a sex drive 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.560
 of bag at the tf I thought that this 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.960
 would be pretty interesting to them 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.260
 send finally brief here is youtube bing 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.760
 you denounce the subject just after having 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.290
 gameplay statement to have told you 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.369
 some little info we already had 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.780
 it's a very short gameplay today 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.140
 it's a three-minute standard at the 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.070
 saq 3 royalty solo cnw does not affect 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.960
 what I did from the second hour 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.150
 free but since the subject is not 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.040
 a lot no I think I'm going 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.270
 just put the first dena with a 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.980
 little piece of the second but I 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.210
 will not you put it entirely so 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.860
 it's a double sheet the saq three 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.260
 rather pretty tickets so these bags 3 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.340
 90th boca three plus three damage so in 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.050
 big is about hope 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.000
 goliath what with a viewfinder so she 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.800
 is really cool I advise you 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.190
 really if you get to unlock them 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.810
 in a in a pack in any case brief 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.040
 that's what you want to say too 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.300
 is that I will try to do more 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.659
 videos since I already full of 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.460
 gameplay 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.720
 I did a lot of blues 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.770
 I have a lot of gameplay shoah in 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.659
 vacation for a week 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.790
 second jean I am well subject to 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.840
 great holidays it makes me super biton 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.159
 but precisely in the comments if 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.769
 you're a holiday if you need 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.179
 to move from your tray right now 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.620
 it's just a little information judge 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.580
 to say that I'm on vacation and that 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.659
 I go on vacation for three 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.239
 weeks a moment when I'm going to try to 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:17.409
 plan videos here I can 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.519
 maybe go to the little subject I 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.470
 thank first just the chains 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.180
 to drop the etherciel clauds me that makes me 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.860
 great pleasure since the small mp here 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.690
 there's no big coffee and denek the sects 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.650
 royalties on all the debate is there this is 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.209
 fast in three minutes 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.830
 so it's great fun if you 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.590
 accept or so I say so I you 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.120
 spoke about youtube gaming 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.050
 what is it? 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.550
 information that I gave you about 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.410
 youtube bing are not necessarily on 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.060
 these are rumors but I think 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.680
 that it's really going to happen because 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.060
 youtube loves money so I 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.769
 explained to me youtube bing so this will be 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.060
 youtube streaming platform 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.030
 So basically youtube 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.769
 he's fed up that youtube the big ones 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.049
 youtuber expressed on the best site 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.760
 henchmen actually streaming twitch 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.470
 on youtube we can stream but 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.700
 directly on youtube that is to say that 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.379
 here is the stream of youtube it is 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.450
 really rotten a that lag 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.000
 it's really very badly done 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.260
 obliged to create a live event you are 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.610
 obliged to do a lot of things to 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.140
 start a stream then on twitter 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.769
 you tap started streaming 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.390
 south stream 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.610
 this size of streaming stops on 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.380
 Stream and knew it reruns 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.579
 Repeats alone on 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.170
 youtube so frankly the stream on 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.200
 youtube it is really very badly done and 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.250
 to the tuba want to leave an application 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.049
 because it will be an application on 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.000
 smartphone too like did twitch 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.750
 they want to get out of there youtube y 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.450
 emig the site 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.739
 so I think we'll have the same chain 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.239
 youtube the same but also to new tube 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.310
 gaming so basically it will allow us 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.069
 that youtube voice canton subscribers 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.290
 strip on youtube gaming and he told us 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.120
 weaving very very latency time 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.430
 weak ie between the moment 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.799
 where the person play the moment when the 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.440
 players see the stream there will be a 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.940
 very short latency finally in 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.549
 anyway that's what guarantees so if 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.139
 they really do a really it takes 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.549
 good things in youtube gaming 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.660
 I think the big streamer and in 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.130
 stream and on youtube 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.930
 because big streamers are often 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.370
 of youtuber and youtuber life when 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.870
 are paid by youtube and since they are 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.090
 partners with youtube streamed heron 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.280
 on tweets on youtube gaming forgiveness and 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.349
 to go back to twitter so basically 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.819
 youtube they want to crush hole 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.530
 it's literally a risk really 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.000
 to do it simply because youtube 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.950
 it's a lot bigger site than 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 twitch so in any case we'll see 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.470
 I really hope that it will come out 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.810
 since if this range I will try 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.400
 trimer safe on youtube gaming even if 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.320
 I do not necessarily have the connection 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.360
 but even for the little ones youtuber it's 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.740
 more useful because especially there is 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.539
 not all your youtube subscribers who you 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.979
 does the deaf switcher 210 that if you 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.720
 are on youtube gaming all your subscribers 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.919
 will see if you streamed because 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.630
 there will be no need to change 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.500
 site between guinea so here it is a 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.360
 little bit everything I had to you 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.860
 tell me in the comments what 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.760
 you think of youtube the mines me I 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.950
 really think it's a good thing 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.240
 and I hope it will come out though 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.590
 I hope it will be really well done 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.880
 kind it will be as well done as twitch 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.040
 because you see there is 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.630
 really of really things that are 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.300
 negative I think you really 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.130
 well done in any case I hope that 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.780
 this gameplay will have pleased you this topic as 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.160
 being you will have pleased me I tell you to the 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.750
 next thank you community channel 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.820
 do not hesitate to let go of a light especially 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.860
 it's great fun a little like a 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.210
 little comment man who shares and 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.210
