00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.640 

so<00:00:01.860> I<00:00:01.890> have<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.610> sign<00:00:02.879> base<00:00:03.270> coated<00:00:03.840> now<00:00:04.230> this

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
so I have the sign base coated now this

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.890 
so I have the sign base coated now this
is<00:00:04.950> about<00:00:05.850> four<00:00:06.480> coats<00:00:06.839> of<00:00:07.319> parchment<00:00:08.900> acrylic

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
is about four coats of parchment acrylic

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.470 
is about four coats of parchment acrylic
paint<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:11.250> sounds<00:00:11.610> worse<00:00:11.790> than<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.450> I

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
paint and it sounds worse than it is I

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.410 
paint and it sounds worse than it is I
actually<00:00:12.990> blow<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.040> dry<00:00:14.219> with<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.580> blow<00:00:15.389> dryer

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
actually blow it dry with a blow dryer

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.689 
actually blow it dry with a blow dryer
in<00:00:15.900> between<00:00:16.260> coats<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:16.949> actually<00:00:17.160> goes

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
in between coats so it actually goes

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.689 
in between coats so it actually goes
really<00:00:18.210> fast<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:19.500> now<00:00:19.710> it's<00:00:19.920> time<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.250> transfer

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
really fast so now it's time to transfer

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.540 
really fast so now it's time to transfer
your<00:00:21.660> design<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.519> used<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:25.080> made<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.740> design

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
your design I used I I made this design

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.599 
your design I used I I made this design
joy<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.150> world<00:00:27.740> on<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.800> computer<00:00:29.400> and

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
joy to the world on the computer and

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.400 
joy to the world on the computer and
printed<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.330> out<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:32.540> that's<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.930> design<00:00:34.230> I'm

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
printed it out and that's the design I'm

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.000 
printed it out and that's the design I'm
going<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.770> use<00:00:35.030> so<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:36.960> position<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.739> on

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
going to use so I just position it on

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.799 
going to use so I just position it on
the<00:00:39.590> sign<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.420> tape<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.450> down<00:00:43.670> my<00:00:44.670> my<00:00:45.300> patterns

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the sign and tape it down my my patterns

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.819 
the sign and tape it down my my patterns
are<00:00:46.050> just<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.500> hair<00:00:46.800> bigger<00:00:47.250> than<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.940> sign<00:00:48.180> so

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
are just a hair bigger than the sign so

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.590 
are just a hair bigger than the sign so
you<00:00:49.829> want<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.100> get<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.370> nice<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.829> even<00:00:52.829> and

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
you want to get it nice and even and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.270 
you want to get it nice and even and
then<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.660> use<00:00:55.110> something<00:00:55.410> called<00:00:55.590> graphite

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
then you use something called graphite

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.549 
then you use something called graphite
paper<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.059> graphite<00:00:57.629> paper<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.230> get<00:00:58.410> it

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
paper this is graphite paper you get it

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.160 
paper this is graphite paper you get it
in<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.180> Michaels<00:01:00.180> or<00:01:00.480> an<00:01:00.600> arts<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.899> crafts

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
in a Michaels or an arts and crafts

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.950 
in a Michaels or an arts and crafts
store<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:02.430> like<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> transfer<00:01:03.270> paper<00:01:03.539> for

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
store and it's like a transfer paper for

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.460 
store and it's like a transfer paper for
what<00:01:04.199> it's<00:01:04.799> dull<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.909> one<00:01:06.180> side<00:01:06.510> shiny<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
what it's dull on one side shiny on the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.469 
what it's dull on one side shiny on the
other<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.159> want<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.430> put<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.700> shiny<00:01:09.060> side

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
other so you want to put it shiny side

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.840 
other so you want to put it shiny side
down<00:01:11.030> underneath<00:01:12.030> your<00:01:12.450> pattern<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:14.700> then

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
down underneath your pattern and then

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.420 
down underneath your pattern and then
hold<00:01:15.180> your<00:01:15.299> pattern<00:01:15.689> tight<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:17.130> trace

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
hold your pattern tight and you trace

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.310 
hold your pattern tight and you trace
around<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.909> using<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.270> little<00:01:18.420> stylus<00:01:19.020> like

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
around it using a little stylus like

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.770 
around it using a little stylus like
this<00:01:19.590> mine<00:01:20.130> has<00:01:20.520> thin<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.060> one<00:01:21.090> side<00:01:21.420> thick<00:01:21.659> on

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
this mine has thin on one side thick on

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.249 
this mine has thin on one side thick on
the<00:01:21.869> other<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.080> go<00:01:22.439> thin<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:24.090> just<00:01:24.570> start

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
the other I go thin and I just start

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:33.319 
the other I go thin and I just start
tracing<00:01:25.890> around<00:01:27.439> my<00:01:28.439> letters<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:32.090> you<00:01:33.090> just

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
tracing around my letters and you just

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.870 
tracing around my letters and you just
keep<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:33.600> until<00:01:34.170> all<00:01:34.530> your<00:01:35.340> letters<00:01:35.520> are

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
keep going until all your letters are

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.310 
keep going until all your letters are
traced<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.750> your<00:01:36.930> sign<00:01:38.150> and<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.659> will<00:01:40.049> just

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
traced on to your sign and I will just

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.140 
traced on to your sign and I will just
show<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.710> I'll<00:01:41.369> give<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> little<00:01:41.880> peak
