00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
full carbon mountain bike wheel the rim

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.450 
full carbon mountain bike wheel the rim
is<00:01:06.450> 33<00:01:07.200> millimeters<00:01:07.500> wide<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.340> outside

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
is 33 millimeters wide on the outside

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.990 
is 33 millimeters wide on the outside
and<00:01:09.439> 26<00:01:10.439> millimeters<00:01:10.979> wide<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> inside

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
and 26 millimeters wide on the inside

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.770 
and 26 millimeters wide on the inside
that<00:01:12.930> makes<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.500> sidewalls<00:01:14.119> 3.5<00:01:15.119> millimeters

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
that makes the sidewalls 3.5 millimeters

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.100 
that makes the sidewalls 3.5 millimeters
thick<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.729> designed<00:01:17.729> these<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.570> sidewalls

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
thick I designed these so the sidewalls

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.380 
thick I designed these so the sidewalls
would<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.530> very<00:01:19.799> thick<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.490> they<00:01:20.610> did<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:21.060> able

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
would be very thick so they did be able

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.289 
would be very thick so they did be able
to<00:01:21.479> take<00:01:21.720> an<00:01:21.869> impact<00:01:22.700> one<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.880> problems

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
to take an impact one of the problems

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.660 
to take an impact one of the problems
with<00:01:24.509> carbon<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.500> mountain<00:01:25.799> bike<00:01:25.979> use<00:01:26.340> is

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
with carbon for mountain bike use is

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.999 
with carbon for mountain bike use is
making<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.659> will<00:01:27.810> survive<00:01:28.290> an<00:01:28.530> impact

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
making it so it will survive an impact

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.730 
making it so it will survive an impact
with<00:01:29.340> rocks<00:01:29.640> because<00:01:30.360> if<00:01:31.320> you're<00:01:31.530> raising

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
with rocks because if you're raising

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.780 
with rocks because if you're raising
mountain<00:01:32.220> bikes<00:01:32.689> you<00:01:33.689> are<00:01:33.990> going<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.790> bottom

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
mountain bikes you are going to bottom

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.730 
mountain bikes you are going to bottom
the<00:01:35.909> tire<00:01:36.150> out<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.659> are<00:01:36.869> going<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.380> hit<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
the tire out you are going to hit the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.810 
the tire out you are going to hit the
rim<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.159> rocks

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
rim on rocks

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.390 
rim on rocks
now<00:01:39.150> with<00:01:39.840> carbon<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.530> trick<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.950> make<00:01:41.250> it

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
now with carbon the trick is to make it

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.969 
now with carbon the trick is to make it
survive<00:01:41.720> so<00:01:42.720> what<00:01:42.930> I've<00:01:43.049> done<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.680> make<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
survive so what I've done is to make the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.139 
survive so what I've done is to make the
sidewalls<00:01:44.490> very<00:01:44.850> thick<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.540> short<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:47.149> that

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
sidewalls very thick and short and that

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.030 
sidewalls very thick and short and that
way<00:01:48.329> they<00:01:48.540> can<00:01:48.720> take<00:01:48.930> some<00:01:49.290> impacts<00:01:49.740> with

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
way they can take some impacts with

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.499 
way they can take some impacts with
rocks<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.700> continue<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.840> survive<00:01:52.549> so<00:01:53.549> this

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
rocks and continue to survive so this

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.350 
rocks and continue to survive so this
rim<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.990> 26<00:01:55.649> millimeters<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.579> inside<00:01:57.030> so

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
rim is 26 millimeters on the inside so

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.460 
rim is 26 millimeters on the inside so
it's<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.600> very<00:01:57.840> wide<00:01:58.229> rim

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
it's a very wide rim

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.980 
it's a very wide rim
and<00:01:59.590> being<00:02:00.130> carbon<00:02:00.520> is<00:02:01.030> still<00:02:01.810> very

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
and being carbon is still very

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.390 
and being carbon is still very
lightweight<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:04.410> I'm<00:02:05.410> really<00:02:05.770> pleased<00:02:06.190> with

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
lightweight so I'm really pleased with

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.940 
lightweight so I'm really pleased with
the<00:02:06.550> way<00:02:06.580> these<00:02:06.880> turned<00:02:07.240> out<00:02:07.450> we<00:02:08.320> decided<00:02:08.860> to

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
the way these turned out we decided to

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.560 
the way these turned out we decided to
make<00:02:09.100> this<00:02:09.369> a<00:02:09.550> sturdy<00:02:10.420> build<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:12.370> it's<00:02:13.060> really

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
make this a sturdy build so it's really

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.610 
make this a sturdy build so it's really
aimed<00:02:13.780> at<00:02:14.340> enduro<00:02:15.340> or<00:02:15.910> all-mountain<00:02:16.620> the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
aimed at enduro or all-mountain the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.710 
aimed at enduro or all-mountain the
other<00:02:17.800> thing<00:02:18.100> that's<00:02:18.280> really<00:02:18.580> unique<00:02:19.360> about

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
other thing that's really unique about

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.890 
other thing that's really unique about
our<00:02:20.050> mountain<00:02:20.440> bike<00:02:20.590> wheels<00:02:20.860> is<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:21.460> we<00:02:21.610> use
