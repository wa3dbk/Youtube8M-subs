00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.620
 activision ran into a gold mine 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.299
 with modern warfare and has squeezed the 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.670
 Call of duty franchise game by 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.740
 a long six years although with gas 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.840
 reporting sales lower than black 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.400
 ops 2 it seems that the money wagon 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.650
 finally it is running out 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.300
 fuel here are the 5 good 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.039
 reasons why we are tired of 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.039
 color and in its current form 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.380
 with yury the game has become 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.690
 equivalent to a film michael 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.120
 bay with dramatic resin scene 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.100
 dramatic watching things fly apart 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.290
 in your face the single player campaign 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.239
 You need to lower the tone so we can 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.810
 really appreciate what happens in 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.810
 screen 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.070
 in these shows 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.900
 for those who are passionate about 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.000
 story but because after seven 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.220
 games we have not been able to experience a 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.740
 moving moment 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.740
 in the morning the view 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.850
 this is the in 3 country upi is great but 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.980
 this was more than 2 years ago and we have not 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.980
 had more than garbage since then 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.170
 call of duty urgently needs a 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.210
 new graphic engine 2 has a few 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.250
 novel effects but the textures 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.200
 basic and the animation has not improved 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.510
 from modern warfare how can a 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.560
 series that generates so much money look worse 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.560
 that your competitors 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.380
 the gameplay in call of duty feels 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.210
 old-fashioned just press the trigger 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.009
 left to aim and the right to 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.470
 shoot at an incessant rain of 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.270
 enemies has become boring we offer 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.220
 something a little more interesting 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.439
 especially for the new consoles 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.439
 like playstation 4 and xbox one 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.520
 never change is a winning team says 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.770
 but that means that fans must 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.110
 stick to receive the same game year 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.820
 after year each new title feels 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.640
 as an expansion pack that a 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.500
 new game and over for a high price 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.220
 let's activision you know you can 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.220
 do better 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.770
 you're tired of the call of formula 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.120
 duty or you love her more than ever to share 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.120
