very different purposes as I know from

very different purposes as I know from
bitter<00:00:45.739> experience<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.910> cooker<00:00:47.330> wears<00:00:47.720> 400

you<00:00:50.630> think's<00:00:50.870> going<00:00:51.050> to<00:00:51.080> happen<00:00:51.140> well

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
you think's going to happen well

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.070 
you think's going to happen well
Aristotle<00:00:52.610> will<00:00:52.790> say<00:00:53.120> that<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.600> cooker<00:00:54.050> is

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
Aristotle will say that the cooker is

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.229 
Aristotle will say that the cooker is
going<00:00:54.350> to<00:00:54.410> fall<00:00:54.620> 400<00:00:55.340> times<00:00:55.580> as<00:00:55.820> fast<00:00:55.970> as<00:00:56.180> the

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
going to fall 400 times as fast as the

whereas<00:00:57.260> Galileo<00:00:57.770> will<00:00:58.100> maintain<00:00:58.580> that

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
whereas Galileo will maintain that

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.250 
whereas Galileo will maintain that
they'll<00:00:58.940> hit<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.150> ground<00:00:59.449> at<00:00:59.629> the<00:00:59.720> same<00:00:59.900> time

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
they'll hit the ground at the same time

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.380 
they'll hit the ground at the same time
I'm<00:01:00.770> with<00:01:01.040> Galileo<00:01:01.340> the<00:01:01.820> mass<00:01:02.120> of<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:02.360> object

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
I'm with Galileo the mass of the object

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.689 
I'm with Galileo the mass of the object
is<00:01:02.860> absolutely<00:01:03.860> nothing<00:01:04.010> to<00:01:04.250> do<00:01:04.400> with<00:01:04.580> the

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
is absolutely nothing to do with the

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:05.980 
is absolutely nothing to do with the
speed<00:01:04.970> with<00:01:05.239> which<00:01:05.270> it<00:01:05.540> will<00:01:05.660> fall

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
speed with which it will fall

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.330 
speed with which it will fall
I<00:01:06.020> think<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.380> cook<00:01:06.530> is<00:01:06.680> going<00:01:06.800> to<00:01:06.890> learn<00:01:07.040> first

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
I think the cook is going to learn first

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.550 
I think the cook is going to learn first
and<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:08.090> pillow<00:01:08.330> will<00:01:08.660> float<00:01:08.930> down<00:01:09.170> gently

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
and the pillow will float down gently

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.740 
and the pillow will float down gently
that's<00:01:09.860> 9<00:01:10.100> angle<00:01:10.550> it's<00:01:10.670> concise<00:01:11.030> millions<00:01:11.600> are

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
that's 9 angle it's concise millions are

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.410 
that's 9 angle it's concise millions are
gonna<00:01:11.840> fall<00:01:12.110> exactly<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.890> same<00:01:13.119> myth<00:01:14.119> has<00:01:14.390> it

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
gonna fall exactly the same myth has it

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.380 
gonna fall exactly the same myth has it

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
that lights and heavy objects fall at

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.800 
that lights and heavy objects fall at

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
the same speed by dropping two

the same speed by dropping two

think you'll find that it's me al goes

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:56.899 
think you'll find that it's me al goes
off<00:01:49.100> right<00:01:49.490> yeah<00:01:50.390> let<00:01:50.960> it<00:01:51.170> drop

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.700 

and<00:01:57.909> a<00:01:58.060> fellow<00:01:58.299> still<00:01:58.869> floats

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
and a fellow still floats

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.340 
and a fellow still floats
oh<00:01:59.770> that's<00:02:00.100> taking<00:02:00.579> I<00:02:00.789> doing<00:02:01.149> I<00:02:01.450> won<00:02:02.110> that

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
oh that's taking I doing I won that

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.059 
oh that's taking I doing I won that
round<00:02:02.619> there<00:02:03.929> the<00:02:04.929> cooker<00:02:05.350> goes<00:02:05.590> off<00:02:05.799> like<00:02:05.920> a

dramatically different ways we've got a

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
cannonball and the football what's going

cannonball and the football what's going
to<00:02:51.489> happen<00:02:51.700> John<00:02:51.910> well<00:02:52.209> Rick<00:02:52.569> I've<00:02:52.720> been

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
to happen John well Rick I've been

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.600 
to happen John well Rick I've been
having<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.170> think<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.709> I<00:02:53.829> reckon<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.400> lack<00:02:54.579> of

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
having a think and I reckon the lack of

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.280 
having a think and I reckon the lack of
aerodynamic<00:02:55.360> properties<00:02:55.510> of<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:55.989> pillow

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
aerodynamic properties of the pillow

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.050 
aerodynamic properties of the pillow
combined<00:02:56.709> with<00:02:56.980> its<00:02:57.100> relatively<00:02:57.489> low<00:02:57.639> mass

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
combined with its relatively low mass

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.849 
combined with its relatively low mass
meant<00:02:58.569> it<00:02:58.660> was<00:02:58.780> more<00:02:58.959> susceptible<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.620> air

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
meant it was more susceptible to air

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.099 
meant it was more susceptible to air
resistance<00:03:00.130> now<00:03:00.790> as<00:03:00.910> you<00:03:01.030> pointed<00:03:01.359> out<00:03:01.510> vastly

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
resistance now as you pointed out vastly

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.990 
resistance now as you pointed out vastly
different<00:03:02.500> masses<00:03:02.769> on<00:03:03.069> these<00:03:03.250> balls<00:03:03.489> but<00:03:03.910> the

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
different masses on these balls but the

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.970 
different masses on these balls but the
same<00:03:04.239> aerodynamic<00:03:05.019> shape<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:05.500> air<00:03:05.709> resistance

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
same aerodynamic shape so air resistance

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.740 
same aerodynamic shape so air resistance
shouldn't<00:03:06.579> be<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.730> factor<00:03:06.819> so<00:03:07.389> which<00:03:07.540> one's

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
shouldn't be a factor so which one's

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.270 
shouldn't be a factor so which one's
going<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:07.930> hit<00:03:08.049> the<00:03:08.139> ground<00:03:08.260> first<00:03:08.560> gonna<00:03:08.859> for

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
going to hit the ground first gonna for

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.039 
going to hit the ground first gonna for
the<00:03:09.519> same<00:03:09.760> rate<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.299> hit<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.600> ground<00:03:10.750> at<00:03:10.989> the

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
the same rate and hit the ground at the

the same rate and hit the ground at the
same<00:03:11.230> time<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.920> think<00:03:12.190> you'll<00:03:12.519> find<00:03:12.700> it's<00:03:12.910> the

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
same time I think you'll find it's the

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.660 
same time I think you'll find it's the
current<00:03:13.329> ball<00:03:13.510> no<00:03:13.930> no<00:03:14.319> no<00:03:14.590> no<00:03:15.160> no<00:03:15.400> I'm<00:03:15.519> gonna

current ball no no no no no I'm gonna

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.300 
current ball no no no no no I'm gonna
prove<00:03:15.970> you<00:03:16.209> wrong<00:03:16.359> for<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:17.500> first<00:03:17.769> time<00:03:18.100> in

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
prove you wrong for the first time in

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.240 
prove you wrong for the first time in
400<00:03:18.639> years<00:03:19.180> two<00:03:19.930> balls<00:03:20.230> of<00:03:20.530> different<00:03:20.769> weight

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
famous one key bell tower I have

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.349 
famous one key bell tower I have
absolute<00:03:26.680> faith<00:03:26.709> in<00:03:27.220> our<00:03:27.549> friend<00:03:27.849> Galileo

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
absolute faith in our friend Galileo

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.900 
absolute faith in our friend Galileo
what<00:03:28.900> an<00:03:29.019> iron<00:03:29.319> cannonball<00:03:30.099> yeah<00:03:30.549> in<00:03:30.639> a<00:03:30.700> brass

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
what an iron cannonball yeah in a brass

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.370 
what an iron cannonball yeah in a brass
cannon<00:03:31.269> ball<00:03:31.540> because<00:03:31.930> that's<00:03:32.079> a<00:03:32.170> football

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
cannon ball because that's a football

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.330 
cannon ball because that's a football
filter<00:03:32.859> there

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
filter there

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.039 
filter there
it<00:03:33.910> doesn't<00:03:34.239> matter<00:03:34.389> they're<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.810> same<00:03:34.989> shape

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
it doesn't matter they're the same shape

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.750 
it doesn't matter they're the same shape
so<00:03:35.680> they're<00:03:35.859> gonna<00:03:35.980> hit<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.310> ground<00:03:36.549> at

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
so they're gonna hit the ground at

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.920 
so they're gonna hit the ground at
exactly<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.419> same<00:03:37.569> time

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
exactly the same time

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:45.850 
exactly the same time
I<00:03:38.109> reckon<00:03:38.440> let<00:03:38.980> it<00:03:39.160> drop

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.190 

well<00:03:46.400> I

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.800 

so<00:03:51.830> another<00:03:52.280> result<00:03:52.700> that<00:03:52.940> only<00:03:53.150> a<00:03:53.270> man<00:03:53.510> who's

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
so another result that only a man who's

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.330 
so another result that only a man who's
taken<00:03:54.020> complete<00:03:54.680> leave<00:03:54.709> of<00:03:55.010> his<00:03:55.310> senses

taken complete leave of his senses

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.180 
taken complete leave of his senses
wouldn't<00:03:56.270> describe<00:03:56.690> as<00:03:56.840> a<00:03:56.870> total<00:03:57.440> victory<00:03:57.680> for

wouldn't describe as a total victory for

wouldn't describe as a total victory for
Aristotle<00:04:00.459> which<00:04:01.459> landed<00:04:01.910> first<00:04:02.150> well

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
Aristotle which landed first well

technically<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:04.010> cannonball<00:04:04.670> goes<00:04:05.030> it

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
technically the cannonball goes it

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.240 
technically the cannonball goes it
technically<00:04:05.959> it<00:04:06.080> did<00:04:06.319> I've<00:04:06.770> got<00:04:06.980> a<00:04:07.010> theory

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
technically it did I've got a theory

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.370 
technically it did I've got a theory
about<00:04:07.520> it<00:04:07.700> though<00:04:08.030> yeah<00:04:08.330> light<00:04:08.720> objects<00:04:09.170> like

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
about it though yeah light objects like

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.930 
about it though yeah light objects like
the<00:04:09.530> football<00:04:09.770> will<00:04:10.130> only<00:04:10.250> accelerate<00:04:10.550> for<00:04:10.910> a

resistance<00:04:20.930> isn't<00:04:21.500> such<00:04:21.709> a<00:04:21.739> factor<00:04:22.310> it<00:04:22.460> won't

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
resistance isn't such a factor it won't

reach<00:04:22.940> its<00:04:23.150> terminal<00:04:23.570> velocity<00:04:23.600> so<00:04:24.380> what<00:04:24.470> do

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
reach its terminal velocity so what do

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.930 
reach its terminal velocity so what do
we<00:04:24.590> know<00:04:24.740> about<00:04:24.860> that<00:04:25.100> we'd<00:04:25.370> like<00:04:25.550> to<00:04:25.700> have<00:04:25.790> the

experiment in the nailers vacuum and

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.200 
experiment in the nailers vacuum and
then<00:04:27.620> air<00:04:27.770> resistance<00:04:28.040> wouldn't<00:04:28.520> be<00:04:28.610> a<00:04:28.639> factor

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
then air resistance wouldn't be a factor

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.730 
then air resistance wouldn't be a factor
well<00:04:29.419> we<00:04:29.630> couldn't<00:04:29.870> arrange<00:04:30.169> for<00:04:30.410> an<00:04:30.470> airless
