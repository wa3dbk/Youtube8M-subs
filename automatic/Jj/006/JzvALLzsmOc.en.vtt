00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 five years the project of the 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.680
 new stadium el monterrey to publicity 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.110
 that there was going to be a stadium for the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.730
 monterrey then at this moment I 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.730
 I directed the right people 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.230
 then I asked them for the opportunity 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.830
 participate in the project because there was 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.779
 all logically seats a thousand things that 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.660
 takes a football stadium the screens 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.000
 etcetera then in the end I settled what 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.879
 that was the seats I remember that 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.820
 I had in this football a day once I 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.890
 agreement that you presented us with a pasture 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.809
 Synthetic grass tape that we put it 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.390
 in tijuana which is the current champion of 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.089
 Mexican football is that grass studios and 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.839
 that we put it and we passed it to 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.110
 chivas 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.520
 right now we put jaguars America 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.770
 we have put several but the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.969
 training yes in this stadium was 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.140
 chivas omnilife and alone and currently 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.329
 well I 'm not the can 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.640
 manage yours if engines say 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.570
 representative of the company of lg 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.940
 made ss ss pasture grass comes from 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.160
 belgium of belgium of the group of that is 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.380
 by system that is a company of the 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.420
 most important globally them 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.430
 usually puts a lot of synthetic grass 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.000
 for football teams 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.940
 dallas cowboys the very first level is 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.190
 ok and in europe el santiago bernabÃ©u 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.360
 it has for synthetic but it has one step 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.270
 synthetic that is a synthetic grass 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.700
 hybrid and barcelona has a grass 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.100
 hybrid that is grateful hybrid 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.369
 hybrid is natural grass is sown 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.229
 It is allowed to grow to 50 millimeters 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.240
 sow 20 million fibers 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.260
 synthetic with a special machine that 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.420
 has a group of that 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.460
 then at the moment it rains or 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.860
 what happens is very well rooted 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.620
 moor and it always looks green the field does not 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.940
 there is no wear anywhere 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.880
 then the cutting of the machine is and 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.760
 is very well calibrated at 50 to 60 for 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.410
 that does not cut synthetic then its paste 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.630
 You always know it's something I will 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.000
 I suggest you are letting yourself be understood 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.540
 then the Bernabeu grass and the 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.280
 Barcelona's pasture have half resigned 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.290
 synthetic and it's natural picture is 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.360
 right is the hybrid is the hybrid 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.090
 some other stadium here in mexico that 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.190
 have hybrid none I am not 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.050
 suggesting I suggested it to the monterrey 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.510
 at a certain moment in the stadium 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.850
 new if in the new stadium but and are 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.590
 of course natural and I am 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.690
 suggesting tigers in an increased if 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.920
 they want to change this so they're going 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.590
 being to all the infrastructure of the 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:43.269
 stadium like this in all the changes 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.879
 a grandstand flown for 15,000 more in the 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:49.599
 volcano stadium in fact I am 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:52.209

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.280
 seats god I am competing hopefully 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.500
 and I'm doing very well but here is with the 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.360
 group of applauses from Spain or that 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.760
 representative me of the group of squares 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.580
 together with the company that I manage or that 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.379
 I represent as manager and hopefully and I go 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.629
 ok but we're working on 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.970
 different areas ok with monterrey you was 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.739
 well with Monterrey, it went well for us 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.450
 The seats were awarded a 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.319
 contract was signed last week 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.280
 Wednesday 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.769
 came the hussein company from the USA 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.290
 the Americans came the directors 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.239
 the joint business manager with the 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.650
 company from us that will be photosport 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.650

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.629
 ical stadium and we are very pleased 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.230
 the monterrey armchair produces one thing 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:37.379
 it's an armchair that's called fusion because 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.670
 we made a fusion of two seats to one 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.709
 and it really is a very comfortable armchair 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.630
 spectacular as abel in so 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.299
 we go to chivas with an armchair that 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.579
 olympic flame ok that is very beautiful is 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.069
 a spectacular armchair leaves the pretty 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.470
 that is comfortable because there are some plates in 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.910
 that sits one and attracts the guy behind 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:01.090
 He does not leave you because he puts your feet 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:04.359
 forward with the high backing that has 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.599
 been assigned airplane seat or are they 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.489
 this one as he put an hour and 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.959
 mean a program to show in the 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.389
 seat because the truth is seats 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.400
 ergonomic that are wet they gave 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.870
 the program his program killed 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.180
 you bring in the chair here the 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.729
 We teach the public when you want 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.740
 but of course it is the chair that is going to have 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:26.349
 the new stadium of the football club 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.300

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:31.000
 it is called multiple or as it is called 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.340
 merger issue because it 's merger because 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.389
 many European companies from 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.490

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.610

 with sports equipment because 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.860
 then in the end we had to compete 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:53.259
 with many from your world then 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.750
 fortunately in qualifying we went 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.460

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.340
