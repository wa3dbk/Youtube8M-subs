00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.300
 hello tankers with you but no, and so 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.550
 It was started from the first days of its foundation 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.329
 of my channel to send me often 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.419
 your replays 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:27.460
 with requests to make a video below him 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.369
 I thought and thought and came to this 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.910
 why not to gash pilot 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.370
 release 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.680
 Well, so to speak rubric of battles for your 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.570
 replays have a look at how much you 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.070
 it is interesting to write in 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.920
 comments what do you think of this 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.710
 occasion and also planned rewards for 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.260
 that your replay will fall into this category 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.399
 Well, there is nothing more to add 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.760
 let's go directly to the replays and 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.410
 why did I choose this particular fight 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.989
 replays send me a person under one name 1 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.940
 part judging because it is in the hangar of 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.530
 Tops only one potter I 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.910
 I think you need to be Einstein them to 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.160
 conduct a causal relationship 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.379
 between his nickname and technology in the hangar 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.170
 what will happen then when the hangar will still 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.080
 we don't have any other tops 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.690
 one stream one pad plays one poet on 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.450
 medium tank seventh level 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.940
 american t20 who wears proudly 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.240
 title of the best st7 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.910
 and why along the way I will tell also 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.550
 I think of me and many of you always 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.560
 I was interested in the question of how to play here 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.020
 achieve good combat performance 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.349
 statistics and in order to lift the veil 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.709
 secrets I chose this replay player with 

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:37.390
 by one 

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:39.729
 one pad has no less 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.780
 fifty eight and a half percent 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.780
 account wins 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.869
 I absolutely do not care 1 you him 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.179
 account or not the main thing is what skills 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.170
 man possesses a given period of time 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:56.619
 but the balance is 20 62 percent over 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.840
 more than 1300 fights as achieved 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.030
 such indicators are not about this fight and 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.200
 show us one pad 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.629
 Well, as you know, the T20 tank is not at all 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.310
 possessing armor and average he was called 

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:11.319
 it seems to me only because he is a little 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.510
 more than easy but less than 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.330
 heavy so what with this unit 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.910
 hope for free ricochets and armor 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.560
 in general there is no possibility only verified 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.569
 thoughtful actions may lead you 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.569
 to victory and help you with it 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:30.019
 a list of the advantages of this machine and it 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:33.230
 cannon with good alpha 240 and review 390 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.670
 meters and dynamics still pleasantly please 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.999
 Vertical American angles 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.939
 10 degrees weapons are available that 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:42.819
 superfluous never indicators 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:45.439
 accuracy and information 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.629
 trager of course but we are not laser 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:48.950
 vision correction we do yes so what 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.079
 if it comes down to the end 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.569
 as our hero does in cold blood 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:56.870
 today's video will be like you 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:59.510
 if you wish, gentlemen driver up to 20 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.120
 behaves exceptionally neatly he 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.549
 perfectly aware that only lazy 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.879
 the enemy team is not choosing t20 as 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:11.209
 priority target of 10 out of 15 opponents 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:14.150
 gladly inject alpha 300 plus yes there 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.879
 even Christmas trees with 90 calibers of 240 alpha each 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.629
 but the trees have already been logged 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:22.549
 by now so forget about them 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:25.129
 Here is our hero 1100 x n 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.840
 don't tell me how they fly away 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.689
 under a focused enemy fire 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.729
 tanks someone may manifest 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:35.840
 discontent like tank tactics 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:38.060
 combat but T20 support tank there 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.849
 second line player under one nickname 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.859
 let you down in this situation 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.109
 exceptionally correct as a textbook 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:48.069
 and I think more discontent will cause 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:51.349
 you for example before your eyes 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.810
 forward on a bunch of trunks flew half a lot 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:56.150
 20 would try to tank by port because 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.669
 angle would receive several Pike 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.120
 went to the hangar that's what's for you 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:04.759
 Ally more useful here and I about the same 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.729
 that's why it's called the theater of the military 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:11.269
 action where everyone should play exactly 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:14.389
 his assigned role by the way with this case 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:17.269
 we have big problems in the game but this 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:20.750
 video is not about that while we are away from the topic 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.000
 1 pack continues to methodically send to 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.699
 opponents projectile behind the projectile to the city 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.380
 he does not climb there to do nothing to tank 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.930
 nothing and take advantage of the corners 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.400
 vertical focusing anywhere so its 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.840
 map positioning 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.820
 I think extremely true 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.490
 and thanks to their verified actions 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.530
 but does not tip the scales to the side 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.530
 defeat your team and score 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.310
 approximately equal plus or minus 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.080
 here I think you as well then I 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.479
 noticed such moments here look at 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.360
 the result of the battle where you merged started 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:57.030
 well, or there is the middle and you know what is not 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.370
 I pushed off and Wang I used this time 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.949
 there would be a victory for my little 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.410
 influence on the course of the battle was not enough here 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:07.590
 literally a couple of shots and a fight 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.470
 It would be in our favor and I for some reason climbed 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.020
 where it is not necessary so here everything 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.479
 otherwise without heroism and fob porto 20 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.360
 does his job and leads his team 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.400
 victory by the way please note that our 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.860
 the hero does not spend his hp 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.820
 this is another point that costs everyone 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.880
 Make a note 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.520
 it is always sad when that's like 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.160
 and the denouement is close like you won 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.440
 left alone against one but you and 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.889
 your ally vanshotny and here on you 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.630
 leaves this one remaining for example 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:42.750
 Ful Tiger 1 and all 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.600
 and defeat so as they say take care 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.580
 Hub with its young can then still wants 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.520
 for expensive sell well or pay 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.889
 defeat if not remove what 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.800
 similarly the driver then 2010 always 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:57.900
 can be judged by his consumables he carries 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.450
 who does it mean to burn and he is not going 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.880
 and accordingly do not collect to receive 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.700
 damage another plus piggy bank faithful 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.160
 solutions since creed iii modulo t20 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:11.099
 phenomenon is not uncommon so 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.349
 better safe than sorry Serb well as the 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:15.900
 time, our heroes are already offensive to the frags 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:17.070
 on account and if a little bit more 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.520
 lucky with breaking through 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:23.700
 it would be more interesting but 160 millimeters 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.139
 breakdown is not the ultimate dream of gradually fighting 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.780
 coming to its logical conclusion 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:31.050
 and if you take into account the amount 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:35.039
 damage that already have a piggy bank 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:37.349
 t20 it becomes clear who should be 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:39.419
 grateful to the team and whose correct 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:42.750
 actions eventually led to 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:44.580
 victory and that's exactly the situation 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.800
 when you kept your hobby for 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.440
 fight and you can without undue strain 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.610
 exchange it for another frag and order 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.520
 more judging by how 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:56.970
 happy finger akim at our tank gun 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:00.390
 u is on well what benito should have been 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:03.900
 would be common to withdraw 22 and a half 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:06.750
 thousand experience made more than four thousand 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.770
 damage and could ridley take but not all 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.230
 carnival carnival 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:13.560
 yes your competent behavior on the battlefield 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:16.770
 I will reward the player with the nickname one potpan patients with 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.669
 M22 code on locust general wanted by t 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.340
 127 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:22.710
 but since the player has an account only 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:26.580
 American tanks will not move away from 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:29.760
 traditions so beware sandbox one 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.980
 pad goes to you well, but they themselves did not 

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.140
 subscribe to the channel leave your 

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.100
 comments about being or not to be 

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.840
 this category 

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:40.140
 if i am to create a topic in a group 

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:42.570
 VKontakte where I will describe in detail why where 

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.110
 and as there you will throw off your 

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.780
 replays 

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.310
 for now it's time for us to say goodbye 

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:51.320
 Like and subscribe to the channel 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.320
 I love all-kisses for now
