00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.530
 hello Polynesians this time I'm going to 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.840
 teach how to make one of my desserts 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.599
 favorites that is dancing strawberries with 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.270
 blackberry see this delicious recipe 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.770
 super rich and the best of all is that no 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.770
 you need an oven to make them 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.609
 in your blender you are going to take a pack 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.470
 full of cookies Mary and you're going to 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.570
 liquefy very well remember that when 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.640
 do this step your blender has to 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.730
 be dry what you finished 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.250
 liquefy cookies now we're going to 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.559
 base in a glass bowl a bar 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.230
 of butter of 90 grams and with a 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.300
 fork you will stir it very well not 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.940
 it has to be so doughy but if 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.390
 It revolves very well now we are going to 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.909
 cover a refractory with aluminum with 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.010
 careful not to break the aluminum 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.719
 time to cover contacting me 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.190
 now let's take our mix of 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.379
 cookie and with a glass that you have to 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.380
 be flat below you're going to start 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:12.060
 Crush care that you can not very 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.740
 thick the crust nor too thin 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.770
 the thing is the part of cookie that goes 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.560
 under the bread or this is that we are 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.340
 doing to know how thick it was 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.590
 they can use their fork and it 's art how 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.630
 thick that if it was very thin throw it 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.000
 a little more if it was too thick and 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.080
 as well 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.720
 and we're going to let it rest, let's use 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.750
 250ml whipping cream that 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.330
 that's equivalent to a cup and we're going to 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.010
 put in a bowl and let's beat remember 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.619
 that the whipped cream has to be fine 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.350
 cold and so we have to stay our 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.350
 whipped cream we will keep it in the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.960
 refri while doing the other mixture in 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.000
 a ripe bowl in container 380 grams of 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.800
 cream cheese remembers having them out of the 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.410
 reinforcer so that when we kill him 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.330
 it's much easier since we beat it 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.509
 super good and it was like a creampie 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:08.110
 let's throw the fruit I'm going to 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.700
 put blackberry and fronts and we're going to 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.650
 beat beat it very well until it 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.650
 no piece of fruit left 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.590
 since we beat well now we are going to 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.650
 pour half a cup of icing sugar or 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.590
 normal sugar and incorporate all this 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.360
 beating it very well now in a glass 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.000
 you are going to put an envelope of 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.000
 grenetina to this one you're going to take four 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.880
 tablespoons of very cold water and you're going to 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.590
 stir very well you wait 15 seconds to 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.480
 that is spent on tim and then the 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.480
 Microwave for 10 seconds 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.740
 your card and ship is ready when 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.990
 is well liquid let's take the 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.330
 our mix moving very fast in 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.610
 this step you have to hurry because the 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.230
 Grenetin returns to a solid state 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.160
 then you have to do it very fast 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.470
 now we throw out our whipped cream 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.190
 remember to save a little to decorate and 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.620
 we incorporate it gently 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.840
 and finally we are going to take our 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.120
 mix to our container and with a 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.400
 Spatula you spread the mixture very well 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.550
 look very well to cover all the 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.380
 edges and you will put it for 5 hours at 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.660
 refrigerator and you will see it to look good 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.750
 durito so I can serve it now 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.140
 carefully you will grab the part of the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.700
 aluminum and will take out 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.940
 the country 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.580
 and now you're going to start removing the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.050
 aluminum with care can help you with 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.910
 a knife 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.310
 and now if we are going to cut it for 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.440
 face it with a smooth knife you go to 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.880
 cut it into small squares without the 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.280
 knife is left you mix of pay 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.200
 clean it with warm water and return to 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.330
 cut so that you are perfect the 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.020
 country squares later you go to 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.570
 silver 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.000
 you can decorate it with rupert and with 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.430
 compresses also and remember the rest 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.920
 that we have stopped cream you can not use 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.080
 to decorate it and that's it, our 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.810
 country of cheese with strawberries and blackberries 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.960
 here the results of our dance 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.930
 is super rich and remember that always 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.210
 you have to serve cold Polynesians if 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.370
 they liked this recipe like friends 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.739

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.570
 more like our recipe and that 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.900
 other tutorials want me to teach them 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.940
 to do 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.680

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:30.200

 let's see how it was 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.830
 Y 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.830

 they were left and best of all is that 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:59.610
 you need and you do not get the cheese 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.890
 Parmesan you can use the same cheese 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.710
 that you used for the inside 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.610

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.830
