it<00:02:41.940> at<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.360> center<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.440> aardman<00:02:44.040> gives

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
it at the center of it the aardman gives

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.540 
it at the center of it the aardman gives
everything<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:46.080> even<00:02:46.320> though<00:02:46.560> this<00:02:46.709> is<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:46.890> 3d

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
everything and even though this is a 3d

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.360 
everything and even though this is a 3d
of<00:02:48.090> monster<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:49.170> still<00:02:49.620> has<00:02:50.010> an<00:02:50.910> adman<00:02:51.570> soul
