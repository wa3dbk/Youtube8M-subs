by three does this very accurately it
uses<00:00:45.690> impedance<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.530> track<00:00:47.070> into<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.610> root<00:00:47.850> of

uses impedance to track into the root of
the<00:00:48.510> joint<00:00:50.000> so<00:00:51.000> what<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.449> here<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.870> two

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
the joint so what we have here is two

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.619 
the joint so what we have here is two
half-inch<00:00:52.860> plates<00:00:53.250> there's<00:00:54.000> no<00:00:54.180> gap<00:00:54.420> at<00:00:54.600> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
start of the joint and there's a four

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.069 
start of the joint and there's a four
millimeter<00:00:56.460> gap<00:00:56.850> at<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.210> end<00:00:57.360> here<00:00:57.780> as<00:00:57.989> you

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
millimeter gap at the end here as you

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.380 
millimeter gap at the end here as you
can<00:00:58.170> see<00:00:58.320> now<00:00:58.980> we're<00:00:59.640> simulation<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
can see now we're simulation the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.630 
can see now we're simulation the
tracking<00:01:00.629> at<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> moment<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:02.340> actually

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
tracking at the moment and it's actually

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.979 
tracking at the moment and it's actually
going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> programmed<00:01:03.390> point<00:01:03.690> which<00:01:03.899> is

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
going to the programmed point which is

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.350 
going to the programmed point which is
about<00:01:04.170> half<00:01:04.470> an<00:01:04.619> inch<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.129> fresh<00:01:05.610> air<00:01:05.850> not

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
about half an inch out in fresh air not

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.210 
about half an inch out in fresh air not
in<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> root<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> joint<00:01:07.290> itself<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:08.100> a

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
in the root of the joint itself in a

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.740 
in the root of the joint itself in a
minute<00:01:08.490> we'll<00:01:08.670> be<00:01:08.700> switching<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.299> arc<00:01:09.479> and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
minute we'll be switching on the arc and

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.600 
minute we'll be switching on the arc and
the<00:01:09.810> tracking<00:01:10.530> will<00:01:10.770> begin<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the tracking will begin and the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.880 
the tracking will begin and the
impedance<00:01:11.909> will<00:01:12.390> be<00:01:12.600> controlling<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.290> arc<00:01:13.470> to

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
impedance will be controlling the arc to

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.020 
impedance will be controlling the arc to
keep<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.220> into<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> root<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.880> joint<00:01:17.030> so

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
keep it into the root of the joint so

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.969 
keep it into the root of the joint so
you<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.240> clearly<00:01:18.479> see<00:01:18.750> here<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.380> final<00:01:19.740> path

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
you can clearly see here the final path

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.340 
you can clearly see here the final path
point<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:21.270> good<00:01:21.659> half<00:01:21.869> an<00:01:22.020> inch<00:01:22.140> off<00:01:24.350> what

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
point is a good half an inch off what

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.140 
point is a good half an inch off what
you're<00:01:25.500> seeing<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.640> arc<00:01:26.909> is

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
you're seeing is the the arc is

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.179 
you're seeing is the the arc is
oscillating<00:01:27.570> from<00:01:27.990> left<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.380> right<00:01:28.650> it's

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
oscillating from left to right it's

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.789 
oscillating from left to right it's
tracking<00:01:30.000> from<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.240> two<00:01:30.390> phases<00:01:30.900> using<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
tracking from the two phases using the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.770 
tracking from the two phases using the
impedance<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.430> keep<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.820> centrally<00:01:33.540> tracked

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
impedance to keep it centrally tracked

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.380 
impedance to keep it centrally tracked
in<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:33.990> roof<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.439> joint<00:01:34.970> so<00:01:35.970> here<00:01:36.180> we<00:01:36.270> have

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
in the roof of the joint so here we have

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.539 
in the roof of the joint so here we have
the<00:01:36.540> samples<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> half-inch<00:01:37.710> steel<00:01:37.829> you

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
the samples for the half-inch steel you

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.859 
the samples for the half-inch steel you
can<00:01:38.700> see<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.030> program<00:01:39.479> point<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
can see the program point in the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.960 
can see the program point in the
beginning<00:01:40.290> how<00:01:40.770> we<00:01:40.829> tracked<00:01:41.250> along<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.820> end

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
beginning how we tracked along the end

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.719 
beginning how we tracked along the end
to<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.020> gap<00:01:43.229> that's<00:01:43.470> opened<00:01:44.159> up<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.520> four

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
to the gap that's opened up to four

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.420 
to the gap that's opened up to four
millimeters<00:01:45.439> we've<00:01:46.439> successfully<00:01:46.890> tracked

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
millimeters we've successfully tracked

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.890 
millimeters we've successfully tracked
the<00:01:47.700> whole<00:01:47.909> length<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.420> weld

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.540 

from<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.560> demonstration<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.220> clearly

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
from the demonstration you can clearly

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.340 
from the demonstration you can clearly
see<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.850> we<00:01:54.090> track<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.510> joint<00:01:54.750> now<00:01:55.200> we're

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
see that we track the joint now we're
