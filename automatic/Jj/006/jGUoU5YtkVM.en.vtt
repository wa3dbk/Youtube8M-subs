00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:14.199
 hello to all the friends of giba network e 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.360
 of ex projects welcome to the first 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.980
 episode of the series we learn redstone 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.250
 that will introduce you is complicated but 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.840
 efficient world of red stone not that 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.579
 I can categorize it as one of the most 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.529
 absolute good but I will try to 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.360
 help you learn to build houses 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.119
 hidden doors that open with a 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.070
 different timer and much more there 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.260
 will mainly be ported from video to 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.120
 youtube already present so as to facilitate 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.410
 of the realization with a comment 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.120
 all Italian 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.380
 good vision, hello to all friends 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.380
 says inva network 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.180
 the first thing to know when talking 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.850
 deadly to understand the fundamentals 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.980
 and the basics of red sonja a material 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.320
 obtainable by destroying blocks of 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.059
 this kind that can be used 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.610
 to create mechanisms in the world of 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.340
 minecraft as door traps 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.920
 automatic reconstruction systems 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.290
 automatic there are some elements 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.170
 important to know about redstone 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.540
 dust direction obtained when blasting 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.270
 so they destroy the blocks of rezzo esco 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.509
 a block of raw redzone will leave 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.640
 dropping 45 dust director the block 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.860
 reds must not be undermined and destroyed 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.009
 usually with a small iron or 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.170
 better than it to redzone dust 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.780
 this is positioned on each block 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.240
 like earth stone blocks of iron for 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.190
 create a bread connection system 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.570
 except ice and glass and all 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.880
 the blocks that can be activated only 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.940
 via red son or buttons and derivatives 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.310
 as relevant in a box etc. east and the 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.049
 blind furnaces a made instead for i 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.250
 allison juke box can be 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.040
 positioned the redzone powder can 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.470
 be connected connected either by way 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.170
 straight therefore without interruptions either 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.000
 upside down or decent a block for 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.009
 connect the blocks that are above or 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.140
 under others never try to 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.360
 place the red only on the side from you 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.209
 desired indeed it will be necessary 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.400
 position it only above the date block 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.970
 advanced gaming system will provide 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.220
 automatically to connect it if a 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.810
 block is positioned diagonally 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.250
 the red is a can connect 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.410
 on the other side 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.940
 except for glass like 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.100
 shown in the video see in the video how 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.670
 the razon arrives up to 15 blocks 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.560
 power 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.540
 after which it dies and generates more 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.209
 important to see also how at the beginning 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.980
 is of a light red reddish color 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.940
 while towards the end you become of a 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.680
 darker color 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.540
 this however does not diminish the power 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.910
 of the repsol to the fifteenth block 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.910
 the energy will be equal and equal to 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.260
 the one in the first position 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.250
 the second thing you need to know 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.830
 about the red 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.910
 and that to activate it and to make it 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.520
 effective 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.680
 obviously we need some 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.930
 activators the rexton connection can 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.680
 be activated in more ways with gods 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.150
 buttons 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.710
 pressing a button will activate the 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.860
 current for about a second 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.620
 precisely 0.9 thousandths of a second 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.200
 after which the flow will stop with the 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.930
 levers activating the lever will be generated 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.880
 constant energy flow until 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.430
 the activator will not be closed with the 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.100
 crÃ¨che flat by lena a player or a 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.380
 mob will activate the redstone circuit when 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.060
 will be positioned above the pressure play yes 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.100
 instead it will stop when it is not there 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.350
 pressure inside the player from this 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.620
 type of pressure plate has the 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.290
 characteristic of being able to be also 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.750
 activated by drop of objects 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.520
 User stone flash will be equal to 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.040
 the wooden one with the difference that 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.320
 you can't use it you could 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.550
 use drop ati objects for 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.350
 make it work 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.060
 the langston torch is finally active 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.310
 energy without the possibility of being able to 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.870
 be deactivated or reactivated in any 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.549
 moment we arrived at the end of 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.130
 our adventure shown in point 3 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.690
 perhaps the most important one 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.220
 I learned how different activators 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.380
 they can make the circuit work 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.000
 rexton in such a way as to make it work 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.250
 machinery and various things 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.049
 there are some methods for energy 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.209
 can be transmitted from ours 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.660
 activator to the object in question 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.150
 let's see how activator can be 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.860
 positioned near or adjacent 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.770
 the object 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.660
 the current can flow under the current 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.290
 of the activator except for the 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:42.070
 redstone torch the current can flow 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:44.410
 on the top of the object and the 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.190
 current can flow below the 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.080
 cast in these two variants when the 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.550
 redzone runs parallel to a 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.730
 activatable object tends to create 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:59.560
 problems as shown in the video 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.450
 current where they instead pass on 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.950
 upper part of the object should not 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.150
 cause problems and mechanism 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.150
 should work properly 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.500
 for today it's all about kids we learn 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.680
 rexton are the ex giuseppe projects 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.980
 miani and this video has been proposed on 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.600
 jim buss network a greeting to all e 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.600
 see you soon. Bye
