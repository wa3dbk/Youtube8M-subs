00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:03.800 

everybody<00:00:02.429> now<00:00:02.970> let's<00:00:03.179> do<00:00:03.330> some<00:00:03.510> punnett

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
everybody now let's do some punnett

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.809 
everybody now let's do some punnett
squares<00:00:04.080> when<00:00:04.830> I<00:00:04.859> do<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.130> punnett<00:00:05.490> square<00:00:05.730> the

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
squares when I do a punnett square the

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.579 
squares when I do a punnett square the
first<00:00:05.879> thing<00:00:06.270> I<00:00:06.359> always<00:00:06.390> do<00:00:06.870> is<00:00:07.020> I<00:00:07.140> write<00:00:07.379> out

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
first thing I always do is I write out

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.580 
first thing I always do is I write out
exactly<00:00:08.220> what<00:00:08.550> each<00:00:08.820> allele<00:00:09.240> codes<00:00:09.570> for<00:00:09.929> so

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
exactly what each allele codes for so

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.220 
exactly what each allele codes for so
for<00:00:10.950> example<00:00:11.059> what<00:00:12.059> I've<00:00:12.210> chosen<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.780> do<00:00:13.019> today

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
for example what I've chosen to do today

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.200 
for example what I've chosen to do today
is<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:14.009> color<00:00:14.670> so<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.809> big<00:00:16.260> brief<00:00:16.560> big<00:00:17.100> be<00:00:17.520> Tim's

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
is I color so a big brief big be Tim's

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.450 
is I color so a big brief big be Tim's
for<00:00:18.510> brown<00:00:18.750> eyes<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.410> little<00:00:19.740> B<00:00:19.890> stands<00:00:20.340> for

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
for brown eyes and a little B stands for

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.000 
for brown eyes and a little B stands for
blue<00:00:20.910> eyes<00:00:21.150> let's<00:00:21.930> try<00:00:22.289> an<00:00:22.350> example<00:00:22.500> with

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
blue eyes let's try an example with

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.250 
blue eyes let's try an example with
homozygous<00:00:23.400> dominant<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.750> homozygous

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
homozygous dominant and a homozygous

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.390 
homozygous dominant and a homozygous
recessive<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.470> said<00:00:28.470> homozygous<00:00:29.070> which

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
recessive so I said homozygous which

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.849 
recessive so I said homozygous which
means<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.880> should<00:00:29.910> be<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.359> same<00:00:30.720> letter<00:00:31.560> and

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
means it should be the same letter and

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.830 
means it should be the same letter and
dominant<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:32.910> they<00:00:33.030> should<00:00:33.210> be<00:00:33.239> capital

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
dominant so they should be capital

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.790 
dominant so they should be capital
letters<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.320> we're<00:00:34.469> going<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.800> have<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.340> big<00:00:35.880> be

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
letters so we're going to have a big be

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.670 
letters so we're going to have a big be
Big<00:00:37.800> B<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:39.120> homozygous<00:00:39.570> recessive<00:00:40.440> which

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
Big B and a homozygous recessive which

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.170 
Big B and a homozygous recessive which
is<00:00:40.860> going<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.219> be<00:00:41.660> little<00:00:42.660> be<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.230> little<00:00:43.800> bit

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
is going to be little be a little bit

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.160 
is going to be little be a little bit
now<00:00:46.100> this<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.340> genotype<00:00:48.030> Big<00:00:48.420> D<00:00:48.600> Big<00:00:48.629> D<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
now this is the genotype Big D Big D the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.439 
now this is the genotype Big D Big D the
phenotype<00:00:49.710> for<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.039> should<00:00:50.250> be<00:00:50.399> brown<00:00:51.149> eyes

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
phenotype for this should be brown eyes

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.730 
phenotype for this should be brown eyes
because<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.230> has<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> capital<00:00:52.949> letter<00:00:53.070> there

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:53.740 
because it has a capital letter there

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.070 
because it has a capital letter there
our<00:00:53.890> little<00:00:54.580> B<00:00:54.850> little<00:00:54.880> B<00:00:55.180> is<00:00:55.510> going<00:00:55.780> to<00:00:55.900> be

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
our little B little B is going to be

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.410 
our little B little B is going to be
blue<00:00:56.740> eyes<00:00:56.950> there<00:00:57.220> are<00:00:57.400> no<00:00:57.580> dominant<00:00:58.090> alleles

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
blue eyes there are no dominant alleles

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.540 
blue eyes there are no dominant alleles
present<00:00:58.540> so<00:00:59.200> the<00:00:59.440> recessive<00:00:59.800> shows<00:01:00.220> through

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
present so the recessive shows through

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.300 
present so the recessive shows through
so<00:01:01.120> we<00:01:01.270> have<00:01:01.480> a<00:01:01.810> brown-eyed<00:01:02.380> individual<00:01:03.010> and<00:01:03.220> a

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
so we have a brown-eyed individual and a

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.830 
so we have a brown-eyed individual and a
blue<00:01:03.490> eyed<00:01:03.670> individual<00:01:04.240> that<00:01:04.600> are<00:01:04.690> going<00:01:04.780> to

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:04.840 
blue eyed individual that are going to

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.900 
blue eyed individual that are going to
be<00:01:04.930> having<00:01:05.050> babies<00:01:05.470> so<00:01:06.160> we're<00:01:06.640> going<00:01:06.760> to<00:01:06.850> put

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
be having babies so we're going to put

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.670 
be having babies so we're going to put
the<00:01:07.090> data<00:01:07.270> up<00:01:07.420> at<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.660> top<00:01:07.840> we're<00:01:08.470> going<00:01:08.590> to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
the data up at the top we're going to

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.800 
the data up at the top we're going to
split<00:01:08.920> up<00:01:09.100> these<00:01:09.280> alleles<00:01:09.670> so<00:01:10.150> we<00:01:10.270> have<00:01:10.420> a<00:01:10.450> big

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
split up these alleles so we have a big

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.650 
split up these alleles so we have a big
big<00:01:11.050> big<00:01:12.010> b<00:01:12.250> and<00:01:12.640> over<00:01:12.910> on<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.180> side<00:01:13.390> we're

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
big big b and over on the side we're

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.960 
big big b and over on the side we're
going<00:01:13.810> to<00:01:13.900> have<00:01:14.080> a<00:01:14.260> little<00:01:14.500> bit<00:01:14.850> little<00:01:15.850> bit

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
going to have a little bit little bit

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.570 
going to have a little bit little bit
now<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.260> way<00:01:17.380> we<00:01:17.530> do<00:01:17.650> a<00:01:17.680> Punnett<00:01:18.100> Square<00:01:18.130> is

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
now the way we do a Punnett Square is

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.340 
now the way we do a Punnett Square is
you're<00:01:18.760> just<00:01:18.880> going<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.090> bring<00:01:19.300> each<00:01:19.540> letter

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
you're just going to bring each letter

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.500 
you're just going to bring each letter
down<00:01:20.680> and<00:01:20.980> fill<00:01:21.190> in<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.460> boxes<00:01:21.820> kind<00:01:22.300> of<00:01:22.420> like

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
down and fill in the boxes kind of like

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.150 
down and fill in the boxes kind of like
a<00:01:22.540> time<00:01:22.780> stable<00:01:23.110> when<00:01:23.230> you<00:01:23.380> did<00:01:23.560> those<00:01:23.710> when

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
a time stable when you did those when

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.650 
a time stable when you did those when
you're<00:01:24.310> low<00:01:24.520> we're<00:01:25.120> going<00:01:25.240> to<00:01:25.300> take<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.510> big

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
you're low we're going to take the big

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.950 
you're low we're going to take the big
be<00:01:25.840> down<00:01:26.580> big<00:01:27.580> me<00:01:27.729> down<00:01:29.040> take<00:01:30.040> me<00:01:30.220> down<00:01:30.960> baby

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
be down big me down take me down baby

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.480 
be down big me down take me down baby
down<00:01:32.410> then<00:01:32.950> you're<00:01:33.040> going<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.190> bring<00:01:33.340> the

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
down then you're going to bring the

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.830 
down then you're going to bring the
little<00:01:33.610> letters<00:01:34.060> across<00:01:34.330> you're<00:01:34.660> going<00:01:34.780> to

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
little letters across you're going to

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.740 
little letters across you're going to
have<00:01:34.930> a<00:01:34.960> little<00:01:35.170> bit<00:01:35.430> little<00:01:36.430> B<00:01:36.700> little<00:01:37.570> B

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
have a little bit little B little B

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.740 
have a little bit little B little B
little<00:01:38.140> B<00:01:38.860> all<00:01:39.460> of<00:01:39.790> these<00:01:40.000> babies<00:01:40.270> are<00:01:40.510> going

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
little B all of these babies are going

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.290 
little B all of these babies are going
to<00:01:40.810> be<00:01:40.930> exactly<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.770> same<00:01:41.800> and<00:01:42.340> if<00:01:43.150> you

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
to be exactly the same and if you

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.900 
to be exactly the same and if you
remember<00:01:43.750> from<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.960> last<00:01:44.080> video<00:01:44.470> I<00:01:44.680> did<00:01:45.130> the

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
remember from the last video I did the

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.940 
remember from the last video I did the
word<00:01:46.690> for<00:01:47.140> when<00:01:47.290> they're<00:01:47.470> different<00:01:47.920> like

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
word for when they're different like

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.700 
word for when they're different like
this<00:01:48.280> is<00:01:48.460> going<00:01:48.640> to<00:01:48.700> be<00:01:48.820> heterozygous<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:50.530> the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
this is going to be heterozygous so the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.859 
this is going to be heterozygous so the
genotypic<00:01:51.340> ratio<00:01:51.700> we're<00:01:52.270> going<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.479> look<00:01:52.660> at

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
genotypic ratio we're going to look at

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.080 
genotypic ratio we're going to look at
just<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:53.800> letters<00:01:54.130> what<00:01:54.369> kind<00:01:54.550> of<00:01:54.610> letters<00:01:54.970> do

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
just the letters what kind of letters do

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.889 
just the letters what kind of letters do
we<00:01:55.150> have<00:01:55.390> here<00:01:55.750> in<00:01:55.900> this<00:01:56.590> rock<00:01:57.490> all<00:01:58.179> one

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
we have here in this rock all one

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.570 
we have here in this rock all one
hundred<00:01:59.080> percent<00:01:59.289> are<00:01:59.800> going<00:01:59.920> to<00:01:59.979> be<00:02:00.070> big<00:02:00.369> P

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
hundred percent are going to be big P

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.029 
hundred percent are going to be big P
little<00:02:01.179> bit<00:02:01.479> so<00:02:01.840> if<00:02:02.020> they<00:02:02.200> ask<00:02:02.229> for<00:02:02.619> genotypic

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
little bit so if they ask for genotypic

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.950 
little bit so if they ask for genotypic
ratio<00:02:03.369> say<00:02:04.270> one<00:02:04.539> hundred<00:02:04.990> percent

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
ratio say one hundred percent

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.540 
ratio say one hundred percent
big<00:02:07.530> be<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:08.100> little<00:02:08.759> bit<00:02:09.350> phenotypic<00:02:10.350> ratio<00:02:10.950> we

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
big be a little bit phenotypic ratio we

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.680 
big be a little bit phenotypic ratio we
want<00:02:12.200> what<00:02:13.200> does<00:02:13.410> it<00:02:13.440> look<00:02:13.590> like<00:02:14.569> even<00:02:15.569> though

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
want what does it look like even though

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.600 
want what does it look like even though
it<00:02:15.780> has<00:02:15.930> both<00:02:16.319> letters<00:02:16.650> present<00:02:17.340> because

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
it has both letters present because

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.730 
it has both letters present because
there<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.300> big<00:02:18.660> be<00:02:18.870> there<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.350> big<00:02:19.500> deal

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
there is a big be there the big deal

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.160 
there is a big be there the big deal
wins<00:02:19.980> can<00:02:20.400> see<00:02:20.520> Big<00:02:20.670> B<00:02:20.880> is<00:02:21.000> Dominic<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:22.110> you

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
wins can see Big B is Dominic so you

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.050 
wins can see Big B is Dominic so you
look<00:02:22.590> back<00:02:22.800> up<00:02:22.950> here<00:02:23.220> if<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.430> forgot<00:02:23.760> and

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
look back up here if you forgot and

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.150 
look back up here if you forgot and
we've<00:02:24.239> got<00:02:24.480> breath<00:02:25.050> so<00:02:25.590> we're<00:02:25.800> going<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.069> have

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
we've got breath so we're going to have

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.200 
we've got breath so we're going to have
one<00:02:26.489> hundred<00:02:27.360> percent<00:02:29.090> Brown

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.220 

I<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:34.040> that's<00:02:34.220> one<00:02:34.610> example<00:02:34.850> of<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.930> punnett

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
I so that's one example of the punnett

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.690 
I so that's one example of the punnett
square<00:02:36.470> let's<00:02:36.680> try<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:36.920> couple<00:02:37.190> different<00:02:37.310> ones

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
square let's try a couple different ones

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.850 
square let's try a couple different ones
with<00:02:38.000> a<00:02:38.030> couple<00:02:38.480> different<00:02:38.720> situations<00:02:39.590> just

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
with a couple different situations just

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.080 
with a couple different situations just
to<00:02:40.040> make<00:02:40.160> sure<00:02:40.190> he<00:02:40.400> doesn't<00:02:40.580> know<00:02:40.760> what<00:02:40.940> you're

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
to make sure he doesn't know what you're

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.559 
to make sure he doesn't know what you're
doing<00:02:41.270> so<00:02:41.870> here's<00:02:42.140> our<00:02:42.290> first<00:02:42.500> one

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.979 

now<00:02:46.200> let's<00:02:46.530> try<00:02:46.829> same<00:02:47.640> thing<00:02:47.939> I<00:02:48.120> color<00:02:48.569> but

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
now let's try same thing I color but

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.300 
now let's try same thing I color but
we're<00:02:49.140> going<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.379> try<00:02:49.439> a<00:02:49.650> heterozygous

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
we're going to try a heterozygous

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.489 
we're going to try a heterozygous
individual<00:02:50.999> now<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:51.629> remember<00:02:51.840> hetero<00:02:52.319> means

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:52.499 
individual now so remember hetero means

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:54.349 
individual now so remember hetero means
different<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:53.489> in<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.849> heterozygous

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
different so in a heterozygous

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.039 
different so in a heterozygous
individual<00:02:55.019> we<00:02:55.290> are<00:02:55.409> going<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.739> have<00:02:55.889> a<00:02:56.219> baby

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
individual we are going to have a baby

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.390 
individual we are going to have a baby
little<00:02:58.049> big<00:02:58.230> now<00:02:58.889> let's<00:02:59.159> try<00:02:59.340> another

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
little big now let's try another

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.330 
little big now let's try another
homozygous<00:03:00.090> top<00:03:00.389> recessive<00:03:01.340> homozygous

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
homozygous top recessive homozygous

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.250 
homozygous top recessive homozygous
recessive<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.120> going<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.329> be<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.540> same<00:03:03.810> you

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
recessive is going to be the same you

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.490 
recessive is going to be the same you
have<00:03:04.500> little<00:03:04.709> be<00:03:04.920> little<00:03:05.250> big<00:03:05.870> so<00:03:06.870> even<00:03:07.469> though

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
have little be little big so even though

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.459 
have little be little big so even though
we've<00:03:07.829> got<00:03:07.980> one<00:03:08.189> of<00:03:08.219> each<00:03:08.810> heterozygous<00:03:09.810> it's

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.469 
we've got one of each heterozygous it's

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.199 
we've got one of each heterozygous it's
going<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.769> be<00:03:10.889> brown<00:03:11.159> eyes<00:03:11.459> because<00:03:11.879> we've<00:03:12.060> got

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
going to be brown eyes because we've got

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.280 
going to be brown eyes because we've got
a<00:03:12.269> big<00:03:13.579> dominant<00:03:14.579> allele<00:03:14.879> present<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:16.019> brown

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
a big dominant allele present so brown

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.259 
a big dominant allele present so brown
eyes<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.829> blue<00:03:17.249> eyes<00:03:17.400> again<00:03:17.730> but<00:03:17.939> let's<00:03:18.060> see

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
eyes and blue eyes again but let's see

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.449 
eyes and blue eyes again but let's see
what<00:03:18.299> we<00:03:18.599> get<00:03:18.750> for<00:03:19.049> our<00:03:19.109> babies<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:19.709> time<00:03:19.950> so

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
what we get for our babies this time so

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.659 
what we get for our babies this time so
we're<00:03:20.579> going<00:03:20.639> to<00:03:20.760> take<00:03:20.879> this<00:03:21.090> one<00:03:22.430> put<00:03:23.430> them<00:03:23.549> up

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
we're going to take this one put them up

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.750 
we're going to take this one put them up
here<00:03:23.699> and<00:03:24.449> are<00:03:25.230> homozygous<00:03:25.500> comp<00:03:26.040> recessive

here and are homozygous comp recessive

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.000 
here and are homozygous comp recessive
sorry<00:03:27.150> put<00:03:27.659> it<00:03:27.780> along<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:27.989> side<00:03:28.319> now<00:03:28.889> we're

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
sorry put it along the side now we're

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.289 
sorry put it along the side now we're
going<00:03:29.099> to<00:03:29.159> cross<00:03:29.400> them<00:03:29.609> out<00:03:29.699> so<00:03:30.030> we<00:03:30.120> have<00:03:30.269> our

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
going to cross them out so we have our

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:36.800 
going to cross them out so we have our
baby<00:03:30.769> little<00:03:31.769> B<00:03:32.010> little<00:03:32.930> B<00:03:33.930> little<00:03:34.409> B<00:03:35.810> baby

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
baby little B little B little B baby

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.040 
baby little B little B little B baby
little<00:03:37.530> bit<00:03:37.799> and<00:03:38.040> then<00:03:38.099> a<00:03:38.909> little<00:03:39.719> bit

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
little bit and then a little bit

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.920 
little bit and then a little bit
little<00:03:40.770> bit<00:03:40.920> now<00:03:41.280> we<00:03:41.340> have<00:03:41.520> two<00:03:41.930> possible

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
little bit now we have two possible

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.070 
little bit now we have two possible
outcomes<00:03:43.110> for<00:03:43.860> this<00:03:44.070> crop<00:03:44.370> half<00:03:45.240> the<00:03:45.630> babies

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
outcomes for this crop half the babies

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.440 
outcomes for this crop half the babies
are<00:03:46.290> going<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.590> be<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:46.920> and<00:03:47.190> half<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:47.910> babies

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
are going to be this and half the babies

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.330 
are going to be this and half the babies
are<00:03:48.750> going<00:03:48.990> to<00:03:49.080> be<00:03:49.230> this<00:03:49.380> we<00:03:49.800> have<00:03:49.950> half<00:03:50.130> our

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
are going to be this we have half our

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.010 
are going to be this we have half our
babies<00:03:50.640> are<00:03:50.790> going<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:50.970> be<00:03:51.090> heterozygous<00:03:51.510> and

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
babies are going to be heterozygous and

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.180 
babies are going to be heterozygous and
have<00:03:52.230> their<00:03:52.410> babies<00:03:52.710> are<00:03:52.890> going<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.100> be

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
have their babies are going to be

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.850 
have their babies are going to be
homozygous<00:03:53.520> recessive<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:55.050> our<00:03:55.290> genotypic

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
homozygous recessive so our genotypic

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.540 
homozygous recessive so our genotypic
ratio<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:56.730> going<00:03:57.300> to<00:03:57.420> be<00:03:57.680> one<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.980> one<00:03:59.160> for

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
ratio is going to be one to one for

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.520 
ratio is going to be one to one for
every<00:03:59.730> one<00:03:59.970> of<00:04:00.120> these<00:04:00.330> you<00:04:00.840> get<00:04:01.020> one<00:04:01.230> of<00:04:01.350> these

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
every one of these you get one of these

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.740 
every one of these you get one of these
so<00:04:02.280> we're<00:04:02.370> going<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.550> have<00:04:02.580> a<00:04:02.750> one-to-one

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
so we're going to have a one-to-one

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.330 
so we're going to have a one-to-one
ratio<00:04:04.170> a<00:04:04.770> big<00:04:05.610> feet<00:04:05.850> big<00:04:06.120> be<00:04:06.830> too<00:04:07.830> little<00:04:08.070> B

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
ratio a big feet big be too little B

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.970 
ratio a big feet big be too little B
little<00:04:08.610> bit<00:04:09.440> now<00:04:10.440> let's<00:04:10.680> look<00:04:10.770> at<00:04:10.860> the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
little bit now let's look at the

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.340 
little bit now let's look at the
phenotype<00:04:11.490> you've<00:04:12.480> got<00:04:12.660> Big<00:04:12.870> B<00:04:13.050> little<00:04:13.230> B

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
phenotype you've got Big B little B

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.620 
phenotype you've got Big B little B
that's<00:04:13.680> going<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:14.010> be<00:04:14.160> brown<00:04:14.880> eyes<00:04:15.180> because

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
that's going to be brown eyes because

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.960 
that's going to be brown eyes because
you<00:04:15.720> have<00:04:15.870> at<00:04:15.990> least<00:04:16.200> one<00:04:16.709> capital<00:04:17.700> letter

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
you have at least one capital letter

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.810 
you have at least one capital letter
present<00:04:18.510> one<00:04:18.750> dominant<00:04:19.530> allele<00:04:19.830> and<00:04:20.100> you're

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
present one dominant allele and you're

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.030 
present one dominant allele and you're
going<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.180> have<00:04:21.359> blue<00:04:21.840> eyes<00:04:21.870> over<00:04:22.440> here<00:04:22.470> so

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
going to have blue eyes over here so

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
going to have blue eyes over here so
you're<00:04:23.250> going<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.610> have<00:04:23.670> a<00:04:24.020> one-to-one<00:04:25.020> ratio

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
you're going to have a one-to-one ratio

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.260 
you're going to have a one-to-one ratio
brown<00:04:27.060> eyes

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.330 

hopefully<00:04:32.080> that<00:04:32.260> Lake<00:04:32.440> makes<00:04:32.680> a<00:04:32.800> little<00:04:33.100> bit

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
hopefully that Lake makes a little bit

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.850 
hopefully that Lake makes a little bit
of<00:04:33.430> sense<00:04:33.610> to<00:04:33.700> this<00:04:34.000> we<00:04:34.270> do<00:04:34.480> one<00:04:34.750> last<00:04:35.140> cross<00:04:35.560> to

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
of sense to this we do one last cross to

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.740 
of sense to this we do one last cross to
show<00:04:36.010> you<00:04:36.070> that<00:04:36.160> sometimes<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:37.240> genotypic

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
show you that sometimes the genotypic

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.810 
show you that sometimes the genotypic
ratio<00:04:38.050> is<00:04:38.290> and<00:04:38.470> phenotypic<00:04:38.860> ratios<00:04:39.220> can<00:04:39.610> it<00:04:39.790> be

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
ratio is and phenotypic ratios can it be

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.600 
ratio is and phenotypic ratios can it be
different<00:04:40.090> from<00:04:40.450> each<00:04:40.630> other<00:04:44.370> now<00:04:45.370> we're

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
different from each other now we're

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.220 
different from each other now we're
going<00:04:45.760> to<00:04:45.880> take<00:04:46.090> two<00:04:46.480> heterozygous

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
going to take two heterozygous

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.020 
going to take two heterozygous
individuals<00:04:47.500> and<00:04:48.160> cross<00:04:48.340> on<00:04:48.550> with<00:04:48.700> each<00:04:48.820> other

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
individuals and cross on with each other

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.420 
individuals and cross on with each other
remember<00:04:49.720> hetero<00:04:50.050> means<00:04:50.260> different<00:04:50.470> so<00:04:51.280> we

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
remember hetero means different so we

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.620 
remember hetero means different so we
have<00:04:51.640> Big<00:04:52.180> B<00:04:52.450> little<00:04:53.140> B<00:04:54.240> times<00:04:55.240> Big<00:04:55.660> B

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
have Big B little B times Big B

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.260 
have Big B little B times Big B
so<00:04:58.170> we're<00:04:58.290> going<00:04:58.410> to<00:04:58.470> take<00:04:58.560> one<00:04:58.830> parent<00:04:59.280> put<00:05:00.150> it

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
so we're going to take one parent put it

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.070 
so we're going to take one parent put it
up<00:05:00.360> here<00:05:00.570> at<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.750> top<00:05:01.310> the<00:05:02.310> other<00:05:02.340> parent<00:05:03.080> put

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
up here at the top the other parent put

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.410 
up here at the top the other parent put
them<00:05:04.230> along<00:05:04.440> here<00:05:04.650> on<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:04.890> sides<00:05:05.240> now<00:05:06.240> we're

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
them along here on the sides now we're

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.860 
them along here on the sides now we're
going<00:05:06.510> to<00:05:06.570> cross<00:05:06.780> them<00:05:06.990> out<00:05:07.110> Big<00:05:07.710> D<00:05:07.920> Big<00:05:07.950> Z<00:05:08.870> goes

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
going to cross them out Big D Big Z goes

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.250 
going to cross them out Big D Big Z goes
in<00:05:10.080> this<00:05:10.200> one<00:05:10.470> always<00:05:11.460> keep<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.540> dominant

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
in this one always keep the dominant

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.520 
in this one always keep the dominant
allele<00:05:13.620> first<00:05:14.070> in<00:05:14.340> your<00:05:14.520> punnett<00:05:14.880> square

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
allele first in your punnett square

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.250 
allele first in your punnett square
maybe<00:05:16.530> little<00:05:16.860> big<00:05:17.040> and<00:05:17.310> last<00:05:17.850> but<00:05:17.970> not<00:05:18.150> least

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
maybe little big and last but not least

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.690 
maybe little big and last but not least
little<00:05:19.260> B<00:05:19.380> little<00:05:19.410> B<00:05:19.710> now<00:05:20.310> we've<00:05:20.550> got

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
little B little B now we've got

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.900 
little B little B now we've got
something<00:05:20.910> different<00:05:21.360> going<00:05:21.450> on<00:05:21.600> we<00:05:22.260> have<00:05:22.440> one

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
something different going on we have one

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.290 
something different going on we have one
baby<00:05:23.910> baby<00:05:24.120> we<00:05:25.050> have<00:05:25.260> two<00:05:25.770> little<00:05:26.760> B<00:05:27.000> little<00:05:27.030> B

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
baby baby we have two little B little B

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.000 
baby baby we have two little B little B
sorry<00:05:28.200> two<00:05:28.680> big<00:05:29.100> P<00:05:29.250> little<00:05:29.400> bit<00:05:29.640> and<00:05:29.900> one

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
sorry two big P little bit and one

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.230 
sorry two big P little bit and one
little<00:05:32.010> bit<00:05:32.540> so<00:05:33.540> that<00:05:33.570> drew<00:05:33.900> genotypic<00:05:34.470> ratio

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
little bit so that drew genotypic ratio

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.440 
little bit so that drew genotypic ratio
12<00:05:36.240> to<00:05:36.450> 21<00:05:36.810> now<00:05:37.530> phenotypic<00:05:38.250> ratio<00:05:38.850> is<00:05:39.090> we<00:05:39.360> only

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
12 to 21 now phenotypic ratio is we only

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:40.880 
12 to 21 now phenotypic ratio is we only
have<00:05:39.630> two<00:05:39.810> options<00:05:39.990> we've<00:05:40.440> got<00:05:40.590> brown<00:05:40.860> eyes

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
have two options we've got brown eyes

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.240 
have two options we've got brown eyes
and<00:05:41.190> we've<00:05:41.340> got<00:05:41.490> blue<00:05:41.670> eyes<00:05:42.110> three<00:05:43.110> of<00:05:43.530> these

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
and we've got blue eyes three of these

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.060 
and we've got blue eyes three of these
out<00:05:44.550> of<00:05:44.880> the<00:05:45.000> four<00:05:45.330> have<00:05:45.720> at<00:05:45.870> least<00:05:45.990> one<00:05:46.350> big<00:05:46.830> be

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
out of the four have at least one big be

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.400 
out of the four have at least one big be
present<00:05:47.580> so<00:05:47.790> that's<00:05:47.970> going<00:05:48.180> to<00:05:48.240> be<00:05:48.410> three

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
present so that's going to be three

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.070 
present so that's going to be three
brown<00:05:50.070> eyes<00:05:51.050> 21<00:05:52.050> blue<00:05:52.740> eyes<00:05:52.950> so<00:05:53.940> Janet<00:05:54.810> a<00:05:54.900> big

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
brown eyes 21 blue eyes so Janet a big

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.380 
brown eyes 21 blue eyes so Janet a big
ratio<00:05:55.440> and<00:05:55.650> phenotypic<00:05:56.070> ratio<00:05:56.550> don't<00:05:56.970> always

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
ratio and phenotypic ratio don't always

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.690 
ratio and phenotypic ratio don't always
have<00:05:57.570> to<00:05:57.720> be<00:05:57.810> the<00:05:57.840> same<00:05:58.170> and<00:05:58.320> that's<00:05:58.410> okay<00:05:58.770> but

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
have to be the same and that's okay but

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.130 
have to be the same and that's okay but
you<00:05:59.910> need<00:05:59.940> to<00:06:00.180> be<00:06:00.210> aware<00:06:00.390> of<00:06:00.600> that<00:06:00.840> to<00:06:00.990> make

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
you need to be aware of that to make

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.720 
you need to be aware of that to make
sure<00:06:01.350> you<00:06:01.470> get<00:06:01.620> question<00:06:02.070> right<00:06:02.250> on<00:06:02.400> the<00:06:02.520> test

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730 
sure you get question right on the test

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:08.120 
sure you get question right on the test
so<00:06:02.940> good<00:06:03.090> luck<00:06:03.240> studying<00:06:03.450> and<00:06:04.940> happy<00:06:05.940> bug
