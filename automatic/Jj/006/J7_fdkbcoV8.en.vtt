one of the things I have to warn you

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.830 
one of the things I have to warn you
about<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.379> 2.8<00:02:50.129> it<00:02:50.400> is<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:50.849> constant<00:02:51.390> 2.8

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
about is the 2.8 it is a constant 2.8

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.210 
about is the 2.8 it is a constant 2.8
don't<00:02:52.050> get<00:02:52.170> me<00:02:52.260> wrong<00:02:52.290> but<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.739> is<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:52.920> little

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
don't get me wrong but it is a little

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.460 
don't get me wrong but it is a little
misleading<00:02:53.459> as<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.480> get<00:02:54.629> closer<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.260> whatever

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
misleading as you get closer to whatever

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.930 
misleading as you get closer to whatever
you're<00:02:55.800> taking<00:02:56.099> the<00:02:56.220> photograph<00:02:56.580> of<00:02:56.760> the

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
you're taking the photograph of the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.420 
you're taking the photograph of the
subject<00:02:57.420> um<00:02:57.569> you<00:02:58.230> know<00:02:58.349> the<00:02:58.620> flower<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.280> bee

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
whatever you're doing you actually will

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.160 
whatever you're doing you actually will
lose<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.069> couple<00:03:02.610> stops<00:03:03.060> maybe<00:03:03.330> it'll<00:03:03.660> instead

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
lose a couple stops maybe it'll instead

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.589 
lose a couple stops maybe it'll instead
of<00:03:04.260> being<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.530> 2.8<00:03:05.099> it'll<00:03:05.610> be<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.730> three<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.150> three

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599

point three a four but that's because as

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.400 
point three a four but that's because as
the<00:03:09.090> closer<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:09.540> get<00:03:09.690> you're<00:03:09.930> restricting

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
the closer you get you're restricting

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.720 
the closer you get you're restricting
the<00:03:10.530> amount<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.769> what<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.040> can<00:03:11.190> let<00:03:11.400> in<00:03:11.580> and

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
the amount of what you can let in and

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.370 
the amount of what you can let in and
the<00:03:12.180> focusing<00:03:12.690> distance<00:03:13.049> so<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.349> a

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
the focusing distance so it is a

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.800 
the focusing distance so it is a
constant<00:03:13.680> f28<00:03:14.370> lens<00:03:14.400> but<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.000> really<00:03:15.330> isn't<00:03:15.510> in

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
constant f28 lens but it really isn't in

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.470 
constant f28 lens but it really isn't in
all<00:03:15.989> reality<00:03:16.519> you<00:03:17.519> do<00:03:17.700> lose<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.000> little<00:03:18.269> bit<00:03:18.390> of

all reality you do lose a little bit of

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.059 
all reality you do lose a little bit of
light<00:03:18.690> as<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:19.140> zoom<00:03:19.349> in<00:03:19.530> but<00:03:19.709> once<00:03:19.860> again

light as you zoom in but once again

that's<00:03:20.190> really<00:03:20.519> not<00:03:20.819> an<00:03:20.970> issue<00:03:21.090> if<00:03:21.420> anything

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.330 
bumped the ISO a little bit but at that
point<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.140> bokeh<00:03:25.380> looks<00:03:25.709> great<00:03:26.010> you're

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
point the bokeh looks great you're

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.770 
point the bokeh looks great you're
really<00:03:26.670> really<00:03:26.819> compressed<00:03:27.390> as<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.660> is

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
really really compressed as it is

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.449 
really really compressed as it is
because<00:03:28.049> you're<00:03:28.200> so<00:03:28.500> tight<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.099> you're

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
because you're so tight and you're

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.400 
because you're so tight and you're
bringing<00:03:29.670> this<00:03:29.940> thing<00:03:30.150> basically<00:03:30.390> up<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.870> you

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
bringing this thing basically up to you

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.800 
bringing this thing basically up to you
know<00:03:31.530> life<00:03:32.010> size<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:32.880> that's<00:03:32.940> that's<00:03:33.720> a

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
know life size and that's that's a

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.839 
know life size and that's that's a
really<00:03:34.140> huge<00:03:34.319> selling<00:03:34.739> point<00:03:34.769> for<00:03:35.160> this<00:03:35.579> lens

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
really huge selling point for this lens

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.610 
really huge selling point for this lens
and<00:03:36.150> then<00:03:36.239> that<00:03:36.420> anyone<00:03:37.019> can<00:03:37.200> use<00:03:37.349> it

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
and then that anyone can use it

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.140 
and then that anyone can use it
I<00:03:37.650> can<00:03:37.980> literally<00:03:38.220> put<00:03:38.519> this<00:03:38.640> on<00:03:38.819> my<00:03:38.910> pocket

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
I can literally put this on my pocket

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.660 
I can literally put this on my pocket
and<00:03:39.510> go<00:03:39.810> anywhere<00:03:40.349> with<00:03:40.769> it<00:03:40.980> not<00:03:41.280> only<00:03:41.519> is<00:03:41.640> it

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
and go anywhere with it not only is it

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.880 
and go anywhere with it not only is it
really<00:03:42.030> easy<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.450> use<00:03:42.569> as<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:42.959> see<00:03:43.079> it<00:03:43.440> does

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
really easy to use as you see it does

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.490 
really easy to use as you see it does
move<00:03:44.130> it<00:03:44.280> does<00:03:44.430> have<00:03:44.840> external<00:03:45.840> parts<00:03:46.170> that

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
move it does have external parts that

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.190 
move it does have external parts that
will<00:03:46.739> that<00:03:47.190> will<00:03:47.370> as<00:03:47.579> you<00:03:47.730> zoom<00:03:48.000> as<00:03:48.870> usually

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
will that will as you zoom as usually

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.599 
will that will as you zoom as usually
may<00:03:49.319> get<00:03:49.500> closer<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.859> will<00:03:50.160> definitely<00:03:50.430> see

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
may get closer you will definitely see

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:51.979 
may get closer you will definitely see
this<00:03:50.819> moving<00:03:51.150> so<00:03:51.329> don't<00:03:51.450> get<00:03:51.569> worried<00:03:51.810> about

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
this moving so don't get worried about

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.530 
this moving so don't get worried about
that<00:03:52.200> because<00:03:52.530> most<00:03:52.799> micro<00:03:53.670> macro<00:03:53.940> lenses<00:03:54.359> do

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
that because most micro macro lenses do

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.990 
that because most micro macro lenses do
that<00:03:54.750> um<00:03:55.350> it's<00:03:55.620> it's<00:03:56.100> something<00:03:56.730> that<00:03:56.970> I

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
that um it's it's something that I

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.699 
that um it's it's something that I
highly<00:03:57.269> recommend<00:03:57.450> I<00:03:58.019> will<00:03:58.170> give<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.410> four

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
highly recommend I will give it four

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.190 
highly recommend I will give it four
eyes<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.370> have<00:03:59.489> four<00:03:59.700> eyeballs<00:04:00.120> out<00:04:00.359> of<00:04:00.930> five

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
eyes you have four eyeballs out of five

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.830 
eyes you have four eyeballs out of five
and<00:04:01.470> as<00:04:01.530> I<00:04:01.650> said<00:04:01.709> it's<00:04:02.069> really<00:04:02.370> fast<00:04:02.850> on<00:04:03.180> um<00:04:03.510> on

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
and as I said it's really fast on um on

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.780 
and as I said it's really fast on um on
auto<00:04:04.530> focusing<00:04:05.100> it's<00:04:05.250> got<00:04:05.370> really<00:04:05.579> good

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
auto focusing it's got really good

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.300 
auto focusing it's got really good
reduced<00:04:06.209> lens<00:04:06.600> flare<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.680> glass<00:04:07.859> on<00:04:08.069> this<00:04:08.160> is

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
reduced lens flare the glass on this is

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.349 
reduced lens flare the glass on this is
really<00:04:08.549> good<00:04:08.700> as<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:08.819> see<00:04:09.090> it's<00:04:09.239> actually

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
really good as you see it's actually

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.900 
really good as you see it's actually
kind<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:10.019> small<00:04:10.400> but<00:04:11.400> that's<00:04:11.609> just<00:04:11.700> because

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
kind of small but that's just because

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.879 
kind of small but that's just because
the<00:04:12.209> way<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.780> optics<00:04:13.139> are<00:04:13.319> and<00:04:13.440> it<00:04:13.530> comes<00:04:13.709> out

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
the way the optics are and it comes out

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.559 
the way the optics are and it comes out
as<00:04:14.040> you<00:04:14.160> zoom<00:04:14.370> in<00:04:14.579> I'd<00:04:14.790> say<00:04:15.030> it's<00:04:15.209> it's<00:04:15.480> very

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
as you zoom in I'd say it's it's very

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.690 
as you zoom in I'd say it's it's very
it's<00:04:15.900> plasticky<00:04:16.680> but<00:04:16.889> that's<00:04:17.070> but<00:04:17.280> that's<00:04:17.489> how

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
it's plasticky but that's but that's how

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.270 
it's plasticky but that's but that's how
these<00:04:17.880> AF<00:04:18.209> SS<00:04:18.570> are<00:04:18.720> but<00:04:18.959> it's<00:04:19.079> very<00:04:19.410> very<00:04:20.010> very

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
these AF SS are but it's very very very

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.659 
these AF SS are but it's very very very
silent<00:04:20.880> I<00:04:20.970> left<00:04:21.419> in<00:04:21.539> the<00:04:21.660> sound<00:04:21.900> for<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.200> video

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
silent I left in the sound for the video

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.870 
silent I left in the sound for the video
you<00:04:23.669> get<00:04:23.880> great<00:04:24.389> great<00:04:25.039> crisp<00:04:26.039> clear<00:04:26.400> images

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
you get great great crisp clear images

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.460 
you get great great crisp clear images
there's<00:04:27.360> not<00:04:27.539> much<00:04:27.720> else<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:27.990> can<00:04:28.110> say<00:04:28.320> about

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
there's not much else you can say about

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.219 
there's not much else you can say about
it<00:04:28.740> it<00:04:28.830> is<00:04:28.950> a<00:04:28.979> fifty-two<00:04:29.550> millimeter<00:04:30.229> filter

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
it it is a fifty-two millimeter filter

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.930 
it it is a fifty-two millimeter filter
mount<00:04:31.440> so<00:04:31.680> you<00:04:31.740> can<00:04:31.950> put<00:04:32.099> a<00:04:32.130> UV<00:04:32.430> filter<00:04:32.460> on<00:04:32.820> it

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
mount so you can put a UV filter on it

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.010 
mount so you can put a UV filter on it
if<00:04:33.030> you<00:04:33.120> want<00:04:33.300> I<00:04:33.510> don't<00:04:33.570> really<00:04:33.810> recommend

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
if you want I don't really recommend

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.409 
if you want I don't really recommend
those<00:04:34.560> for<00:04:34.880> something<00:04:35.880> like<00:04:36.030> this<00:04:36.180> these<00:04:36.360> are

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
those for something like this these are

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.690 
those for something like this these are
very<00:04:36.720> very<00:04:36.930> easy<00:04:36.990> to<00:04:37.229> keep<00:04:37.410> clean<00:04:37.610> you<00:04:38.610> know

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
very very easy to keep clean you know

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.600 
very very easy to keep clean you know
it's<00:04:38.880> a<00:04:38.940> small<00:04:39.270> small<00:04:40.139> back<00:04:40.560> there<00:04:40.889> is<00:04:41.039> really

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
it's a small small back there is really

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.790 
it's a small small back there is really
uh<00:04:41.970> there's<00:04:42.570> a<00:04:42.630> semi<00:04:43.080> weather<00:04:43.320> sealing<00:04:43.620> on

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
uh there's a semi weather sealing on

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.870 
uh there's a semi weather sealing on
this<00:04:43.950> I'm<00:04:44.130> not<00:04:44.280> going<00:04:44.430> to<00:04:44.520> say<00:04:44.639> it's<00:04:44.760> the

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
this I'm not going to say it's the

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.390 
this I'm not going to say it's the
greatest<00:04:45.180> but<00:04:45.930> it'll<00:04:46.229> do<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.410> job<00:04:46.560> in<00:04:47.039> a<00:04:47.130> pinch

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
greatest but it'll do the job in a pinch

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.480 
greatest but it'll do the job in a pinch
and<00:04:47.639> this<00:04:48.180> will<00:04:48.360> autofocus<00:04:49.020> on<00:04:49.200> basically<00:04:50.190> any

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
and this will autofocus on basically any

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.250 
and this will autofocus on basically any
camera<00:04:50.970> because<00:04:51.330> it<00:04:51.450> has<00:04:51.659> the<00:04:51.900> built-in

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
camera because it has the built-in

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.770 
camera because it has the built-in
focusing<00:04:52.860> motor<00:04:53.070> and<00:04:53.310> you

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
focusing motor and you

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.140 
focusing motor and you
tell<00:04:54.020> because<00:04:54.230> of<00:04:54.650> the<00:04:54.830> notches<00:04:55.070> here<00:04:55.880> that

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
tell because of the notches here that

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.420 
tell because of the notches here that
will<00:04:56.590> communicate<00:04:57.590> with<00:04:57.800> your<00:04:58.010> cameras<00:04:58.310> you

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
will communicate with your cameras you

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.940 
will communicate with your cameras you

you're on a crop sensor camera because

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.780 
you're on a crop sensor camera because
basically<00:05:24.860> you're<00:05:24.950> getting<00:05:25.070> a<00:05:25.250> 60<00:05:25.580> millimeter

basically you're getting a 60 millimeter

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.480 
basically you're getting a 60 millimeter
view<00:05:26.270> as<00:05:26.390> it<00:05:26.540> is<00:05:26.660> anyway<00:05:27.230> the<00:05:28.070> only<00:05:28.220> thing<00:05:28.370> I

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
view as it is anyway the only thing I

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.050 
view as it is anyway the only thing I
don't<00:05:29.030> 100%<00:05:29.720> like<00:05:30.380> about<00:05:30.680> it<00:05:30.860> is<00:05:31.010> you<00:05:31.070> do<00:05:31.850> have

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
don't 100% like about it is you do have

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.550 
don't 100% like about it is you do have
to<00:05:32.240> get<00:05:32.330> really<00:05:32.720> really<00:05:32.870> close<00:05:33.230> to<00:05:33.260> your

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
to get really really close to your

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.050 
to get really really close to your
subject<00:05:33.740> it's<00:05:34.100> just<00:05:34.250> because<00:05:34.520> well<00:05:34.910> that's

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
subject it's just because well that's

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.520 
subject it's just because well that's
just<00:05:35.210> the<00:05:35.330> distance<00:05:35.750> it's<00:05:35.930> only<00:05:36.050> 40

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
just the distance it's only 40

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.870 
just the distance it's only 40
millimeters<00:05:36.980> so<00:05:37.100> you<00:05:37.190> got<00:05:37.310> to<00:05:37.400> get<00:05:37.520> really

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
millimeters so you got to get really

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.970 
millimeters so you got to get really
close<00:05:38.090> so<00:05:38.630> if<00:05:38.750> you<00:05:38.840> are<00:05:38.990> trying<00:05:39.290> to<00:05:39.350> do<00:05:39.500> still

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
close so if you are trying to do still

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.520 
close so if you are trying to do still
life<00:05:40.190> with<00:05:40.490> them<00:05:40.730> with<00:05:41.390> bugs<00:05:41.690> and<00:05:41.960> bees<00:05:42.230> and

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
life with them with bugs and bees and

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.870 
life with them with bugs and bees and
all<00:05:42.590> ants<00:05:42.830> and<00:05:43.040> everything<00:05:43.370> like<00:05:43.490> that<00:05:43.550> they

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
all ants and everything like that they

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.280 
all ants and everything like that they
might<00:05:44.030> be<00:05:44.210> spooked<00:05:44.540> out<00:05:44.690> as<00:05:44.930> you're<00:05:45.200> getting

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
might be spooked out as you're getting

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.050 
might be spooked out as you're getting
closer<00:05:45.680> so<00:05:46.040> that's<00:05:46.190> why<00:05:46.370> people<00:05:46.669> like<00:05:46.910> to<00:05:46.940> use

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
closer so that's why people like to use

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.110 
closer so that's why people like to use
a<00:05:47.150> 60<00:05:47.570> millimeter<00:05:47.780> 105<00:05:48.560> millimeter<00:05:49.000> but<00:05:50.000> those

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
a 60 millimeter 105 millimeter but those

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.450 
a 60 millimeter 105 millimeter but those
are<00:05:50.270> majority<00:05:50.630> of<00:05:50.750> full<00:05:51.200> full-frame<00:05:52.040> lenses

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
are majority of full full-frame lenses

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.980 
are majority of full full-frame lenses
but<00:05:52.639> for<00:05:52.790> something<00:05:52.970> like<00:05:53.240> this<00:05:53.479> you<00:05:53.540> can<00:05:53.870> get

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
but for something like this you can get

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.750 
but for something like this you can get
away<00:05:54.229> with<00:05:54.410> as<00:05:54.560> I<00:05:54.710> said<00:05:54.740> with<00:05:55.010> a<00:05:55.040> crop<00:05:55.430> you're

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
away with as I said with a crop you're

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.420 
away with as I said with a crop you're
like<00:05:56.150> 60<00:05:56.540> millimetres<00:05:56.960> as<00:05:57.080> it<00:05:57.200> is<00:05:57.320> anyway<00:05:57.740> and

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
like 60 millimetres as it is anyway and

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.920 
like 60 millimetres as it is anyway and
it<00:05:58.520> works<00:05:58.729> really<00:05:58.910> really<00:05:59.030> well<00:05:59.300> very

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930
