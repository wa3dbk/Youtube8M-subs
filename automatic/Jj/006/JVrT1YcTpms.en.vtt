00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
alright guys this is our Porsche 911

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.070 
alright guys this is our Porsche 911
that<00:00:12.530> we<00:00:12.650> are<00:00:12.830> suspecting<00:00:13.809> there<00:00:14.809> is<00:00:14.930> an

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
that we are suspecting there is an

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.580 
that we are suspecting there is an
exhaust<00:00:15.440> blow<00:00:15.740> somewhere<00:00:17.170> to<00:00:18.170> the<00:00:18.200> past<00:00:18.439> few

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
exhaust blow somewhere to the past few

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.560 
exhaust blow somewhere to the past few
weeks<00:00:18.650> now<00:00:18.980> the<00:00:19.010> the<00:00:19.670> rear-end<00:00:20.150> exhaust<00:00:20.450> has

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
weeks now the the rear-end exhaust has

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.150 
weeks now the the rear-end exhaust has
been<00:00:20.600> getting<00:00:20.840> progressively<00:00:21.110> louder<00:00:21.680> louder

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
been getting progressively louder louder

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.940 
been getting progressively louder louder
now<00:00:23.029> on<00:00:23.300> a<00:00:23.330> visual<00:00:23.660> expect<00:00:24.230> inspection<00:00:24.860> we've

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
now on a visual expect inspection we've

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.990 
now on a visual expect inspection we've
got<00:00:25.070> it<00:00:25.160> up<00:00:25.220> on<00:00:25.340> the<00:00:25.430> ramps<00:00:25.670> here<00:00:27.820> now<00:00:28.820> you<00:00:28.939> can

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
got it up on the ramps here now you can

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.650 
got it up on the ramps here now you can
see<00:00:29.739> just<00:00:30.739> there<00:00:37.090> too<00:00:38.090> much<00:00:38.270> of<00:00:38.420> a<00:00:38.480> plop

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
see just there too much of a plop

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.910 
see just there too much of a plop
however<00:00:39.020> we<00:00:39.170> go<00:00:39.290> to<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:39.470> other<00:00:39.560> side<00:00:41.800> and<00:00:42.800> as

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
however we go to the other side and as

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.160 
however we go to the other side and as
you<00:00:42.949> can<00:00:43.129> see<00:00:43.309> there<00:00:43.519> so<00:00:43.760> we<00:00:44.420> keep<00:00:44.660> it<00:00:44.840> all<00:00:44.989> in

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
you can see there so we keep it all in

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.549 
you can see there so we keep it all in
the<00:00:45.199> back<00:00:45.410> box<00:00:45.680> there<00:00:47.170> so<00:00:48.170> what<00:00:48.350> we<00:00:48.469> need<00:00:48.590> to<00:00:48.649> do

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
the back box there so what we need to do

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.259 
the back box there so what we need to do
it<00:00:51.910> we're<00:00:52.910> gonna<00:00:53.030> do<00:00:53.179> a<00:00:53.210> test<00:00:53.480> whereby<00:00:53.989> we<00:00:54.230> can

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
it we're gonna do a test whereby we can

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.849 
it we're gonna do a test whereby we can
cover<00:00:56.269> up<00:00:56.480> the<00:00:56.920> use<00:00:57.920> our<00:00:58.070> spikes<00:00:59.530> and<00:01:00.530> then

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
cover up the use our spikes and then

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.970 
cover up the use our spikes and then
doing<00:01:01.699> the<00:01:01.850> engine<00:01:02.059> on<00:01:02.589> I'll<00:01:03.589> see<00:01:03.800> if<00:01:03.890> the

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
doing the engine on I'll see if the

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.570 
doing the engine on I'll see if the
exhaust<00:01:04.280> gas<00:01:04.519> is<00:01:04.790> escaping<00:01:04.940> from<00:01:05.980> that<00:01:06.980> or<00:01:07.310> I

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
exhaust gas is escaping from that or I

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.330 
exhaust gas is escaping from that or I
suspect<00:01:08.120> it<00:01:08.360> probably<00:01:08.390> will<00:01:09.050> be

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.060 

so<00:01:11.909> we'll<00:01:12.060> do<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.240> now<00:01:12.710> right<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:13.890> they<00:01:14.010> see

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
so we'll do that now right so they see

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.880 
so we'll do that now right so they see
we<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.490> just<00:01:14.700> basic<00:01:15.060> rags<00:01:15.560> packed<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
we have just basic rags packed in the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.300 
we have just basic rags packed in the
exhaust<00:01:17.159> pipes<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:18.830> we<00:01:19.830> are<00:01:19.920> now<00:01:20.070> going<00:01:20.250> to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
exhaust pipes and we are now going to

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.680 
exhaust pipes and we are now going to
turn<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> engine<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.560> see<00:01:22.560> if<00:01:23.009> we<00:01:23.280> can

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
turn on the engine and see if we can

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.420 
turn on the engine and see if we can
visually<00:01:24.690> see<00:01:24.720> any<00:01:25.020> exhaust<00:01:25.350> gases<00:01:25.830> coming

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
visually see any exhaust gases coming

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.999 
visually see any exhaust gases coming
out<00:01:27.320> all<00:01:28.320> right<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.590> what<00:01:28.740> we've<00:01:28.890> had<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.310> is

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
out all right so what we've had to do is

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.770 
out all right so what we've had to do is
put<00:01:32.009> these<00:01:32.130> wooden<00:01:32.880> poles<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.390> here<00:01:33.600> because

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
put these wooden poles in here because

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.760 
put these wooden poles in here because
when<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:34.830> were<00:01:34.950> starting<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.399> exhaust<00:01:35.729> before

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
when we were starting the exhaust before

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.020 
when we were starting the exhaust before
these<00:01:37.770> rags<00:01:38.070> were<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.399> shooting<00:01:38.549> straight

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
these rags were just shooting straight

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.070 
these rags were just shooting straight
out<00:01:39.649> so<00:01:40.649> I<00:01:40.680> put<00:01:40.950> these<00:01:41.040> poles<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.990> hopefully<00:01:42.990> it

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
out so I put these poles in hopefully it

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.080 
out so I put these poles in hopefully it
will<00:01:43.170> keep<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.470> bags<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.890> place<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.910> I<00:01:44.970> will

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
will keep the bags in place and I will

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.370 
will keep the bags in place and I will
start<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.390> engine<00:01:45.630> again<00:01:48.020> okay<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.080> we<00:01:49.289> have

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
start the engine again okay so we have

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.930 
start the engine again okay so we have
the<00:01:49.470> engine<00:01:49.740> started<00:01:50.070> now<00:01:50.250> what<00:01:50.729> we're<00:01:50.820> going

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
the engine started now what we're going

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.480 
the engine started now what we're going
to<00:01:50.970> do<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.240> put<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.710> paper<00:01:52.710> underneath<00:01:53.280> where

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
to do is put this paper underneath where

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.249 
to do is put this paper underneath where
we<00:01:53.610> think<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.970> leak<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.300> and<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.929> starts

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
we think the leak is and if it starts

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.290 
we think the leak is and if it starts
wheeling<00:01:55.619> around<00:01:55.740> then<00:01:56.670> appears<00:01:56.940> to<00:01:57.060> be<00:01:57.149> means

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
wheeling around then appears to be means

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.830 
wheeling around then appears to be means
that<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.569> where<00:01:59.060> the<00:02:00.060> exhaust<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.569> leaking

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
that is where the exhaust is leaking

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.440 
that is where the exhaust is leaking
from

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
from

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.770 
from
from<00:02:02.719> there

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.350 

see<00:02:08.350> that<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.710> sweet<00:02:08.950> of<00:02:09.070> me<00:02:09.160> moving<00:02:10.090> out

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
see that the sweet of me moving out

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.119 
see that the sweet of me moving out
there<00:02:10.600> and<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:10.840> can<00:02:11.020> feel

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
there and I can feel

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.239 
there and I can feel
the<00:02:13.659> exhaust<00:02:14.659> gases<00:02:15.079> coming<00:02:15.290> out<00:02:15.439> of<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.799> and

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:16.249 
the exhaust gases coming out of it and

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:28.490 
the exhaust gases coming out of it and
we<00:02:16.340> just<00:02:16.370> check<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.730> other<00:02:16.849> side<00:02:17.180> as<00:02:17.329> well

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.050 

nothing<00:02:29.130> on<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.400> side

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
nothing on this side

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.230 
nothing on this side
so<00:02:31.630> it's<00:02:31.780> all<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:32.140> side<00:02:32.470> there<00:02:32.770> so<00:02:33.240> that's

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
so it's all that side there so that's

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.570 
so it's all that side there so that's
what<00:02:34.390> we<00:02:34.480> need<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.690> do<00:02:34.840> next<00:02:35.650> step<00:02:36.010> is<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.550> use

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
what we need to do next step is to use

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.170 
what we need to do next step is to use
some<00:02:37.000> what<00:02:37.930> we<00:02:38.020> called<00:02:38.260> gun<00:02:38.530> come<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.910> we<00:02:40.030> give

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
some what we called gun come and we give

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.750 
some what we called gun come and we give
that<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.360> try<00:02:40.830> so<00:02:41.830> while<00:02:42.310> we're<00:02:42.430> waiting<00:02:42.459> for

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
that a try so while we're waiting for

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.630 
that a try so while we're waiting for
that<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.060> dry<00:02:43.330> just<00:02:43.720> thought<00:02:43.900> I'd<00:02:44.610> show<00:02:45.610> you

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
that to dry just thought I'd show you

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.620 
that to dry just thought I'd show you
what<00:02:45.910> we're<00:02:46.000> gonna<00:02:46.060> use<00:02:46.209> here<00:02:48.390> it's<00:02:49.390> what<00:02:49.540> they

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
what we're gonna use here it's what they

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.570 
what we're gonna use here it's what they
call<00:02:49.840> gum<00:02:50.170> gum<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:50.730> fire<00:02:51.730> gum<00:02:53.400> basically<00:02:54.400> this

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
call gum gum and fire gum basically this

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.570 
call gum gum and fire gum basically this
stuff<00:02:55.150> here<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:56.050> to<00:02:56.290> put<00:02:56.500> it<00:02:56.560> together<00:02:56.650> well<00:02:57.340> so

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
stuff here is to put it together well so

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.979 
stuff here is to put it together well so
I'll<00:02:57.760> start<00:02:58.000> with<00:02:58.060> this<00:02:58.150> one<00:02:58.330> first<00:02:58.540> this<00:02:58.780> one

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
I'll start with this one first this one

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.580 
I'll start with this one first this one
is<00:02:59.110> basically<00:02:59.709> just<00:02:59.800> to<00:03:00.630> see<00:03:01.630> as<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:01.959> shows<00:03:02.470> you

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
is basically just to see as it shows you

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.170 
is basically just to see as it shows you
on<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.800> back<00:03:02.950> there<00:03:03.190> cover<00:03:03.459> up<00:03:03.610> any<00:03:03.790> holes

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
on the back there cover up any holes

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.449 
on the back there cover up any holes
it's<00:03:04.300> like<00:03:04.480> paste<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.940> it's<00:03:07.239> all<00:03:07.330> sort<00:03:07.630> of

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
it's like paste and it's all sort of

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.960 
it's like paste and it's all sort of
it'll<00:03:09.459> seal<00:03:09.820> once<00:03:10.209> it<00:03:10.390> gets<00:03:10.630> hot<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.790> that's

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
it'll seal once it gets hot so that's

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.060 
it'll seal once it gets hot so that's
what<00:03:13.120> we<00:03:13.209> need<00:03:13.330> to<00:03:13.420> put<00:03:13.600> on<00:03:13.720> and<00:03:14.380> then<00:03:14.890> this

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
what we need to put on and then this

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.420 
what we need to put on and then this
stuff<00:03:15.370> here<00:03:16.230> is<00:03:17.230> in<00:03:17.410> case<00:03:17.709> of<00:03:17.739> any<00:03:18.069> sort<00:03:18.400> of

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
stuff here is in case of any sort of

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.729 
stuff here is in case of any sort of
vibration<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.209> or<00:03:19.840> something<00:03:20.050> like<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.319> and

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
vibration and or something like that and

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.650 
vibration and or something like that and
happy<00:03:21.459> nose<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:22.000> has<00:03:22.150> been<00:03:22.330> a<00:03:22.420> slight

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
happy nose and has been a slight

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.080 
happy nose and has been a slight
vibration<00:03:23.130> from<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.190> exhaust<00:03:24.580> so<00:03:24.790> we'll<00:03:24.940> look

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
vibration from the exhaust so we'll look

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.650 
vibration from the exhaust so we'll look
to<00:03:26.040> stop<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.160> vibration<00:03:27.310> with<00:03:27.850> this<00:03:28.060> fire<00:03:28.420> gum

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
to stop the vibration with this fire gum

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.870 
to stop the vibration with this fire gum
as<00:03:28.810> well<00:03:28.959> but<00:03:29.860> we<00:03:29.980> can<00:03:30.130> use<00:03:30.250> both<00:03:30.430> of<00:03:30.489> them<00:03:30.730> in

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
as well but we can use both of them in

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.360 
as well but we can use both of them in
the<00:03:30.940> same<00:03:31.150> place<00:03:31.680> so<00:03:32.680> that's<00:03:32.769> what<00:03:32.950> we<00:03:33.069> do

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
the same place so that's what we do

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.020 
the same place so that's what we do
once<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:34.019> exhaust<00:03:35.019> has

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
once the exhaust has

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.780 
once the exhaust has
cool<00:03:37.780> down<00:03:38.010> all<00:03:39.010> right<00:03:39.100> so<00:03:39.370> this<00:03:39.490> is<00:03:39.670> the

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
cool down all right so this is the

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.000 
cool down all right so this is the
problem<00:03:40.180> area<00:03:40.450> here<00:03:40.720> as<00:03:40.900> you<00:03:41.020> can<00:03:41.170> see<00:03:41.380> what

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
problem area here as you can see what

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.610 
problem area here as you can see what
probably<00:03:42.310> best<00:03:42.520> off<00:03:42.670> doing<00:03:42.970> is<00:03:43.319> taking<00:03:44.319> this

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
probably best off doing is taking this

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.059 
probably best off doing is taking this
off<00:03:44.830> completely<00:03:45.360> angry<00:03:46.360> of<00:03:46.709> any<00:03:47.709> bits<00:03:47.920> of

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
off completely angry of any bits of

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:59.940 
off completely angry of any bits of
excess<00:03:48.459> No

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.260 

does<00:04:00.950> that<00:04:01.099> stay<00:04:01.340> there<00:04:01.550> just<00:04:01.849> lead<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.090> more

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
does that stay there just lead to more

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:16.240 
does that stay there just lead to more
problems<00:04:14.140> and<00:04:15.140> then<00:04:15.260> down<00:04:15.470> here<00:04:15.500> is<00:04:15.890> we're

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
problems and then down here is we're

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.719 
problems and then down here is we're
gonna<00:04:16.430> port

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.719 

this<00:04:23.729> is<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.289> gun<00:04:25.289> come<00:04:25.560> here<00:04:25.800> try<00:04:26.340> to<00:04:26.400> protect

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
this is the gun come here try to protect

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.339 
this is the gun come here try to protect
a<00:04:26.849> limo<00:04:27.210> over<00:04:27.330> right<00:04:27.690> now<00:04:27.840> but<00:04:28.050> you<00:04:28.110> can<00:04:28.229> see

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
a limo over right now but you can see

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:31.189 
a limo over right now but you can see
how<00:04:28.819> soft<00:04:29.819> it<00:04:30.030> is<00:04:30.120> just<00:04:30.300> like<00:04:30.479> it<00:04:30.629> it's<00:04:30.990> like<00:04:31.110> a

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
how soft it is just like it it's like a

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.820 
how soft it is just like it it's like a
paste<00:04:31.819> and<00:04:32.819> that<00:04:33.000> is<00:04:33.090> what<00:04:33.270> we<00:04:33.360> need<00:04:33.449> to<00:04:33.509> spread

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.520 

order<00:04:37.830> between<00:04:37.979> that<00:04:38.250> area<00:04:39.169> it<00:04:40.169> is<00:04:40.229> worth

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
order between that area it is worth

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.420 
order between that area it is worth
noting<00:04:41.009> that<00:04:41.039> this<00:04:41.669> bath<00:04:41.970> box<00:04:42.240> here<00:04:43.220> it<00:04:44.220> will

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
noting that this bath box here it will

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.969 
noting that this bath box here it will
eventually<00:04:44.610> need<00:04:45.090> replacing<00:04:45.120> in<00:04:45.810> order<00:04:46.800> no

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
eventually need replacing in order no

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.249 
eventually need replacing in order no
illusions<00:04:47.400> that<00:04:47.569> the<00:04:48.569> attempt<00:04:48.840> oh<00:04:48.930> you<00:04:49.020> pair

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
illusions that the attempt oh you pair

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.439 
illusions that the attempt oh you pair
won't<00:04:49.470> last<00:04:49.650> forever<00:04:49.830> but<00:04:50.280> it<00:04:51.060> will<00:04:51.120> see<00:04:51.300> us

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
won't last forever but it will see us

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.689 
won't last forever but it will see us
through<00:04:51.509> until<00:04:52.500> we<00:04:52.530> can<00:04:54.500> maybe<00:04:55.500> afford<00:04:55.770> or<00:04:56.340> you

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
through until we can maybe afford or you

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.719 
through until we can maybe afford or you
get<00:04:56.819> your<00:04:56.940> next<00:04:57.180> check<00:04:57.710> to<00:04:58.710> get<00:04:59.250> it<00:04:59.400> repaired

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
get your next check to get it repaired

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:39.460 
get your next check to get it repaired
or<00:04:59.970> replacement

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.840 

so<00:05:40.470> as<00:05:40.590> you<00:05:40.680> can<00:05:40.770> see<00:05:40.830> here<00:05:41.160> we've<00:05:41.280> put<00:05:41.310> on<00:05:41.639> an

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
so as you can see here we've put on an

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
so as you can see here we've put on an
initial<00:05:42.270> layer<00:05:43.970> we'll<00:05:44.970> come<00:05:45.210> back<00:05:45.419> to<00:05:45.600> it<00:05:45.720> it's

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
initial layer we'll come back to it it's

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.670 
initial layer we'll come back to it it's
a<00:05:45.960> very<00:05:46.080> rough<00:05:46.289> layer<00:05:46.590> of<00:05:46.740> course<00:05:47.330> it's<00:05:48.330> not

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
a very rough layer of course it's not

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.159 
a very rough layer of course it's not
it's<00:05:49.680> not<00:05:49.830> Medlock's<00:05:50.280> month<00:05:50.550> or<00:05:51.210> neat<00:05:52.050> and

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
it's not Medlock's month or neat and

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.909 
it's not Medlock's month or neat and
tidy<00:05:52.320> by<00:05:52.949> any<00:05:53.100> stretch<00:05:53.220> of<00:05:53.310> the<00:05:53.460> means<00:05:53.639> but<00:05:54.919> you

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
tidy by any stretch of the means but you

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.850 
tidy by any stretch of the means but you
do<00:05:56.400> it<00:05:56.430> so<00:05:56.550> once<00:05:56.970> that<00:05:57.180> dries<00:05:57.449> well<00:05:58.380> we'll<00:05:58.740> go

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
do it so once that dries well we'll go

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.300 
do it so once that dries well we'll go
out<00:05:58.979> and<00:05:59.009> we<00:05:59.190> put<00:05:59.400> another<00:05:59.460> layer<00:05:59.910> on<00:06:00.000> as<00:06:00.270> well

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
out and we put another layer on as well
