00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.830

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.189
 Toulon and he does it rather well 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.500

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.640
 first touch alert without charge for 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.640
 the English 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.809

 toulon by bad luck his captain himself 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.940

 three-quarters of toulon snif this time 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.430
 it ends in the goal but that good 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.910
 departure and quickly tempered by Bernard 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.660
 the door 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.430
 the opponent of the day is dreaded I was 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.630
 a team that holds the ball that 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.190
 exceeds the play with a third 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.120
 line lets be at everything from genius and 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.850
 pinball happy days

 no it's really a team of very 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.729
 good level 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.600
 demonstration in pictures here is one of 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.090
 two dangerous wingers 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.280
 tom james the famous third line is 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.479
 to support marmande of a hook 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.910
 inside and make the last defender 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.270
 and it took advantage of the score 7 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.270
 at 5 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.370
 on the action alexis palisson gets hurt 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.500
 the infirmary of Toulon continues to 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.280
 fill the poles of the international 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.590

 plastic film 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.360
 bernard laporte do not know yet 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.090
 but that's the end of the mess in the 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.440
 Toulon game then well put the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.440
 things in order throwing goes to 7 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.549
 the pitot has pierced the pass to the limit 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.530
 the publisher the double and the freestyle is 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.640
 resumed our he escapes the high tackle 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.369
 left 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.369
 swiss second try in may 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.160
 video gag because the pass is ahead the 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.780
 position of the guy's hands rate does not seem 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.890
 not turn back and yet 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.540
 against all odds 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.540
 the test is granted by the video referee 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.890
 I did not think before but after max 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.670
 pretty good I do not know it's me it's the 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.910
 keep during and after mac and got 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.910
 quick quick 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.870
 rather fair play rob baxter sure that the 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.700
 manager 17h to love the action of matt 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.350
 a high class slalom and 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.270
 especially very effective with three 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.019
 hooks it clears four defenders 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.459
 raise the head 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.930
 they see that smith is free on his 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.930
 wing following you know her 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.090
 at mid-time toulon leads 15 to 12 to 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.260
 banal smile despite his injury to the 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.239
 leg that will keep him away from 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.739
 land for two months a quarter 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.209
 from end time both teams are 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.629
 always in a handkerchief the 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.920
 score 18 15 only 5 points ahead 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.840
 always decide then to go out 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.280
 combination of superheroes delivers 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.709
 wilkinson interior for mitchell 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.480
 mitchell is stopped under the poles the 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.489
 quick release allows cioci to 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.989
 mark the third try a moment 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.819
 rare that savor the young pillar I 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.209
 mark is very rarely so I'm 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.310
 glad only for special occasions 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.060
 when I can, especially to hope 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.489
 play a quarter-final at home 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.680
 Toulon needs the offensive bonus 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.090
 he still lacks a try of 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.859
 liberation which to the banks hospitals 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.170
 left auxerre fit he is tackled by 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.510
 james will always Toulon Tillous 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.150
 borde restaura with mathieu bastareaud 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.940
 and referees and without spring tube 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.510
 born berdos bernois 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.510
 that's all 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.630
 standing jacques 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.950
 including flights in the stadium 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.570
 wilkinson mark the bonus test but 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.980
 when we talk to him about his essay they 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.660
 prefer to save the game of matt giteau 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:14.390
 and the end game was spinning and his louis 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.820
 would have been difficult against then I 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.470
 believe the team was in good shape 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.650
 for me that's the most 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.600
 important final score 32 to 20 after the 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.160
 match frédéric michalak did rab 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.400
 the warning of the door to 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.230
 Does it seem to have already borne fruit 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.340
 talk here obviously about the interview 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.810
 of bernard laporte in the newspaper 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.450
 the team this morning if you do not have it 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.100
 read frédéric must sleep at the stadium 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.120
 he believes that his dome he should in 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.680
 do a little more training 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.300
 or light tackle even of 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.090
 the coach to his player while in 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.900
 think frederic michalak explanations of 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.340
 two interested 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.560
 it was earlier at the microphone of 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.560
 cinpres they have to sleep at the stadium 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.580
 he's training, but still 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.360
 fell into the situation in which he 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.950
 is I would like them to do it again 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.380
 more because we've all been in these 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.050
 situations there I go and nothing and all that 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.190
 it's always more pleasant to 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.840
 tell us things to see them 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.490
 go to the media about the vote 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.840
 yellowed who train here is out 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.190
 standard and it's obvious but I would like 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.390
 that freddy the face and even more in 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.160
 the period he is in today 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.260
 it's as simple as that after there's nothing 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.450
 in your frederic and as I you 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.380
 said if if had I not stay there 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.460
 must know him who was not 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.770
 seriously i would have never taken it to Toulon 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.530
 I try to do my best to 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.520
 return to my best level 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.140
 the important thing is it is played on the 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.419
 ground to be performing on the 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.130
 field after the judgments of some and 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.669
 others that's why or not milk 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.669
 sleep at the stadium
