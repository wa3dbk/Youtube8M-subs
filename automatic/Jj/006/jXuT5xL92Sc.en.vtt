00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
that for you and I want to start with

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.680 
that for you and I want to start with
the<00:00:40.739> difference<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.610> size<00:00:41.820> between<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the difference in size between the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.819 
the difference in size between the
oakley<00:00:43.530> x<00:00:43.710> squared<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:45.680> oakley<00:00:46.680> flak

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
oakley x squared and the oakley flak

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.779 
oakley x squared and the oakley flak
jacket<00:00:48.680> really<00:00:49.680> quick<00:00:50.039> i<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.340> going<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.579> say

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
jacket really quick i just going to say

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.889 
jacket really quick i just going to say
that<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:53.399> x<00:00:53.730> square<00:00:54.090> will<00:00:54.300> appear<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.780> be

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
that the x square will appear to be

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.209 
that the x square will appear to be
bigger<00:00:55.170> because<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:57.050> full-frame

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
bigger because it's a full-frame

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.590 
bigger because it's a full-frame
compared<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> flak<00:00:59.820> jacket<00:01:00.270> which<00:01:00.449> is

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
compared to the flak jacket which is

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.710 
compared to the flak jacket which is
only<00:01:00.809> like<00:01:02.780> you<00:01:03.780> know<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.350> not<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.530> full<00:01:04.710> frame

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
only like you know it's not a full frame

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.960 
only like you know it's not a full frame
so<00:01:06.720> that's<00:01:07.200> why<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.530> x<00:01:08.070> square<00:01:08.369> will<00:01:08.549> appear

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
so that's why the x square will appear

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.270 
so that's why the x square will appear
to<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.270> slightly<00:01:09.659> bigger<00:01:10.020> they<00:01:10.470> are<00:01:10.500> slightly

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
to be slightly bigger they are slightly

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.980 
to be slightly bigger they are slightly
wider<00:01:11.869> know<00:01:12.869> now<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.049> much<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:14.720> from<00:01:15.720> top<00:01:15.960> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
wider know now that much and from top to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.149 
wider know now that much and from top to
bottom<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.560> lengths<00:01:16.830> are<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.100> same<00:01:19.159> each

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
bottom the lengths are the same each

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.510 
bottom the lengths are the same each
individual<00:01:20.759> lenses<00:01:21.299> l<00:01:21.720> or<00:01:22.170> lens<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.040> x

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
individual lenses l or lens on the x

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.480 
individual lenses l or lens on the x
squared<00:01:23.640> are<00:01:24.000> slightly<00:01:24.930> wider<00:01:25.290> than<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:26.189> flak

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
squared are slightly wider than the flak

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.149 
squared are slightly wider than the flak
jacket<00:01:26.880> lenses<00:01:29.630> see<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.770> frame<00:01:32.070> itself

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
jacket lenses see that the frame itself

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.300 
jacket lenses see that the frame itself
though<00:01:35.630> x<00:01:36.630> squared<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.350> going<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.619> open<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
though x squared is going to open up a

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.359 
though x squared is going to open up a
little<00:01:38.430> bit<00:01:38.640> more<00:01:38.850> than<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.329> flak<00:01:39.900> jacket<00:01:40.369> so

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
little bit more than the flak jacket so

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.969 
little bit more than the flak jacket so
that<00:01:41.579> means<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.030> if<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.630> flak<00:01:42.990> jacket<00:01:43.619> fits

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
that means is if the flak jacket fits

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.819 
that means is if the flak jacket fits
you<00:01:44.220> perfect<00:01:44.820> then<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.930> x<00:01:46.140> squared<00:01:46.290> will<00:01:46.619> fit

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
you perfect then the x squared will fit

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.520 
you perfect then the x squared will fit
you<00:01:46.979> perfect<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.540> flat<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
you perfect if the flat if you have the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.789 
you perfect if the flat if you have the
flak<00:01:49.860> jacket<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.610> these<00:01:51.600> fit<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.290> tight

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.459 

these<00:01:55.799> will<00:01:56.189> also<00:01:56.490> fit<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.820> tight<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:58.079> not<00:01:58.259> as

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
so they both open up to like six inches

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.230 
so they both open up to like six inches
apart<00:02:15.170> you<00:02:15.440> know<00:02:15.500> from<00:02:16.190> here<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.580> from<00:02:17.060> one

leg<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.480> another<00:02:17.780> one<00:02:17.960> button<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:18.500> get<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.680> good

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
leg to another one button you get a good

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.380 
leg to another one button you get a good
six<00:02:19.100> inches<00:02:20.020> it's<00:02:21.020> just<00:02:21.410> these<00:02:22.000> open<00:02:23.000> up<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.240> lot

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
six inches it's just these open up a lot

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.970 
six inches it's just these open up a lot
easier<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:24.850> for<00:02:25.850> bigger<00:02:26.060> faces<00:02:26.930> or<00:02:27.320> larger
