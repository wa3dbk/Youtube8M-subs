00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hi friends in touch pashkin frazer and 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.099
 Now I would like to tell you about 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.980
 that when working with ballerinas kai sometimes 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.120
 there is a need to find out which 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.220
 a circle describes a tooth turning well 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.550
 as well as a tooth in the one Ballerina 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.710
 make it pretty difficult but 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.250
 there is still a way out and now I give it to you 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.650
 show us for this will require a marker 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.630
 and the plane the plane is possible 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.550
 use stupidly which is produced 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.950
 work with ballerina 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.190
 but don't do it on the table 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.100
 milling machine or vise lips 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.350
 in principle, you can do without a marker 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.579
 the marker i use to make it 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.649
 you can see better so let's start using 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.399
 marker around the circumference 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.840
 we will put two such labels here 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.120
 they should be approximately 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.469
 against each other in relation to the axis 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.500
 spindle rotation and not including spindle 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.720
 milling machine quietly rotating 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.010
 hand ballerina 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.659
 raise the table to the top and put light 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.880
 scratch one of the blue markers 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.100
 after you have made the first trace 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.009
 put a zero point on the limb 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.240
 vertical feed and lower the table down 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:30.030
 a couple dozen translate tooth in 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.040
 the opposite side and the same 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.729
 the way we put the first risk 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.130
 we put the second in principle if 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.740
 the plane still has a rough abrasion 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.380
 you can safely take and draw 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.409
 ballerina circle 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.640
 and measure but if the plane 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.890
 already fair 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.899
 and there is no longer any 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.009
 further action is necessary to act 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.880
 neatly 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.649
 not to put extra scratches on the bottom 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.079
 after we had two 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.680
 Here are such arcs with the help of a shangel 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.500
 can be measured around the circumference 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:12.040
 and find out what diameter 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.709
 describes a tooth as it rotates around its axis 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.230
 I'm going to mill the groove in this place 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.709
 and the whole thing I started to 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.260
 it was possible to mark the future pass diameter 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.859
 Circle suits me and now I 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.250
 produce 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:30.670
 I will turn on the spindle 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.280
 light touch and pull the spindle out 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.819
 the details are thus drawn to me 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.319
 some such surface 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.569
 on this surface it will be possible 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.609
 rough rough milling 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.340
 before i do clean 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:47.230
 groove milling now I think you 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.139
 guessed what I needed 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.829
 find out what circumference the tooth describes 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:54.700
 ballerinas 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:57.250
 spinning around an axis i'm sure this way 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.599
 I will be useful to you on this I finished 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.599
 Thank you for your attention goodbye
