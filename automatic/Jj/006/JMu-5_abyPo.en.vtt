gray they use for the weapons and in

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.450 
gray they use for the weapons and in
joints<00:01:57.630> which<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.590> quite<00:01:58.920> unfortunate

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
joints which is quite unfortunate

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.219

of a question do you really want another
set<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:07.900> them<00:03:08.080> I<00:03:08.290> mean<00:03:08.470> if<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:09.010> just<00:03:09.040> have<00:03:09.490> the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880

set of them I mean if you just have the
gun<00:03:10.510> cannon<00:03:10.960> then<00:03:11.410> yeah<00:03:11.560> you<00:03:11.620> could<00:03:11.860> justify

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
gun cannon then yeah you could justify

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.830 
gun cannon then yeah you could justify
success<00:03:12.550> in<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.910> end<00:03:13.030> of<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.210> movies<00:03:13.570> you<00:03:13.690> do

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
success in the end of the movies you do

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.110 
success in the end of the movies you do
have<00:03:14.050> two<00:03:14.230> gun<00:03:14.620> countess<00:03:14.950> flying<00:03:15.190> around<00:03:15.400> not

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
have two gun countess flying around not

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.640 
have two gun countess flying around not
to<00:03:16.240> mention<00:03:16.420> that<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:17.110> colors<00:03:17.410> are<00:03:17.560> different

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
to mention that the colors are different

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.680 
to mention that the colors are different
so<00:03:18.040> even<00:03:18.460> though<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:18.850> would<00:03:19.090> have<00:03:19.240> two<00:03:19.390> gun

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
so even though you would have two gun

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.990 
so even though you would have two gun
cannons<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.350> they<00:03:20.980> would<00:03:21.220> still<00:03:21.580> find<00:03:21.910> a

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
cannons and they would still find a

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.050 
cannons and they would still find a
little<00:03:22.150> different<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:24.310> yeah<00:03:24.550> that's<00:03:24.940> pretty

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
little different so yeah that's pretty

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.560 
little different so yeah that's pretty
