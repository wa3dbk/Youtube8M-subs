00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.330 

while<00:00:01.700> I'm<00:00:01.910> doing<00:00:02.060> all<00:00:02.360> this<00:00:02.810> I<00:00:03.080> put<00:00:03.830> my<00:00:03.889> garden

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:04.340 
while I'm doing all this I put my garden

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.030 
while I'm doing all this I put my garden
hose<00:00:04.490> to<00:00:04.520> fill<00:00:04.970> up<00:00:05.149> in<00:00:05.960> the<00:00:06.170> pool<00:00:06.590> to<00:00:06.740> bring<00:00:06.920> up

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
hose to fill up in the pool to bring up

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.760 
hose to fill up in the pool to bring up
the<00:00:07.130> water<00:00:07.309> level<00:00:07.790> as<00:00:08.720> high<00:00:08.960> as<00:00:09.110> I<00:00:09.260> can<00:00:09.320> get<00:00:09.590> it

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:09.770 
the water level as high as I can get it

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.420 
the water level as high as I can get it
and<00:00:10.510> once<00:00:11.510> it's<00:00:11.750> at<00:00:11.900> that<00:00:12.080> level<00:00:12.440> the<00:00:13.070> next

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 
and once it's at that level the next

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.830 
and once it's at that level the next
phase<00:00:13.880> will<00:00:14.210> be<00:00:14.420> to<00:00:15.050> vacuum<00:00:16.010> the<00:00:16.699> other<00:00:17.330> degree

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
phase will be to vacuum the other degree

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.070 
phase will be to vacuum the other degree
that's<00:00:18.020> the<00:00:18.230> bottom<00:00:18.530> of<00:00:18.619> the<00:00:18.710> pool<00:00:19.780> now<00:00:20.780> I<00:00:20.810> want

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
that's the bottom of the pool now I want

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.820 
that's the bottom of the pool now I want
to<00:00:21.140> connect<00:00:21.560> the<00:00:22.330> big<00:00:23.330> drain

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.599 

so<00:00:27.400> we<00:00:27.519> put<00:00:27.759> the<00:00:27.970> drain<00:00:28.779> hose<00:00:29.080> there<00:00:29.470> and<00:00:29.740> so

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
so we put the drain hose there and so

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.110 
so we put the drain hose there and so
just<00:00:30.880> tighten<00:00:31.269> up<00:00:31.480> the<00:00:31.630> collar<00:00:32.760> so<00:00:33.760> that<00:00:33.790> it

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
just tighten up the collar so that it

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.319 
just tighten up the collar so that it
holds<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:36.399> then<00:00:36.699> we<00:00:37.000> could<00:00:37.180> take<00:00:37.390> this<00:00:37.629> holes

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
holds and then we could take this holes

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.360 
holds and then we could take this holes
and<00:00:40.329> unroll<00:00:40.780> it

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.930 

-<00:00:44.120> to<00:00:44.270> look<00:00:44.450> behind<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:44.870> Cabana

one thing I like to do is I like to walk
around<00:00:51.540> the<00:00:51.930> swimming<00:00:52.260> pool<00:00:52.530> put<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.890> cup<00:00:53.550> of

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
around the swimming pool put a cup of

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.890 
around the swimming pool put a cup of
chlorine<00:00:54.120> into<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.510> water<00:00:55.070> this<00:00:56.070> way<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.900> don't

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
chlorine into the water this way I don't

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.020 
chlorine into the water this way I don't
get<00:00:58.320> any<00:01:00.530> bacterial<00:01:01.530> infections<00:01:02.220> on<00:01:02.430> my<00:01:02.580> hands

or<00:01:03.180> if<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.420> touch<00:01:03.660> my<00:01:03.900> eyes<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:05.790> water

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.970 

next<00:01:09.450> thing<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.810> just<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:10.110> vacuum<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.620> bottom

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
next thing is just a vacuum the bottom

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.240 
next thing is just a vacuum the bottom
and<00:01:11.510> vacuum<00:01:12.510> straight<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.080> waste<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.620> not<00:01:13.830> go

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
and vacuum straight to waste do not go

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.820 
and vacuum straight to waste do not go
through<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.760> filter<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.180> don't<00:01:15.420> want<00:01:15.600> all<00:01:15.720> this

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
through the filter I don't want all this

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.590 
through the filter I don't want all this
dirt<00:01:16.830> all<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.220> black<00:01:17.520> gunk<00:01:17.940> Coyne<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
dirt all this black gunk Coyne and

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.530 
dirt all this black gunk Coyne and
clogging<00:01:19.380> up<00:01:19.530> my<00:01:19.560> filter<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:21.030> wanted<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
clogging up my filter I just wanted to

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.570 
clogging up my filter I just wanted to
bring<00:01:21.750> up<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.110> water<00:01:22.350> level<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:23.040> little<00:01:23.400> bit

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
bring up the water level a little bit

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.150 
bring up the water level a little bit
more<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.270> want<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.810> try<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.990> bring<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.350> up<00:01:25.470> about

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
more I want to try to bring it up about

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.390 
more I want to try to bring it up about
another<00:01:26.310> two<00:01:27.060> maybe<00:01:27.360> three<00:01:27.750> inches<00:01:27.930> higher

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
another two maybe three inches higher

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.780 
another two maybe three inches higher
this<00:01:29.510> gives<00:01:30.510> me<00:01:30.660> more<00:01:30.870> time<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.500> actually<00:01:32.490> do

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
this gives me more time to actually do

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.080 
this gives me more time to actually do
the<00:01:32.910> vacuum<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:34.050> now<00:01:34.530> I'm<00:01:34.830> slowly<00:01:35.190> vacuuming

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
the vacuum and now I'm slowly vacuuming

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.440 
the vacuum and now I'm slowly vacuuming
to<00:01:36.450> waste<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.550> all<00:01:38.550> of<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.030> leaves

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
to waste so all of this leaves

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.280 
to waste so all of this leaves
everything<00:01:40.580> going<00:01:41.580> out<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.090> waste<00:01:42.330> once<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
everything going out to waste once the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.020 
everything going out to waste once the
water<00:01:43.440> level<00:01:43.530> goes<00:01:43.800> down<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> skimmer<00:01:44.910> I

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
water level goes down and the skimmer I

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.680 
water level goes down and the skimmer I
have<00:01:45.330> to<00:01:45.479> stop<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.550> once<00:01:47.550> that<00:01:47.910> happens<00:01:48.390> I

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
have to stop and once that happens I

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.410 
have to stop and once that happens I
start<00:01:49.020> vacuuming<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.950> fill<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.280> pool<00:01:50.520> vacuum

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
start vacuuming we fill the pool vacuum

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.999 
start vacuuming we fill the pool vacuum
again<00:01:51.720> well<00:01:52.650> you<00:01:52.800> got<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.460> three<00:01:53.729> times<00:01:54.650> so<00:01:55.650> for

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
again well you got to three times so for

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.480 
again well you got to three times so for
a<00:01:56.070> first<00:01:56.340> vacuuming<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.240> looks<00:01:58.220> quite<00:01:59.220> good

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
a first vacuuming it looks quite good

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.810 
a first vacuuming it looks quite good
actually

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.690 

over<00:02:02.820> here<00:02:03.030> we<00:02:03.210> have<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.830> close<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:05.160> poll<00:02:05.430> so

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
over here we have to close the poll so

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.330 
over here we have to close the poll so
it's<00:02:05.820> on<00:02:05.940> close<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.509> don't<00:02:06.660> know<00:02:06.720> why<00:02:06.869> problem

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
it's on close I don't know why problem

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.930 
it's on close I don't know why problem
as<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.539> promised<00:02:10.610> this<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.879> really<00:02:12.450> bad<00:02:12.629> dog<00:02:13.200> so

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
as I promised this is really bad dog so

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.520 
as I promised this is really bad dog so
all<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.239> leaves<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.660> were<00:02:15.870> vacuuming

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
all the leaves that were vacuuming

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.290 
all the leaves that were vacuuming
before<00:02:16.950> coming<00:02:17.670> here<00:02:17.849> so<00:02:17.970> it's<00:02:18.120> very

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
before coming here so it's very

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.619 
before coming here so it's very
important<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:18.989> would<00:02:19.170> be<00:02:20.450> cleaned<00:02:21.450> out

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
important that this would be cleaned out

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.300 
important that this would be cleaned out
if<00:02:21.930> not<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.349> can<00:02:22.470> end<00:02:22.590> up<00:02:22.709> burning<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.040> pump

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
if not you can end up burning the pump

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.600 
if not you can end up burning the pump
so<00:02:23.840> dump<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:24.959> in<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.200> garbage<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:25.920> we'll<00:02:26.489> be

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
so dump this in the garbage and we'll be

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.690 
so dump this in the garbage and we'll be
right<00:02:26.760> back<00:02:27.170> what<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.230> did<00:02:28.379> is<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.769> did<00:02:28.830> one

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
right back what I did is I did one

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.630 
right back what I did is I did one
vacuum<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:31.140> after<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.590> I<00:02:31.650> let<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.160> pump<00:02:32.400> run

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
vacuum and after that I let the pump run

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.830 
vacuum and after that I let the pump run
overnight<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:34.190> put<00:02:35.190> two<00:02:35.580> cups<00:02:35.879> of<00:02:36.060> chlorine<00:02:36.569> in

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
overnight I put two cups of chlorine in

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.160 
overnight I put two cups of chlorine in
it<00:02:37.459> basically<00:02:38.459> do<00:02:38.730> what<00:02:39.510> everybody<00:02:39.840> calls<00:02:40.049> a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
it basically do what everybody calls a

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.120 
it basically do what everybody calls a
shock<00:02:40.440> treatment

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
shock treatment

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.819 
shock treatment
so<00:02:42.000> that's<00:02:42.329> two<00:02:42.599> times<00:02:42.840> 900<00:02:43.440> grams<00:02:43.620> of

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
so that's two times 900 grams of

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.750 
so that's two times 900 grams of
chlorine<00:02:44.099> two<00:02:44.549> cups<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:46.310> this<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.489> what<00:02:47.670> it

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
chlorine two cups of this is what it

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.370 
chlorine two cups of this is what it
looks<00:02:47.910> like<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.209> next<00:02:48.360> day<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:49.079> waters

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
looks like the next day so the waters

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.069 
looks like the next day so the waters
been<00:02:49.730> filtering<00:02:50.989> overnight<00:02:53.690> what<00:02:54.690> I'll<00:02:54.810> do<00:02:54.959> is

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
been filtering overnight what I'll do is

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.830 
been filtering overnight what I'll do is
I'll<00:02:55.260> vacuum<00:02:55.590> one<00:02:56.519> more<00:02:56.760> time<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.269> then<00:02:57.569> a

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
I'll vacuum one more time and then a

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.940 
I'll vacuum one more time and then a
backwash<00:02:59.690> once<00:03:00.690> I've<00:03:00.870> done<00:03:01.079> that<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.590> will<00:03:01.739> put

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
backwash once I've done that I will put

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.979 
backwash once I've done that I will put
in<00:03:02.099> the<00:03:02.220> stairs<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:02.879> the<00:03:03.239> pool<00:03:03.510> will

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
in the stairs and the pool will

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.020 
in the stairs and the pool will
theoretically<00:03:04.500> be<00:03:04.950> ready<00:03:05.160> for<00:03:05.849> use

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030
