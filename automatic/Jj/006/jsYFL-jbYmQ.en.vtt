00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.410
 This noise is unmistakable. 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.019
 is the same leaving any needle and 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.700
 duékoué fact that going to the dentist can 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.549
 be an unpleasant experience 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.199
 especially for children 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.050
 But does this fear have a 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.519
 logical explanation there are two types of 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.670
 fear the objective fear and the subjective fear the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.380
 Fear goal is when the child has 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.260
 went through a negative experience 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.140
 inside the surgery and generated trauma 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.320
 as a difficult child from us deal 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.610
 have to see the reason for this trauma 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.910
 find out how to treat 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.850
 subjective fear is that fear that the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.190
 Child never went to the office but 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.559
 she has an anxiety inside her for 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.590
 that this anxiety on behalf of 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.110
 mother says that we are horrible 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.469
 To die of a dentist's fear, I do not do this. 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.989
 at home maria 2 years and felipe of six 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.239
 are examples of children who have 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.549
 better had the dread 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.530
 today it is possible to see both one and the 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.520
 another at ease in the chair of the 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.350
 dentist 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.180
 but she says it's been months 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.210
 working the psychological of these 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.090
 small the case of Maria she has two 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.240
 year and a half is a child who attended 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.060
 to a colleague's office and his colleague 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.780
 was not an expert in the field and he 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.090
 approach with this child 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.530
 through a sheet and signed the child 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.350
 in the chair and she has an experience 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.659
 negative so much that the presence of 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.509
 the secretary 's office 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.659
 panic in her and in the case of Felipe was 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.090
 a subjective fear he had never had 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.880
 coming to the office, but he had a 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.280
 Fear too great he arrived tremendous and 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.770
 came to vomit of anxiety 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.600
 It's as if we dealt with it. 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.240
 when we discovered that his fear 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.030
 it was anesthesia so we brought a 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.130
 new technique for this that the safe injecte 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.530
 which is an empty list without a needle 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.710
 We already know that the fear of Felipe 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.080
 It's needle is anesthesia and look I'm going 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.080
 talk saw the way has very grown up has 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.840
 sure that they are still afraid of needle and 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.790
 I will confess that the hill must 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.670
 I will have patience for the 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.890
 doctor danielle and look at people to our 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.560
 joy to the joy of all those 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.709
 that just as I am very afraid of 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.850
 needle anesthesia has been developed 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:36.030
 anesthesia technique that promises to win 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.680
 and the confidence of the on-call 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.380
 Doc explains to us what kind of 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.850
 anesthesia is if this one is a day 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:48.810
 anesthesia without needle was made of 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.480
 in a way that an injection site is a 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.819
 Connie said this tip of 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.910
 silicone is in close contact with the 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.819
 mucosa and with a small shot the 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.310
 anesthetic that is diffused by the 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.500
 epithelium and that way we can 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.950
 anesthesia successfully imagine here 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:14.250
 All around, tell me what you're afraid of. 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:16.850
 dentist no longer has the business 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.850
 doctor me
