kinds of symptoms I don't believe that

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.230 
kinds of symptoms I don't believe that
it<00:02:04.889> would<00:02:05.009> be<00:02:05.100> considered<00:02:05.520> say<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.759> their<00:02:05.969> to

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
it would be considered say to their to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.609 
it would be considered say to their to
treat<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.659> cancer<00:02:06.810> itself<00:02:07.139> with

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
treat the cancer itself with

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.120 
treat the cancer itself with
alternatives<00:02:08.569> this<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.750> combining<00:02:10.229> maybe

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
alternatives this is combining maybe

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.370 
alternatives this is combining maybe
eastern<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:12.000> western<00:02:12.390> medicine<00:02:12.870> together

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
eastern and western medicine together

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.350 
eastern and western medicine together
the<00:02:13.560> eastern<00:02:13.950> medicine<00:02:14.220> helping<00:02:14.790> kind<00:02:15.209> of

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
the eastern medicine helping kind of

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.420 
the eastern medicine helping kind of
combat<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.200> result<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.040> Western

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
combat the result of the Western

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.100 
combat the result of the Western
medicine<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.360> we<00:02:18.450> think<00:02:18.660> it's<00:02:18.780> kind<00:02:18.960> of<00:02:18.990> the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
medicine so we think it's kind of the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.870 
medicine so we think it's kind of the
best<00:02:19.320> of<00:02:19.470> both<00:02:19.590> worlds<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.130> many<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.790> these

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
best of both worlds that many of these

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.730 
best of both worlds that many of these
kids<00:02:21.210> certainly<00:02:21.450> will<00:02:21.900> still<00:02:22.380> need

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
kids certainly will still need

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.770 
kids certainly will still need
their<00:02:23.240> life-saving<00:02:24.240> treatments<00:02:24.660> like

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
their life-saving treatments like

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.690 
their life-saving treatments like
chemotherapy<00:02:24.840> or<00:02:25.530> radiation<00:02:25.800> but

program<00:02:40.620> at<00:02:40.890> Children's<00:02:41.460> what<00:02:42.060> makes<00:02:42.360> the

program at Children's what makes the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.930 
program at Children's what makes the
program<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:43.440> unique<00:02:43.770> I<00:02:44.100> think<00:02:44.550> one<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.820> the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
program so unique I think one of the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.130 
program so unique I think one of the
unique<00:02:45.120> aspects<00:02:45.600> is<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.840> we<00:02:45.960> are<00:02:45.990> the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
unique aspects is that we are the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.870 
unique aspects is that we are the
largest<00:02:46.440> longest<00:02:47.160> running<00:02:47.310> program<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.790> its

largest longest running program of its

largest longest running program of its
kind<00:02:47.970> in<00:02:48.270> North<00:02:48.480> America<00:02:48.990> so<00:02:49.170> we've<00:02:49.320> really

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
kind in North America so we've really

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.990 
kind in North America so we've really
had<00:02:49.650> more<00:02:49.860> experience<00:02:50.280> than<00:02:50.370> anyone<00:02:50.610> else<00:02:50.880> the

had more experience than anyone else the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.240 
had more experience than anyone else the
United<00:02:51.270> States<00:02:51.480> with<00:02:52.380> this<00:02:52.680> kind<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.130> approach

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
United States with this kind of approach

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.490 
United States with this kind of approach
with<00:02:53.670> kids<00:02:53.910> we've<00:02:54.540> definitely<00:02:54.780> always<00:02:55.170> been

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
what we do in safety so that we do a lot

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.180 
what we do in safety so that we do a lot
of<00:03:00.300> research<00:03:00.720> as<00:03:00.900> part<00:03:00.960> of<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.260> program<00:03:01.650> we've

of research as part of the program we've

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.720 
of research as part of the program we've
looked<00:03:02.370> into<00:03:02.520> things<00:03:02.910> like<00:03:04.190> biofeedback<00:03:05.190> for

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
cancer there's a lot of interesting

cancer there's a lot of interesting
research<00:03:12.600> project<00:03:13.050> we've<00:03:13.170> been<00:03:13.230> doing<00:03:13.560> so

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
research project we've been doing so

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.010 
research project we've been doing so
we've<00:03:14.250> tried<00:03:14.550> to<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:15.000> think<00:03:15.300> really<00:03:15.510> balance

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
we've tried to I think really balance

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.020 
we've tried to I think really balance
the<00:03:16.230> excellence<00:03:16.950> in<00:03:17.100> clinical<00:03:17.520> care<00:03:17.550> over

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
the excellence in clinical care over

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.270 
the excellence in clinical care over
time<00:03:18.270> with<00:03:18.870> also<00:03:19.170> looking<00:03:19.530> at<00:03:19.650> how<00:03:20.070> these

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
time with also looking at how these

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.000 
time with also looking at how these
things<00:03:20.340> work<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:21.030> whether<00:03:21.360> they<00:03:21.570> work<00:03:22.010> okay

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
things work and whether they work okay

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.620 
things work and whether they work okay
and<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.400> what<00:03:23.820> would<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:23.970> say<00:03:24.180> are<00:03:24.210> the<00:03:24.480> most

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
and and what would you say are the most

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.230 
and and what would you say are the most
common<00:03:25.170> ailments<00:03:25.770> that<00:03:25.800> are<00:03:26.130> seemed<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.090> be

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
common ailments that are seemed to be

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.840 
common ailments that are seemed to be
showing<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.780> most<00:03:27.900> promise<00:03:28.530> with

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
showing the most promise with

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.030 
showing the most promise with
alternative<00:03:29.850> therapies<00:03:30.300> I<00:03:30.570> think<00:03:31.040> several

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
alternative therapies I think several

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.740 
alternative therapies I think several
things<00:03:32.070> are<00:03:32.400> really<00:03:32.610> promising<00:03:33.180> in<00:03:33.330> terms<00:03:33.360> of

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
things are really promising in terms of

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.260 
things are really promising in terms of
chronic<00:03:34.350> illness<00:03:34.650> in<00:03:34.890> particular<00:03:35.190> if<00:03:36.030> we<00:03:36.150> look

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
chronic illness in particular if we look

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.610 
chronic illness in particular if we look
at<00:03:36.360> things<00:03:36.570> like<00:03:36.660> chronic<00:03:36.990> pain<00:03:37.320> shoulder

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
at things like chronic pain shoulder

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.230 
at things like chronic pain shoulder
with<00:03:37.830> chronic<00:03:38.160> pain<00:03:38.190> are<00:03:38.520> doing<00:03:38.730> very<00:03:39.000> well

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
with chronic pain are doing very well

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.030 
with chronic pain are doing very well
with<00:03:39.270> alternative<00:03:39.870> therapies<00:03:40.230> acupuncture

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
with alternative therapies acupuncture

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.170 
with alternative therapies acupuncture
for<00:03:41.160> example<00:03:41.550> people<00:03:41.700> don't<00:03:41.940> think<00:03:42.060> about

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
for example people don't think about

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.330 
for example people don't think about
that<00:03:42.390> for<00:03:42.690> kids<00:03:42.930> so<00:03:43.170> much<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.770> kids<00:03:44.010> actually
