00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.879
 Confucius Asia Pacific Summit 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.600
 economic cooperation is nearing 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.550
 completion 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.190
 The forum takes place in the suburbs of Beijing on 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.690
 the shore of the Yankee Lake the night before 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.910
 world leaders attended to 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.310
 gala dinner and you probably already 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.800
 have seen photos of the heads of the participating countries from 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.660
 with bright national costumes that 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.789
 China's rulers were never worn 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.900
 it seems not everyone felt like that 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.970
 clothes comfortable 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.250
 so many heads of state are going to 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.679
 one event not so often for example 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.899
 Presidents Putin and Obama did not appear in 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.670
 one place since june this year when 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.730
 came to france in celebration 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.079
 jubilee of the Allied landings in Normandy 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.250
 the leaders of Russia and the United States exchanged 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.200
 several phrases 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.600
 may soon be held 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.969
 more official meeting of Putin and Obama 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.399
 however, no agreement on this 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.500
 not yet at large meetings 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.180
 the number of world leaders is always very 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.059
 interesting to watch facial expressions and gestures 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.250
 and the behavior of politicians for example 10 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.230
 November, President Obama hit the lenses 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.420
 cameras when walked at the end of the process and 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.700
 communicated with the heads of small states 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.159
 President Putin, on the contrary, keeps closer 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.110
 to the center at the photography ceremony 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.320
 he stood next to the head of the host 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.030
 country chairman china si jinping 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.310
 remains a mystery why dinner table 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.890
 was decorated in such a way that arose 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.600
 associations with the Russian flag for 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.420
 The last few days a number of important have been signed 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.210
 documents for Russia of great importance 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.530
 have gas deals with china 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.450
 the parties intend to start work on 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.759
 Western gas pipeline construction 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.619
 route which will be in addition to 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.840
 eastern route of agreement on 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.579
 which were achieved earlier in 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.170
 As a result, China will become the largest 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.630
 importer of Russian gas 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.939
 China has made some agreements with 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.860
 other countries of China and Malaysia 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.780
 signed a bank creation agreement 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.790
 which all operations will be carried out in 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.100
 national currencies and although the president 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.380
 Obama at one time talked about turning on 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.460
 east american dollar can pass 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.460
 positions in this region
