00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.009
 next cylinder I want to add to you 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.080
 I will say 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.080
 I insert the next cylinder 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.860
 Well then everything was done the following valve 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.170
 I do the next cylinder here I have 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.470
 the cutting pads are exposed to the inlet valve by 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.270
 size i mean i pass them and then 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.480
 I already exhibit at graduation 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.669
 prom well you principle everything is clear 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:33.100
 The main thing I wanted to add is pay 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:38.260
 attention what for what i start over 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:41.170
 make two corners and then the main under 45 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:45.370
 degrees the very end you just i 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.860
 spat the whole thing good and you saw 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.730
 so that I do literally 45 degrees 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.640
 a little bit 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.010
 that is, I didn't have to gnaw 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.760
 many 45 degrees I first he 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.190
 put the edit on both sides 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.790
 then Terni at 45 degrees a few 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.979
 turns and I had a good 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.740
 edge working 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.640
 it is very important 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.420
 to the extent that I didn't rub very deeply 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.520
 and I didn't leave didn't saddle very much 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.670
 very far i mean i literally 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.409
 a little bit 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.740
 corrected the work surface 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.280
 that is, basically the main one I chose with two 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.590
 dimensions and corrected the main 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.060
 the size of my saddle turned out 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.470
 as close as necessary to need and 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.250
 depth before landing our valve 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.289
 this is very important if i start now 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.530
 rub the floor at 45 degrees then again 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.149
 come back to the other cones then I'm all 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.940
 I will squander time 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.000
 saddle deeper and deeper and deeper and hugging 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.140
 valve generally fail and 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.679
 hydrocompensator is not an election where choose 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.909
 right size here it will be wrong 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:08.369
 work and again 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:13.450
 Khan's saddle will have to be times 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:17.170
 affects the saddle or change heads 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.170
 Here I choose 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:26.370
 here here is much better here goes with 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:34.020
 evenly here goes more or less 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:40.190
 right all so it goes with us so it 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.190
 here we go here here I look 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.160
 these barn 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.290
 exhibited with nuances that is me 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.060
 there on the valve 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.349
 formed on top I showed you on 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:03:01.530
 the circle did not make such a groove 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:04.620
 the arm was slightly offset from that 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:10.739
 of our marriage which we saw on 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:13.950
 bad how did it come to this 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.290
 the time is now, and then increase the teacher color 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.549
 gradually tapering already there a little bit there 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.880
 do you think sticks out 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:27.410
 its business is maximally well in the middle 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.410
 basically everything is so here in the third cylinder 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:35.269
 such a very big trouble with the saddle here 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.269
 big furrow that's how you can see on 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.269
 the fourth 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.870
 more precisely then we have in the second this in the first 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.990
 before the gilding correctly lies and thought 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.730
 vice versa is deployed so okay in general 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:57.330
 fight is very big here it is 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:10.260
 valve here we have 2 can be seen on the valve where 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:18.390
 this furrow is so visible here 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:22.950
 dark spot is dark spot and here 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:28.020
 see what is so incomprehensible such such 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:30.660
 choosing yes yes I now draw out and 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.340
 put the edge of the court can be very hard 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:39.240
 I have this deep furrow 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.120
 then come from this furrow on the side 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.790
 the press itself is the valve itself 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:48.990
 pass the saddle so I have a little bit here 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:51.470
 45 degrees I have already walked so where 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:56.930
 my cane to show you 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:59.060
 here are examples here for 45 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.060
 degrees is tronca and here we go 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:05.030
 furrow i.e. it goes a little bit lower 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:09.160
 and I will grind my tronca 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.600
 it will not work here on the valve 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:16.100
 it will work out somewhere 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:18.640
 on the valve a little bit closer to the middle but 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.840
 in principle, nothing wrong with that 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.890
 well everything will work everything will 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.540
 it's ok to close here but better 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:30.230
 let it be a little bit of tramp 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:34.220
 closer valve than I sit down strongly 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:39.980
 food and and tone is unclear what it all 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:42.020
 will lead here well when true separately as it were 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.880
 will pay this attention as we will 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.360
 grind everything and how we do it 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:52.310
 where it will turn out okay good 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:56.510
 further so I finished our good 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:59.770
 head at least until that moment 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:02.780
 until i clean out all the valve 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:06.890
 that's when i clean i see what's here 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:10.070
 we probably need the edge of the valve 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:12.890
 give only rove this one 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:16.790
 here is an angle of 45 degrees will remove 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:19.140
 literally a couple of meters or how many 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:22.440
 will turn out 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:26.100
 I do not think that there will be a lot 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:30.970
 that's it 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.650
 I will give only release looks and makes 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.170
 not valve 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:41.650
 restore then we after that 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:44.160
 take and start fraying and I'm on 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:48.060
 right now 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:53.040
 unfolds and begin to embed our 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:57.180
 pistons directly into the cylinders 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.180
 already directly here 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:07.920
 collect down the motor our block 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.920
 everything
