00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
bear and a tiara I think two markers but

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.200 
bear and a tiara I think two markers but
on<00:01:43.390> each<00:01:44.050> side<00:01:44.410> the<00:01:44.740> double-sided<00:01:45.280> on<00:01:45.550> these

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
on each side the double-sided on these

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.830 
on each side the double-sided on these
two<00:01:46.570> nibel<00:01:47.020> double-sided<00:01:47.950> markers<00:01:48.580> are<00:01:49.240> blue

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
two nibel double-sided markers are blue

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.770

and<00:01:49.869> purple<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.550> pink<00:01:51.550> and<00:01:51.729> red<00:01:51.880> so<00:01:52.300> maybe

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
and purple and pink and red so maybe

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.260 
and purple and pink and red so maybe
this<00:01:53.050> could<00:01:53.259> count<00:01:53.530> as<00:01:53.770> four<00:01:54.220> markers<00:01:54.700> I<00:01:54.940> think

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
this could count as four markers I think

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.520
