boutique handmade modulation delay with
four<00:01:00.910> controls<00:01:01.390> for<00:01:01.720> delay

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
four controls for delay

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.440 
four controls for delay
depth<00:01:02.500> tracking<00:01:03.160> and<00:01:03.309> blend<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:07.060> here<00:01:07.270> I'm

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
depth tracking and blend so here I'm

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.960 
depth tracking and blend so here I'm
striking<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:07.930> chord<00:01:08.140> once<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.610> then<00:01:09.729> we<00:01:09.820> have

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
striking the chord once and then we have

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:10.650 
striking the chord once and then we have
a<00:01:10.000> short<00:01:10.330> delay

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
a short delay

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.749 
a short delay
that's<00:01:11.200> modulated<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.100> it's<00:01:12.280> dropping<00:01:12.700> a

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
that's modulated and it's dropping a

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.450 
that's modulated and it's dropping a
pitch<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:15.340> we<00:01:16.180> can<00:01:16.330> adjust<00:01:16.420> that<00:01:16.720> just<00:01:17.290> by

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
pitch and we can adjust that just by

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.740 
pitch and we can adjust that just by
changing<00:01:18.460> some<00:01:18.700> controls<00:01:19.210> here<00:01:19.390> there's<00:01:19.600> the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
changing some controls here there's the

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:33.180 
changing some controls here there's the
delay<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:26.140> longer<00:01:26.740> delay<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:32.500> seems<00:01:32.800> to<00:01:32.950> react

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
delay a longer delay it seems to react

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.340 
delay a longer delay it seems to react
to<00:01:33.220> it<00:01:33.550> with<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:33.940> pig<00:01:34.390> attack<00:01:34.690> how<00:01:35.020> hard<00:01:35.259> you

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
to it with the pig attack how hard you

00:01:35.350 --> 00:02:04.950 
to it with the pig attack how hard you
hit

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:45.100 

there's<00:02:05.960> tracking<00:02:27.100> here's<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.280> depth

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:57.410 

there's<00:02:46.110> your<00:02:46.319> blend<00:02:55.610> that's<00:02:56.610> basically<00:02:57.090> just

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
there's your blend that's basically just

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.140 
there's your blend that's basically just
the<00:02:57.569> effect<00:02:57.959> there's<00:02:58.319> no<00:02:58.590> natural<00:02:59.489> attack<00:02:59.970> at

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
the effect there's no natural attack at

00:03:00.150 --> 00:04:40.110 
the effect there's no natural attack at
all

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.249 

and<00:04:41.120> of<00:04:41.240> course<00:04:41.449> you<00:04:41.599> could<00:04:41.780> combine<00:04:41.990> this

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
and of course you could combine this

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:43.689 
and of course you could combine this
with<00:04:42.319> any<00:04:42.620> other<00:04:42.860> effect<00:04:43.219> but<00:04:43.430> I'm<00:04:43.520> just<00:04:43.580> gonna

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
with any other effect but I'm just gonna

00:04:43.699 --> 00:06:01.139 
with any other effect but I'm just gonna
put<00:04:43.969> a<00:04:44.000> distortion<00:04:44.419> in<00:04:44.599> front<00:04:44.810> of<00:04:44.870> it

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:01.149
