00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.700 

we<00:00:40.940> were<00:00:41.059> lucky<00:00:41.420> enough<00:00:41.570> to<00:00:41.870> work<00:00:42.020> with<00:00:42.230> to

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
we were lucky enough to work with to

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.799 
we were lucky enough to work with to
start<00:00:43.160> off<00:00:43.309> with<00:00:43.579> casting<00:00:44.000> Sebastian<00:00:44.540> below

he's<00:00:45.290> almost<00:00:46.129> too<00:00:46.879> perfect<00:00:47.120> for<00:00:47.390> mocap<00:00:47.809> you

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
he's almost too perfect for mocap you

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.610 
he's almost too perfect for mocap you
know<00:00:48.290> him<00:00:48.649> he's<00:00:48.920> like<00:00:49.390> super<00:00:50.390> athletic<00:00:50.690> he<00:00:51.469> can

know him he's like super athletic he can
he<00:00:51.860> can<00:00:51.890> sometimes<00:00:52.370> move<00:00:52.550> better<00:00:52.790> than<00:00:53.030> even

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
he can sometimes move better than even

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.310 
he can sometimes move better than even
can<00:00:53.420> actually<00:00:53.690> move<00:00:53.809> and<00:00:53.989> we<00:00:54.050> have<00:00:54.170> to

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
can actually move and we have to

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.479 
can actually move and we have to
sometimes<00:00:54.650> even<00:00:54.860> slow<00:00:55.070> him<00:00:55.100> down<00:00:55.220> a<00:00:55.370> little

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
sometimes even slow him down a little

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.100 
sometimes even slow him down a little
bit<00:00:55.730> which<00:00:55.879> is<00:00:55.909> very<00:00:56.180> very<00:00:56.300> rare<00:00:56.600> in<00:00:56.750> mocap

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
bit which is very very rare in mocap

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.780

usually<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:57.800> animators<00:00:58.159> have<00:00:58.280> to<00:00:58.399> go<00:00:58.519> in<00:00:58.670> and

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
usually the animators have to go in and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.060 
usually the animators have to go in and
speed<00:00:59.390> up<00:00:59.420> and<00:00:59.629> augment<00:00:59.930> the<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.589> animation

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
speed up and augment the the animation

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.340 
speed up and augment the the animation
but<00:01:01.190> actually<00:01:01.519> sabash<00:01:02.030> is<00:01:02.180> so<00:01:02.390> athletic<00:01:02.540> that

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
but actually sabash is so athletic that

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.139 
but actually sabash is so athletic that
he<00:01:03.530> can<00:01:03.649> do<00:01:03.769> actually<00:01:04.489> more<00:01:04.670> than<00:01:04.699> aiden<00:01:05.000> can

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
he can do actually more than aiden can

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:11.650 
he can do actually more than aiden can
really<00:01:05.420> do<00:01:05.540> in<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:05.750> game

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.150 

it's<00:01:12.660> a<00:01:12.780> pocket<00:01:13.110> was<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.230> big<00:01:13.440> thing<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.680> us<00:01:13.920> I

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
it's a pocket was a big thing for us I

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.070 
it's a pocket was a big thing for us I
never<00:01:14.760> seen<00:01:14.940> anybody<00:01:15.150> really<00:01:15.480> try<00:01:15.690> to<00:01:15.750> do<00:01:15.960> this

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
never seen anybody really try to do this

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.750 
never seen anybody really try to do this
in<00:01:16.230> a<00:01:16.290> pin<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.800> video<00:01:17.010> game<00:01:17.070> before<00:01:17.490> because

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
in a pin in a video game before because

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.210 
in a pin in a video game before because
it's<00:01:17.910> very<00:01:18.060> complicated<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:19.140> make<00:01:19.410> a<00:01:19.470> hand<00:01:20.010> go

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
it's very complicated to make a hand go

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.920 
it's very complicated to make a hand go
into<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> pocket<00:01:20.730> in<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.150> believable<00:01:21.480> way<00:01:21.690> and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
into a pocket in a believable way and

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.380 
into a pocket in a believable way and
have<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.440> cloth<00:01:22.680> move<00:01:23.070> with<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:24.030> pocket

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
have the cloth move with the pocket

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.850 
have the cloth move with the pocket
because<00:01:24.750> we<00:01:24.870> have<00:01:24.960> simulated<00:01:25.380> cloth<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:25.830> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
because we have simulated cloth on the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.590 
because we have simulated cloth on the
characters<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:27.000> built<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.240> simple

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
characters so we just built the simple

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.300 
characters so we just built the simple
rope<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.110> hang<00:01:28.290> around<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.590> neck<00:01:28.740> when

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
rope that you hang around the neck when

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.010 
rope that you hang around the neck when
he<00:01:29.370> walks<00:01:29.580> it<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:30.330> kind<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.510> helps<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.840> hands

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
he walks it just kind of helps the hands

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.240 
he walks it just kind of helps the hands
hang<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.410> the<00:01:31.500> correct<00:01:31.740> position<00:01:37.160> Brayden<00:01:38.160> we

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
hang in the correct position Brayden we

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.680 
hang in the correct position Brayden we
tried<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.550> create<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.790> fighting<00:01:39.120> style<00:01:39.360> that's

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
tried to create a fighting style that's

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.330 
tried to create a fighting style that's
a<00:01:39.810> lot<00:01:39.960> more<00:01:40.229> realistic<00:01:40.800> than<00:01:41.010> you<00:01:41.220> normally

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
a lot more realistic than you normally

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.740 
a lot more realistic than you normally
see<00:01:41.759> we<00:01:41.910> didn't<00:01:42.060> want<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.270> do<00:01:42.330> anything<00:01:42.540> that

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
see we didn't want to do anything that
