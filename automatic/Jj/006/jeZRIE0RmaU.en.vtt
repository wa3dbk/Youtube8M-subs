00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.490 
I'll try that I do find that warm things
go<00:02:12.450> down<00:02:12.660> better<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.260> I

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
go down better and I

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
go down better and I

was horrible but everything has gotten
better<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:43.709> feel<00:02:43.980> like<00:02:44.100> water<00:02:44.490> goes<00:02:44.820> down

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
better and I feel like water goes down

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.360 
better and I feel like water goes down
harder<00:02:45.510> than<00:02:45.810> anything<00:02:46.140> else<00:02:46.500> broth<00:02:47.100> goes

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
harder than anything else broth goes

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.740 
harder than anything else broth goes
down<00:02:47.580> fine<00:02:47.880> um<00:02:49.040> but<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:51.000> cream<00:02:51.209> soup<00:02:51.480> went

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750
