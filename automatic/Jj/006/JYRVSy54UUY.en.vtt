let's talk about playing bass notes on

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.150 
let's talk about playing bass notes on
the<00:00:07.240> accordion<00:00:07.509> one<00:00:08.440> thing<00:00:08.680> that<00:00:08.800> I<00:00:08.830> would<00:00:09.010> say

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.160 
the accordion one thing that I would say

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.650 
the accordion one thing that I would say
that's<00:00:09.340> really<00:00:09.760> important<00:00:10.300> is<00:00:10.450> that<00:00:10.480> you

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:10.660 
that's really important is that you

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.140 
that's really important is that you
stand<00:00:11.110> in<00:00:11.260> front<00:00:11.410> of<00:00:11.560> a<00:00:11.650> mirror<00:00:11.980> not<00:00:12.760> only<00:00:13.000> is

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 
stand in front of a mirror not only is

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.670 
stand in front of a mirror not only is
it<00:00:13.180> important<00:00:13.750> to<00:00:13.840> be<00:00:13.960> able<00:00:14.019> to<00:00:14.200> see<00:00:14.500> what

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
it important to be able to see what

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.180 
it important to be able to see what
you're<00:00:14.800> doing

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
you're doing

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.620 
you're doing
you<00:00:15.430> need<00:00:15.580> to<00:00:15.700> feel<00:00:15.910> it<00:00:16.059> and<00:00:16.180> see<00:00:16.330> it<00:00:16.359> at<00:00:16.539> the

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
you need to feel it and see it at the

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.179 
you need to feel it and see it at the
same<00:00:16.810> time<00:00:16.869> until<00:00:17.380> you<00:00:17.619> kind<00:00:17.859> of<00:00:17.920> get<00:00:18.099> a<00:00:18.130> handle

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:18.189 
same time until you kind of get a handle

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:20.060 
same time until you kind of get a handle
of<00:00:18.760> what<00:00:18.939> goes<00:00:19.119> on<00:00:19.240> with<00:00:19.420> the<00:00:19.539> left<00:00:19.749> hand

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
of what goes on with the left hand

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.800 
of what goes on with the left hand
something<00:00:21.070> that's<00:00:21.220> really<00:00:21.730> helped<00:00:22.060> my<00:00:22.300> left

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
something that's really helped my left

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.800 
something that's really helped my left
hand<00:00:23.079> playing<00:00:23.349> has<00:00:23.890> been<00:00:24.130> to<00:00:24.279> run<00:00:24.429> scales<00:00:24.970> with

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
hand playing has been to run scales with

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.849 
hand playing has been to run scales with
my<00:00:26.259> left<00:00:26.739> hand<00:00:26.859> in<00:00:27.369> every<00:00:28.239> position<00:00:29.050> possible

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
my left hand in every position possible

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.790 
my left hand in every position possible
so<00:00:30.489> let's<00:00:30.819> start<00:00:31.149> with<00:00:31.300> a<00:00:31.329> basic<00:00:31.630> C<00:00:32.320> scale

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
so let's start with a basic C scale

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.880 
so let's start with a basic C scale
starting<00:00:33.790> on<00:00:33.850> the<00:00:34.420> fundamental<00:00:35.050> base<00:00:35.230> note

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
starting on the fundamental base note

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.170 
starting on the fundamental base note
line<00:00:36.309> with<00:00:36.789> a<00:00:36.820> C

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.360 

and<00:00:41.720> then<00:00:42.050> circle<00:00:42.380> of<00:00:42.470> fifths<00:00:42.650> the<00:00:42.950> next<00:00:43.190> note

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
and then circle of fifths the next note

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.920 
and then circle of fifths the next note
up<00:00:43.520> and<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:43.850> line<00:00:44.000> will<00:00:44.150> be<00:00:44.240> G<00:00:44.510> we're<00:00:44.750> going<00:00:44.870> to

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
up and the line will be G we're going to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.020 
up and the line will be G we're going to
skip<00:00:45.110> that<00:00:45.290> to<00:00:45.410> go<00:00:45.530> to<00:00:45.590> the<00:00:45.710> D

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.180 

moving<00:00:50.750> to<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:50.990> counter<00:00:51.350> base<00:00:51.560> row<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.160> first

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
moving to the counter base row the first

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.080 
moving to the counter base row the first
row<00:00:52.580> just<00:00:53.090> above<00:00:53.270> the<00:00:53.420> sea

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.840 

here's<00:00:56.600> your<00:00:56.750> e<00:00:56.930> back<00:00:57.860> to<00:00:58.130> the<00:00:58.250> fundamental

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
here's your e back to the fundamental

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.740 
here's your e back to the fundamental
base<00:00:58.970> note<00:00:59.270> line

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.920 

skipping<00:01:04.739> over<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.040> C<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.060> G

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.800 

counter<00:01:10.930> base<00:01:11.110> road<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.560> a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.420 

to<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> bee

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.670 

back<00:01:21.430> to<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.729> sea

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.650 

and<00:01:25.430> I<00:01:25.580> think<00:01:25.760> if<00:01:25.850> you<00:01:25.940> just<00:01:25.970> keep<00:01:26.300> running

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
and I think if you just keep running

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.960 
and I think if you just keep running
those<00:01:27.170> scales<00:01:27.770> over<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:28.310> over<00:01:28.520> it<00:01:28.580> really

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
those scales over and over it really

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.370 
those scales over and over it really
will<00:01:29.120> help<00:01:29.330> your<00:01:29.420> left<00:01:29.660> hand<00:01:29.840> playing<00:01:30.050> even

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
will help your left hand playing even

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.420 
will help your left hand playing even
saying<00:01:30.650> them<00:01:30.830> as<00:01:30.950> you<00:01:31.040> go<00:01:31.070> c<00:01:31.910> d<00:01:32.450> e<00:01:32.960> f<00:01:33.620> g<00:01:34.000> a<00:01:35.000> b<00:01:35.660> c

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
saying them as you go c d e f g a b c

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:43.730 
saying them as you go c d e f g a b c
just<00:01:37.430> doing<00:01:37.670> them<00:01:37.790> over<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.120> over

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.130 

and<00:01:44.070> what's<00:01:44.850> great<00:01:45.120> because<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> accordion

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
and what's great because the accordion

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.750 
and what's great because the accordion
is<00:01:46.350> set<00:01:46.590> up<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.890> circle<00:01:47.190> of<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.610> can

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
is set up in the circle of this you can

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:56.930 
is set up in the circle of this you can
do<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.030> anywhere<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.170> instrument

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:04.890 

hmmm<00:01:57.950> even<00:01:58.950> at<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.160> other<00:01:59.310> end

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.990 

and<00:02:05.900> I<00:02:06.560> think<00:02:06.620> by<00:02:06.980> going<00:02:07.190> over<00:02:07.400> these<00:02:07.640> scales

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
and I think by going over these scales

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.180 
and I think by going over these scales
you<00:02:08.570> can<00:02:08.600> really<00:02:09.050> begin<00:02:09.320> to<00:02:09.350> have<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.649> grasp<00:02:09.979> of

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
you can really begin to have a grasp of

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.800 
you can really begin to have a grasp of
what<00:02:10.250> needs<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:10.789> happen<00:02:11.090> with<00:02:11.210> the<00:02:11.360> left<00:02:11.540> hand

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
what needs to happen with the left hand

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.350 
what needs to happen with the left hand
and<00:02:11.960> you're<00:02:12.080> playing
