00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
and not see it very well there but

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.640 
and not see it very well there but
there's<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.790> black<00:02:41.030> wire<00:02:41.330> in<00:02:41.600> there<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:42.500> goes

most<00:02:46.670> of<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:46.940> colors<00:02:47.240> I've<00:02:47.390> done<00:02:47.570> so<00:02:47.750> far

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
most of the colors I've done so far

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.420 
most of the colors I've done so far
there's<00:02:48.140> also<00:02:48.320> a<00:02:48.470> blue<00:02:48.770> wire<00:02:48.980> that<00:02:49.190> goes<00:02:49.250> to

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
the read switch but in this case we have

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.740 
the read switch but in this case we have
not<00:02:51.380> wired<00:02:51.710> it<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.220> read<00:02:52.400> switch<00:02:52.750> the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:25.200 

now<00:03:16.130> if<00:03:16.340> we<00:03:16.460> turn<00:03:16.730> this<00:03:16.880> DL<00:03:20.920> DHL<00:03:21.920> truck<00:03:22.490> on<00:03:24.040> and

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
now if we turn this DL DHL truck on and

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.850 
now if we turn this DL DHL truck on and
send<00:03:26.210> it<00:03:26.330> towards<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:28.280> sensor<00:03:29.530> see<00:03:30.530> how<00:03:30.650> far

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
send it towards the sensor see how far

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.400 
send it towards the sensor see how far
back<00:03:31.070> it<00:03:31.340> stopped<00:03:31.670> from<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.210> IR<00:03:32.540> LED<00:03:33.020> cuz

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
back it stopped from the IR LED cuz

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.880 
back it stopped from the IR LED cuz
that's<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.710> 5<00:03:33.920> millimeter<00:03:34.190> IR<00:03:34.820> LED<00:03:35.390> and<00:03:35.840> we<00:03:36.680> have

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
that's a 5 millimeter IR LED and we have

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.950 
that's a 5 millimeter IR LED and we have
the<00:03:37.010> DC<00:03:37.370> command<00:03:37.730> controller<00:03:38.240> turned<00:03:38.600> down<00:03:38.780> to

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
the DC command controller turned down to

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.250 
the DC command controller turned down to
speed<00:03:39.230> zero<00:03:39.650> if<00:03:40.550> we<00:03:40.730> turn<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.180> speed<00:03:41.420> up<00:03:41.450> the

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
speed zero if we turn the speed up the

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.670 
speed zero if we turn the speed up the
truck<00:03:42.500> takes<00:03:42.800> off<00:03:43.510> down<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:45.080> stops<00:03:46.060> it<00:03:47.060> stops

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
truck takes off down it stops it stops

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.040 
truck takes off down it stops it stops
so<00:03:48.680> now<00:03:48.830> we're<00:03:49.040> at<00:03:49.130> speed<00:03:49.459> zero<00:03:50.090> we'll<00:03:50.840> take

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
so now we're at speed zero we'll take

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.090 
so now we're at speed zero we'll take
this<00:03:51.260> truck<00:03:51.970> we'll<00:03:52.970> set<00:03:53.209> it<00:03:53.240> up<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:53.660> track<00:03:54.100> at

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
this truck we'll set it up the track at

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.490 
this truck we'll set it up the track at
speed<00:03:55.520> zero<00:03:57.160> will<00:03:58.160> come<00:03:58.340> down

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
speed zero will come down

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.170 
speed zero will come down
as<00:04:01.500> you<00:04:01.620> can<00:04:01.739> see<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.159> truck<00:04:02.430> stops<00:04:02.790> well

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
as you can see the truck stops well

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.850 
as you can see the truck stops well
behind<00:04:03.689> the<00:04:04.019> 5<00:04:04.260> millimeter<00:04:04.640> IR<00:04:05.640> LED<00:04:06.739> now<00:04:07.739> I'll

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
behind the 5 millimeter IR LED now I'll

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:19.219 
behind the 5 millimeter IR LED now I'll
go<00:04:08.010> turn<00:04:08.220> on<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.549> truck<00:04:16.370> as<00:04:17.370> you<00:04:18.209> see<00:04:18.479> the

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
go turn on the truck as you see the

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.960 
go turn on the truck as you see the
lights<00:04:19.410> powered<00:04:20.009> on<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.370> tell<00:04:20.579> us<00:04:20.699> that<00:04:20.850> the

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
lights powered on to tell us that the

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.920 
lights powered on to tell us that the
DCT<00:04:21.479> coder<00:04:21.780> is<00:04:22.079> now<00:04:22.440> on<00:04:23.210> now<00:04:24.210> if<00:04:24.360> we<00:04:24.509> turn<00:04:24.780> on

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
DCT coder is now on now if we turn on

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.450 
DCT coder is now on now if we turn on
the<00:04:25.080> bus<00:04:25.289> and<00:04:25.800> send<00:04:26.669> it<00:04:26.820> towards<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.360> truck<00:04:28.460> it

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
the bus and send it towards the truck it

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.450 
the bus and send it towards the truck it
should<00:04:29.789> stop<00:04:30.060> before<00:04:30.300> it<00:04:30.630> gets<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.460> truck

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
should stop before it gets to the truck

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.250 
should stop before it gets to the truck
because<00:04:32.699> the<00:04:32.760> IR<00:04:33.180> LEDs<00:04:33.720> are<00:04:33.900> putting<00:04:34.139> out<00:04:34.229> a

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
because the IR LEDs are putting out a

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:44.870 
because the IR LEDs are putting out a
signal<00:04:42.680> now<00:04:43.680> we<00:04:43.740> come<00:04:44.070> back<00:04:44.100> to<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.580> command

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
signal now we come back to the command

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.500 
signal now we come back to the command
control<00:04:45.449> center<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.710> if<00:04:46.979> we<00:04:47.160> hit<00:04:47.340> zero<00:04:48.060> the

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
control center and if we hit zero the

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:57.189 
control center and if we hit zero the
lights<00:04:48.720> on<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.080> truck<00:04:49.320> come<00:04:49.560> on<00:04:50.720> on<00:04:54.470> blinker

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
lights on the truck come on on blinker

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:08.540 
lights on the truck come on on blinker
other<00:04:58.199> blinker<00:05:02.389> hazards<00:05:03.389> lights

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.749 

now<00:05:09.120> if<00:05:09.270> we<00:05:09.389> hit<00:05:09.539> the<00:05:09.720> f4<00:05:09.960> button<00:05:10.919> it<00:05:11.280> turns<00:05:11.520> the

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 
now if we hit the f4 button it turns the

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:15.170 
now if we hit the f4 button it turns the
reed<00:05:11.970> switch<00:05:12.150> off<00:05:12.539> and<00:05:13.319> we<00:05:14.250> can<00:05:14.400> dial<00:05:14.729> up<00:05:14.970> the

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
reed switch off and we can dial up the

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.719 
reed switch off and we can dial up the
speed<00:05:15.530> but<00:05:16.530> we're<00:05:16.650> going<00:05:16.770> to<00:05:16.830> turn<00:05:17.099> this<00:05:17.430> truck

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
speed but we're going to turn this truck

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.159 
speed but we're going to turn this truck
around<00:05:19.159> and<00:05:20.159> hopefully<00:05:20.610> the<00:05:21.479> truck<00:05:21.780> when<00:05:22.050> it

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
around and hopefully the truck when it

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:30.520 
around and hopefully the truck when it
gets<00:05:22.319> to<00:05:22.530> it<00:05:22.620> will<00:05:22.800> stop

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530
