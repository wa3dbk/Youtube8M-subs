00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.079
 You are the color of your preference. 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:03.320
 in shock to find a way 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.580
 It's better for me to do the 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.800
 tiny hearts is very simple 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.229
 this line has a child fans and this is 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.310

 r is a back and forth and back and forth 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:48.920
 doing very slowly so as not to miss 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.660
 because I am also with 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.190

 A little draw here downstairs stayed 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.690
 here for no purpose 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:08.510

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.780

 catch my view that extra sparkle gives 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.239
 a certain brightness becomes much more beautiful well 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.070
