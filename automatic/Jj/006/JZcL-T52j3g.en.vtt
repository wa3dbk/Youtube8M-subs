00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
could finish it easily and she did so it

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.970

a<00:03:29.440> nice<00:03:29.680> work<00:03:29.980> on<00:03:30.190> that<00:03:31.019> okay<00:03:32.019> well<00:03:32.530> would<00:03:32.709> you

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
a nice work on that okay well would you

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.729 
a nice work on that okay well would you
tell<00:03:33.040> me<00:03:33.190> what<00:03:33.489> do<00:03:33.549> you<00:03:33.670> think<00:03:33.910> of<00:03:34.060> this<00:03:34.239> toy

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.220 

but<00:03:38.739> you<00:03:38.890> need<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.430> be<00:03:40.000> very<00:03:40.239> careful<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.049> have

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
but you need to be very careful and have

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.330 
but you need to be very careful and have
a<00:03:41.260> duck<00:03:41.590> has<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.610> be<00:03:42.760> able<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:43.090> do<00:03:43.390> it<00:03:43.570> so<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:44.340> it

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
a duck has to be able to do it so it it

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.250 
a duck has to be able to do it so it it
doesn't<00:03:45.670> just<00:03:45.850> cut<00:03:46.450> up<00:03:46.600> so<00:03:46.840> what<00:03:46.930> you<00:03:47.019> do<00:03:47.170> it

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
doesn't just cut up so what you do it

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.100 
doesn't just cut up so what you do it
and<00:03:47.470> you<00:03:47.560> need<00:03:47.709> to<00:03:47.829> have<00:03:47.920> patience<00:03:48.750> so<00:03:49.750> it<00:03:49.870> sort

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
and you need to have patience so it sort

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.020 
and you need to have patience so it sort
of<00:03:50.170> seems<00:03:50.380> like<00:03:50.470> a<00:03:50.590> puzzle<00:03:51.130> in<00:03:51.340> that<00:03:51.700> there<00:03:51.940> are

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
of seems like a puzzle in that there are

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.340 
of seems like a puzzle in that there are
lots<00:03:52.180> of<00:03:52.299> little<00:03:52.450> pieces<00:03:52.780> I<00:03:53.049> think<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.260> hundred

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
lots of little pieces I think a hundred

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.020 
lots of little pieces I think a hundred
and<00:03:53.620> seventy-six<00:03:54.010> pieces<00:03:54.459> you<00:03:54.670> put<00:03:54.880> together

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
and seventy-six pieces you put together

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.840 
and seventy-six pieces you put together
so<00:03:55.900> it's<00:03:56.110> painstaking<00:03:56.620> work<00:03:57.220> but<00:03:57.670> at<00:03:57.730> least

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
so it's painstaking work but at least

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.039 
so it's painstaking work but at least
with<00:03:58.000> a<00:03:58.030> puzzle<00:03:58.420> when<00:03:58.540> you're<00:03:58.660> done<00:03:58.750> you<00:03:58.930> have

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
with a puzzle when you're done you have

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.319 
with a puzzle when you're done you have
that<00:03:59.230> big<00:03:59.380> nice<00:03:59.829> picture<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.549> look<00:04:00.700> at<00:04:00.850> this

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
that big nice picture to look at this

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.030 
that big nice picture to look at this
one<00:04:01.600> as<00:04:01.810> soon<00:04:02.019> as<00:04:02.140> you<00:04:02.230> get<00:04:02.380> it<00:04:02.500> done<00:04:02.530> what<00:04:03.010> are

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
one as soon as you get it done what are

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.520 
one as soon as you get it done what are
you<00:04:03.100> gonna<00:04:03.220> do<00:04:03.400> with<00:04:03.549> it<00:04:04.019> smash<00:04:05.019> it<00:04:05.290> and<00:04:05.410> the

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
you gonna do with it smash it and the

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.810 
you gonna do with it smash it and the
pieces<00:04:05.709> and<00:04:06.070> have<00:04:06.190> to<00:04:06.280> start<00:04:06.489> all<00:04:06.579> over<00:04:06.640> again

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
pieces and have to start all over again

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.330 
pieces and have to start all over again
so<00:04:07.239> if<00:04:07.750> your<00:04:08.079> kid<00:04:08.320> has<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.680> temperament<00:04:09.100> for

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
so if your kid has the temperament for

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.190 
so if your kid has the temperament for
that<00:04:09.640> then<00:04:09.940> this<00:04:10.090> is<00:04:10.239> a<00:04:10.269> lot<00:04:10.570> of<00:04:10.690> fun<00:04:10.870> it<00:04:11.170> looks

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
that then this is a lot of fun it looks

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.830 
that then this is a lot of fun it looks
like<00:04:11.590> but<00:04:11.920> if<00:04:12.489> they're<00:04:12.850> not<00:04:13.420> gonna<00:04:13.570> have<00:04:13.750> the

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
like but if they're not gonna have the

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.600 
like but if they're not gonna have the
temperament<00:04:14.230> to<00:04:14.440> sit<00:04:14.829> still<00:04:15.130> and<00:04:15.190> put<00:04:15.519> it

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
temperament to sit still and put it

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.860 
temperament to sit still and put it
together<00:04:15.730> in<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.060> first<00:04:16.299> place<00:04:16.570> and

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
together in the first place and

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.659 
together in the first place and
certainly<00:04:17.590> not<00:04:17.769> to<00:04:17.829> do<00:04:18.130> it<00:04:18.250> again<00:04:18.489> after

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
certainly not to do it again after

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.039 
certainly not to do it again after
they've<00:04:19.000> spent<00:04:19.299> all<00:04:19.450> that<00:04:19.479> time<00:04:19.660> and<00:04:19.840> then

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
they've spent all that time and then

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.960 
they've spent all that time and then
smashed<00:04:20.349> it<00:04:20.590> then<00:04:20.830> this<00:04:21.310> might<00:04:21.580> not<00:04:21.609> be<00:04:21.760> the

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
smashed it then this might not be the

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:22.340 
smashed it then this might not be the
best

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
best

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.440 
best
for<00:04:22.560> them<00:04:22.680> anyhow<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.460> moment<00:04:24.030> everyone's

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
for them anyhow the moment everyone's

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.000 
for them anyhow the moment everyone's
been<00:04:24.540> waiting<00:04:24.690> for<00:04:25.260> is<00:04:25.590> seeing<00:04:25.860> the

been waiting for is seeing the
demonstration<00:04:26.910> of<00:04:27.600> the<00:04:27.990> Smashing<00:04:28.560> after<00:04:28.860> all

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
demonstration of the Smashing after all

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.440

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
camera here to get the best view of this

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.800 
camera here to get the best view of this
and<00:04:34.610> how<00:04:35.610> fast<00:04:35.850> does<00:04:36.060> it<00:04:36.120> shoot<00:04:36.450> out<00:04:36.570> we've

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
and how fast does it shoot out we've

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.570 
and how fast does it shoot out we've
tried<00:04:37.080> that<00:04:37.110> what<00:04:37.440> do<00:04:37.530> you<00:04:37.620> think<00:04:37.800> how<00:04:38.190> fast<00:04:38.370> is

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
tried that what do you think how fast is

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:47.660 
tried that what do you think how fast is
it<00:04:42.920> not<00:04:43.920> should<00:04:44.720> probably<00:04:45.720> cut<00:04:46.080> their<00:04:47.010> rubbery

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
it not should probably cut their rubbery

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.790 
it not should probably cut their rubbery
things<00:04:48.030> but<00:04:48.480> it's<00:04:48.930> still<00:04:49.110> my<00:04:49.260> turn<00:04:49.290> okay

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
things but it's still my turn okay
