there<00:01:56.369> any<00:01:56.490> head<00:01:56.729> banging<00:01:57.030> both<00:01:57.450> these

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
there any head banging both these

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.840 
there any head banging both these
coasters<00:01:58.110> are<00:01:58.259> very<00:01:58.649> smooth<00:01:58.979> tempest<00:01:59.460> o<00:01:59.610> is

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
coasters are very smooth tempest o is

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.969 
coasters are very smooth tempest o is
brand<00:02:00.329> spanking<00:02:00.719> new<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.439> course<00:02:01.680> it's

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
brand spanking new so of course it's

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.709 
brand spanking new so of course it's
going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.159> be<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> smooth<00:02:02.549> coaster<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.210> mr.

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
going to be a smooth coaster and mr.

going to be a smooth coaster and mr.
freeze<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:03.990> running<00:02:04.530> very<00:02:04.920> well<00:02:05.009> even<00:02:05.610> though

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790

it<00:02:06.000> opened<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.540> 1998<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.770> fact<00:02:08.190> I'd<00:02:08.399> consider

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
it opened in 1998 in fact I'd consider

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.609 
it opened in 1998 in fact I'd consider
the<00:02:09.060> smoothness<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.810> these<00:02:09.989> two<00:02:10.140> coasters

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
the smoothness of these two coasters

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.300 
the smoothness of these two coasters
eeek

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
eeek

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.590 
eeek
I<00:02:11.520> wouldn't<00:02:11.970> say<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.240> one<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.420> these

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
I wouldn't say that one of these

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.420 
I wouldn't say that one of these
coasters<00:02:12.990> is<00:02:13.200> smoother<00:02:13.620> than<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.980> other<00:02:14.100> so

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
coasters is smoother than the other so

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.090 
coasters is smoother than the other so
both<00:02:14.700> coasters<00:02:15.390> will<00:02:15.660> earn<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:16.200> point<00:02:16.560> for<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
both coasters will earn a point for the

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.770 
both coasters will earn a point for the
inversions<00:02:17.610> category<00:02:18.060> both<00:02:18.270> coasters

about<00:02:27.630> mr.<00:02:28.080> freeze<00:02:28.380> is<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.920> actually<00:02:29.310> goes

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
about mr. freeze is that actually goes

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.880 
about mr. freeze is that actually goes
through<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:29.910> top<00:02:30.180> hat<00:02:30.420> twice<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.230> both<00:02:31.830> of

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
these are really good inversions what I

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.230 
these are really good inversions what I
love<00:02:34.290> about<00:02:34.560> temp<00:02:35.010> éstos<00:02:35.490> is<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.030> go

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
love about temp éstos is that you go

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.080 
love about temp éstos is that you go
through<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:37.020> slowly<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.459> feels<00:02:38.940> like

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
through it so slowly it feels like

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.030 
through it so slowly it feels like
you're<00:02:39.240> moving<00:02:39.390> in<00:02:39.660> slow<00:02:40.080> motion<00:02:40.470> you're<00:02:40.860> just

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
you're moving in slow motion you're just

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.500 
you're moving in slow motion you're just
hanging<00:02:41.430> there<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:41.970> feels<00:02:42.120> like<00:02:42.360> you're

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
hanging there and it feels like you're

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.449 
hanging there and it feels like you're
hanging<00:02:42.780> for<00:02:42.959> an<00:02:43.020> eternity<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.950> inversions

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
hanging for an eternity the inversions

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.520 
hanging for an eternity the inversions
on<00:02:44.610> both<00:02:44.880> of<00:02:45.090> these<00:02:45.209> coasters<00:02:45.630> are<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:46.200> good

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
on both of these coasters are so good

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.280 
on both of these coasters are so good
that<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:47.040> consider<00:02:47.550> them<00:02:47.790> equal<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:48.900> instead<00:02:49.230> of

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
that I consider them equal so instead of

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.530 
that I consider them equal so instead of
having<00:02:49.560> one<00:02:49.770> coaster<00:02:50.459> earn<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.730> point<00:02:51.270> and

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
having one coaster earn a point and

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.090 
having one coaster earn a point and
having<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:51.840> be<00:02:51.989> so<00:02:52.230> close<00:02:52.500> I'm<00:02:52.739> simply<00:02:53.070> just

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
having it be so close I'm simply just

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.490 
having it be so close I'm simply just
going<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.550> give<00:02:53.820> both<00:02:54.150> coasters<00:02:54.780> one<00:02:55.140> point

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
going to give both coasters one point

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.710 
going to give both coasters one point
for<00:02:55.709> their<00:02:55.860> inversions<00:02:56.640> next<00:02:57.420> is<00:02:57.540> the

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
for their inversions next is the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.630 
for their inversions next is the
duration<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.560> ride<00:02:58.800> both<00:02:59.400> of<00:02:59.550> these

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
duration of the ride both of these

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.490 
duration of the ride both of these
coasters<00:03:00.030> are<00:03:00.239> very<00:03:00.570> short<00:03:00.900> both<00:03:01.110> them<00:03:01.320> are

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
coasters are very short both them are

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.070 
coasters are very short both them are
under<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.890> minute<00:03:02.280> long<00:03:02.459> mr.<00:03:03.180> Frese<00:03:03.510> lasts

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
under a minute long mr. Frese lasts

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.280 
under a minute long mr. Frese lasts
about<00:03:04.200> 45<00:03:04.860> seconds<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.840> Tempesta<00:03:06.840> lasts

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
about 45 seconds and Tempesta lasts

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.350 
about 45 seconds and Tempesta lasts
about<00:03:07.410> 50<00:03:08.160> seconds<00:03:08.610> that's<00:03:08.790> only<00:03:09.090> five

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
about 50 seconds that's only five

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.170 
about 50 seconds that's only five
seconds<00:03:09.959> more<00:03:10.230> but<00:03:10.860> it's<00:03:11.100> still<00:03:11.430> longer<00:03:11.790> and

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
seconds more but it's still longer and

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.930 
seconds more but it's still longer and
so<00:03:12.360> I'm<00:03:12.480> gonna<00:03:12.720> give<00:03:12.989> it<00:03:13.050> to<00:03:13.170> Tabasco<00:03:14.130> next<00:03:14.820> up

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
so I'm gonna give it to Tabasco next up

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.789 
so I'm gonna give it to Tabasco next up
is<00:03:15.030> airtime<00:03:15.540> however<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.110> better<00:03:16.290> word<00:03:16.590> to

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
is airtime however the better word to

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.440 
is airtime however the better word to
use<00:03:16.980> for<00:03:17.010> this<00:03:17.430> category<00:03:17.700> with<00:03:18.120> these<00:03:18.269> two

really too many airtime moments on these
two<00:03:22.410> coasters<00:03:22.799> however<00:03:23.549> there<00:03:23.730> are<00:03:23.820> some

however what I like about tempest oh is

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.140 
however what I like about tempest oh is
that<00:05:04.740> it<00:05:04.890> seems<00:05:05.220> that<00:05:05.430> they<00:05:05.580> paid<00:05:05.790> a<00:05:05.820> little

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
that it seems that they paid a little

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.600 
that it seems that they paid a little
bit<00:05:06.270> more<00:05:06.390> attention<00:05:07.230> to<00:05:07.350> detail<00:05:07.800> which<00:05:08.370> makes

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
bit more attention to detail which makes

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.950 
bit more attention to detail which makes

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960
