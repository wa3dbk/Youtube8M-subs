miracle yeah there's the blot amount of

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.459 
miracle yeah there's the blot amount of
loss<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.980> here<00:00:35.520> they<00:00:35.670> are<00:00:35.850> again<00:00:36.469> visually

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
loss and here they are again visually

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.810 
loss and here they are again visually
there's<00:00:37.649> not<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> huge<00:00:38.129> difference<00:00:38.280> between

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
there's not a huge difference between

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.729 
there's not a huge difference between
them<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.360> time<00:00:39.570> around<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:40.170> guess<00:00:40.590> there

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
them this time around I guess there

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.680 
them this time around I guess there
never<00:00:40.890> has<00:00:41.100> been<00:00:41.129> with<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.640> mercurial<00:00:42.329> series

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
never has been with the mercurial series

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.990 
never has been with the mercurial series
but<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.950> get<00:00:44.190> you're<00:00:44.370> still<00:00:44.579> getting<00:00:44.700> that

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
but you get you're still getting that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.170 
but you get you're still getting that
Asian<00:00:45.210> synthetic<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.960> again<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:47.760> miracle

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
Asian synthetic and again the miracle

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.420 
Asian synthetic and again the miracle
feels<00:00:48.450> really<00:00:48.899> soft<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.500> vapor<00:00:49.680> super<00:00:50.190> soft

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
feels really soft the vapor super soft

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.310 
feels really soft the vapor super soft
this<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.210> feels<00:00:51.360> soft<00:00:51.660> as<00:00:51.809> well<00:00:51.989> but<00:00:52.140> you're

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
this one feels soft as well but you're

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.959 
this one feels soft as well but you're
getting<00:00:52.559> back<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.100> kind<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.579> cheaper

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
getting back to that kind of cheaper

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.939 
getting back to that kind of cheaper
synthetic<00:00:54.420> material<00:00:54.930> i<00:00:54.989> guess<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.680> feels

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
synthetic material i guess it feels

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.000 
synthetic material i guess it feels
better<00:00:56.160> than<00:00:56.370> past<00:00:56.670> glides<00:00:57.090> i<00:00:57.270> would<00:00:57.420> say<00:00:58.010> it

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
better than past glides i would say it

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.639 
better than past glides i would say it
doesn't<00:00:59.309> feel<00:00:59.550> it<00:01:00.480> by<00:01:00.930> no<00:01:00.989> means<00:01:01.260> does<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.500> feel

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
doesn't feel it by no means does it feel

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.100 
doesn't feel it by no means does it feel
cheap<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> low-end<00:01:03.510> synthetic<00:01:03.989> i'm

that<00:01:53.399> i<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:53.820> see<00:01:53.970> visually<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.960> going<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.200> be

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
that i can see visually is going to be

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.170 
that i can see visually is going to be
the<00:01:55.439> sole<00:01:55.590> plate<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.130> heel<00:01:56.430> you're<00:01:57.030> going

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
the sole plate and the heel you're going

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.280 
the sole plate and the heel you're going
to<00:01:57.240> notice<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.630> does<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> new

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
to notice that this does have the new

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.170 
to notice that this does have the new
stud<00:01:58.530> pattern<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.100> front<00:01:59.340> but<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> back

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
stud pattern in the front but the back

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.719 
stud pattern in the front but the back
or<00:02:00.630> has<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.200> traditional<00:02:01.829> four<00:02:02.189> studs<00:02:02.520> as

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
or has this traditional four studs as

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.700 
or has this traditional four studs as
opposed<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.509> two<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.590> new

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
opposed to just the two like the new

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.029 
opposed to just the two like the new
vapor<00:02:04.950> 8<00:02:05.250> does<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:06.590> reasons<00:02:07.590> for<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.829> is

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
vapor 8 does have reasons for that is

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.919 
vapor 8 does have reasons for that is
probably<00:02:08.340> because<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:08.970> soul<00:02:09.360> itself<00:02:09.539> is

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
probably because it's the soul itself is

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.080 
probably because it's the soul itself is
not<00:02:10.080> stiff<00:02:10.319> enough<00:02:10.489> there<00:02:11.489> needs<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.700> be<00:02:11.730> extra

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
not stiff enough there needs to be extra

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.460 
not stiff enough there needs to be extra
supporting<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.629> heel<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.110> kind<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.319> have

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
supporting that heel to kind of have

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.700 
supporting that heel to kind of have
that

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
that

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.740 
that
two<00:02:13.830> studs<00:02:14.100> because<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.520> is<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:15.420> are<00:02:15.570> standing

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
two studs because it is you are standing

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.630 
two studs because it is you are standing
on<00:02:15.990> two<00:02:16.170> sizes<00:02:16.560> as<00:02:16.740> opposed<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.250> four<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:17.610> it's

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
on two sizes as opposed to four so it's

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.160 
on two sizes as opposed to four so it's
got<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:17.940> be<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.120> extra<00:02:18.420> support<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.810> keep<00:02:19.050> the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
got to be the extra support to keep the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.290 
got to be the extra support to keep the
studs<00:02:19.380> in<00:02:19.500> place<00:02:19.820> but<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:20.910> do<00:02:21.030> have<00:02:21.150> this

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
studs in place but you do have this

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.580 
studs in place but you do have this
again<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:21.720> have<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:21.930> kind<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.200> zigzag

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
again you have this kind of zigzag

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.550 
again you have this kind of zigzag
pattern<00:02:23.690> again<00:02:24.690> at<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:24.930> one<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.260> looks<00:02:25.440> like

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
pattern again at this one it looks like

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.170 
pattern again at this one it looks like
the<00:02:25.710> tap<00:02:25.920> x<00:02:26.130> material<00:02:26.580> like<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.790> do<00:02:26.910> see<00:02:27.090> on

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
the tap x material like you do see on

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.690 
the tap x material like you do see on
the<00:02:27.300> vapor<00:02:27.450> 8<00:02:27.720> i'm<00:02:28.650> not<00:02:28.860> entirely<00:02:29.190> sure<00:02:29.400> it's

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
the vapor 8 i'm not entirely sure it's

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.760 
the vapor 8 i'm not entirely sure it's
hard<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.030> tell<00:02:30.270> if<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.570> actually<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.500> or

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
hard to tell if it actually is that or

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.080 
hard to tell if it actually is that or
it's<00:02:31.890> just<00:02:31.920> kind<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.220> this<00:02:32.400> design<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:33.060> they

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
it's just kind of this design that they

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.330 
it's just kind of this design that they
put<00:02:33.330> in<00:02:33.420> there<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.810> make<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.500> look<00:02:34.710> like<00:02:34.890> tap<00:02:35.130> x

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
put in there to make it look like tap x

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.310 
put in there to make it look like tap x
to<00:02:35.970> me<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.270> doesn't<00:02:36.450> look<00:02:36.660> like<00:02:36.780> it's<00:02:36.930> actually

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
to me it doesn't look like it's actually

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.210 
to me it doesn't look like it's actually
there<00:02:37.590> but<00:02:38.480> i<00:02:39.480> don't<00:02:40.110> really<00:02:40.380> know<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:41.010> me<00:02:41.100> it

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
there but i don't really know to me it

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.800 
there but i don't really know to me it
seems<00:02:41.340> like<00:02:41.550> reinforced<00:02:42.000> plastic<00:02:42.420> if<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.600> if

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
seems like reinforced plastic if you if

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.020 
seems like reinforced plastic if you if
if<00:02:43.140> i<00:02:43.290> had<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.590> guess<00:02:43.620> what<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.040> with<00:02:44.820> some

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
if i had to guess what it is with some

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.160 
if i had to guess what it is with some
silver<00:02:45.300> stuff<00:02:45.480> in<00:02:45.630> there<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.870> make<00:02:45.960> it<00:02:46.020> look

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
silver stuff in there to make it look

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.610 
silver stuff in there to make it look
like<00:02:46.290> carbon<00:02:46.860> fiber<00:02:47.100> esque<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:49.380> then<00:02:49.500> you

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
like carbon fiber esque and then you

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.380 
like carbon fiber esque and then you
have<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:50.160> new<00:02:50.520> stuff<00:02:50.730> powder<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.150> front

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
have the new stuff powder in the front

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.460 
have the new stuff powder in the front
with<00:02:52.080> just<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.350> plastic<00:02:52.560> soul<00:02:53.070> nothing<00:02:53.970> really

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
with just a plastic soul nothing really

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.540 
with just a plastic soul nothing really
nothing<00:02:55.470> really<00:02:55.650> crazy<00:02:56.070> but<00:02:56.280> there<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.460> go

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550
