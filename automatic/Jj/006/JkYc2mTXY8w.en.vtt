00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 to 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.779
 welcome to kill the taste 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.790
 good for our brain gelatin 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.930
 let's use a cheese bar 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.920
 cream are roughly 190 grams 250 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.920
 milliliters of half cream 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.070
 a condensed milk 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.989
 the brand that you prefer four envelopes 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.329
 of grenetine of 7 grams each in 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.559
 total would be 28 grams 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.559
 honey for baby 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.530
 red artificial coloring 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.790
 and our brain mold 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.770
 The first thing we will do is put in a 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.160
 half a cup of water to the seven sachets of 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.160
 grenetina 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.010
 so that he thinks to hydrate himself 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.510
 and friends, what we will do now is put 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.620
 the cheese in our blender as well 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.700
 There is the bar 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.700
 the half cream 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.700
 and all the condensed milk 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.120
 the next thing we will do is liquefy 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.700
 all the ingredients we start with the 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.880
 half cream cheese and milk 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.880
 condensed 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.180
 and we want to now add the 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:14.370
 grenetina this half cup of water you 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.830
 let's add a little warm water 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.599
 so that is loosen the grenetina and can 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.709
 be very manageable when liquefying it 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.709
 together with the other ingredients 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.270
 while the blender is low 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:44.190
 speed we add 5 drops of 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.190
 coloring paint 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.680
 now let's prepare the blood this is 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.790
 very easy we are going to grab a bit of 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.560
 honey for baby 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.900
 which you like the amount that you 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.780
 you like it really is everything there is not a 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.650
 exact amount and we will add 7 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.650
 dye drops 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.959
 if you do not stay convinced with seven 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:32.900
 droplets you think it will take more color 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.939
 you add up to a maximum of 10 drops 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.030
 let's stir it well so I'm 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:41.980
 grabbing the uniform color color of a 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.980
 bloody consistency 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.030
 what we will do now will be to remove 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:03.540
 the excesses that our brain has 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.760
 here the thing is to create an effect like that 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.160
 goes to the brain and you threw it in the 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.930
 dish in one fell swoop that's the effect 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.930
 what we want to cause in this plane 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.800
 calling because that's how our 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:28.449
 brain gelatin good I'm going to 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.699
 sit at the table as in days gone by 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:34.120
 try because in addition to a medium 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.860
 bite but if you do not like it if not 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.620
 you want to make jelly with cheese and 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.629
 half cream and all that can replace it 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.250
 for yogurt not here the important thing is the 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:44.680
 grenetina which is what the 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.940
 consistency is the brain sticky 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.940
 let's try it 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:00.779
