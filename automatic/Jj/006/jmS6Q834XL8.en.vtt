00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.120
 I am Nomura Zhou Ping. Welcome to IN DEPTH CHANNEL. 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.340
 When I was a baby, my family took me to travel to Hong Kong. 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.640
 But it was too small at the time, I didn’t have any impression at all. 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.420
 So it’s called the first time. 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.380
 (It turns out that. Can you tell me how it feels?) 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.032
 I think... 

00:00:42.788 --> 00:00:45.768
 I think Hong Kong is a cosmopolitan city. 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.360
 If you want to compare with Tokyo, Hong Kong has a higher building. 

00:00:55.953 --> 00:00:57.173
 Startled. 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.039
 The food is delicious. 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.508
 The streets are neat and tidy. 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.920
 Some people have a feeling. 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.000
 I think it is a very good place. 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:21.060
 This photo album is an atmosphere that creates a movie. 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.840
 We want readers to feel that they are in the movie world. 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.260
 Also, it shows that I am in the movie (the protagonist). 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
 The most impressive impression? 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.480
 That is the lucky one who just took photos together here. 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.440
 (why) 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.640
 Why is she here? 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.613
 (In fact, she is our design director.) 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.520
 And the birthday cake on the stage really touched me. 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.660
 I am really happy to take photos with my fans. 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.460
 What? You guy 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.500
 No one wants to be an actor. 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.660
 But in the future, I want to be an all-around actor. 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.000
 (So ​​far, the role of many students 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.060
 Do you want to play any role?) 

00:02:37.172 --> 00:02:39.172
 There is no role to play for the time being. 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.760
 But I want to work in Hong Kong. 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.756
 (What type do you want to do?) 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.064
 Movies, TV series 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.180
 (Cantonese?) 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.900
 I want to use Mandarin a little more.
