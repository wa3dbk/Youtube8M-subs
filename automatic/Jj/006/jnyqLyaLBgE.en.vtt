00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
a guy's face I was very kind of

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.959 
a guy's face I was very kind of
skeptical<00:00:35.430> whether<00:00:35.579> or<00:00:35.730> not<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.850> could

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
skeptical whether or not I could

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.459 
skeptical whether or not I could
actually<00:00:36.180> do<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.840> was<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.079> most

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
actually do this but it was the most

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.069 
actually do this but it was the most
suggested<00:00:38.250> person<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.390> do<00:00:39.600> there<00:00:39.989> were

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
suggested person that I do there were

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.540 
suggested person that I do there were
the<00:00:40.170> more<00:00:40.320> comments<00:00:40.739> for<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.010> then<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.309> think

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
the more comments for that then I think

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.340 
the more comments for that then I think
there<00:00:41.730> were<00:00:41.850> for<00:00:42.090> Obama<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:42.870> at<00:00:42.960> first<00:00:43.140> I

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
there were for Obama but at first I

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.630 
there were for Obama but at first I
figured<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.770> know<00:00:43.890> what<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.219> probably<00:00:44.520> pretty

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
figured you know what it probably pretty

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.520 
figured you know what it probably pretty
hard<00:00:44.850> for<00:00:45.030> me<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.210> actually<00:00:45.329> make<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.750> but<00:00:46.500> I

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
hard for me to actually make that but I

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.229 
hard for me to actually make that but I
decided<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.010> go<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.579> because<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:47.850> decided

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
decided to go for it because I decided

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.510 
decided to go for it because I decided
you<00:00:48.600> know<00:00:48.719> making<00:00:49.289> handsome<00:00:49.920> Squidward<00:00:50.340> would

expression<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.119> other<00:01:42.240> thing<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.509> noticed

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
expression the other thing I noticed

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.300 
expression the other thing I noticed
about<00:01:42.869> handsome<00:01:43.619> Squidward<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.189> his

nose has an extremely large bulge right

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.460 
nose has an extremely large bulge right
in<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.549> center<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.540> bridge<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.170> decided

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
in the center of the bridge so I decided

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.469 
in the center of the bridge so I decided
to<00:01:49.649> put<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.009> on<00:01:50.220> there<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.640> make<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
to put that on there and make that the

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.780 
to put that on there and make that the
centerpiece<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:52.200> his<00:01:52.380> face<00:01:52.649> aside<00:01:53.399> from<00:01:53.640> of

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
centerpiece on his face aside from of

course<00:01:54.030> his<00:01:54.210> chin<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.750> then<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.439> tried<00:01:55.649> his

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
course his chin and then just tried his

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.649 
course his chin and then just tried his
nose<00:01:56.009> out<00:01:56.219> drag<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.790> down<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.210> was<00:01:57.299> really

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
nose out drag it down it was really

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.870 
nose out drag it down it was really
pretty<00:01:57.899> simple<00:01:58.290> from<00:01:58.799> there<00:01:59.159> on<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.579> just

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
pretty simple from there on in just

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.249 
pretty simple from there on in just
making<00:02:00.180> sure<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.689> features<00:02:01.079> were

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
making sure that the features were

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.929 
making sure that the features were
pulled<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.920> different<00:02:02.219> areas<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.700> I

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
pulled in the different areas and I

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.340 
pulled in the different areas and I
found<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.329> by<00:02:03.450> trying<00:02:03.780> from<00:02:03.990> different

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
found that by trying from different

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.050 
found that by trying from different
angles<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.770> was<00:02:05.070> actually<00:02:05.310> able<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.790> pull

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
angles I was actually able to pull

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.910 
angles I was actually able to pull
things<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.630> different<00:02:07.049> ways<00:02:07.229> you'll<00:02:07.500> see<00:02:07.649> here

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
things in different ways you'll see here

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.190 
things in different ways you'll see here
I<00:02:08.069> tried<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.700> make<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.090> chin<00:02:09.330> big<00:02:09.599> but<00:02:09.810> only<00:02:09.989> by

I tried to make the chin big but only by

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.140 
I tried to make the chin big but only by
pulling<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.770> section<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.430> wasn't<00:02:12.000> able

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
pulling on that section it wasn't able

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.520 
pulling on that section it wasn't able
to<00:02:12.330> make<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.720> chin<00:02:12.959> pull<00:02:13.230> out

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
to make the chin pull out

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.440 
to make the chin pull out
it<00:02:13.709> was<00:02:13.800> just<00:02:14.010> able<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.310> adjust<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.880> specific

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
it was just able to adjust that specific

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.760 
it was just able to adjust that specific
section<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.020> actually<00:02:16.350> have<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.530> click<00:02:16.650> on

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
section you actually have to click on

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.280 
section you actually have to click on
the<00:02:16.890> jawline<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.700> then<00:02:18.090> drag<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.810> out<00:02:19.080> to

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
the jawline and then drag that out to

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.960 
the jawline and then drag that out to
make<00:02:19.410> this<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.980> chin<00:02:20.280> actually<00:02:20.850> elongated

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
make this the chin actually elongated

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.059 
make this the chin actually elongated
which<00:02:21.750> was<00:02:21.900> something<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.680> didn't<00:02:22.860> really

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
which was something that I didn't really

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.320 
which was something that I didn't really
know<00:02:23.190> at<00:02:23.340> first<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:23.790> it's<00:02:23.940> kind<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.180> little

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
know at first so it's kind of a little

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.670 
know at first so it's kind of a little
disappointed<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:24.930> thought<00:02:24.959> maybe<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.560> know

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
disappointed I thought maybe you know

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.530 
disappointed I thought maybe you know
the<00:02:25.830> chin<00:02:26.040> was<00:02:26.190> only<00:02:26.520> allowed<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.850> be<00:02:26.970> that

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
the chin was only allowed to be that

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.750 
the chin was only allowed to be that
long<00:02:27.840> which<00:02:28.110> was<00:02:28.319> in<00:02:28.470> my<00:02:28.890> opinion<00:02:29.280> not<00:02:29.459> very

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
long which was in my opinion not very

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.490 
long which was in my opinion not very
good<00:02:29.970> at<00:02:30.180> all<00:02:30.420> but<00:02:30.840> then<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:30.959> realized<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.470> could

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
good at all but then I realized I could

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.350 
good at all but then I realized I could
actually<00:02:31.709> make<00:02:31.980> his<00:02:32.100> entire<00:02:32.459> jawline<00:02:32.819> stick

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
actually make his entire jawline stick

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.540 
actually make his entire jawline stick
out<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:34.080> think<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.350> even<00:02:34.590> take<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:34.890> one<00:02:35.220> step

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
out and I think I even take it one step

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.400 
out and I think I even take it one step
further<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:36.270> little<00:02:36.660> bit<00:02:36.750> later<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.050> when<00:02:37.380> I

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
further a little bit later on when I

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.860 
further a little bit later on when I
move<00:02:37.650> his<00:02:37.800> entire<00:02:38.100> face<00:02:38.430> out<00:02:38.760> more<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.569> it

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
move his entire face out more and it

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.250 
move his entire face out more and it
just<00:02:40.050> makes<00:02:40.260> for<00:02:40.380> is<00:02:40.770> lot<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.730> lot<00:02:42.150> longer<00:02:42.569> jaw

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
just makes for is lot a a lot longer jaw

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.630 
just makes for is lot a a lot longer jaw
the<00:02:43.620> bottom<00:02:43.890> jaw<00:02:44.069> looks<00:02:44.250> like<00:02:44.340> it's<00:02:44.459> kind<00:02:44.610> of

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
the bottom jaw looks like it's kind of

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.759 
the bottom jaw looks like it's kind of
hanging<00:02:45.060> off<00:02:45.209> his<00:02:45.330> face<00:02:45.570> I<00:02:45.900> guess<00:02:46.440> that's<00:02:46.680> a

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
hanging off his face I guess that's a

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.770 
hanging off his face I guess that's a
good<00:02:46.890> thing<00:02:46.950> seems<00:02:47.670> kind<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.030> odd<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.209> me<00:02:48.390> but

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
good thing seems kind of odd to me but

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.350 
good thing seems kind of odd to me but
it's<00:02:49.260> not<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:49.620> big<00:02:49.830> of<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:50.010> deal<00:02:50.250> now<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:51.120> main

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
it's not that big of a deal now the main

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.690 
it's not that big of a deal now the main
thing<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:52.350> was<00:02:52.620> focusing<00:02:53.010> on<00:02:53.130> besides<00:02:53.550> the

thing that I was focusing on besides the

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.300 
thing that I was focusing on besides the
jaw<00:02:53.970> besides<00:02:54.420> all<00:02:54.660> this<00:02:54.810> other<00:02:54.959> stuff<00:02:55.080> was<00:02:55.830> his

structured it looks like a bad plastic
surgery<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.620> wasn't<00:03:14.250> really<00:03:14.340> able<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:14.760> get<00:03:14.910> the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
surgery I wasn't really able to get the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.030 
surgery I wasn't really able to get the
eyebrows<00:03:15.540> done<00:03:15.810> correctly<00:03:16.290> but<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.590> will<00:03:16.830> say

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
eyebrows done correctly but I will say

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.180 
eyebrows done correctly but I will say
the<00:03:17.250> chin<00:03:17.579> in<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.120> actual<00:03:18.680> puffy<00:03:19.680> cheekbones

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
the chin in the actual puffy cheekbones

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.979 
the chin in the actual puffy cheekbones
while<00:03:20.670> it<00:03:20.790> didn't<00:03:21.060> look<00:03:21.150> so<00:03:21.360> good<00:03:21.390> from<00:03:21.720> head

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
while it didn't look so good from head

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.210 
while it didn't look so good from head
on<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:22.380> here<00:03:22.470> you'll<00:03:22.620> see<00:03:22.739> I<00:03:22.769> figured<00:03:23.100> out<00:03:23.190> I

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
on and here you'll see I figured out I

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.400 
on and here you'll see I figured out I
could<00:03:23.400> actually<00:03:23.519> extend<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.209> jaw<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.690> lot<00:03:25.170> more

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
could actually extend the jaw a lot more

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.170 
could actually extend the jaw a lot more
and<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.950> really<00:03:26.250> started<00:03:26.489> coming<00:03:26.820> into<00:03:26.940> shape

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
and it really started coming into shape

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.720 
and it really started coming into shape
with<00:03:27.570> being<00:03:27.959> like<00:03:28.350> fancy<00:03:28.680> Squidward<00:03:29.280> I<00:03:29.400> think

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
with being like fancy Squidward I think

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.970 
with being like fancy Squidward I think
and<00:03:29.880> at<00:03:30.000> least<00:03:30.090> in<00:03:30.360> my<00:03:30.780> opinion<00:03:30.900> personally<00:03:31.799> I

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
and at least in my opinion personally I

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.699 
and at least in my opinion personally I
might<00:03:32.579> have<00:03:32.760> overextended<00:03:33.510> his<00:03:33.930> face<00:03:34.170> as<00:03:34.470> far

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
might have overextended his face as far

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.069 
might have overextended his face as far
as<00:03:34.920> being<00:03:35.310> from<00:03:35.579> the<00:03:35.760> bottom<00:03:36.180> but<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.600> think

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
as being from the bottom but I think

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.229 
as being from the bottom but I think
from<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.320> top<00:03:37.530> or<00:03:37.860> from<00:03:38.160> front<00:03:38.430> on<00:03:38.579> it<00:03:38.820> looks<00:03:39.090> a

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
from the top or from front on it looks a

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.940 
from the top or from front on it looks a
lot<00:03:39.420> better<00:03:39.630> this<00:03:39.930> way<00:03:40.140> although<00:03:40.470> from<00:03:40.890> the

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
lot better this way although from the

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.890 
lot better this way although from the
side<00:03:41.220> profile<00:03:41.670> view<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.000> think<00:03:42.329> if<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.540> had<00:03:42.660> kept

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
side profile view I think if I had kept

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.449 
side profile view I think if I had kept
it<00:03:42.989> in<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.260> little<00:03:43.470> bit<00:03:43.560> more<00:03:43.739> it<00:03:43.950> might<00:03:44.310> look

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
it in a little bit more it might look

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.650 
it in a little bit more it might look
better<00:03:44.670> here<00:03:45.000> I<00:03:45.030> was<00:03:45.209> just<00:03:45.359> trying<00:03:45.510> to<00:03:45.540> make

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
better here I was just trying to make

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.449 
better here I was just trying to make
sure<00:03:45.840> that<00:03:46.019> his<00:03:46.109> mouth<00:03:46.380> was<00:03:46.680> all<00:03:46.769> scrunched<00:03:47.250> up

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
sure that his mouth was all scrunched up

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.819 
sure that his mouth was all scrunched up
as<00:03:47.640> far<00:03:47.880> as<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.180> could<00:03:48.269> possibly<00:03:48.329> be<00:03:48.810> so<00:03:49.470> I

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
as far as it could possibly be so I

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.520 
as far as it could possibly be so I
think<00:03:50.400> this<00:03:50.940> honestly<00:03:51.600> came<00:03:51.870> out<00:03:52.049> pretty<00:03:52.290> good

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
think this honestly came out pretty good

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.229 
think this honestly came out pretty good
can<00:03:53.220> they<00:03:53.340> improve<00:03:53.549> on<00:03:53.790> some<00:03:53.940> certain

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
can they improve on some certain

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.780 
can they improve on some certain
features<00:03:54.660> yes<00:03:55.200> but<00:03:55.769> keep<00:03:55.950> in<00:03:56.100> mind<00:03:56.130> I<00:03:56.489> was

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
features yes but keep in mind I was

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.180 
features yes but keep in mind I was
trying<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.269> make<00:03:57.450> an<00:03:57.630> intentionally<00:03:58.410> hideous

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
trying to make an intentionally hideous

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.090 
trying to make an intentionally hideous
and<00:03:59.400> grotesque<00:04:00.239> sim<00:04:00.750> I'm<00:04:01.200> not<00:04:01.560> trying<00:04:01.859> to<00:04:01.950> make

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
and grotesque sim I'm not trying to make

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.190 
and grotesque sim I'm not trying to make
someone<00:04:02.310> who's<00:04:02.549> normal<00:04:02.970> so<00:04:03.269> things<00:04:03.840> like<00:04:04.019> the

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
someone who's normal so things like the

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.199 
someone who's normal so things like the
eyebrow<00:04:04.650> bones<00:04:04.920> that<00:04:05.370> weren't<00:04:05.730> able<00:04:05.850> to<00:04:06.120> be

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
eyebrow bones that weren't able to be

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.180 
eyebrow bones that weren't able to be
extruded<00:04:06.750> as<00:04:06.870> much<00:04:07.049> as<00:04:07.170> I<00:04:07.260> possibly<00:04:07.440> wanted

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
extruded as much as I possibly wanted

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.340 
extruded as much as I possibly wanted
those<00:04:08.790> aren't<00:04:09.150> they<00:04:09.269> you<00:04:09.600> know<00:04:09.720> issues<00:04:10.170> that

have eyebrows that you know just have a
little<00:04:15.690> bit<00:04:15.780> of<00:04:15.870> X<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.859> know<00:04:16.950> extrusion<00:04:17.850> not

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
little bit of X you know extrusion not

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.349 
little bit of X you know extrusion not
necessarily<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.739> extension<00:04:20.700> that<00:04:20.850> I<00:04:20.880> wanted

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
necessarily the extension that I wanted

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.909 
necessarily the extension that I wanted
which<00:04:21.510> was<00:04:21.539> pretty<00:04:21.840> much<00:04:21.930> out<00:04:22.380> to<00:04:22.680> where<00:04:22.800> his

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
which was pretty much out to where his

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.070 
which was pretty much out to where his
chin<00:04:23.280> was<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.729> wanted<00:04:24.000> them<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.150> be<00:04:24.240> big<00:04:24.570> giant

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
chin was I wanted them to be big giant

chin was I wanted them to be big giant
bulges<00:04:25.590> in<00:04:25.620> his<00:04:25.830> head<00:04:26.039> but<00:04:26.640> besides

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
bulges in his head but besides

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.560 
bulges in his head but besides
the<00:04:27.580> only<00:04:27.729> thing<00:04:27.880> that<00:04:27.970> I<00:04:28.030> could<00:04:28.090> possibly

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
the only thing that I could possibly

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.629 
the only thing that I could possibly
think<00:04:28.750> of<00:04:28.960> might<00:04:29.290> make<00:04:29.740> two<00:04:29.949> sims<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.400> little

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
think of might make two sims a little

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.100 
think of might make two sims a little
bit<00:04:30.760> better<00:04:30.910> especially<00:04:31.630> if<00:04:31.750> they<00:04:31.810> want<00:04:32.020> to

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
bit better especially if they want to

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.870 
bit better especially if they want to
make<00:04:32.229> us<00:04:32.380> make<00:04:32.620> you<00:04:33.010> know<00:04:33.100> different<00:04:33.520> sized

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
make us make you know different sized

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.300 
make us make you know different sized
things<00:04:34.720> maybe<00:04:35.320> give<00:04:35.590> us<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.860> option<00:04:35.979> to

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
things maybe give us the option to

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.969 
things maybe give us the option to
create<00:04:36.580> or<00:04:37.030> to<00:04:37.300> drag<00:04:37.630> the<00:04:37.930> head<00:04:38.169> I<00:04:38.440> wasn't<00:04:38.800> able

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
create or to drag the head I wasn't able

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.010 
create or to drag the head I wasn't able
to<00:04:39.100> really<00:04:39.250> shape<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:39.639> head<00:04:39.970> as<00:04:40.150> much<00:04:40.720> as<00:04:40.930> I

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
to really shape the head as much as I

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.020 
to really shape the head as much as I
would<00:04:41.199> have<00:04:41.229> liked<00:04:41.590> but<00:04:42.190> it's<00:04:42.490> not<00:04:42.669> that<00:04:42.850> big<00:04:42.970> a

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
would have liked but it's not that big a

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.909 
would have liked but it's not that big a
deal<00:04:43.180> it's<00:04:43.449> not<00:04:43.510> the<00:04:43.930> end<00:04:44.050> of<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.199> world<00:04:44.410> for

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
deal it's not the end of the world for
