00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
you've obviously got the bait smoked and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.710 
you've obviously got the bait smoked and
I<00:01:55.130> had<00:01:55.549> that<00:01:55.729> on<00:01:55.880> a<00:01:55.909> little<00:01:56.240> at<00:01:56.330> a<00:01:56.390> time<00:01:56.420> and

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
I had that on a little at a time and

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.539 
I had that on a little at a time and
just<00:01:56.780> do<00:01:56.959> thin<00:01:57.170> lines<00:01:57.439> over<00:01:58.039> the<00:01:58.159> top<00:01:58.369> of<00:01:58.490> the

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
just do thin lines over the top of the

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.370 
just do thin lines over the top of the
crumb<00:01:58.819> and<00:01:59.299> what<00:01:59.420> that<00:01:59.569> enables<00:01:59.959> me<00:01:59.990> to<00:02:00.110> see

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
crumb and what that enables me to see

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.020 
crumb and what that enables me to see
you<00:02:00.470> just<00:02:00.649> work<00:02:01.039> out<00:02:01.220> how<00:02:01.399> much<00:02:01.610> I've<00:02:01.789> got

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
you just work out how much I've got

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.880 
you just work out how much I've got
rather<00:02:02.209> than<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.479> big<00:02:02.689> old<00:02:02.869> blob<00:02:03.049> but<00:02:03.500> from<00:02:03.709> then

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
rather than a big old blob but from then

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.380 
rather than a big old blob but from then
it's<00:02:04.069> really<00:02:04.340> important<00:02:04.759> that<00:02:04.789> you<00:02:04.970> mix<00:02:05.209> it

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
it's really important that you mix it

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.669 
it's really important that you mix it
through<00:02:05.509> far<00:02:05.810> really<00:02:06.020> you<00:02:06.110> don't<00:02:06.259> want<00:02:06.380> like

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
through far really you don't want like

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.650 
through far really you don't want like
some<00:02:06.979> bags<00:02:07.189> or<00:02:07.399> more<00:02:07.610> in<00:02:07.759> than<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.000> other<00:02:08.149> so

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
some bags or more in than the other so

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.180 
some bags or more in than the other so
give<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:08.840> a<00:02:08.959> good<00:02:09.110> stir<00:02:09.410> around<00:02:09.560> spend<00:02:10.009> a<00:02:10.069> bit

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
give it a good stir around spend a bit

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.009 
give it a good stir around spend a bit
of<00:02:10.220> time<00:02:10.310> doing<00:02:10.759> it<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.120> once<00:02:11.810> you've<00:02:11.930> got

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
of time doing it and once you've got

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.229 
of time doing it and once you've got
that<00:02:12.110> evenly<00:02:12.470> mixed<00:02:12.920> that's<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.459> combo<00:02:14.060> that

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
that evenly mixed that's the combo that

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.059 
that evenly mixed that's the combo that
I'm<00:02:14.330> using<00:02:14.540> for<00:02:14.810> that<00:02:14.870> fish<00:02:15.110> bag<00:02:15.410> there<00:02:15.680> the
