you have to decide which one is the real

you have to decide which one is the real
one<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.410> fake<00:04:26.800> ones<00:04:27.070> will<00:04:27.400> turn<00:04:27.580> back<00:04:27.789> and<00:04:27.970> you

have to react fast enough to hit the
real<00:04:29.710> one<00:04:29.889> then<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.639> second<00:04:31.000> phase<00:04:31.150> begins

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
volley with him which was really fun at

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.080 
volley with him which was really fun at
the<00:04:35.710> time<00:04:35.889> but<00:04:36.460> throughout<00:04:36.729> the<00:04:36.910> franchise

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
the time but throughout the franchise

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.999 
the time but throughout the franchise
this<00:04:37.630> mechanic<00:04:38.229> has<00:04:38.349> been<00:04:38.530> done<00:04:38.680> multiple

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009 
this mechanic has been done multiple

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.029 
this mechanic has been done multiple
times<00:04:39.389> making<00:04:40.389> it's<00:04:40.539> still<00:04:40.810> fun<00:04:41.139> however<00:04:41.800> it

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
times making it's still fun however it

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:43.770 
times making it's still fun however it
would<00:04:42.310> have<00:04:42.400> been<00:04:42.550> more<00:04:42.789> fun<00:04:43.060> if<00:04:43.270> it<00:04:43.389> wasn't

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
would have been more fun if it wasn't

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.749 
would have been more fun if it wasn't
done<00:04:43.930> to<00:04:44.110> death<00:04:44.320> ever<00:04:44.620> since<00:04:44.740> I<00:04:45.340> can<00:04:45.520> at<00:04:45.729> least

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
done to death ever since I can at least

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.820 
done to death ever since I can at least
appreciate<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:46.630> first<00:04:46.870> place<00:04:47.080> though<00:04:47.380> and

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
appreciate the first place though and

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.620 
appreciate the first place though and
don't<00:04:48.190> like<00:04:48.370> like<00:04:48.580> face<00:04:48.789> offense<00:04:49.150> but<00:04:49.330> this<00:04:49.479> is

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
don't like like face offense but this is

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.260 
don't like like face offense but this is
more<00:04:49.810> reaction<00:04:50.320> based<00:04:50.560> it<00:04:51.310> is<00:04:51.370> indeed<00:04:51.880> a<00:04:51.940> good

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
more reaction based it is indeed a good

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.510 
more reaction based it is indeed a good
thing<00:04:52.539> but<00:04:52.960> many<00:04:53.229> people<00:04:53.440> always<00:04:53.860> regarded<00:04:54.370> as

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
thing but many people always regarded as

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:01.589 
thing but many people always regarded as
the<00:04:54.639> best<00:04:54.849> boss<00:04:55.120> in<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.360> game<00:04:55.389> just<00:04:56.169> why<00:05:00.599> the

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:01.599 
the best boss in the game just why the

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:04.170 
the best boss in the game just why the
next<00:05:01.900> boss<00:05:02.080> from<00:05:02.440> a<00:05:02.530> Sonic<00:05:02.889> game<00:05:02.919> however<00:05:03.849> you

next boss from a Sonic game however you

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.180 
next boss from a Sonic game however you
probably<00:05:04.449> won't<00:05:04.900> expect<00:05:05.349> much<00:05:05.650> because<00:05:06.039> the

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
probably won't expect much because the

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.270 
probably won't expect much because the
game<00:05:06.370> is<00:05:06.550> Sonic<00:05:06.940> 4<00:05:07.180> episode<00:05:07.659> 1<00:05:07.690> oh<00:05:08.199> my<00:05:08.889> god<00:05:09.250> I

verse which many people including the
guild<00:05:27.430> master<00:05:27.880> but<00:05:28.090> very<00:05:28.479> disappointed<00:05:29.139> and

guild master but very disappointed and

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.439 
guild master but very disappointed and
you<00:05:29.409> probably<00:05:29.919> wonder<00:05:30.340> well<00:05:30.909> the<00:05:30.970> final<00:05:31.210> boss

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:46.520 

I'll<00:05:44.669> be<00:05:44.910> honest<00:05:45.210> when<00:05:45.690> I<00:05:45.750> saw<00:05:45.960> that<00:05:46.080> the<00:05:46.199> final

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
I'll be honest when I saw that the final

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.170 
I'll be honest when I saw that the final
buff<00:05:46.710> is<00:05:46.919> a<00:05:46.949> rehash<00:05:47.340> of<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.639> Phantom's<00:05:48.030> like

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
buff is a rehash of the Phantom's like

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.200 
buff is a rehash of the Phantom's like
you<00:05:48.449> I<00:05:48.630> was<00:05:48.900> skeptical<00:05:49.380> however<00:05:50.210> you

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
you I was skeptical however you

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.600 
you I was skeptical however you
shouldn't<00:05:51.479> judge<00:05:51.750> anyone<00:05:52.229> by<00:05:52.440> appearance<00:05:53.040> so

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
shouldn't judge anyone by appearance so

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.310 
shouldn't judge anyone by appearance so
the<00:05:53.729> beginning<00:05:53.910> is<00:05:54.240> very<00:05:54.600> similar<00:05:54.930> to<00:05:55.080> the

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
the beginning is very similar to the

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.680 
the beginning is very similar to the
fighting<00:05:55.680> sonic<00:05:55.919> tale<00:05:56.310> except<00:05:57.030> was<00:05:57.210> raised<00:05:57.510> in

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
fighting sonic tale except was raised in

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.689 
fighting sonic tale except was raised in
the<00:05:57.810> home<00:05:57.960> in<00:05:58.110> their<00:05:58.229> town<00:05:58.410> at<00:05:58.740> least<00:05:58.800> give

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
the home in their town at least give

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:01.129 
the home in their town at least give
enough<00:05:59.940> damage<00:06:00.300> to<00:06:00.449> the<00:06:00.540> robot<00:06:00.900> and<00:06:01.050> the

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
enough damage to the robot and the

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.200 
enough damage to the robot and the
second<00:06:01.590> phase<00:06:01.770> begins<00:06:02.190> the<00:06:02.760> robot<00:06:03.060> goes

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
second phase begins the robot goes

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.330 
second phase begins the robot goes
completely<00:06:03.870> insane<00:06:04.169> and<00:06:04.440> start<00:06:04.770> jumping<00:06:04.979> back

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
completely insane and start jumping back

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.000 
completely insane and start jumping back
and<00:06:05.370> forth<00:06:05.580> also<00:06:06.330> the<00:06:07.020> robot<00:06:07.290> is<00:06:07.440> electrified

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
and forth also the robot is electrified

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.980 
and forth also the robot is electrified
now<00:06:08.220> so<00:06:08.669> to<00:06:08.729> damage<00:06:09.150> it<00:06:09.270> you<00:06:09.540> have<00:06:09.690> to<00:06:09.840> wait

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
now so to damage it you have to wait

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.689 
now so to damage it you have to wait
until<00:06:10.229> he<00:06:10.440> launches<00:06:10.740> its<00:06:10.919> face<00:06:11.160> at<00:06:11.370> you<00:06:11.520> and
