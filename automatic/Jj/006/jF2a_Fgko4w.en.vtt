00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
was banking on child's place in like

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.750 
was banking on child's place in like
fifth<00:00:21.900> or<00:00:22.050> sixth<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.619> mean<00:00:23.130> he<00:00:23.220> throws<00:00:23.430> evidence

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
fifth or sixth I mean he throws evidence

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.120 
fifth or sixth I mean he throws evidence
on<00:00:23.850> like<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.119> well<00:00:25.019> he's<00:00:25.410> been<00:00:25.560> even<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.070> a

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
on like that well he's been even to a

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.429 
on like that well he's been even to a
pretty<00:00:26.340> good<00:00:26.460> dry<00:00:26.670> state<00:00:27.019> tournament<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.170> I

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
pretty good dry state tournament so I

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.339 
pretty good dry state tournament so I
guess<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.039> should<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.640> mother<00:00:29.820> surprise

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
fat mass madness jamie is really trying

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.560 
fat mass madness jamie is really trying
to<00:01:31.770> stay<00:01:32.490> away<00:01:32.670> from<00:01:32.700> wild<00:01:33.090> laser<00:01:33.240> pressure

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
to stay away from wild laser pressure

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.850 
to stay away from wild laser pressure
you<00:01:33.780> want<00:01:33.929> to<00:01:33.990> come<00:01:34.079> off<00:01:34.200> from<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.439> era<00:01:34.649> la

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
you want to come off from the era la

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.620 
you want to come off from the era la
when<00:01:35.579> they<00:01:35.700> laser<00:01:35.909> from<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.240> certain<00:01:36.390> distance

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
when they laser from a certain distance

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.389 
when they laser from a certain distance
you<00:01:36.869> can<00:01:36.990> fo<00:01:37.140> hop<00:01:37.289> jump<00:01:37.560> or<00:01:37.710> fall<00:01:37.829> out<00:01:37.950> there<00:01:38.219> at

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
you can fo hop jump or fall out there at

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.370 
you can fo hop jump or fall out there at
them<00:01:38.579> which<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.539> very<00:01:39.750> effective<00:01:40.049> because<00:01:40.229> it

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
them which is very effective because it

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.649 
them which is very effective because it
makes<00:01:40.530> powerful<00:01:41.000> it<00:01:42.000> makes<00:01:42.149> about<00:01:42.299> go<00:01:42.479> not

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
makes powerful it makes about go not

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.660 
makes powerful it makes about go not
approach<00:01:42.959> so<00:01:43.259> freely<00:01:43.590> even<00:01:44.340> though<00:01:44.399> it

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
approach so freely even though it

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.980 
approach so freely even though it
appears<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:44.969> he<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:45.209> approach<00:01:45.450> really<00:01:45.840> if

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
appears that he can approach really if

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.809 
appears that he can approach really if
you<00:01:46.140> Jim<00:01:46.350> rash<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.829> discern<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.429> certain

you Jim rash you discern and certain

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:50.270 
you Jim rash you discern and certain
laser<00:01:48.000> angles<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:49.380> have<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> free<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.920> aerial

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
laser angles you have a free the aerial

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.370 
laser angles you have a free the aerial
on<00:01:50.399> them<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.600> why<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.719> have<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.959> maneuver

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
on them this is why you have to maneuver

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.499 
on them this is why you have to maneuver
around<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.709> stage<00:01:52.920> as<00:01:53.640> powerful<00:01:54.030> as<00:01:54.090> well<00:01:54.270> you

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
around the stage as powerful as well you

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.410 
around the stage as powerful as well you
just<00:01:54.659> can't<00:01:54.840> run<00:01:55.259> Russian<00:01:55.560> lasers<00:01:56.209> muchas<00:01:57.209> to

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
just can't run Russian lasers muchas to
