00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.440
 I come with a very interesting new video 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.090
 for all those who are fans 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:25.800
 from minecraft, what I'm going to contribute 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.689
 in this video is minecraft free and 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.560
 it is not the test version no minecraft 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.070
 free full of poker for your 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.360
 mobile and good I will indicate more or 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.149
 minus the steps that you have to follow 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.129
 to get our cell phone and install it 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.170
 well the first thing you're going to have to 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.329
 to do is good to go to the description and 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.970
 download minecraft from the link 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.760
 download that I leave in the description 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.400
 unzip it and take it out at 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.400
 desktop will be this file 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.970
 well once what you may have the 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.970
 where ever you want whenever he wants 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.220
 it has to be decompressed 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.350
 what you have to do is connect the 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.590
 mobile with 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.479
 with the computer in such a way 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.979
 typical of opening folder to see the 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.710
 files well once you have opened the 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:27.610
 mobile or is connected to the computer 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.060
 you pass minecraft to the mobile then to a 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.640
 folder that you will then locate 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.500
 you have that this is important a 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.539
 folder that is located here then 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.360
 then we have to install minecraft and 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.369
 I also forget to say that you do not have 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.210
 have the minecraft demo installed 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.550
 previously good I will not say or the 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.350
 original version because if you have 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.060
 bought so you're going to install 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.939
 this well 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.380
 once crossed the mobile longer 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.430
 it matters to have the mobile phone connected to 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.950
 computer 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.659
 You have to go to my things normally 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.840
 it's called my things 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.789
 or my files is also usually called and 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.910
 there look for the folder where you have left 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:15.209
 the file find the folder and once 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.019
 enter the folder you are looking for the file 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:22.530
 this mp 061 you can rename that not 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:25.739
 nothing happens well let's say you install the 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.709
 file complicate in it already asks you the 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.930
 installation but in the event that we 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.330
 leave you have to go first of all to 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.970
 the settings and option options of 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.569
 security you have to allow to install 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.910
 files from outside the app store ' this 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.269
 from the play store so that you can 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.989
 install the minecraft well continuing 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.629
 with installation and good install the 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.129
 minecraft as I told you and once 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.019
 is installed because you will already have 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.879
 minecraft and on your mobile I have it 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.560
 right now in a simulator that I have in 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.640
 My computer 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.500
 from android so I'm going to show you 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.900
 well I've opened it before to try it 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.600
 but I'm going to teach it from scratch once 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.910
 if you let me record 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.300
 because with the qantas it always gives me 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:18.610
 error these things these programs 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.610
 good I do not know do not know 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.670
 Yes I can see 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.250
 I do not know 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.250
 let's wait for the program to respond 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.630
 computer is already very old 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.140
 Well, no 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.150
 I do not charge for singing if I study 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.120
 but you can try it if you have 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.489
 some very old mobile very very bad then 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.400
 no doubt it will go a little bad for you 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:55.239
 make up but come on I really do not think 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.239
