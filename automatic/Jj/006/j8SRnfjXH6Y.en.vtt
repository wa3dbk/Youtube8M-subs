00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:17.409
Hello my friends, here I am to show you

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:20.439
al the Nauraliss products from Cunipic

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.779
in prizes for the chinchillas.

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.720
As you know, Naturaliss is a Cunipic range of completely natural

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.999
feed.

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.759
And I want to show you the four references.

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.210
The first one, the treats,

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.590
made from beetroot and zucchini

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.420
with a base of hay

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.980
that as you know if very important for the dental

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:42.630
ware.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.140
You know that is a unique product inthe market, and has this cube shape

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.150
so the animals enjoy playing with it.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.480
Secondly,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.430
we have the Naturaliss delicious

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.640
it has zucchini, beetroot

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.640
and white carrot. Look how curious the product looks like.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.800
Thirdly we have

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.020
Natural Salad, with

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.440
red cabbage,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.860
radishes and carrot. In this product you can also find quite a lot of hay.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.680
Look how nice...

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.910
And finally,

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.740
here we have the Fruit muesli,

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.700
made from beetroot and pineapple.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.780
And I would like to stop here a minute, Look

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:30.970
at the pineapple

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.570
here artificially dehydrated with added sugar

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.800
and our natural pineapple

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.260
Which one looks more natural?

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.120
Well this one, evidently. Also

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.180
the smell

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.460
is incredible, it smells espectacular and they love it

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.840
all we do is dehydrate is. This is 100% natural, it has only passed by

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.550
a dehydration process, whilst here

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.290
they have included preservatives, colorings and sugars.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.630
The best is to see how well they eat it, we will give some to Nee-loo

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.589
a bit of fruit and beetroot.

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:11.629
Look here, I want to show you all of these products,

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.619
but in their natural appearance.

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:18.259
On one side we have

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:19.919
the beetroot,

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:21.009
very rich

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:22.409
in sulfur.

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.479
The radishes, that are very good for young animals, for the bone

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.899
growth, as they have a lot of minerals.

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:31.489
The red cabbage

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.700
is very rich in fiber and has very few calories, it is a prize that can been fed

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.389
often, as it will not fatten the animal

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:39.789
the zucchini is very

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:42.249
rich in potassium,

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:44.309
as you well know the carrots

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:47.219
have carotenoids, vitamin A,

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:48.909
the white carrot

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:49.969
the calcium,

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:51.779
it is very rich in calcium,

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:53.999
and finally, the pineapple

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:57.339
is proeolytic, the bromelain included in the pineapple

00:02:57.339 --> 00:03:00.879
has properties that help to undo the hair balls that are in the

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.159
stomach, because when animals clean their coat, this happens

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.569
we have a video of this, have a look a it
