yeah<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:23.539> MetroPCS<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.689> guess<00:00:24.869> since<00:00:25.140> they

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
yeah and MetroPCS I guess since they

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.300 
yeah and MetroPCS I guess since they
have<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.529> now<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.150> um<00:00:27.470> your<00:00:28.470> phone<00:00:28.769> does<00:00:29.070> have

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
have it now and um your phone does have

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.429 
have it now and um your phone does have
to<00:00:29.550> be<00:00:29.640> rooted<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.720> let's<00:00:30.900> see<00:00:31.109> how<00:00:31.289> this<00:00:31.380> looks

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.330 
to be rooted so let's see how this looks
like<00:00:32.390> like<00:00:33.390> gum

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
like like gum
