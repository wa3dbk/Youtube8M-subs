 three-phase system regret I'm not 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.960
 I managed to test and since I 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.059
 no special removal fluid 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.309
 gel polish 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.230

 wonderful green jars I knew about her 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.399
 existence for a long time you did not believe in and 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.129
 magical properties 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.140
 this nail polish remover 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.199
 green tea series severin 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.000
 her peculiarity is that she has a sponge 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.390
 impregnated nail polish remover 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.160
 I'll show you how it works 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.260
 specially applied for the demonstration varnish 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.250
 waited for it to dry completely 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.710
 everything was honestly taking a finger on 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.020
 I give liquid varnish for a couple of seconds 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.810
 and smooth circular motions take off 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.189
 the coating does not dry out 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.110
 nail plate and does not contain acetone 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.360
 this miracle jar removes and black lacquer 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.030

 too, will be on the teeth instructions indicated 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.570

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.650
 tried on the sand removes with a bang 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.820
 the only negative is that sponge 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.250
 crumbles very quickly 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.869

 wide brush not liquid and not thick 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.080
 therefore, two layers of rare 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.330
 cases of three stages of lilac shade 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.430

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.599
 used stickers on sticky 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.050

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.530
 nail 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.680
 now you will see I followed the exact 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.440
 instructions on package 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.990
 did a manicure nails as usual run

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:45.380
 on the nail starts the growth line 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:48.320
 removed all the air bubbles where 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.890
 heating folds with the help of 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.240
 scissors 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:55.520
 cut off the excess part of the sticker file 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.000

 all the same repeated with each 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:04.610
 that come further by following the instructions I 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.340
 Covered with top coating after all stupidly 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.560
 stickers for bubbled want 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.969
 used here for the same company I 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.029
 terribly upset 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:15.889
 all my efforts turned out to be smarts on 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:18.769
 the remaining stickers spent 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:21.559
 experiments with top companies from other companies 

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:24.289
 the result will be the same even 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:26.689
 base failure and usually clear varnishes 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:29.419
 but they still bubble you want 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:32.389
 varying degrees further tried to inflict 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:35.329
 on them finish photo gel polish and up 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:37.339
 raising the bubble so you can 

00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:37.849
 believe instruction from acrylic and 

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:40.309
 gel 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:43.039
 they look the same and now about 

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:46.939
 one tool from the parcel is oil for 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:51.099
 cuticle peach here svirin be composed 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:54.139
 peach oil vitamin e jojoba oil 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:56.959
 a bottle of 30 milliliters has only 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:59.029
 convenient brush thanks to which oil 

00:05:56.959 --> 00:06:01.729
 easy to apply on nails and skin around 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:04.309
 No, the coolest thing is 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.379
 set cap pipette thanks to her 

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:09.439

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:12.349
 beautiful ritual oil has resistant but 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:15.229
 very pleasant peach aroma as well 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:18.819
 perfectly moisturizes and nourishes the nails therefore 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:18.819
 only now I use it 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.500
