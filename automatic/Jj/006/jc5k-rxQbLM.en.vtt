units<00:01:37.020> where<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.799> LCD<00:01:38.280> always<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:38.970> I

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
units where you have the LCD always on I

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.240 
units where you have the LCD always on I
don't<00:01:39.210> know<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:39.450> can<00:01:39.540> get<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.659> shot<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.960> this

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
don't know if we can get a shot of this

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.950 
don't know if we can get a shot of this
but<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.369> always<00:01:41.549> have<00:01:41.909> what<00:01:42.390> information<00:01:42.840> is

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
but you always have what information is

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.480 
but you always have what information is
on<00:01:43.110> there<00:01:43.259> why<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.619> important<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.280> gives

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
on there why is this important it gives

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.950 
on there why is this important it gives
you<00:01:44.610> four<00:01:44.820> data<00:01:45.060> points<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.540> really<00:01:45.780> good<00:01:45.930> to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
you four data points it's really good to

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.990 
you four data points it's really good to
its<00:01:46.290> first<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> person<00:01:47.159> has<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> multiple

its first and the person has a multiple
hard<00:01:48.210> drives<00:01:48.299> one<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.079> gives<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:50.130> ability

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
hard drives one it gives you the ability

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.210 
hard drives one it gives you the ability
to<00:01:51.360> name<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.689> drive<00:01:51.990> where<00:01:52.350> versus<00:01:52.799> put<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> bunch

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
to name a drive where versus put a bunch

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.039 
to name a drive where versus put a bunch
of<00:01:53.310> post-it<00:01:53.700> notes<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.060> those<00:01:54.390> portable<00:01:54.899> hard

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
of post-it notes on those portable hard

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.139 
of post-it notes on those portable hard
drives<00:01:55.290> second<00:01:56.040> point<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.340> tells<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.820> when

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
drives second point it tells you when

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.459 
drives second point it tells you when
the<00:01:57.299> last<00:01:57.450> time<00:01:57.659> you've<00:01:57.840> actually<00:01:57.990> written<00:01:58.320> to

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
the last time you've actually written to

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.270 
the last time you've actually written to
the<00:01:58.560> drive

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
the drive

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.219 
the drive
and<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.520> third<00:01:59.760> part<00:01:59.869> gives<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> ability

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
and the third part gives you the ability

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.140 
and the third part gives you the ability
if<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.650> user<00:02:01.860> definable<00:02:02.369> space<00:02:02.760> to<00:02:02.940> tell

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
if you user definable space to tell

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.120 
if you user definable space to tell
exactly<00:02:03.479> what<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.200> hard<00:02:04.560> drive<00:02:04.650> and

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
exactly what is on that hard drive and

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.890 
exactly what is on that hard drive and
in<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.640> last<00:02:05.850> data<00:02:06.119> point<00:02:06.210> which<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.659> most

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
in the last data point which is most

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.690 
in the last data point which is most
popular<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.619> gas<00:02:07.950> gauge<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.429> tells<00:02:08.580> you

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
popular is the gas gauge it tells you

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.040 
popular is the gas gauge it tells you
how<00:02:08.789> much<00:02:08.910> capacity<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.479> left<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.869> hard

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
how much capacity is left on the hard

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.840 
how much capacity is left on the hard
drive<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.979> that's<00:02:11.160> become<00:02:11.400> very<00:02:11.580> very<00:02:11.730> popular

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
drive so that's become very very popular

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.970 
drive so that's become very very popular
and<00:02:12.480> as<00:02:12.600> you<00:02:12.750> mentioned<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.260> an<00:02:13.410> always-on

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
and as you mentioned it is an always-on

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.130 
and as you mentioned it is an always-on
screen<00:02:14.010> there's<00:02:14.670> no<00:02:14.790> battery<00:02:15.180> powered<00:02:15.630> best

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
screen there's no battery powered best

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.180 
screen there's no battery powered best
way<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.319> look<00:02:16.500> at<00:02:16.620> it's<00:02:16.800> almost<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.100> an

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
way to look at it's almost like an

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.460 
way to look at it's almost like an
etch-a-sketch<00:02:17.630> well<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:18.780> can<00:02:18.930> never<00:02:18.959> be<00:02:19.140> too

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
etch-a-sketch well you can never be too

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.800 
etch-a-sketch well you can never be too
thin<00:02:20.010> too<00:02:20.370> rich<00:02:20.670> or<00:02:20.850> have<00:02:21.000> too<00:02:21.120> much<00:02:21.239> storage<00:02:21.569> I

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
thin too rich or have too much storage I

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.150 
thin too rich or have too much storage I
guess<00:02:21.989> right<00:02:22.170> well<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.500> don't<00:02:22.860> know<00:02:22.950> what<00:02:23.100> the
