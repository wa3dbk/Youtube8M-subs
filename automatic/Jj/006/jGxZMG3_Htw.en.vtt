00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.460
 Welcome to smart games today 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.770
 another training lok and that 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.200
 with a putsch training 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.509
 When I notice my calorie reduction 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.549
 I often press the bank immediately 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.949
 an impact little military press 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.199
 I would do that at the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.270
 the military press that first 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.640
 I can kneel and squat 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.980
 always for a relatively long time through ten 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.930
 especially before I get there 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.029
 somehow nutritionally or 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.859
 energy moderately what merkel but at the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.050
 you can tell by pressing movements 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.000
 a lot of people will know that relatively quickly 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.399
 today in any case again 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.290
 the 120 on the plan three sentences six 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.809
 repetitions I grabbed the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.350
 week the italy definitely has 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.600
 contributed that the 120 again 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.700
 felt a little better 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.280
 I probably no Italy now 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.230
 I'd guess that week 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.590
 the weight should have been reduced 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.620
 clean up in the next time so um 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.140
 25 kilos because you notice someday 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.250
 really this calorie deficit thing 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.159
 especially always a bit 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.710
 advanced is so goes 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.070
 currently everything is still 120 36 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.750
 All right and then until I do 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.490
 always like a slight diagonal bank 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.619
 variant I was there currently a 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.049
 a little bit with the inclination a bit 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.240
 steeper our steep it is just put 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.850
 the rest to more shoulder takes her 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.409
 with very important here at the third 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.360
 step bank press attention that 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.640
 the elbows do not point outwards 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.560
 So do not make the band back too 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.750
 in this exercise if it helps you 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.540
 The older one turns the wrists slightly 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.880
 one sees this as mine like mine 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.590
 Wrist is that so that's one 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.210
 little 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.450
 some would say almost klo 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.159
 script my wrist I turn so 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.540
 as after the upper arm at the deepest 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.670
 position should stand 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.840
 I move on the second exercise 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.670
 I'm a bit more with myself 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.560
 repetitions as there I am now he 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.360
 so out on teeth 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.680
 at the first exercise bench press I was 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.299
 now with reimer 6 at the start 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.880
 Here I have a pyramid upstairs 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.160
 I made the first set with 38 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.440
 made the second with 40 you see 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.400
 have you blessed earlier that was the top 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.530
 stars with 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.989
 42 and I have all three sets 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.970
 40 still packed my girlfriend here with 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.980
 I wore some short of school 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.180
 I'll do it to you too 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.950
 really good progress 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.680
 Here's her left-hand tick 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.060
 weaker than the right one 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.909
 in that she had an injury from 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.019
 handball so oh now comes the last one 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:35.549
 set that the 42 ok then it was already before 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.849
 a little too fast so that is 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:41.189
 now the top set of 42 I'll be there 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.319
 pack another ten but claimed it 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.299
 I'm definitely going to notice you at the 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.099
 I have to repeat that with the last 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.079
 after he presses he goes out 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.500
 above so that is already very distressed 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.950
 Nevertheless, I am now ringing 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.290
 a cell phone 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.840
 Nevertheless, I am fully satisfied 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:02.489
 as far as my training performance is concerned 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.870
 and so we can do it all over 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.629
 art trade, of course, also heavy 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.139
 can not run or ask on 68 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:12.389
 Yes, but you know that I am 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:14.489
 big advocates that for example the 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:16.680
 barbell what progression increase 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.530
 As far as the better choice is and short 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.879
 you have to trade something 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.519
 risk of injury because I would not like that 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.590
 Hardly go in I'll be even more 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.609
 a video will do a bit of dumbbell 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.870
 before dumbbell short trade before disadvantages 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.909
 and with different points I have 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.500
 me already firmly and as 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.900
 finisher for the post I like to do 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.199
 flying variant today with one 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.620
 sitting cape cross or yes that is 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:45.720
 Almost butterfly after simulates the 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.139
 butterfly machines in the studio like 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.000
 not me 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:50.400
 That's why I have to give myself one 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.870
 alternative search and then just for the 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.750
 I do my middle shoulder head then 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.370
 just because the front shoulder head 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.359
 is just when diagonally bench press already 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.729
 very strong in it 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.620
 Some ask your are you doing 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:03.900
 no shoulder push the movement 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.459
 I do not do it but that has just that 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.109
 reason when I am at an angle bank at 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.790
 Bench press the front school computer 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.609
 head very much in it, and the 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.739
 is well developed for me and this 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.690
 bodybuilding this broad look of 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.590
 So you get wider from the front 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.900
 appearance 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.430
 you do not get that from before 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.019
 front shoulder head you get 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.210
 from the middle of that I do then 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.919
 four sets of ten to twelve repetitions 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.150
 Here's what you'll see that now that I 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:32.430
 my company's view from the front 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.830
 this goes into the broad yes this 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.130
 Cannonball temperate this round that 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.810
 you get through the middle 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.669
 okay then i have ten sets of ten 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.110
 until just twelve repetitions 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.599
 and then I still do 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.389
 a triceps exercise so kate bush dance 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:49.860
 where I am now increasingly on tips 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.870
 also resist 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.330
 I have taken out the kind of 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.970
 even now I'm going again 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.060
 got some time on the dips sets 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.490
 To cool things read also something 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.340
 functional anatomy of 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.710
 intelligence potion with regard to the tip 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.539
 and whatever I integrate now 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.699
 but currently have not filmed much 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.820
 I have long since that is now a two 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.810
 for minutes just two minutes 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.370
 holding classic plenk 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.050
