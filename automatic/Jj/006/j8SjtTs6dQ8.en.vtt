00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180 

so<00:00:00.390> the<00:00:00.539> chicken<00:00:00.900> is<00:00:01.020> cooking<00:00:01.260> nicely<00:00:01.620> and<00:00:02.070> now

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
so the chicken is cooking nicely and now

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.550 
so the chicken is cooking nicely and now
I<00:00:02.220> add<00:00:02.669> the<00:00:02.939> same<00:00:03.120> amount<00:00:03.179> of<00:00:03.510> mix<00:00:03.750> of<00:00:04.259> flour

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
I add the same amount of mix of flour

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.079 
I add the same amount of mix of flour
and<00:00:04.589> forth<00:00:04.980> but<00:00:05.220> though<00:00:05.430> there<00:00:05.609> has<00:00:05.730> been

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
and forth but though there has been

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:15.049 
and forth but though there has been
started<00:00:10.490> this<00:00:11.490> will<00:00:11.730> certainly<00:00:13.580> use<00:00:14.580> up<00:00:14.790> quite

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
started this will certainly use up quite

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.810 
started this will certainly use up quite
a<00:00:15.089> bit<00:00:16.130> it<00:00:17.130> just<00:00:17.340> works<00:00:17.550> easier<00:00:18.090> when<00:00:18.359> the

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
a bit it just works easier when the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.000 
a bit it just works easier when the
whatever<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:21.090> using<00:00:21.510> breadcrumbs<00:00:22.050> plow<00:00:22.980> or

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
whatever you using breadcrumbs plow or

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.970 
whatever you using breadcrumbs plow or
whatever<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.000> haven't<00:00:24.300> enough

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.970 

this<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.310> going<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.580> be<00:00:29.670> even<00:00:29.849> at<00:00:30.090> riskier

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
this is going to be even at riskier

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.770 
this is going to be even at riskier
coating

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.660 

so<00:00:36.289> you<00:00:36.410> have<00:00:36.590> the<00:00:36.710> choice<00:00:36.920> of<00:00:37.129> doing<00:00:37.430> it<00:00:37.520> this

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
so you have the choice of doing it this

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:49.049 
so you have the choice of doing it this
way<00:00:38.469> with<00:00:39.469> this<00:00:39.620> once

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.299 

and<00:00:50.059> that's<00:00:50.300> it<00:00:50.540> now<00:00:51.410> we'll<00:00:51.559> just<00:00:51.770> wait<00:00:51.920> to<00:00:52.190> let

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
and that's it now we'll just wait to let

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.400 
and that's it now we'll just wait to let
chicken<00:00:52.670> spinach<00:00:52.879> not<00:00:53.780> be<00:00:53.960> using<00:00:54.110> out

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
chicken spinach not be using out

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.959 
chicken spinach not be using out
electric<00:00:54.829> deep-fry<00:00:55.280> which<00:00:55.550> is<00:00:55.670> a<00:00:55.699> little

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
electric deep-fry which is a little

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:02.290 
electric deep-fry which is a little
deeper<00:00:56.360> than<00:00:56.510> this<00:00:59.920> ug<00:01:00.920> usually<00:01:01.910> fried

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
deeper than this ug usually fried

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.060 
deeper than this ug usually fried
chicken<00:01:03.070> is<00:01:04.070> done<00:01:04.489> when<00:01:05.420> it<00:01:05.540> floats

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.660 

well<00:01:09.700> that<00:01:09.970> won't<00:01:10.120> be<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.390> case<00:01:10.420> here<00:01:10.630> because

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
well that won't be the case here because

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.540 
well that won't be the case here because
this<00:01:12.670> isn't<00:01:13.000> deep<00:01:13.150> enough

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.890 

but<00:01:16.150> we're<00:01:16.330> maintaining<00:01:16.570> this<00:01:18.120> 375<00:01:19.120> at<00:01:19.750> the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
but we're maintaining this 375 at the

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.590 
but we're maintaining this 375 at the
highest<00:01:20.110> flame<00:01:20.530> I<00:01:20.710> have<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:22.150> that's<00:01:22.330> what<00:01:22.510> you

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
highest flame I have so that's what you

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.050 
highest flame I have so that's what you
have<00:01:22.720> to<00:01:22.750> watch<00:01:23.020> out<00:01:23.260> for<00:01:23.880> keep<00:01:24.880> the

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
have to watch out for keep the

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:33.090 
have to watch out for keep the
temperature<00:01:30.900> closing<00:01:31.900> in<00:01:32.020> on<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.410> 15-minute

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.510 
temperature closing in on the 15-minute
mark<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.640> things<00:01:33.850> are<00:01:34.000> going<00:01:34.270> well<00:01:35.490> when<00:01:36.490> I

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
mark and things are going well when I

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.550 
mark and things are going well when I
was<00:01:36.730> working<00:01:37.000> in<00:01:37.240> New<00:01:37.270> Orleans<00:01:37.390> I<00:01:38.050> stopped<00:01:38.380> in

was working in New Orleans I stopped in

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.840 
was working in New Orleans I stopped in

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
looking the back and I noticed what they

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.250 
looking the back and I noticed what they
were<00:01:46.840> doing<00:01:47.460> liquid<00:01:48.460> into<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.540> flour<00:01:49.840> mix

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.900 
were doing liquid into the flour mix
back<00:01:50.740> into<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.130> liquid<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:52.350> each<00:01:53.350> party<00:01:53.910> the

older houses popeyes fried chicken wings

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.330 
older houses popeyes fried chicken wings
well<00:02:00.010> just<00:02:00.340> keep<00:02:00.490> your<00:02:00.670> eye<00:02:00.730> on<00:02:00.880> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
well just keep your eye on the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.190 
well just keep your eye on the
thermometer<00:02:03.340> temperature<00:02:03.840> we're<00:02:04.840> reaching<00:02:04.990> a

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
thermometer temperature we're reaching a

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.900 
thermometer temperature we're reaching a
little<00:02:05.440> over<00:02:05.650> 400<00:02:05.920> so<00:02:06.310> I'm<00:02:06.400> lowering<00:02:06.730> the

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
little over 400 so I'm lowering the

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.359 
little over 400 so I'm lowering the
flame<00:02:07.180> let's<00:02:07.450> replace<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.900> chicken<00:02:08.290> now<00:02:09.130> is

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
flame let's replace the chicken now is

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.450 
flame let's replace the chicken now is
completely<00:02:09.580> hot<00:02:10.179> inside<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.980> oil<00:02:12.190> is<00:02:12.430> not

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
completely hot inside so the oil is not

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.900 
completely hot inside so the oil is not
cooling<00:02:12.940> down<00:02:13.240> any<00:02:13.630> longer<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:15.580> maybe<00:02:15.820> you

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
cooling down any longer so maybe you

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.760 
cooling down any longer so maybe you
make<00:02:16.150> your<00:02:16.330> adjustments<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.050> lower<00:02:17.320> little

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
make your adjustments this lower little

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.820 
make your adjustments this lower little
you<00:02:18.130> don't<00:02:18.280> want<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.460> go<00:02:18.580> over<00:02:18.790> 400<00:02:19.830> an

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
you don't want to go over 400 an

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.380 
you don't want to go over 400 an
electric<00:02:21.310> one<00:02:21.459> I<00:02:21.520> guess<00:02:21.820> you<00:02:21.940> don't<00:02:22.120> have<00:02:22.180> that

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
electric one I guess you don't have that

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.100 
electric one I guess you don't have that
problem<00:02:22.540> has<00:02:22.840> its<00:02:23.170> own<00:02:23.290> thermostat<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:25.540> we're

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
problem has its own thermostat so we're

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.960 
problem has its own thermostat so we're
going<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.470> get<00:02:26.739> in<00:02:26.860> close<00:02:27.070> to<00:02:27.250> ten<00:02:27.459> minutes<00:02:27.790> and

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
going to get in close to ten minutes and

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.050 
going to get in close to ten minutes and
the<00:02:28.420> chicken<00:02:28.780> looks<00:02:28.989> great<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.820> turn<00:02:30.820> it<00:02:31.000> a

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
the chicken looks great I turn it a

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.690 
the chicken looks great I turn it a
little<00:02:31.090> bit<00:02:31.420> here<00:02:31.600> in<00:02:31.630> there

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.800 

feels<00:02:35.569> nice<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.849> hard<00:02:37.849> on<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.239> outside<00:02:38.270> that

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
feels nice and hard on the outside that

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.350 
feels nice and hard on the outside that
means<00:02:39.050> that<00:02:39.230> coating<00:02:39.680> is<00:02:39.769> going<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.040> be<00:02:40.129> tricky

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.509 

well<00:02:44.360> we<00:02:44.540> are<00:02:44.720> now<00:02:44.930> at<00:02:45.200> these<00:02:45.440> 15<00:02:45.980> minute<00:02:46.310> more

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
well we are now at these 15 minute more

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.309 
well we are now at these 15 minute more
and<00:02:46.849> to<00:02:47.720> me<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.379> way<00:02:48.530> that<00:02:48.560> chicken<00:02:49.099> look<00:02:50.319> it

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
and to me the way that chicken look it

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.830 
and to me the way that chicken look it
looks<00:02:51.590> cook<00:02:52.090> so<00:02:53.090> I'm<00:02:53.180> going<00:02:53.300> to<00:02:53.360> remove<00:02:53.630> the

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840
