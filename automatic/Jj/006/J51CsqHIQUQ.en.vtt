00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.990
 ah 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:13.770
 or the plea of saavedra for Christmas 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.770
 official byte and crochet study 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.630
 Now I would like to speak to you 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.640
 What are the main features? 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.849
 differences between three countries and 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.710
 with the other brand that there is in the market 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.570
 We start 2007 in one of the 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.609
 first like saying the first one that we 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.430
 first enter the special visit of the 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.519
 chile have spent a lot of years we have a lot 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.680
 experience in the subject I myself am 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:41.110
 semi professional cyclist and running to the 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.940
 less 12 years ride the truth that 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.040
 I'm passionate about the subject so 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.229
 I know the requirements very well 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.640
 that people have at a general level 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:53.199
 both previously and subsequently 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.330
 So roughly what I 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.220
 I could tell you the following today by 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.290
 today I have accounted for around 20 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.070
 folding wax brand what about 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.180
 would be in salt which is better which is more 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.369
 which one is more convenient for me 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.560
 we just do not want to get into your 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.900
 budget but I invite you to do the 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.200
 next exercise of all brands 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.460
 that currently has the Chilean market 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.460
 how many of these brands 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.060
 or have a presence in the market 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.130
 International should say that it is time 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.710
 where is wrong 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.439
 this is not minor because they are visits 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.320
 stuck where the most important thing is your 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.390
 security the market study not for that 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.430
 motive is not as demanding as the 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.520
 European market as the market 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.909
 American or countries like Japan or like 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.649
 south korea therefore our 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.960
 bicycles are the same bicycles that 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.460
 you will find in those markets 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.819
 where high standards of 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.740
 Almost equal quality as with 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:56.149
 what matters are vehicles so 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.500
 so much is not surprising that the 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.539
 bicycles that cover other brands 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.549
 ancile we will have a presence in 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.979
 these markets because because you're not going to 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.130
 find a minimum of quality I think that 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.920
 yes 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.709
 that guarantee us transit do it for 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.560
 something will come 25 years warranty 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.599
 picture 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.620
 with the fork and the aforementioned delegate 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:20.120
 a unique guarantee not to the market besides 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.550
 that we guarantee that we are always going to 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.200
 have a large stock of spare parts and a 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.390
 vast experience with respect to 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.650
 any flaw or any 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.110
 problem of your issues products 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.750
 visible that would be and I hope that it has 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.230
 become clear because we are numbers 1 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.230
