the low in Tibet Pro is pretty much the
top<00:00:39.350> of<00:00:39.559> the<00:00:39.649> line<00:00:39.859> in<00:00:40.219> the<00:00:40.280> low<00:00:40.789> of

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
top of the line in the low of

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.819 
top of the line in the low of
backpacking<00:00:41.359> boots<00:00:41.629> series<00:00:42.140> and<00:00:42.649> there's<00:00:42.800> a

backpacking boots series and there's a
lot<00:00:42.980> of<00:00:43.010> reasons<00:00:43.430> for<00:00:43.579> that<00:00:43.659> boots<00:00:44.659> got<00:00:44.809> a<00:00:44.870> lot

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
lot of reasons for that boots got a lot

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:46.720 
lot of reasons for that boots got a lot
of<00:00:45.110> really<00:00:45.469> cool<00:00:45.649> features<00:00:45.710> it's<00:00:46.519> got<00:00:46.550> the

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
of really cool features it's got the

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.060 
of really cool features it's got the
nice<00:00:46.909> Vibram<00:00:47.390> sole<00:00:47.659> on<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.140> bottom<00:00:48.170> but<00:00:48.980> as

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
nice Vibram sole on the bottom but as

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.100 
nice Vibram sole on the bottom but as
you<00:00:49.159> can<00:00:49.339> see<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:49.730> lugs<00:00:49.969> are<00:00:50.180> really<00:00:50.420> wide<00:00:50.659> and

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
you can see the lugs are really wide and

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.930 
you can see the lugs are really wide and
there's<00:00:51.500> a<00:00:51.559> lot<00:00:51.710> of<00:00:51.860> gaps<00:00:52.129> in<00:00:52.399> between<00:00:52.430> there

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
there's a lot of gaps in between there

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.910 
there's a lot of gaps in between there
and<00:00:53.329> what<00:00:53.449> that<00:00:53.479> does<00:00:53.839> is<00:00:54.049> it<00:00:54.229> allows<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.440> sole

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
and what that does is it allows the sole

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.950 
and what that does is it allows the sole
to<00:00:55.190> stick<00:00:55.460> on<00:00:55.640> rocks<00:00:55.909> and<00:00:56.180> hardpan<00:00:56.629> and<00:00:56.809> things

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
to stick on rocks and hardpan and things

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.899 
to stick on rocks and hardpan and things
like<00:00:57.110> that<00:00:57.170> so<00:00:57.530> you<00:00:57.739> have<00:00:57.799> good<00:00:57.979> traction<00:00:58.250> but

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
like that so you have good traction but

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.729 
like that so you have good traction but
more<00:00:59.089> importantly<00:00:59.449> it<00:00:59.600> kicks<00:00:59.839> out<00:01:00.019> rocks<00:01:00.350> it

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
more importantly it kicks out rocks it

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.279 
more importantly it kicks out rocks it
kicks<00:01:00.979> out<00:01:01.159> mud<00:01:01.460> it<00:01:01.699> kicks<00:01:01.909> out<00:01:02.089> snow<00:01:02.420> so<00:01:02.989> your

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
kicks out mud it kicks out snow so your

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.830 
kicks out mud it kicks out snow so your
soul<00:01:03.589> is<00:01:03.769> always<00:01:03.979> clean<00:01:04.369> and<00:01:04.449> without<00:01:05.449> that

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
soul is always clean and without that

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.149 
soul is always clean and without that
you<00:01:05.899> wouldn't<00:01:06.259> have<00:01:06.409> very<00:01:06.680> good<00:01:06.860> traction

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
you wouldn't have very good traction

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.279 
you wouldn't have very good traction
this<00:01:07.819> boot<00:01:08.000> is<00:01:08.119> also<00:01:08.450> really<00:01:08.659> tough<00:01:08.929> as<00:01:09.200> you

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
this boot is also really tough as you

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.830 
this boot is also really tough as you
can<00:01:09.470> tell<00:01:09.710> it's<00:01:09.920> got<00:01:09.950> a<00:01:10.100> hard<00:01:10.610> rubber<00:01:11.000> toe<00:01:11.539> on

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
can tell it's got a hard rubber toe on

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.200 
can tell it's got a hard rubber toe on
it<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:12.229> it's<00:01:12.740> got<00:01:12.860> a<00:01:12.890> full<00:01:13.220> rubber<00:01:13.490> R<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:13.850> all

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
it and it's got a full rubber R and all

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.880 
it and it's got a full rubber R and all
the<00:01:14.479> way<00:01:14.600> around<00:01:14.899> the<00:01:15.080> outside<00:01:15.470> of<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.679> boot

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
the way around the outside of the boot

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.770 
the way around the outside of the boot
so<00:01:16.369> we<00:01:16.429> can<00:01:16.550> take<00:01:16.700> a<00:01:16.729> lot<00:01:16.940> of<00:01:17.000> abuse<00:01:17.360> and<00:01:17.569> as<00:01:17.690> you

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
so we can take a lot of abuse and as you

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.330 
so we can take a lot of abuse and as you
can<00:01:17.899> tell<00:01:17.960> this<00:01:18.259> boot<00:01:18.470> has<00:01:18.710> taken<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.159> lot<00:01:19.280> of

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
can tell this boot has taken a lot of

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.669 
can tell this boot has taken a lot of
abuse<00:01:19.630> it's<00:01:20.630> a<00:01:20.690> full<00:01:20.899> leather<00:01:21.140> boot<00:01:21.380> which<00:01:21.530> I

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
abuse it's a full leather boot which I

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.200 
abuse it's a full leather boot which I
really<00:01:21.890> like<00:01:22.100> because<00:01:22.130> it<00:01:22.580> fits<00:01:22.819> really<00:01:23.030> well

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
really like because it fits really well

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.749 
really like because it fits really well
and<00:01:23.659> it<00:01:23.929> conforms<00:01:24.380> over<00:01:24.619> time<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:25.009> your<00:01:25.159> foot<00:01:25.490> I

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
and it conforms over time to your foot I

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.010 
and it conforms over time to your foot I
think<00:01:25.850> that<00:01:26.330> becomes<00:01:26.569> a<00:01:26.690> lot<00:01:26.869> more

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
think that becomes a lot more

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.690 
think that becomes a lot more
comfortable<00:01:27.409> overall<00:01:27.890> than<00:01:28.130> a<00:01:28.220> synthetic

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
comfortable overall than a synthetic

comfortable overall than a synthetic
