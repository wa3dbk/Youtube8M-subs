00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
something like that and you know

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.029 
something like that and you know
obtaining<00:01:58.240> it<00:01:58.329> through<00:01:58.630> pvp<00:01:59.079> or<00:01:59.289> through<00:01:59.859> some

obtaining it through pvp or through some
kind<00:02:00.249> of<00:02:00.539> largely<00:02:01.539> available<00:02:02.289> means<00:02:02.469> but<00:02:03.069> it's

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:03.279 
kind of largely available means but it's

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:05.159 
kind of largely available means but it's
not<00:02:03.489> really<00:02:03.759> in<00:02:03.939> the<00:02:04.029> true<00:02:04.239> spirit<00:02:04.419> of<00:02:04.689> diablo

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:05.169 
not really in the true spirit of diablo

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:07.739 
not really in the true spirit of diablo
so<00:02:05.709> honestly<00:02:06.219> I<00:02:06.429> couldn't<00:02:06.789> figure<00:02:07.060> out<00:02:07.209> with

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:07.749 
so honestly I couldn't figure out with

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:10.290 
so honestly I couldn't figure out with
an<00:02:07.929> overwhelmingly<00:02:08.770> good<00:02:09.099> idea<00:02:09.550> on<00:02:09.789> how<00:02:10.270> to

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
an overwhelmingly good idea on how to

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.630 
an overwhelmingly good idea on how to
introduce<00:02:10.599> a<00:02:10.899> PV<00:02:11.319> system<00:02:11.710> that<00:02:11.950> will<00:02:12.130> you<00:02:12.520> know

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
introduce a PV system that will you know

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.340 
introduce a PV system that will you know
solve<00:02:12.940> both<00:02:13.150> those<00:02:13.420> problems<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:13.990> know<00:02:14.110> keep

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
solve both those problems you know keep

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.680 
solve both those problems you know keep

Taylor Liam Diablo you know as it's been

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
nature those two things are such such an

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.940 
nature those two things are such such an
odds<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:22.790> it's<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:23.630> thought<00:02:24.230> it<00:02:24.470> was<00:02:24.680> pretty

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
odds that it's I thought it was pretty

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.460 
odds that it's I thought it was pretty
much<00:02:25.160> impossible<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.880> balance<00:02:26.180> them<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.570> it

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
much impossible to balance them and it

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.260 
much impossible to balance them and it
seems<00:02:27.740> that<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:28.220> guys<00:02:28.520> will<00:02:28.700> read<00:02:28.910> Blizzard

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
seems that the guys will read Blizzard

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.770 
seems that the guys will read Blizzard
thought<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.260> same<00:02:30.470> because<00:02:31.300> they<00:02:32.300> just<00:02:32.570> went

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
thought the same because they just went

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.140 
thought the same because they just went
with<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:32.990> pitch<00:02:33.020> know<00:02:33.380> for<00:02:33.770> a<00:02:33.800> lost<00:02:34.100> EVP<00:02:34.610> they

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
with a pitch know for a lost EVP they

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.910 
with a pitch know for a lost EVP they
pretty<00:02:35.390> much<00:02:35.480> drove<00:02:35.960> the<00:02:36.140> competitive<00:02:36.710> part

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
pretty much drove the competitive part

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.730 
pretty much drove the competitive part
and<00:02:37.220> young<00:02:38.150> people<00:02:38.420> just<00:02:38.840> you<00:02:39.350> know<00:02:39.440> bash<00:02:39.710> each

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
and young people just you know bash each

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.650 
and young people just you know bash each
other's<00:02:39.950> heads<00:02:40.310> in<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:40.580> PFD<00:02:40.940> arena<00:02:41.210> for<00:02:41.450> some

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
other's heads in the PFD arena for some

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.810 
other's heads in the PFD arena for some
for<00:02:41.900> some<00:02:41.930> walls<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.560> that'll<00:02:43.070> be<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.490> mean

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
for some walls and that'll be it I mean

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.990 
for some walls and that'll be it I mean
that's<00:02:44.000> pretty<00:02:44.210> cool<00:02:44.480> um<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.500> think<00:02:46.490> it's<00:02:46.820> good

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
that's pretty cool um I think it's good

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.490 
that's pretty cool um I think it's good
I<00:02:47.180> think<00:02:47.420> it's<00:02:47.510> good<00:02:47.660> to<00:02:47.720> have<00:02:47.900> further<00:02:48.230> walls

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
I think it's good to have further walls

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.060 
I think it's good to have further walls
PvP<00:02:48.980> in<00:02:49.220> an<00:02:49.520> action<00:02:49.820> RPG<00:02:49.940> game<00:02:50.510> but<00:02:51.200> I<00:02:51.440> don't

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
PvP in an action RPG game but I don't

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.560 
PvP in an action RPG game but I don't
think<00:02:52.130> it's<00:02:52.310> good<00:02:52.520> to<00:02:52.550> delay<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.150> for<00:02:53.330> eight

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
think it's good to delay it for eight

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.630 
think it's good to delay it for eight
months<00:02:53.780> hype<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:54.380> up<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.710> then<00:02:54.950> come<00:02:55.310> up<00:02:55.340> with

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
months hype it up and then come up with

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.260 
months hype it up and then come up with
the<00:02:56.480> same<00:02:56.510> PvP<00:02:57.140> that<00:02:57.320> every<00:02:57.680> other<00:02:57.830> action<00:02:58.820> RPG

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
the same PvP that every other action RPG

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.570 
the same PvP that every other action RPG
game<00:02:59.480> has<00:02:59.690> so<00:03:00.290> I<00:03:00.350> think<00:03:00.620> that<00:03:00.920> was<00:03:01.070> pretty<00:03:01.340> big

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
game has so I think that was pretty big

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.690 
game has so I think that was pretty big
blunder<00:03:01.910> but<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:03.650> know<00:03:03.770> maybe<00:03:04.100> it's<00:03:04.340> a<00:03:04.430> lot<00:03:04.610> of

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
blunder but you know maybe it's a lot of

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.510 
blunder but you know maybe it's a lot of
fun<00:03:04.850> because<00:03:05.090> act<00:03:05.570> 3<00:03:06.110> farming<00:03:06.680> isn't<00:03:06.890> so

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
fun because act 3 farming isn't so

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.390 
fun because act 3 farming isn't so
comparatively<00:03:08.650> relatively<00:03:09.650> maybe<00:03:10.160> we'll<00:03:10.280> be

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
comparatively relatively maybe we'll be

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.430 
comparatively relatively maybe we'll be
very<00:03:10.550> enjoying<00:03:11.060> there's<00:03:12.050> a<00:03:12.140> couple<00:03:12.290> other

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440

experience I think empty towns over five
hundred<00:03:42.500> percent<00:03:42.860> experience<00:03:43.370> bonus<00:03:43.700> which

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
hundred percent experience bonus which

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.540

is really cool you know my only

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.220 
is really cool you know my only
criticism<00:03:46.790> of<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.209> monster<00:03:47.540> power<00:03:47.750> system<00:03:48.080> is

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
criticism of the monster power system is

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.210 
criticism of the monster power system is
that<00:03:48.260> it<00:03:49.100> was<00:03:49.280> a<00:03:49.459> pretty<00:03:49.940> good<00:03:50.030> system<00:03:50.570> but<00:03:51.220> the

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
that it was a pretty good system but the

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.190 
that it was a pretty good system but the
best<00:03:52.400> monster<00:03:52.790> part<00:03:53.000> of<00:03:53.060> plan<00:03:53.269> was<00:03:53.540> zero<00:03:53.900> so

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
best monster part of plan was zero so

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.960 
best monster part of plan was zero so
why<00:03:54.680> introduces<00:03:55.130> system<00:03:55.430> in<00:03:55.519> Alton<00:03:55.760> begin

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970
