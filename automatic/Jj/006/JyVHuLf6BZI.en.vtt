which<00:00:04.110> I<00:00:04.589> don't<00:00:05.279> think<00:00:05.580> it's<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.790> good<00:00:05.910> idea<00:00:06.060> to

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
which I don't think it's a good idea to

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.970 
which I don't think it's a good idea to
hand<00:00:06.540> it<00:00:06.660> around<00:00:06.870> because<00:00:07.140> art<00:00:07.350> majors<00:00:07.649> always

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
hand it around because art majors always

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.430 
hand it around because art majors always
have<00:00:08.130> dirty<00:00:08.309> fingers<00:00:08.840> but<00:00:09.840> one<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.410> things

encaustic which I could have a great
life<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.450> crime<00:00:48.780> because<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.680> burned<00:00:50.340> some<00:00:50.610> of

almost impossible to make because it's

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.039

like<00:01:47.939> look<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.750> really<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.380> only<00:01:49.530> description

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
like look I really the only description

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.590 
like look I really the only description
I<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.490> think<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.119> like<00:01:51.270> liquid

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
I can think of is it's like liquid

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.170 
I can think of is it's like liquid
velvet<00:01:52.049> now<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.100> hard<00:01:53.340> for<00:01:53.549> us<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.700> make<00:01:53.970> that

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
velvet now it's hard for us to make that

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.429 
velvet now it's hard for us to make that
today<00:01:54.479> because<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:54.899> hard<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.170> find<00:01:55.290> a

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
today because it's hard to find a

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.560 
today because it's hard to find a
chimney<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.009> has<00:01:56.460> only<00:01:56.490> ever<00:01:56.880> burned<00:01:57.299> would

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
chimney that has only ever burned would

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.749 
chimney that has only ever burned would
sue<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.960> or<00:01:58.110> would<00:01:58.290> but<00:01:59.130> during<00:01:59.670> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
sue it or would but during the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.760 
sue it or would but during the
Renaissance<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.509> was<00:02:00.719> their<00:02:00.899> primary<00:02:01.140> fuel

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
Renaissance that was their primary fuel

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.280 
Renaissance that was their primary fuel
so<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.280> was<00:02:02.399> easy<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.909> artists<00:02:03.630> didn't<00:02:03.990> go<00:02:04.229> to

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
so it was easy and artists didn't go to

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.319 
so it was easy and artists didn't go to
the<00:02:04.770> art<00:02:04.920> supply<00:02:05.280> store<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.790> they<00:02:05.880> didn't<00:02:06.180> go

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
the art supply store and they didn't go

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.449 
the art supply store and they didn't go
to<00:02:07.039> the<00:02:08.039> place<00:02:08.310> across<00:02:10.009> utrecht<00:02:11.009> they<00:02:11.280> didn't

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
to the place across utrecht they didn't

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.860 
to the place across utrecht they didn't
go<00:02:11.580> there<00:02:11.760> there<00:02:11.910> was<00:02:12.030> no<00:02:12.150> such<00:02:12.360> place<00:02:12.599> like

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
go there there was no such place like

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.820 
go there there was no such place like
that<00:02:12.900> they<00:02:13.170> made<00:02:13.349> their<00:02:13.500> own

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
that they made their own

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.190 
that they made their own
brushes<00:02:14.550> they<00:02:14.790> made<00:02:15.060> their<00:02:15.270> own<00:02:15.300> pens<00:02:15.780> then

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
brushes they made their own pens then

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.380 
brushes they made their own pens then
they<00:02:16.350> made<00:02:16.500> their<00:02:16.680> own<00:02:16.710> ink<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.430> so

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
they made their own ink and so

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.290
