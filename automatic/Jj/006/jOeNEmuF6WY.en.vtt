00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.010
 flour 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.250
 now we add a pinch of salt and 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.399
 add the icing sugar if that 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:06.539
 we do everything together we mix the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:13.409
 we all practice in the middle of the pile 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:16.170
 a hole inside let 's put the egg in it 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.069
 we begin to incorporate it at the base of the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.069
 little sky 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.980
 for this point on the edges we add 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.980
 the pieces of butter 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.750
 no 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.830
 for half a packet of yeast 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:20.670
 we begin to work the sector in a way 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:25.040
 to form a loaf but change with the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:31.530
 hands we try to work the dough 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:34.459
 quickly and with our dough that 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.459
 is taking shape 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.370
 now that we have our nice cake e 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.830
 let's split into two parts 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:52.590
 you see a part and a bigger one more 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:54.989
 small of the smallest stick 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.080
 we attach to incorporate the cocoa into 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.080
 powder 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.650
 here is how you see we have two doughs one 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:15.390
 white and one with cocoa and now we tend 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:18.150
 to merge I recommend you don't have to 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.970
 knead it so much otherwise it will come soon 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.970
 so the past is the least varied 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:34.880
 here you see it must come more or less like this 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.880
 and now with the dough we make totolo 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.709
 after created only about 30 long 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.769
 centimeters 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.780
 we go to wrap the film and it 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.070
 we refrigerate to rest for 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.670

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:54.000
