00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
this here but it's also integrated with

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.810 
this here but it's also integrated with
this<00:00:30.330> top<00:00:30.689> piece<00:00:31.189> so<00:00:32.189> when<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.430> go<00:00:32.550> through

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
and try and pull us out you gotta

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.250 
and try and pull us out you gotta
basically<00:00:35.790> kind<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.059> force<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.960> slide

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
basically kind of force this the slide

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.680 
basically kind of force this the slide
out<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:38.040> but<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.850> also<00:00:38.969> got<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.210> pop<00:00:39.480> all

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
out here but you also got to pop all

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.610 
out here but you also got to pop all
this<00:00:39.899> off<00:00:40.140> across<00:00:40.530> there<00:00:41.040> at<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.790> same<00:00:42.000> time

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
this off across there at the same time

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.410 
this off across there at the same time
slide<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.829> out<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.520> then<00:00:45.149> do<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> same

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
slide that out and then do the same

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.990 
slide that out and then do the same
thing<00:00:45.840> on<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.050> other<00:00:46.079> side<00:00:46.520> to<00:00:47.520> get<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.820> off

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
thing on the other side to get it off

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.830 
thing on the other side to get it off
and<00:00:48.390> as<00:00:48.629> you'll<00:00:48.899> see<00:00:49.260> here<00:00:50.449> it's<00:00:51.449> got<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> little

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
and as you'll see here it's got a little

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.729 
and as you'll see here it's got a little
bit<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.140> bevel<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.219> can<00:00:53.280> actually

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
bit of a bevel on it so it can actually

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.740 
bit of a bevel on it so it can actually
fit<00:00:56.390> into<00:00:57.390> their<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.469> sub<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.480> the<00:01:00.480> same

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
fit into their like sub and the same

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.560 
fit into their like sub and the same
thing<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:02.070> way<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.609> designed<00:01:02.760> here<00:01:03.390> is

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
thing the way this is designed here is

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.410 
thing the way this is designed here is
how<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:03.989> bottom<00:01:04.470> piece<00:01:04.760> here<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.790> designed

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
how this bottom piece here is designed

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.190 
how this bottom piece here is designed
integrate<00:01:06.930> into<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:08.210> so<00:01:09.210> just<00:01:09.750> say<00:01:09.990> no<00:01:10.140> if

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
integrate into this so just say no if

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.660 
integrate into this so just say no if
you<00:01:10.260> ever<00:01:10.380> try<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.680> pull<00:01:10.979> one<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.220> these<00:01:11.280> off

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
you ever try and pull one of these off

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.660 
you ever try and pull one of these off
you<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.750> pull<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.520> on

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
you have to pull this up and that and on

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.160 
you have to pull this up and that and on
some<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.090> models<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.780> actually<00:01:16.140> a

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
some of the models this is actually a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.780 
some of the models this is actually a
separate<00:01:16.530> piece<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.159> comes<00:01:17.400> off<00:01:17.549> all

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
separate piece it just comes off all

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.990 
separate piece it just comes off all
together<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.450> then<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.140> work<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.500> this

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
together and then you can work on this

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.560 
together and then you can work on this
other<00:01:21.000> top<00:01:21.540> part<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> button<00:01:22.170> part<00:01:22.409> separate

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
other top part the button part separate

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.219 
other top part the button part separate
them<00:01:25.520> I've<00:01:26.520> got<00:01:26.850> probably<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.540> stupidest

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
them I've got probably the stupidest

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.630 
them I've got probably the stupidest
thing<00:01:28.470> I've<00:01:28.710> seen<00:01:29.100> ever<00:01:29.850> if<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.960> kind<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.640> lift

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
thing I've seen ever if I kind of lift

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.420 
thing I've seen ever if I kind of lift
this<00:01:32.880> up<00:01:33.150> here<00:01:34.220> this<00:01:35.220> one<00:01:35.790> connector<00:01:36.689> here

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
this up here this one connector here

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.340 
this up here this one connector here
this<00:01:38.430> actually<00:01:38.700> slides<00:01:39.299> out<00:01:39.600> see<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:39.990> get<00:01:40.259> my

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
this actually slides out see I get my

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.730 
this actually slides out see I get my
kind<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.680> screwdriver<00:01:41.130> right<00:01:41.369> there<00:01:41.729> that's

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
kind of screwdriver right there that's

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.980 
kind of screwdriver right there that's
basically<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> separator<00:01:44.399> between<00:01:44.990> this

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
basically the separator between this

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.440 
basically the separator between this
connector<00:01:46.500> holds<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.970> connector

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
connector holds it in the connector

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.170 
connector holds it in the connector
itself<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.829> course<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.399> cable<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.030> see

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
itself and of course the cable you see

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.280 
itself and of course the cable you see
that<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> grey<00:01:51.689> cable<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.860> problem<00:01:53.460> here<00:01:54.290> see

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
that a grey cable the problem here see

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.410 
that a grey cable the problem here see
that<00:01:55.470> little<00:01:55.590> metal<00:01:55.770> thing<00:01:56.130> right<00:01:57.030> under<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
that little metal thing right under the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.990 
that little metal thing right under the
screwdriver<00:01:57.960> tip<00:01:58.229> that's<00:01:59.130> completely<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.880> the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
screwdriver tip that's completely in the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.289 
screwdriver tip that's completely in the
way<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.680> can't<00:02:01.680> get<00:02:01.890> any<00:02:02.040> four<00:02:02.430> sips<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:02.969> here<00:02:03.180> to

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
way I can't get any four sips in here to

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.700 
way I can't get any four sips in here to
actually<00:02:03.540> grab<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> hold<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.290> slide

but<00:02:12.280> on<00:02:12.400> top<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.819> you<00:02:13.030> got<00:02:13.150> that<00:02:13.300> actual

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
but on top of that you got that actual

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.660 
but on top of that you got that actual
connector<00:02:14.080> in<00:02:14.200> there<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:15.130> there's<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.370> high

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
connector in there so there's a high

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.430 
connector in there so there's a high
chance<00:02:15.700> this<00:02:16.330> thing<00:02:16.390> can<00:02:16.750> actually<00:02:17.050> break

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
chance this thing can actually break

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.740 
chance this thing can actually break

this<00:02:22.870> out<00:02:23.349> I<00:02:23.680> mean<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.040> could<00:02:24.130> try<00:02:24.780> no

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
this out I mean you could try no

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.979 
this out I mean you could try no
wiggling<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.440> or<00:02:26.590> something<00:02:26.920> like<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.069> but<00:02:27.550> I

wiggling it or something like that but I

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.780 
wiggling it or something like that but I
mean<00:02:28.989> that<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.380> just<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.739> stupidest<00:02:30.550> thing

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
into this connector and I had to take

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.949 
into this connector and I had to take
apart<00:03:00.280> another<00:03:00.610> one<00:03:00.790> under<00:03:01.000> warranty<00:03:01.690> and

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
go ahead and just break the connector

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.860 
go ahead and just break the connector
anyway<00:03:05.920> so<00:03:06.849> they<00:03:06.970> could<00:03:07.150> go<00:03:07.269> through<00:03:07.660> and

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
anyway so they could go through and

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.630 
anyway so they could go through and

the<00:03:22.359> first<00:03:22.690> one<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.019> do<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.260> because<00:03:23.970> that's

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
the first one to do that because that's

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.550

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
like that and sure enough we had like

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.819 
like that and sure enough we had like
two<00:03:28.720> or<00:03:28.870> three<00:03:28.900> more<00:03:29.200> like<00:03:29.380> that<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:29.680> they

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
two or three more like that and they

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.729 
two or three more like that and they
kept<00:03:30.069> telling<00:03:30.280> me<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.549> go<00:03:30.700> through<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:32.560> this<00:03:32.709> is

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
kept telling me to go through so this is

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.949 
kept telling me to go through so this is
why<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.040> don't<00:03:33.220> recommend<00:03:33.790> toshibas<00:03:34.450> at<00:03:34.690> all

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959

why I don't recommend toshibas at all
anymore<00:03:35.230> they<00:03:35.500> used<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.769> be<00:03:35.859> a<00:03:35.890> good<00:03:36.130> brand<00:03:36.370> but

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
anymore they used to be a good brand but

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.920 
anymore they used to be a good brand but
stupid<00:03:37.720> things<00:03:37.959> like<00:03:38.140> this<00:03:38.859> here<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:39.930> that

there<00:03:42.630> it's<00:03:43.630> just<00:03:43.780> beyond<00:03:44.200> me<00:03:44.350> what<00:03:45.069> they're

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
there it's just beyond me what they're

another<00:04:01.000> wire<00:04:01.420> attached<00:04:01.930> to<00:04:02.290> their<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:02.920> of

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
another wire attached to their and of

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.349 
another wire attached to their and of
course<00:04:04.060> this<00:04:04.299> is<00:04:04.510> a<00:04:04.540> two<00:04:05.109> wire<00:04:05.500> connector<00:04:06.329> so<00:04:07.329> I

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
course this is a two wire connector so I

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.479 
course this is a two wire connector so I
took<00:04:07.600> a<00:04:07.870> chance<00:04:08.019> so<00:04:08.650> that<00:04:08.920> this<00:04:09.160> thing

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
took a chance so that this thing

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.150 
took a chance so that this thing
probably<00:04:10.030> is<00:04:10.600> not<00:04:10.810> soldered<00:04:11.200> to<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.560> board<00:04:11.680> or

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
probably is not soldered to the board or

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.729 
probably is not soldered to the board or
has<00:04:12.310> any<00:04:12.519> connectors<00:04:12.970> under<00:04:13.389> it<00:04:13.540> so<00:04:14.380> i<00:04:14.410> just

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
has any connectors under it so i just

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.219 
has any connectors under it so i just
took<00:04:14.859> my<00:04:15.069> screwdriver<00:04:15.790> pride<00:04:16.269> it<00:04:16.570> up<00:04:16.750> and

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
took my screwdriver pride it up and

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.810 
took my screwdriver pride it up and
short<00:04:17.859> enough<00:04:18.039> it<00:04:18.190> was<00:04:18.310> just<00:04:18.489> glued<00:04:19.269> be<00:04:20.169> a<00:04:20.200> heat

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
short enough it was just glued be a heat

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.820 
short enough it was just glued be a heat
onto<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:22.120> board

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
onto the board

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.149 
onto the board
and<00:04:24.389> then<00:04:25.389> I<00:04:25.419> had<00:04:25.629> to<00:04:25.900> take<00:04:26.110> my<00:04:26.349> forceps<00:04:27.039> and

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:27.159 
and then I had to take my forceps and

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:31.350 
and then I had to take my forceps and
very<00:04:27.370> easily<00:04:27.699> pull<00:04:28.270> this<00:04:28.479> out<00:04:28.780> and<00:04:29.110> then<00:04:30.360> have

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
very easily pull this out and then have

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.469 
very easily pull this out and then have
to<00:04:31.509> somehow<00:04:31.720> get<00:04:31.990> that<00:04:32.310> reconnected<00:04:33.310> I'm<00:04:34.240> done

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
to somehow get that reconnected I'm done

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.330 
to somehow get that reconnected I'm done
with<00:04:34.659> it<00:04:34.840> but<00:04:35.050> that's<00:04:35.319> how<00:04:35.620> this<00:04:36.129> one<00:04:36.310> works

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
with it but that's how this one works

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.170 
with it but that's how this one works
you<00:04:36.729> basically<00:04:37.000> lift<00:04:37.300> it<00:04:37.449> up<00:04:37.539> pull<00:04:38.439> that<00:04:38.620> out

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
you basically lift it up pull that out

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.249 
you basically lift it up pull that out
that's<00:04:40.180> one<00:04:40.360> of<00:04:40.449> things<00:04:40.509> with<00:04:40.810> working<00:04:41.139> on

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
that's one of things with working on

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.260 
that's one of things with working on
laptops<00:04:41.800> you<00:04:42.009> never<00:04:42.520> really<00:04:42.879> know<00:04:43.030> what<00:04:43.150> you

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
laptops you never really know what you

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.899 
laptops you never really know what you
want<00:04:43.300> to<00:04:43.539> get<00:04:43.719> and<00:04:43.930> as<00:04:44.199> you<00:04:44.349> can<00:04:44.469> see<00:04:44.500> a<00:04:45.129> little

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:45.909 
want to get and as you can see a little

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:48.839 
want to get and as you can see a little
bit<00:04:46.120> melted<00:04:46.509> damage<00:04:47.169> there<00:04:47.580> because<00:04:48.580> this

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
bit melted damage there because this

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:52.980 
bit melted damage there because this
thing<00:04:49.150> literary<00:04:49.930> was<00:04:50.199> melting<00:04:50.770> in<00:04:50.919> place<00:04:51.990> I'm

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
thing literary was melting in place I'm

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.230 
thing literary was melting in place I'm
very<00:04:53.050> concerned<00:04:53.860> about<00:04:54.159> all<00:04:54.430> these<00:04:54.550> toshibas

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.550 

continuing<00:04:58.240> my<00:04:58.360> little<00:04:58.629> rant<00:04:58.870> there's<00:04:59.169> also<00:04:59.379> a

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
continuing my little rant there's also a

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.580 
continuing my little rant there's also a
certain<00:04:59.979> level<00:05:00.159> of<00:05:00.340> quality<00:05:01.090> that<00:05:01.210> goes<00:05:01.990> into

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
certain level of quality that goes into

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.990 
certain level of quality that goes into
building<00:05:03.039> a<00:05:03.340> system<00:05:03.610> and<00:05:05.340> you<00:05:06.340> can<00:05:06.550> tell<00:05:06.759> some

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
building a system and you can tell some

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.420 
building a system and you can tell some
of<00:05:07.090> that<00:05:07.210> quality<00:05:07.539> that<00:05:07.840> care<00:05:08.440> all<00:05:08.860> that<00:05:09.069> stuff

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
of that quality that care all that stuff

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.589 
of that quality that care all that stuff

this<00:05:43.960> portion<00:05:44.620> off<00:05:44.940> and<00:05:45.940> for<00:05:46.270> some<00:05:46.569> unknown

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
this portion off and for some unknown

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.790 
this portion off and for some unknown
reason<00:05:47.129> the<00:05:48.129> technician<00:05:48.879> that<00:05:49.060> put<00:05:49.389> this

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
reason the technician that put this

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.779 
reason the technician that put this
computer<00:05:50.800> together<00:05:51.960> didn't<00:05:52.960> and<00:05:53.919> I<00:05:54.610> don't

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
computer together didn't and I don't

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:56.579 
computer together didn't and I don't
think<00:05:54.969> it's<00:05:55.180> because<00:05:55.360> this<00:05:55.750> sticker<00:05:56.050> is<00:05:56.319> hard

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:56.589 
think it's because this sticker is hard

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:59.550 
think it's because this sticker is hard
to<00:05:56.740> get<00:05:56.919> off<00:05:57.210> or<00:05:58.210> who<00:05:58.779> knows<00:05:58.810> it<00:05:59.110> could<00:05:59.139> be<00:05:59.379> he

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
to get off or who knows it could be he

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.379 
to get off or who knows it could be he
might<00:05:59.680> just<00:05:59.860> been<00:06:00.039> that<00:06:00.190> lazy<00:06:00.460> that<00:06:01.029> he<00:06:01.089> just

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
might just been that lazy that he just

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.119 
might just been that lazy that he just
didn't<00:06:01.569> want<00:06:01.690> to<00:06:01.750> go<00:06:01.870> through<00:06:02.199> and<00:06:02.409> peel<00:06:02.949> this

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:03.129 
didn't want to go through and peel this

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.089 
didn't want to go through and peel this
little<00:06:03.460> bit<00:06:03.610> off<00:06:03.819> but<00:06:04.810> I<00:06:04.900> mean<00:06:05.169> that's<00:06:05.800> the<00:06:06.009> way

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
little bit off but I mean that's the way

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.809 
little bit off but I mean that's the way
it's<00:06:06.219> supposed<00:06:06.250> to<00:06:06.639> look<00:06:06.879> and<00:06:08.250> this<00:06:09.250> piece<00:06:09.550> is

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:09.819 
it's supposed to look and this piece is

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:13.350 
it's supposed to look and this piece is
extra<00:06:10.779> and<00:06:11.339> it<00:06:12.339> just<00:06:12.550> goes<00:06:12.699> to<00:06:12.909> show<00:06:12.969> you<00:06:13.180> like
