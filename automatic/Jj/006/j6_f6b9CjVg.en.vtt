00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.370
 that is, marvels today I want to show you 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.570
 how is it possible to take care of 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.059
 own hair 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.090
 especially if they are maybe a little dry 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.670
 off like doing the mask 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.649
 really easy to do because 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.980
 you just need to open the fridge e 

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:24.899
 open the pantry and you really are a 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.509
 place 

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:30.610
 it is a very simple mask once 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.219
 once done, you can apply immediately 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.370
 I tell you right away that it should be applied to 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:39.040
 dry hair held in pose let's say 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.200
 about three quarters of an hour at most 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.620
 you don't really need that much 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.280
 time 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.560
 then proceed with the usual washing 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.160
 as you are used to you will see that i 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.460
 hair will be nourished more 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.790
 obviously illuminated even more hydrated 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.520
 thanks to the natural properties of things 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.579
 that maybe we have at home and not there 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.799
 expect that by combining they could 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.990
 give us these results and instead this 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:12.159
 Video I want you to see how what 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.470
 we need oil 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.310
 extra virgin olive oil or 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.729
 olive 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:22.810
 then we need honey of any kind 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:27.520
 you will obviously notice these then 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:30.850
 cocoa powder preferably 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.670
 bitter maybe not used I don't know the 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.369
 nesquik here is this here 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.159
 dell'esselunga also in this case the 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.170
 mark the price anything else not 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.299
 it matters 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.430
 the same applies to the last one 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.100
 ingredient as you see the ingredients 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.210
 they are really few, they are only 4 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:56.590
 the last ingredient is yogurt 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.330
 whole white do you realize that anyway the 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.430
 recipe that we are going to do is not 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.789
 something we then have to insert 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.500
 so you can be absolutely low 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.539
 both with the price and in short with the 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.390
 product quality the important thing is that 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:13.110
 that those are the products that 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.430
 use nothing in this case 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.590
 in short, I recommend replacement of 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.330
 use all four ingredients 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.250
 I think in short it is not a problem 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.470
 for anyone to find them 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.130
 I'll show you how to do it 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.100
 I've already told you everything about the times 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.480
 if you have any questions to ask 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.390
 sign up below 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.489
 I tell you already in advance that this 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.830
 mask year risk neither of harvey color 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.500
 hair or dark veils as you can 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.230
 see the red hair now but 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.750
 do not become me that disconnects in Greek e 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.730
 they do n't even darken me though 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.380
 you are blond or you are not 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.510
 more you can still use it 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.959
 quietly because the purpose is that 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.970
 to moisturize your hair and go to 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.829
 enlighten them nothing else does not 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.019
 nothing else this mask then 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.120
 go absolutely quiet one 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.220
 time our station ready 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.340
 first thing to do is add the 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.049
 Our yogurt there will serve you 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.720
 account for my length of hair 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:18.989
 then set yourself up with yours 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.989
 but for me it takes 4 tablespoons of yogurt 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.370
 once done that 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:32.140
 we give our bitter cocoa and ne 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.140
 add two tablespoons 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.000
 at this point we add a spoon 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.000
 of honey 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:52.860
 and we begin to mix a little 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:56.080
 at first it seems that it never thickens 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.070
 because cocoa takes a while but 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.760
 continuing to mix you will see that 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.760
 will become a pap 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.580
 as you can see the pap 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.920
 would be 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.640
 already ready so at this point there is 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:24.040
 remains that add a teaspoon of 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.800
 olive oil or extra virgin olive oil from 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.680
 olive small trick if you have a 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.690
 problem already of greasy hair in this 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.210
 in case you avoid this step e 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.600
 stop only at the first three 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.600
 ingredients 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.100
 at this point obviously we do not stay 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.250
 that mix everything for one last 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.250
 time 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.790
 at this point our mother 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.680
 but nutritious and enlightening is not ready 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.780
 all you have to do is apply it 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.480
 so I hope this video is there 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.240
 liked let me know if you try it me 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.100
 I recommend try it because you really do 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.230
 very simple and you will notice the difference 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.810
 that is, the first wash, at least I 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.990
 already after the first application I have it 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.880
 noticed so much so I hope that 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.040
