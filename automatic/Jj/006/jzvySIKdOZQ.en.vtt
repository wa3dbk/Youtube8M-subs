00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.710
 today we will talk about bites in this 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.290
 video I'll show you the pictures probably 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.590
 high-quality photograph bites it was 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.690
 very serious bite 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:20.279
 my fill the wrists by the hand 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.260
 before show photos I want 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.670
 warn not so nice 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.670
 so if you are on such things 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.009
 susceptible it's better not to watch 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.350
 before showing i want to tell how 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.180
 It turned out in the first tag 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:42.780
 stage lizards us from the laity and this is a predator 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.480
 predator he catches he kills and that's quite 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.850
 Naturally his tent nature this 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.699
 predator like many reptiles 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:56.610
 he is prone to getting scared but right now I am very 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.460
 easy to scare as well as my tag 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.469
 mostly pet and except 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.510
 my terrarium and my room more 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.850
 does not feel life is not seen even when 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.710
 he looks through the window looks out sometimes 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.549
 He has already filled up the window sill when this was 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.119
 opportunity he was very surprised watched 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.770
 on passing by by people and often he 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.409
 just ran off the windowsill frightened 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.200
 This is why the face for him is something 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.880
 such as for a man she fly to 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.790
 space 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.520
 unexplored and once having seen enough I 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.750
 videos 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.729
 foreign bloggers who are also 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.119
 contain tag I 've seen some 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.460
 take them out there lizards there 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.040
 kayaba walk picking at the ground in the grass 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.670
 and so on well, and I decided for a long time without thinking 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.259
 do the same thing this towers was 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.270
 the ultimate big mistake because 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.070
 the moment from that mountain was two or three years 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:56.909
 and accustom him to the street as if too late 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.290
 but took i bought a leash tied up brought 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.720
 pangolin lizard on the street 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:06.110
 holding his leash began lizards 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.360
 he was calm brought him out in front of his house 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.570
 I live in a private house next door 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.710
 there was not so small on the lawn with 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:18.620
 grass here brought him there but next to 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.820
 home was the track is not mattresses often 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.800
 drove large wagons 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.790
 I do not know why they didnâ€™t come exactly 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.950
 our road to you but still the noise and 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.380
 they created a huge vibration 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.070
 Definitely a shake probably in another 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.490
 times when the odds in documents 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.810
 noticed saw much frightened and dioramas 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.100
 but I accordingly since he was 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.470
 tied grabbed this one over the leash 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.470
 stopped him and still continued 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.010
 break I realized that was about it, and 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.170
 I will miss 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.300
 and there were garages nearby 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.160
 barn if released then hardly beats 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.140
 found him later 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.660
 well, you know, I can let it go, I took it 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.910
 grabbed and got it turned out now 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.880
 I grabbed him by the base of the tail and have 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.610
 lizards there is such a thing 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.370
 funny and even if the base grabs the tail 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.800
 of the tail they immediately associate it with 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.110
 the fact that there is enough predator therefore not 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.660
 trying hard to break out biting 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.360
 fight back well and accordingly 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.340
 respond appropriately well 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.070
 the first reaction was what he discovered 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.590
 the mouth began to swing it and the very first 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.540
 hit him in the mouth is my hand of tone and 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.860
 grabbed 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.970
 that's the way it happened then on 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.670
 the street no longer take out 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.670
 but you are watching a photo 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.620
 as you can see not the most pleasant sight to me 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.739
 the same day I had to turn to 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.840
 the surgeon then I drank a week 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.170
 antibiotics just in case all the same 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.840
 animals home but God knows 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:59.010
 It turned out here such here sooner but later 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:03.239
 somewhere for two months, we have a lo 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:07.019
 such a scar is also an unpleasant sight to 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.939
 so far i still have but principle 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.829
 I got off easy because the bite 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:15.540
 adult because he is serious enough 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:18.539
 so that you yourself look at his teeth, yes 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.870
 here is a photo of such teeth 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.729
 when they grab they are calculated so 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.580
 way if you will break out you still 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:29.300
 get hurt more and your teeth are very sharp 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.340
 they cut the flesh on like a blade probably 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.680
 so even if even if if you 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.650
 reptile enough let's say by the hand or by 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.600
 finger never pull out just 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.060
 neatly yes it hurts to be patient 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.740
 grab it with two fingers pointing 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:49.800
 and thumb up squeeze it in 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.530
 this moment the poster will weaken will open and its 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.530
 after that you can 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.240
 break free from his teeth otherwise 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.840
 case you will break out even more 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.070
 hurt yourself 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.020
 and in the end it will heal for a long time therefore 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.820
 always have to remember 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.620
 whatever animals even with 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.729
 it will be a kitty and a doggie so me 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.139
 need to understand that 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:15.449
 animals and teeth especially cat if she 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:19.620
 homework go outside she is he too he 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:23.340
 eyes scratch roughly speaking here 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:26.690
 fear street so just be alert and 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.770
 especially when handling reptiles 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.560
 who likes videos necessarily 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:37.340
 leave comments and it will be possible 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.340
 more topics for video that's all
