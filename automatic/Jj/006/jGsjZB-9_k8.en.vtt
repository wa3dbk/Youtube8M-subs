00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:18.750
 the audio slot mode in bag 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.150
 It is also used for devices 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.100
 audio 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.690
 the battery is a circuit card 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.130
 printed to which the 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.960
 components that make up the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.670
 computer or computer 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.100
 is a fundamental part when it comes to 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.200
 put together a portable desktop pc 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.370
 has a series of circuits installed 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.320
 integrated between 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.720
 which are the circuit 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.840
 integrated auxiliary that serves as a center 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.900
 connection between the microprocessor 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.900

 electronic components or peripherals 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.289
 of a machine to communicate with the 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.289
 operating system that 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.940
 the expansion is an element of the plate 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.010
 base of a computer that allows 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.400
 connect an additional card to it 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.569
 of expansion which usually performs 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.050
 device control functions 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:23.450
 additional peripherals 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.450
 monitors printers disk drives 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.370
 the tx that kind of connector to the source 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.820
 of feeding which is from 20 to 24 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.220
 pins contacts that allow a single 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:39.090
 way to connect and avoid mistakes like 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.150
 with the sources and another with the so-called p4 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.560
 of four commands 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.240
 collection please 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.190
 northern bridge was the integrated circuit 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.410
 most important chip set 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.090
 which constitutes the heart of the plate 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.670
 base 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.220
 which controls the access functions and 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.270
 up to microprocessor acp and pci express 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.130
 ram and disintegrated memory and about its 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.410
 main function is to control the 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.140
 processor bus operation and 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.690
 the memory and porto gp or pci express 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.490
 in that way it serves as a connection between the 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.980
 motherboard and the main 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.770

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.300
 the south bridge is an integrated circuit 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.100
 which is responsible for coordinating the 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.110
 different input devices and 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.510
 output and some other functionalities 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.420
 low speed inside the plate 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.030
 base of the south bridge is not connected to 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.220
 the central processing unit but 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.540
 who communicates with her indirectly 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.540
 through the north bridge 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.790
 this is one of the first devices 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.840
 in updating to turn on the 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.999
 computer 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.639
 even before the video therefore 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:58.139
 allows the user to communicate errors that 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.569
 may occur via different 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:02.430
 types of beeps 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.959
 this is controlled by the bios by 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.329
 barron's high 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.110
 the code of beeps depends on each 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.730
 motherboard 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.340
 fm os is a technology for 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.349
 construction of integrated circuits 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.680
 the technology peed is used in 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.209
 microprocessor microcontrollers 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.840
 static and other logic circuits 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.840
 digital 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.920
 you in Spanish that architecture 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.170
 industry standard 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:38.130
 is a bus architecture created by 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:42.080

 be an employee of ibm pc 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.930
 the serial ata sata is an interface of 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.460
 data transfer between the board 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.710
 base and some devices of 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.110
 storage such as the disk 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.050
 hard readers and rewrite is to decide 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.700
 you should see solid state drives u 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.480
 other high performance devices 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.730
 that are still being developed 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:09.260
 serial ata things replaces the 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:11.750
 traditional paw paw leg provides 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.640
 higher speeds improves better 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.470
 use when there are several 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.720
 units longer cable length 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.730
 data transfer and capacity for 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.460
 connect units instantly 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.040
 that is to say insert the device without 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.890
 have to turn off the computer 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.790
 even if it short-circuits like the 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.790
 old molex 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:38.270
 ata opa is originally known 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.010
 as idb 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.020
 interface for connecting 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.580
 mass storage devices 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.849
 data 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:51.629
 the optical units that the

 standard derived from layer to layer 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.160
 this is an electronic device 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.230
 semiconductor that fulfills functions of 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.750
 amplifier oscillator switch 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:05.820
 rectifier the puppy the term 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.820
 transistors the contraction of English 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.680
 the trainers can be blue 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.510
 black or red and blue or black are 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.400
 so that the suit of electric power 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.890
 against noise coming from the network 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.129
 electrical and one of these will miss what 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:25.289
 most likely your pc 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:27.869
 but it could fail at any time 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:29.839
 given that by not being protected by these 

00:06:27.869 --> 00:06:33.509
 centers an electrical noise could be 

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:35.930
 interpreted as a logical bit 110 and 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:39.500
 cause a system failure 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:41.630
 the red trainers can 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.460
 or they are filters that fulfill a 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:49.100
 similar function can be a time 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:51.650
 controller since next to 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.139
 has the ability to ozil to generate 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.939
 frequency 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:59.490
 these were some of the main 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:59.490
 parts that constitute a mother card
