00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.639
 this program has been made possible in part 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.639
 by zlm insurance 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.610
 from the open parade hanzeland to the 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.320
 Limburg hills 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.150
 wind makes way for sun and bee 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.970
 There is still a good mood on the wagner 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.680
 always the leader of the Ster ZLM Toer and 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.630
 all that in his hinterland 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.400
 Rob Ruijgh she already has the scribble 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.590
 Vacansoleil today for another 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.970
 trumps in mind than watching today 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.280
 the card 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.410
 kenny van hummel can play because 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.820
 you are still gambling on a mass sprint 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.220
 yes ultimately so it of course 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.410
 what the limburg hills but we 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.659
 also see it in the end in the 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.280
 the final is quite flat and I have 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.360
 here are four teams that will make you one 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.360
 want a sprint 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.559
 the first climb is on the menu 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.940
 the third stage 188 kilometers with start and 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.650
 finish in curves 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.989
 the first hills await the journey 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.339
 with the cauberg the camerich the gulperberg 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.470
 and the Eyserbosweg 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.420
 the 1st victims will therefore go 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.850
 are already the last kilometers then 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.500
 completely flat again 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.810
 some 7 from the grip of the pack 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.880
 and head of ronan van zandbeek from appearance 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.619
 from the rich formation 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.329
 Jane Makati Reinier tried honey 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.509
 various lampair 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:24.729
 adriaan kurassiers pink and luc hagenaars 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.979
 they chase a lone soldier and what 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.689
 emperor from the vacansoleil team the 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.429
 complete that yesterday 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.850
 was invisible and so I am something 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.850
 criminal work 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:39.210
 the peloton has a maximum of and minutes 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.210
 long way does not seem to worry 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.299
 and so may sean paul van poppel 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.859
 Martijn Keizer is currently satisfied 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.170
 it is admittedly made up for by the 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:50.380
 7 but he is rewarded with the 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.030
 mountain jersey the hills are good 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.740
 is slowly being digested 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.869
 spins thought and then he succeeds 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.609
 finally mar kevin this last year 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.780
 betty beat every stage and also 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:00.780
 it didn't work yesterday 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.859
 the eight time lost to the 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.170
 to form trains and then it becomes 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:10.450
 again theo forest or crawl praise cavendish 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.040

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.840
 the German good for mass boilers 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.840

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.340

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.850
 someone else so yes 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.500

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.080
 looking for the game i pregnant 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.260

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.320
 to win 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.210
 the German also immediately takes a yellow 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.250
 over six line up in the rankings 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.110
