 my last purchase show you 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.730

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.889

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.920
 all sorts of new cool stuff in 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.869
 stores so let's get started right away 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.970
 I have been using the site for a long time, I know that 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.689
 many boys i am friends with 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.060
 order 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.730
 from this site and the boys usually don't 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.710
 doing chopin and the internet so here 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.529
 what a cool site i bought there is 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.969
 the dress that v-rox chose 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.829
 This is from England bats and I am very 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.489
 liked that we are in this prince and decided 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.930
 go buy 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.059
 I'm just sure that I will wear it 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.910
 very often it must be leaves 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.820
 palm trees and but does not look a little bit like not 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.329
 palm leaves but shorter yes i remember that 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.070
 when 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.020
 denim shirts began to go out in 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.670
 shops they were always very expensive 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.199
 and because of that I didnâ€™t buy them, so I 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.690
 went to a store bought and for three 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.430
 dollar to school and never wore 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.559
 because she just didn't like me 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.989
 affects these denim shirts it's not 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.939
 just the trend is just really cool 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.640
 the thing you need to have in the wardrobe I 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.220
 I think so I went to topshop and I 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.500
 bought in the men's department because i don't 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.400
 I know, but I liked it and this is what I 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.110
 I was looking for in the women's department and it was not her 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.000
 you can dress like a board or you can 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.729
 wear like a sweater or throw on 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.350
 some kind of cool bath or just 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.119
 the usual shirt her outfit will be 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.119
 cool especially cool if you wear 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.979
 such a black skirt with this beat 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.170
 little shirt it looks awesome yet 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.909
 if we're talking about classics, I went to 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.460
 America on 1 and in America on 1 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.140
 very very classic things that 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.630
 qualitatively if you something about me 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.030
 you know this is what this color is gray 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.009
 this is my favorite color in the world here 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.960
 these are your question I do not know how many of them 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.000
 me because i'm not enough of them 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.619
 never because i can wear them with 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.210
 every outfit just 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.799
 and not passing away, I think that this color 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.659
 i just bought a classic 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.790
 gray shirt because i have 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.189
 could their shirts and prints there any 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.200
 words are written well, just so ordinary 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.579
 I did not have a shirt for a long time 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.259
 time was looking just like that black 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.209
 skirt that can be worn with each 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.240
 outfit and I went in at the moment 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.100
 tension 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.510
 myth dress tights or not easy 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.550
 summer is children with bare legs then on 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.920
 Aysa I ordered several things there 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.900
 This little shirt is just perfect. 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.910
 she looks just with roses i think that 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.890
 she really suits me this color i think my 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.870
 second favorite i really like white 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.170
 the color does not really like such a gray color 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.240
 and such a dirty pink color so here 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.490
 awesome shirt i really start 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.310
 she is very comfortable and so soft 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.010
 I also ordered this decoration and blueberries 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.430
 and because I have such a decoration 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.530
 white color 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.810
 I thought that white is not quite an idiot so 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.320
 that nadym black is also the last one i 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.390
 ordered 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.460
 individual these were these earrings that 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.310
 on me now and i think that the coolest 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.010
 stitches I've ever seen in my 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.810
 life they just stunned cool 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.370
 cool i think that if someone took away 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.280
 your earrings they will just watch 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.050
 on them 10 minutes without stopping because 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.910
 they are so cool in america was 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.760
 a store called marshal 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.200
 eat came to canada all american 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.020
 store and are already starting to open 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.060
 wear canada i very much i adore 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.980
 American stores and us more 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.730
 of course it spoils us Canadian 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.220
 savings 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.830
 juicy couture and perfume in small size 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.440
 called sour vinci throughout they are very 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.960
 summer of course we do not have much now 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.760
 I don't know about summer 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.830
 they come in handy i really like smell 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.550
 very tasty in my opinion I bought it for 12 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.910
 dollars later 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:40.240
 from the shop cheek ago I ordered two things 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.370
 first such denim jacket which 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.110
 very cool she reminds me like that 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.970
 I don't like old-fashioned style 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.010
 buy winter jackets and all this because 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.320
 what is this England do not want to buy 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.690
 declare what cool things for years 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.290
 but because summer is my season I love 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.270
 diva in color and in the winter on threw him and 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.050
 went on the street and last things bought 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.990
 such leggings that are all paired these 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.550
 all the kardashian sisters they have these 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.470
 leggings that they always wear 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.209
 and they I always start here if they 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.190
 really wanted and finally found on it 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.580
 I think that in these forests 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.410
 you may be misunderstood but they are to me 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.230
 really wanted to wear very well not with 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.670
 very long 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.800
 with a long shirt I think they 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.690
 will be normal and finally the last 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:27.320
 thing i will show you today at rome 2 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.380
 the store and I'm such a bitch is not a handbag 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.750
 This is a skirt and she ordered a Christmas tree 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.970
 this leather I really like it 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.000
 quality is not bad, I thought that quality 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.560
 will be bad well ok i just don't 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.020
 I know how it strokes because she 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.660
 a little battered but it's not real 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.390
 skin is something that I do not know how I can 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.670
 pat well shorter and I also ordered 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.530
 so seed purple and you already know 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.210
 I love this purple color well 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.640
 now i had dark hair because 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.760
 that a month ago I got highlights 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.670
 new and i just spoiled them all 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.340
 hair they became white and looked very 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.230
 very unnatural so I went a couple 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.130
 days ago and asked them to fix mine 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.590
 terrible highlights 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.810
 so they put toner but hair and 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.670
 I now have hair after someone 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.100
 natural are you there about the neutrality of hair 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.570
 although a little bit of the highlight is so 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.910
 now I don't think that such a color is to me 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.280
 very much going he goes more to blondes than 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.860
 true thread and well, he just is with eggs 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.600
 there is cool because I do n't like it in 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.110
 my videos outfits their ideas 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.910
 I showed you such a huge cardigan 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.010
 Red I ordered because I saw 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.130
 one photo medic is victoria 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:40.030
 secret model and she wore a sweater 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.590
 red jump outfit and just me 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.250
 pulled something on a red sweater and I im 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.280
 bought and 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.090
 but I really liked have not ordered 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.130
 Here is a sweater 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.190
 if you still do not understand, I love very much 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.600
 sweater my sweater smiles all but me 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.140
 really like her very very very 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.820
 warm and just so much more comfortable by whom 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.950
 not very much eternal salvation 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.660
 insanely beautiful but unfortunately me I 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.250
 disappointed it when i order 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.960
 I never have a blood clot 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.200
 that i don't like the quality i think that 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.210
 for this price the quality is good enough 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.100
 decent and I every day our thing about 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.930
 language his throne chala not shown here it is 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.910
 dress on facebook and said we will be soon 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.830
 sell and here every day I was looking and 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.180
 I think damn when they will this dress 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.930
 sell it because it 's just me 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.520
 madly 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.740
 I liked it but unfortunately when I would 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.660
 I got the quality is not very 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.460
 Liked was one layer under this 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.710
 a dress that I cut but because 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.840
 just was terrified and because they need 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.190
 somehow fix it pays me just 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.300
 very sad because this dress 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.580
 gorgeous 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.500
 I see I know how this dress can be 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.590
 fix but unfortunately for some reason they 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.600
 didn't make this dress nice i don't know 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.270
 why I think it's worth buying this party 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.150
 if you know how to hem a dress like 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:53.030
 simple you have a fantasy just him 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.740
 Unfortunately, it is impossible to buy clothes 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.570
 what is all my last purchases now 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:00.590
