00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.150 
wood that the reason is called ply wood
is<00:03:16.220> that<00:03:16.940> if<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.209> take<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:18.160> cross-sectional

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
is that if you take a cross-sectional

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.430 
is that if you take a cross-sectional
look<00:03:19.639> at<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:20.290> ply<00:03:21.290> wood<00:03:21.799> you<00:03:22.609> would<00:03:22.819> find

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
look at a ply wood you would find

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.509 
look at a ply wood you would find
different<00:03:24.440> layers<00:03:25.190> of<00:03:25.760> wood<00:03:26.440> those<00:03:27.440> layers<00:03:28.040> of

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
different layers of wood those layers of

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.979 
different layers of wood those layers of
wood<00:03:28.940> are<00:03:29.359> called<00:03:29.810> price<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:31.810> because<00:03:32.810> you

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
wood are called price and because you

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.740 
wood are called price and because you
have<00:03:33.169> several<00:03:33.680> if<00:03:34.639> it's<00:03:34.940> a<00:03:35.030> three-quarter

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
have several if it's a three-quarter

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.170 
have several if it's a three-quarter
plywood<00:03:36.349> you<00:03:36.379> have<00:03:36.680> maybe<00:03:36.919> about<00:03:37.069> seven<00:03:37.910> or

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
plywood you have maybe about seven or

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.759 
plywood you have maybe about seven or
eight<00:03:38.419> plies<00:03:39.319> it<00:03:39.859> is<00:03:40.220> called<00:03:40.489> fly<00:03:41.180> would<00:03:41.930> fly

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
eight plies it is called fly would fly

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.890 
eight plies it is called fly would fly
simply<00:03:43.730> means<00:03:43.940> a<00:03:44.120> layer<00:03:44.949> all<00:03:45.949> right<00:03:46.569> so<00:03:47.569> when

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
simply means a layer all right so when

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.369 
simply means a layer all right so when
God<00:03:48.199> says<00:03:48.709> be<00:03:49.519> fruitful<00:03:50.419> and<00:03:50.629> multiply<00:03:53.379> he's

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
God says be fruitful and multiply he's

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.409 
God says be fruitful and multiply he's
saying<00:03:54.769> add<00:03:55.389> several<00:03:56.389> layers<00:03:57.379> on<00:03:57.889> top<00:03:57.949> of<00:03:58.760> one

00:03:59.409 --> 00:03:59.419 
saying add several layers on top of one

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:09.099 
saying add several layers on top of one
another<00:04:03.310> do<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:04.430> follow<00:04:04.609> that<00:04:05.319> okay<00:04:06.459> so<00:04:08.109> to

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
another do you follow that okay so to

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:14.080 
another do you follow that okay so to
multiply<00:04:10.010> simply<00:04:10.730> is<00:04:10.970> to<00:04:11.299> increase<00:04:12.250> by<00:04:13.250> adding

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
multiply simply is to increase by adding

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.700 
multiply simply is to increase by adding
new<00:04:14.540> layers<00:04:14.620> upon<00:04:15.620> what<00:04:16.370> you<00:04:16.729> have<00:04:16.940> done

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:20.710 

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.980 

when<00:04:21.710> you<00:04:21.920> are<00:04:22.070> truthful<00:04:22.460> you<00:04:23.120> have<00:04:23.300> laid<00:04:23.630> a

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
when you are truthful you have laid a

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.750 
when you are truthful you have laid a
layer<00:04:24.560> of<00:04:25.690> activity<00:04:26.690> but<00:04:27.680> you<00:04:27.830> must<00:04:28.040> continue

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
layer of activity but you must continue

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.550 
layer of activity but you must continue
adding<00:04:29.350> layer<00:04:30.370> upon<00:04:31.370> layer<00:04:31.430> upon<00:04:32.240> layer<00:04:32.810> upon

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
adding layer upon layer upon layer upon

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.690 
adding layer upon layer upon layer upon
layer<00:04:34.180> so<00:04:35.180> you<00:04:35.240> have<00:04:35.600> height<00:04:36.140> you<00:04:37.010> have<00:04:37.190> depth

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
layer so you have height you have depth

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:44.470 
layer so you have height you have depth
and<00:04:38.120> you<00:04:38.750> have<00:04:38.930> strength<00:04:42.910> just<00:04:43.910> because

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
and you have strength just because

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.100 
and you have strength just because
something<00:04:44.870> has<00:04:45.590> been<00:04:46.070> fruitful<00:04:46.940> does<00:04:47.780> not

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
something has been fruitful does not

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.900 
something has been fruitful does not
mean<00:04:48.380> it<00:04:48.680> is<00:04:48.790> multi-layered<00:04:49.790> a<00:04:51.790> lot<00:04:52.790> of

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
mean it is multi-layered a lot of

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.260 
mean it is multi-layered a lot of
fruitfulness<00:04:53.390> is<00:04:53.720> one<00:04:54.560> layer<00:04:54.890> of<00:04:55.270> activity

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
fruitfulness is one layer of activity

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.590 
fruitfulness is one layer of activity
but<00:04:56.900> there<00:04:57.110> are<00:04:57.290> not<00:04:57.620> several<00:04:58.430> layers<00:04:59.090> and<00:04:59.480> I'm

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
but there are not several layers and I'm

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.230 
but there are not several layers and I'm
going<00:04:59.810> to<00:04:59.870> show<00:04:59.930> you<00:05:00.170> how<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:01.340> process<00:05:01.880> works

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
going to show you how the process works

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.770 
going to show you how the process works
now<00:05:02.810> I<00:05:03.580> don't<00:05:04.580> know<00:05:04.940> about<00:05:05.000> you<00:05:05.330> but<00:05:05.360> when<00:05:05.570> I

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
now I don't know about you but when I

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.860 
now I don't know about you but when I
went<00:05:06.080> to<00:05:06.410> school<00:05:06.650> I<00:05:07.130> lent<00:05:08.060> what<00:05:08.330> was<00:05:08.510> called<00:05:08.720> a

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
went to school I lent what was called a

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:15.460 
went to school I lent what was called a
times<00:05:09.370> table<00:05:12.130> did<00:05:13.130> anybody<00:05:13.370> learn<00:05:13.730> that<00:05:14.470> times

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
times table did anybody learn that times

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.100 
times table did anybody learn that times
table<00:05:16.400> you<00:05:16.490> don't<00:05:16.730> learn<00:05:16.940> it<00:05:17.150> you<00:05:17.180> memorize<00:05:17.810> it

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
table you don't learn it you memorize it

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:25.030 
table you don't learn it you memorize it
and<00:05:19.690> you'll<00:05:20.690> and<00:05:22.390> 212<00:05:23.590> now<00:05:24.590> that<00:05:24.890> is

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
and you'll and 212 now that is

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.300 
and you'll and 212 now that is
multiplication<00:05:25.760> we<00:05:26.210> say<00:05:26.420> one<00:05:27.080> layer<00:05:27.470> of<00:05:27.890> 2

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
multiplication we say one layer of 2

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.340 
multiplication we say one layer of 2
equals<00:05:29.320> 2<00:05:30.880> but<00:05:31.880> when<00:05:32.060> you<00:05:32.210> put<00:05:32.480> another<00:05:33.020> layer

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
equals 2 but when you put another layer

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.450 
equals 2 but when you put another layer
on<00:05:33.710> top<00:05:33.800> of<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:34.400> two<00:05:34.670> you<00:05:35.270> have<00:05:35.570> four<00:05:36.350> and<00:05:36.650> if

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
on top of the two you have four and if

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.270 
on top of the two you have four and if
you<00:05:37.580> put<00:05:37.820> another<00:05:38.240> layer<00:05:38.600> on<00:05:38.960> top<00:05:39.050> of<00:05:39.620> that<00:05:40.010> and

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
you put another layer on top of that and

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.210 
you put another layer on top of that and
you<00:05:40.820> have<00:05:40.940> three<00:05:41.270> layers<00:05:41.510> of<00:05:41.840> two<00:05:42.080> it<00:05:42.380> is<00:05:42.830> equal

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
you have three layers of two it is equal

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.210 
you have three layers of two it is equal
to<00:05:43.520> six<00:05:44.800> so<00:05:45.800> multiplication<00:05:46.750> basically<00:05:47.750> is

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
to six so multiplication basically is

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.250 
to six so multiplication basically is
putting<00:05:49.220> the<00:05:49.400> same<00:05:49.790> layer<00:05:50.330> of<00:05:50.690> were<00:05:51.050> of

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
putting the same layer of were of

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.240 
putting the same layer of were of
numbers<00:05:51.770> on<00:05:51.980> top<00:05:52.610> of<00:05:52.820> the<00:05:53.300> other<00:05:53.420> and<00:05:54.100> that<00:05:55.100> is

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
numbers on top of the other and that is

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.910 
numbers on top of the other and that is
how<00:05:55.460> you<00:05:56.290> multi<00:05:57.290> I<00:05:58.120> you<00:05:59.120> add<00:05:59.360> layer<00:05:59.930> upon<00:06:00.860> layer

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:00.920 
how you multi I you add layer upon layer

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.290 
how you multi I you add layer upon layer
upon<00:06:01.700> layer<00:06:02.680> that's<00:06:03.680> God's<00:06:04.010> principle<00:06:04.640> be

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
upon layer that's God's principle be

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.750 
upon layer that's God's principle be
fruitful<00:06:06.140> and<00:06:07.750> multi
