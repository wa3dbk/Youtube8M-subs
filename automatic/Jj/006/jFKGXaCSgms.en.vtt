 our tactical guide and tips for 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.290
 improve warfare mode 3 is worth and today what 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.990
 what I bring you is a guide 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.460
 a tad not very enlarged how to catch 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.310
 the spam 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.870
 in general, it's not just not just in a 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.790
 map but in general in all it is worth if 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:25.240
 you want later I'll make map or map 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:28.240
 okay, we started this little one this 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.160
 little tactical guide come the first 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.460
 thing you should know is that spam 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.110
 each map varies according to the game mode 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.720
 the one you 're playing is not worth the 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.330
 same the dom the one that is used in domain 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.130
 which is used in launch areas or the 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.320
 which is used in any other mode of 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.260
 game is worth now they will explain 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.579
 a bit how would it be in domain and zone 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.020
 of launch is very summary 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.700
 pretty summarized 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.190
 in this case I will give you the example of 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.450
 where it's worth we start good since you 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.130
 I put the example worth from a 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.840
 launch as you can see in the red part 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.310
 you just lost is the area 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.140
 launch where is the goal where 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.210
 which in the packages is worth 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.700
 then the green area that you just finished 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.920
 see appear is your spawn as you see 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.360
 it is very marked very delimited usually 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.880
 always be unless someone 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.560
 interrupt erp although in this change it 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.840
 would change in this case would be changed 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.540
 forgiveness is usually very marked is worth 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.030
 those for those guidelines and just opposite 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.490
 ok to the opposite side is the spa a 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.100
 orange that would be the enemy worth usually 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.720
 to be are quite pounds that do not 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.790
 be reappear and have two in front 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.040
 ok are usually spawn that you find 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.180
 in front a medium distance is worth now 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.450
 I will give you another example of this 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.550
 same launch zone is worth now you are 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.490
 seeing the red zone appear 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.080
 I wanted another launch area ok that 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.539
 would be closer to the area where 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.690
 would be the flag of ao the area should 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:52.080
 search and destroy vale 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.730
 in this area the spa an ally that 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.470
 let's put it in green does not matter is for 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.360
 an enemy ally is worth once you can 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.870
 touch you here another one in the other area gives 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.360
 you are ally green would be marked 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.330
 within the faith zone and near the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.060
 cars and tank worth that would be more or 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.820
 less are you still the employee and you're a 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.190
 enemy would develop near the 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.950
 area of ​​the boxes or in the area of the 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.010
 building must be worth everything it looks 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.690
 marked very well that does not stop appearing 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.540
 in those places then to catch the 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.720
 spam and do fitz you know if you know 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.210
 where are the stands you only have 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.240
 to play to learn the ones there 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:36.960
 are the chips is a matter of waiting 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.410
 Okay we pass to domain mode in 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.990
 another map 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.110
 good and now what you can see in a 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.030
 screen is the buttler map with the 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.700
 Three flags of domains designated as 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.470
 a red cuadradito map is not worth you 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.070
 I leave a few moments so that if I twist in 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.070
 the map is worth 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.580
 imagine that we have two flags of 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.300
 burlesque taken in this case would be to 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.520
 ive 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.160
 worth as you see here would be to the one of the 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.930
 left and see the middle one that 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.150
 is higher up he also showed towards 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.150
 up more on the top then 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.310
 how can you observe normally when 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.540
 you play domain to catch the spam well 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.340
 that if you have played with teams 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.530
 that are usually colleagues and that therefore 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.700
 usually they usually catch ybocy 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:27.090
 b and leaving them there are only 12 to the enemy 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.980
 to go into your spam better ose 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.189
 enter to take well the spam of 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.250
 of that flag because they are caught if you catch 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:36.810
 I did and you let see the enemy is going to be 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.180
 much more complicated to take the 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.000
 Spam since it's wider it's usually more 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.739
 broad in ve or you can reappear from 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.170
 so that it is easier for them to take the 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.269
 flag of aice so what do you 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.879
 they would remove one of the two flags and 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.319
 you could not take the spam worth in the case 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.989
 to have these two flags on the map 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.639
 the bootleg as you can see the lower area 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.189
 from the right of the bottom corner 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:02.129
 right would be the flag that has 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:05.159
 taken the enemy is worth about this 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:08.069
 flag could be observed spam worth 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:10.099
 that depending on the map is one or the other 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.760
 I 've told you before to learn them 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.520
 you mainly have to play 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.530
 give a couple of hours to each map 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.720
 with what you play enough to the world in 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.160
 warfare because at the end you will finish 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.770
 understanding a little where they will be 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.240
 the points answer each map and well you 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.910
 I'm going to say a little bit what the 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.430
 done taking spam to this 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.220
 to the enemy team according to the flag 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.440
 of cee vale 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.800
 It's worth right now you'll be seeing 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.500
 appear on the screen three squares of 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.450
 orange color is worth that in this case 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.920
 would be the spawn areas in the way 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.440
 of feval in case you two 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.650
 you your team had both 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.240
 flags there sees the enemy team and 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.030
 those three points would reappear 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.770
 major spawn unless good 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.360
 that one of your team enters 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.090
 of your cee flag anywhere 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.130
 of those spaces that I have and marked and 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.480
 in that case and change the spam by 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.820
 complete and you could not catch what's worth 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.710
 but well those are three spam points 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.210
 main map puzzle with 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.630
 c flag 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.009
 How good is that it's a matter of knowing 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.280
 take them 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:18.110
 mark with an X in the areas from 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.479
 where you could catch each spawn vale 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.000
 but it's a matter of throwing hours 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:25.550
 to each map and you already know how to play 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.280
 play practice and finally 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.060
 you will end up knowing how to take spam 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.199
 perfectly on any map worth 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:35.539
 Well since those 3 x is worth one of 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:38.000
 they will be in the part where the 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:40.340
 awning is valid from there then you can take 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.400
 the smallest square the most spam 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.680
 broad in the way of doing another part 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.960
 it would be the corridor the center hall 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.270
 it's worth from there you could take both 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.340
 the square I put a broad as 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.080
 the smallest of all and from the 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.539
 road because you could take the casita 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.690
 the house that is farthest from the 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.949
 way of cee is worth nothing this is a 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.449
 small tutorial that I have done to you 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:04.009
 you so that you learn to take the 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:07.370
 spam is worth knowing that you change 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:08.840
 distinguished according to the map changes according to the 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.009
 flags change according to the game mode 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.710
 they change according to how you are 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:16.779
 and two for the map everything is worth it is matter 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.059
 to take hours and practice and you know 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:20.740
 If you have any idea, well, what 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:23.309
 leave in a comments like favorites 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.599
 subscribed if it has served you and you already know 

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:29.819
