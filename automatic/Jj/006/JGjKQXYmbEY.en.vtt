00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.189 
people liked it I thought they would and
not<00:00:45.940> that<00:00:46.120> many<00:00:46.300> people<00:00:46.420> entered<00:00:46.989> as<00:00:47.109> I

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
not that many people entered as I

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.529 
not that many people entered as I
thought<00:00:47.410> they<00:00:47.620> would<00:00:47.649> so<00:00:48.100> but<00:00:48.940> which<00:00:49.149> makes<00:00:49.359> it

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
thought they would so but which makes it

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.689 
thought they would so but which makes it
easier<00:00:49.929> to<00:00:49.989> wonder<00:00:50.589> I<00:00:50.800> guess<00:00:51.010> then<00:00:51.250> right<00:00:51.460> does

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
easier to wonder I guess then right does
