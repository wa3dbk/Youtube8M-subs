00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.359
 aggression is sick 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:12.569
 the train station some time prisoner 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:14.639
 but then the car 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.369
 still a corpse in another place 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.369
 installs them in a particular position 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.070
 the 5 2 million dance 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.410
 the first in the second the victims were not abused 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.569
 sex 

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:42.569
 so this is not a maniac the molecule 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.380
 among the cats what does he think of this case I think everything is wrong 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.280
 from my experience i would rather say that the murderer a behavior 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.010
 border-line, that is to say they evolve on the border between 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.080
 neurosis and psychosis 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.080
 I present a model jersey of the service of criminal psychology 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.380
 it's the kind of person that active personality 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.880
 they must be between 30 and 40 years old and if you know that you must also have 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.610
 information on his way of living 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.560
 he committed the martens during the night 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.720
 which means he is obliged to work at regular intervals 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.650
 during the day he is subject to some control maybe in the 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.980
 part of his work 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.010
 he is single or divorced and a healthy life alone 2 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.910
 the mayor bernard l 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.910
 if you 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.200
 who has a stain on your shirt 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.910
 who painted again 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.270
 your doctor told me that at the moment you country and especially our house 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.720
 yes of course because that's where I grew up and who puts a lot of blacks 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 I have a lot of bad luck 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.460
 the individual in an environment that is familiar to him 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.210
 the right to do something to do with this place 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.030
 it's weird that he's also joked 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.170
 or he wants to attract attention 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.919
 not serious I note 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.009
 scared schulze 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:13.159
 antiquities 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:15.769
 but where are you going 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.090
 ok I'll take care of it right now dirtyh since this is a 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.819
 ball in heavier 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.980
 so everything suggests that the killer is used an ancient weapon 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:31.639
 but we 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:33.299
 Hello 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.659
 Hello 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.659
 I was told that you sell very young leaders 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.549
 this man committed two murders in a very short time 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.599
 in clear he can not stop 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:50.539
 all parts 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:53.019
 xenia we did not care about his peers 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.350
 I'm a mother and it was not my musical style at all 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.680
 it's no wonder right now newspapers only talk about them 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.680
 killings of shana yes you know that only mark one point 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.399
