00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.080
 My name is Sandra Suarez from the team 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.630
 of work how to lose weight easily 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.600
 in this video I want to share with you 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.540
 the most effective aerobic machines 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.430
 to burn fat the heat is already noticeable and 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.919
 that's why exercise lovers 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.140
 outdoor aerobic many times 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.240
 they are forced to stop practicing this 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.440
 type of activity because of the high 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.350
 temperatures 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.710
 for this we usually resort to doing it 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.480
 inside for those cases in this 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.910
 video we want to highlight those 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.980
 most effective devices when it comes to 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.950
 do away with the fats that accumulate in 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.020
 the organism aerobic exercise is a 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.270
 good ally to eliminate fats 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.910
 but many times what we are not 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.130
 So sure is what kind of exercise 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.860
 will serve us more to get these 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.769
 objectives therefore it is necessary to have 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.229
 some basic notions about it and if 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.750
 we also mix this type of exercise 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.520
 with the anaerobic the result will be the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.250
 best possible 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.109
 the rowing machine first 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.390
 let's stop at one of the 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:21.479
 Aerobic machines more effective than 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.149
 there is the rowing machine almost never 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.429
 we have it and we must do it more 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.740
 often since it will bring us a 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.810
 complete aerobic activity since in 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.569
 she will intervene in inferior train and the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.520
 superior without forgetting the core that 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.579
 will be in tension throughout the 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.860
 exercise is involvement of all 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.259
 the body parts will cause the burning 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.689
 of calories is greater besides working 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.500
 at the same time the muscles that make up 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.079
 These body parts 2 bicycle 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.470
 static secondly we will 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.569
 highlight the static bicycle is true 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.060
 that many people would choose 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.369
 the treadmill but the bicycle 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.409
 Static is a good way to do 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.319
 Aerobic exercise without putting yourself at risk 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.110
 the joints as it can happen 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.209
 with the treadmill this is a 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.040
 exercise that involves the lower train 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.859
 and it allows us to make different 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.050
 routines in a way that is not harmful to the 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:21.480
 organ 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.720
 elliptical as a third option we 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.580
 we will opt for the elliptical is true 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.130
 that the mechanics are the same as 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.170
 we will continue with the treadmill alone 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.380
 that in this case the impact for 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.390
 joints of the legs is null no 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.130
 we must forget that the movement that 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.710
 let's do it is not entirely natural 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.140
 but we will involve the top 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.420
 of the body with what we will increase the 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.440
 burning calories and therefore the 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.720
 Fat loss 4 treadmill on 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.180
 this list we can not forget about the 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.760
 treadmill for many is the 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.070
 star of the aerobic machines and 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.630
 to a certain extent it is only that the 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.460
 impact it will have on the 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.430
 joints is greater than 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.800
 previous despite all the movement 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.440
 it's much more natural and with it 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.270
 we will burn calories and melt 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.180
 the fat that accumulates in our 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.240
 body if the information that I just
