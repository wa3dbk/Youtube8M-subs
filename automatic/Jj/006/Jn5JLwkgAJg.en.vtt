 point 4.2 which is of robots that changes the 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:18.939
 stopped the skeletons of the clipper of 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:22.060
 lenderman of all those changes like 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:24.770

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:29.000
 grabbing a tnt 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:33.930

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.740
 of the spider 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.770
 it seems 10 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:45.860
 this is the same 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:49.870

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.870
 these are zombie 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:57.350
 it is very strange this 2010 exists but 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.640
 because it's the body name that we follow 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.640
 in the drinking 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.950
 hell and it looks like a spider is 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.230
 these are 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.930
 internal 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.930
 fernando cotillo 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.820
 I search 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:30.409
 but there is more 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.409
 these tangle of caves 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.120
 terraces 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.120
 new 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.380
 they are going to die 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.000
 they paid 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.380
 is the song 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.380
 and why not for this 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.119
 that thing 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.630
 but these things 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.990
 how 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.330
 and so they will appear as all 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.140
 they 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.770
 Down here 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.250
 With everyone 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:23.340
 this is death I leave a video for you 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.340
 that they see how they are installed and then we are going 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.860
 Well, here we are with the 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.830
 engine installation we need this 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.450
 file of the description of the video and 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.180
 download and nothing happens is that everything 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.220
 to make installation easier and 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.680
 it will be a start producing of spears 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:45.650
 here side says run 5% condition 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.130
 back by 5 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.090
 with your hand 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.090
 next to mike 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.030
 Minecraft 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.750
 and robots like 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.569
 with a little 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.590
 or 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.240
 for the mind folder because when I 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.240
 I think 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.740
 as in all they control 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.740
 one factor escapes 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.970
 best 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.740
 then the wells close these folders 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.900
 and now grabs 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.900
 again and they go love 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.320
 here we are 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.390
 efe 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.250
 this new current stop will not arrive 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:06.200
 two 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:10.730
 the new groove shields 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:13.180
 and its creatures minecraft and that's why 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.180
 these tones 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.729
 good
