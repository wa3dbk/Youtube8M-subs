00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 he took with the mission two cgt to five 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.600
 gas grenades more useful recipe good since 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.179
 you know after leaving the team 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.610
 of box travers we call the extraction 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.679
 in which we already have it and he tells us that 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.170
 there is a rocking hunter that is 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.060
 circulating around the city ​​and we have 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.410
 to be grabbing a few grenades 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.060
 is hanging around the city and goes from 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.269
 northwest to the airport and we have 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.310
 that being fast too well already marked 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.980
 on the radar the trail 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.750
 hz gas grenades bz so let's go 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.270
 fast let's go now any any 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.430
 vehicle of preference you already know a 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.080
 bit fast 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.080
 so as not to waste a lot of time 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.180
 unlike the car or the vehicle 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.370
 when we steal the carbines in the mode 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.860
 used this vehicle was super fast 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.710
 really super super fast this vehicle 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.230
 it's a truck and it's a little bit slower 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.580
 that's the advantage does not go that fast 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.020
 but just as preferably I am a 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.990
 fast vehicle so that the reach is 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.850
 also quickly well we are already in 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.810
 the avenue on the highway in which 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.710
 this truck is coming 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.710
 comes to us so we have to 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.710
 intercept it 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.420
 and I'm going against it but as you see 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.720
 there is so much problem 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.930
 well it's already very close very close too 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.450
 let's do this in half an hour if 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.759
 because it's easy too there's no time no 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.799
 asks for time only asks for one thing that 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.600
 now he is going to heal boy is coming 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.600
 I'm going to stop a little bit later 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:53.220
 to do as a block 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.590
 ok here I'm going to leave this vehicle and 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.230
 now I'm going to grab another vehicle and like 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.110
 I told you seized a weapon a water that 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.330
 It will be very useful to try these 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.270
 good grenades 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.460
 we already have a vehicle ready now 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.030
 let's put this more here in front 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.240
 also from this this cold 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.090
 Ok, It's right 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.740
 and now I'm going behind the field of 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.900
 boxcar and I will activate the skill 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.130
 franklin special and I will shoot in 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.110
 the doors 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.910
 this requirement for 100% you have to 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.060
 shoot until the back doors 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.370
 open up as discounted I'm 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.020
 organizing the time for the car 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.400
 do not move so fast because normally 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.340
 it also advances fast 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.620
 well he opened the doors and now yes 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.870
 let's roll what are the grenades 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.080
 no michael no no no you still do not have 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.120
 that you go in the link well now yes ya 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.930
 we have the grenades and now if we 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.569
 we escape 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.480
 dies in the same vehicle 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.749
 we have a search star but the 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.489
 cops is right behind us and he 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:04.200
 they have activated two stars, you are not 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.030
 look for are activated when you are able to 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.069
 the police or are not very close when 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.689
 she is very close to three layers 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.420
 activate one more star that's why there's already 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:15.299
 two star search finally we have 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.889
 that evade us as three accounts are re 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:21.599
 Jews give anger these pinches cops 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:25.200
 but well let's do it let's go 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:27.920
 try to escape fast 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.690
 well the important thing is that the circle the 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.220
 red already disappear that would be the most 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.069
 important because we are very very 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.129
 visible well we have already separated and we do not 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.890
 they have removed and they have taken our sight 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:42.210
 again good already disappeared again 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.850
 and now what we have to do 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:48.090
 it is simply not to come across the 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.069
 polis and just no longer in front so I'm going 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.370
 to escape here because there is a 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.590
 rise because we go ahead 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.800
 right and arribita I will go up here 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:03.640
 and I will try to go to the santones 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.110
 customs or near there so that I do not 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.120
 reach the procredit poly is a 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.960
 a little bit away but they can still 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.390
 capture truth 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.900
 I'm going to get in the alley cited in 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.900
 that alley 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:21.130
 and we 're done and we've lost the cops 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.610
 Now we have to go to the factory 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.300
 textile for 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.729
 leave 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.710
 the gas grenades that are going to be very 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.630
 tools 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:37.670
 for the assault of the jewelry 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:40.340
 it's not useful as you already know bats well 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.070
 as you realize the only thing the only 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.830
 problem is the police those are the 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.350
 unique and only impediment that we have 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.700
 to go for the mission although it's 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.380
 impossible for me is relatively easy 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.660
 because you have to be simply 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.970
 shoot at the rear doors for 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.510
 that these are opened and in this way 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:02.470
 vote or throw the bombs for the 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.470
 gas grenades 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.030
 but that you do have to use the bible 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:09.539
 franklin's special we lose the 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:13.700
 Michael's ability to be 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:16.070
 the time while you shoot yes 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.540
 well then now we go to 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.540
 good factory is easy 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:30.889
 with that we would already be concluding the 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.889
 the mini missions that lester asks us 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:35.509
 for preparations to the assault on jewelry 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:38.539
 in this case they were two in subtle mode 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:41.240
 were two teams needed in the mode 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:43.729
 sado was the only one home 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.909
 carbines anything else if you want to see the 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.960
 flavor mode is the video in the 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:50.509
 description of the video in the excretion 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.499
 this video if you can not also see it in 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:53.499
 the playlist 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:59.220
 well now good here no no no no 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.220
 park any vehicle 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.669
 is in front do not come forward if it is not 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.240
 in the same building the factory is in 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.240
 the same factory 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.710
 the accounts is simple truth is not so 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.750
 complicated good now yes to upload 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:26.740
 is in the briefcase with the grenades of 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:28.660
 gas or the numbing gas and let's leave 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:32.620
 these grenades from this briefcase in the 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:34.780
 estuary office 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.210
 well not the year without doing in the 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:40.300
 contiguous room 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.250
 let's drop the briefcase and 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.289
 we are automatically dialing 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.440
 lester to tell him that we already have the 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:46.440
 team 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:57.480
 well and everything is ready for the others 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.480
 seven videos from across
