 Translated by the CG Portal website: http://kg-portal.ru/ 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.820
 From the studio, in passing rewriting the definition of the word "trilogy". 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.180
 "Hunger Games", which you have not seen: 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.660
 Without a trace of the Hunger Games. 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.920
 “Hunger Games: Mockingbird. Part 1" 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.420
 If you thought that in the middle of a short book there would not be enough plot for a two-hour film ... 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.300
 You. 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.080
 Were 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.960
 Are right. 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.900
 Get ready for a slow preparation for the end, which you will see only by paying for the next movie. 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.440
 Almost like in the last part. 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.140
 Behold tons of obvious ways to take time out: 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.380
 Reiteration. 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.480
 President Snow? 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.340
 President Snow, this is Katniss. 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.560
 President Snow, I need to talk to you. 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.800
 Are you online? 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.080
 President Snow, this is Katniss. 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.380
 Do you hear me? 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.120
 President Snow, this is Katniss. 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.800
 President Snow. 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.060
 President Snow. 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.860
 The guy whose only role is to lead Katniss to the next scene. 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.860
 First, President Coyne wants to talk to you. 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.060
 Command calls. 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.960
 Here. 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.960
 Here, soldier. 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.680
 Let's go. 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.520
 Come after me. 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.980
 And just the sea, tons ... nothing. 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.540
 And-and-and ... filmed! 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.760
 After past games, the capital begins to shoot everyone. 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.060
 And Katniss, who got the chance to stop the genocide, will do everything possible ... 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.680
 ... not to do that. 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.520
 Katniss! 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.900
 Don't make me do it! 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.680
 And constantly whining about your fake TV boyfriend. 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.140
 Togo, whom she did not think until he gave her a ball. 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.140
 What about pete? Is he alive 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.380
 You left Pete! 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.160
 Pete had to survive! 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.920
 In fact, now things are going more important Pete. 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.380
 Even if we win: what happens to Pete? 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.980
 Pete and other "volunteers" will be saved at the first opportunity. 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.220
 Pete said the same thing when you called him a traitor. 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.820
 Please stop whining about Pete! 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.120
 He will kill Pete! 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.840
 He torments Pete to torment me! 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.160
 He will kill Pete! 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.100
 Katniss, are you there? 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.940
 Pete! 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.820
 This revolution concerns everyone. 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.480
 Then it was necessary to save Pete! 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.120
 Good luck to you movie, the whole essence of which sounds like: "Two parties are shooting agitation, blackening the enemy." 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.060
 And Pete, meanwhile, appears on TV in various shameful costumes. 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.280
 And Katniss plays the role of Mocking Jay ... 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.760
 The fascination in which no more than in real film production. 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.800
 Residents Panema! We fight, we dare, we ... 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.780
 Do you know your text? 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.720
 Yes, yes, I know, sorry. 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.980
 She just warms up. 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.060
 OK OK. 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.060
 You will be distracted by the sight of one of the best sets of supporting actors ... 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.580
 Spend on this plotless underfilm. 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.620
 The main handsome movie shake for the sake of this zombie nedoroslya. 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.000
 Understand, I'm not gay. 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.400
 But you'd better kiss him ... 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.240
 Or with this? 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.000
 And one of the most talented young actresses ... 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.480
 Wasted on the role, consisting of an old-fashioned jacket and two hours of crying face. 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.820
 Don't worry, Keith, just a little bit. 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.540
 Starring: 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.780
 Pete Vorcher 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.060
 For Jacob 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.000
 50 shades of grey 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.900
 Elizabeth banks so pays the bills 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.200
 Woody Harrelson in the role of himself 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.500
 Scrilex 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.120
 And None of us have seen your boobs 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.720
 I certainly did not see ... 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.960
 A friend threw a link to me, but I like this: “Dude! ..” 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.840
 "Not cool!" 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.840
 "It is not good to invade privacy!" 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.300
 "I will manage, thank you" 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.140
 "Because ... not cool" 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.460
 “Where is Pete. Part 1" 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.280
 The capital just bombed the hospital! 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.160
 With unarmed people, women and children! 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.640
 No, not bombed. 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.200
 Did you try, forget? 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.740
 Well done, Hawk Eye. 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.940
 Do not forget to subscribe if you want more "Fair Trailers"! 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.740
 I was, and always will be, your friend. 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.680
 The needs of the majority are more important than the needs of the minority. Or one. 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.640
 Solar eclipse. Space ballet continues. 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.920
 Of all the souls I have met during my travels, he was the most ... humane. 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.400
 Live long and prosper.
