00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
think about that yeah I threw the first

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.689 
think about that yeah I threw the first
one<00:00:46.589> and<00:00:46.620> then<00:00:46.800> needed<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.190> take<00:00:47.339> a<00:00:47.400> large<00:00:47.640> step

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
one and then needed to take a large step

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.360 
one and then needed to take a large step
to<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> left<00:00:48.710> this<00:00:49.710> ball<00:00:49.949> is<00:00:49.980> definitely

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
to the left this ball is definitely

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.439 
to the left this ball is definitely
going<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.550> give<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.730> something<00:00:50.909> different<00:00:51.360> in

going to give you something different in

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.910 
going to give you something different in
the<00:00:51.510> HP<00:00:51.870> for<00:00:52.050> line<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.290> think<00:00:52.589> it's<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> most

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
the HP for line I think it's the most

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.700 
the HP for line I think it's the most
versatile<00:00:53.399> ball<00:00:53.640> yeah<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.629> hybrid<00:00:55.530> cover

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
versatile ball yeah the hybrid cover

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.560 
versatile ball yeah the hybrid cover
stock<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.190> definitely<00:00:56.640> gets<00:00:57.120> down<00:00:57.269> the<00:00:57.390> lane<00:00:57.539> a

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
stock is definitely gets down the lane a

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.450 
stock is definitely gets down the lane a
bit<00:00:57.840> better<00:00:58.019> than<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.379> hyper<00:00:59.160> cell<00:00:59.489> and<00:01:00.440> Wow

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
bit better than the hyper cell and Wow

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.520 
bit better than the hyper cell and Wow
sideways<00:01:02.460> down<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> lane<00:01:03.019> yeah<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.350> mean<00:01:04.470> it's

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
sideways down the lane yeah I mean it's

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.200 
sideways down the lane yeah I mean it's
one<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.890> those<00:01:04.979> things<00:01:05.039> that<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.550> know<00:01:05.850> having

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
one of those things that you know having

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.029 
one of those things that you know having
that<00:01:06.360> core<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.899> that<00:01:06.990> cover<00:01:07.229> combination<00:01:07.800> and

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:08.039 
that core and that cover combination and

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:09.710 
that core and that cover combination and
laser<00:01:08.280> said<00:01:08.580> as<00:01:08.759> you<00:01:08.880> kept<00:01:09.119> moving<00:01:09.509> and<00:01:09.630> moving

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
laser said as you kept moving and moving

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.630 
laser said as you kept moving and moving
and<00:01:10.200> there's<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.770> lot<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:10.950> times<00:01:11.190> when<00:01:11.399> we<00:01:11.490> get

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
and there's a lot of times when we get

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.940 
and there's a lot of times when we get
these<00:01:11.789> asymmetric<00:01:12.720> cores<00:01:12.899> that<00:01:13.050> he<00:01:13.619> kind<00:01:13.860> of

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
these asymmetric cores that he kind of

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.040 
these asymmetric cores that he kind of
reached<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.280> kind<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.729> tipping<00:01:15.090> point<00:01:15.119> but

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
reached that kind of a tipping point but

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.300 
reached that kind of a tipping point but
dude<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:16.380> kept<00:01:16.619> chasing<00:01:16.830> after<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
dude you just kept chasing after and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.499 
dude you just kept chasing after and
they<00:01:17.369> kept<00:01:17.580> coming<00:01:17.700> back<00:01:17.850> around<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.210> corner

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
they kept coming back around the corner

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.139 
they kept coming back around the corner
yeah<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.259> mean<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.979> got<00:01:20.340> pretty<00:01:20.520> far<00:01:20.700> left<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
yeah I mean we got pretty far left and

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:22.399 
yeah I mean we got pretty far left and
it<00:01:21.240> was<00:01:21.330> still<00:01:21.509> making<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:21.899> move<00:01:22.050> really

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
it was still making the move really

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.139 
it was still making the move really
nicely<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.159> think<00:01:23.759> he'll<00:01:23.880> give<00:01:24.060> you

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
nicely so I think he'll give you

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:25.730 
nicely so I think he'll give you
definitely<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.690> more<00:01:24.869> versatile<00:01:25.320> piece<00:01:25.560> that

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
definitely a more versatile piece that

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.930 
definitely a more versatile piece that
you<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:25.890> use<00:01:26.039> on<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.190> few<00:01:26.429> more<00:01:26.520> different

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
you can use on a few more different

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.540 
you can use on a few more different
angles<00:01:27.300> and<00:01:27.450> conditions<00:01:28.099> when<00:01:29.099> you<00:01:29.220> think<00:01:29.429> H

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
angles and conditions when you think H

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.210 
angles and conditions when you think H
before<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.910> want<00:01:30.209> you<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.360> think<00:01:30.450> one<00:01:30.780> thing

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
before I want you to think one thing

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.350 
before I want you to think one thing
dynamic<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.399> that's<00:01:32.729> exactly<00:01:32.910> what<00:01:33.270> we

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
dynamic and that's exactly what we

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.540 
dynamic and that's exactly what we
deliver<00:01:33.509> with<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.929> new<00:01:34.080> cage<00:01:34.319> core<00:01:34.619> dynamics

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
deliver with the new cage core dynamics

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.309 
deliver with the new cage core dynamics
like<00:01:35.640> you've<00:01:35.789> never<00:01:35.880> seen<00:01:36.209> this<00:01:36.899> ball<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.289> off

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
like you've never seen this ball is off

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.830 
like you've never seen this ball is off
