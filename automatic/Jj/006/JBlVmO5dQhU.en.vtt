but it came out pretty good and let's
head<00:00:07.440> on<00:00:07.529> inside<00:00:07.710> now<00:00:08.040> so<00:00:09.000> basically<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:09.990> have

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
head on inside now so basically you have

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.830 
head on inside now so basically you have
three<00:00:10.530> bays<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.070> each<00:00:12.030> one<00:00:12.240> holds<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.540> single

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
three bays and each one holds a single

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.950 
three bays and each one holds a single
mine<00:00:13.019> cart<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.940> the<00:00:14.940> way<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.179> departs<00:00:15.750> is

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
mine cart and the way it departs is

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.660 
mine cart and the way it departs is
you'd<00:00:16.170> hop<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.770> press<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.070> button<00:00:17.369> these

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
you'd hop in and press the button these

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.450 
you'd hop in and press the button these
are<00:00:17.820> departure<00:00:18.270> only<00:00:18.630> there's<00:00:18.900> an<00:00:18.990> incoming

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
are departure only there's an incoming

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.450 
are departure only there's an incoming
over<00:00:20.460> there<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.140> how<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.260> launches<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> you

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
over there and how it launches is a you

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.070 
over there and how it launches is a you
press<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.820> button<00:00:23.850> like<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.210> said<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.750> it

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
press the button like I said and it

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.960 
press the button like I said and it
pulls<00:00:25.320> back<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.680> stone<00:00:25.890> slab<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.460> real<00:00:26.640> pop

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
pulls back to stone slab and a real pop

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.359 
pulls back to stone slab and a real pop
up<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.390> monitor<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.779> can<00:00:27.930> go<00:00:28.050> out<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.380> then

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
up so the monitor I can go out and then

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.220 
up so the monitor I can go out and then
it<00:00:29.460> also<00:00:29.670> flips<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.300> RS<00:00:30.510> nor<00:00:30.689> latch<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.109> it

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
it also flips in RS nor latch so it

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.470 
it also flips in RS nor latch so it
knows<00:00:31.439> there's<00:00:31.740> no<00:00:31.800> mind<00:00:32.250> rugby<00:00:32.610> or<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:32.910> say

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
knows there's no mind rugby or so say

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.790 
knows there's no mind rugby or so say
you<00:00:33.540> took<00:00:33.719> out<00:00:33.899> number<00:00:34.140> three<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.710> would

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
you took out number three it would

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.139 
you took out number three it would
actually<00:00:34.920> return<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.610> number<00:00:35.700> two<00:00:35.969> because

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
actually return it to number two because

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.549 
actually return it to number two because
it<00:00:36.329> returns<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.020> closest<00:00:37.410> one

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
it returns it to the closest one

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.490 
it returns it to the closest one
possible<00:00:38.660> so<00:00:39.660> let's<00:00:39.960> go<00:00:40.110> for<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.379> ride

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
possible so let's go for the ride

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.680 
possible so let's go for the ride
basically<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.489> hop<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:42.000> hit<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.570> button

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
basically just hop in hit the button

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.260 
basically just hop in hit the button
again<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.530> said<00:00:43.730> they<00:00:44.730> never<00:00:44.850> take<00:00:45.090> you

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
again like I said they never take you

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.319 
again like I said they never take you
off<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:46.100> you<00:00:47.100> go<00:00:47.280> up<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.579> your<00:00:47.670> other<00:00:47.760> station

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
off and you go up to your other station

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.940 
off and you go up to your other station
then<00:00:48.510> when<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.899> came<00:00:49.079> back<00:00:49.260> you'd<00:00:49.559> end<00:00:49.710> up<00:00:49.800> on

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
then when it came back you'd end up on

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.750 
then when it came back you'd end up on
this<00:00:50.070> side<00:00:50.840> you'd<00:00:51.840> hop<00:00:52.079> out<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:53.010> then<00:00:53.370> each

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
this side you'd hop out and then each

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.520 
this side you'd hop out and then each
step<00:00:54.000> over<00:00:54.180> those<00:00:54.300> pressure<00:00:54.539> pads<00:00:54.870> which<00:00:55.379> we

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
step over those pressure pads which we

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.920 
step over those pressure pads which we
send<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.829> minecart<00:00:56.190> out<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:57.090> goes<00:00:57.360> down<00:00:57.629> through

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
send a minecart out it goes down through

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.689 
send a minecart out it goes down through
here<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.440> goes<00:00:58.620> around<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:59.160> side<00:00:59.430> because

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
here it goes around this side because

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.250 
here it goes around this side because
this<00:01:00.030> side<00:01:00.239> controls<00:01:00.270> where<00:01:00.989> they're<00:01:01.140> going

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
this side controls where they're going

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.139 
this side controls where they're going
to<00:01:01.320> go<00:01:01.410> back<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.699> knows<00:01:02.879> there's<00:01:03.090> a

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
to go back in if it knows there's a

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.759 
to go back in if it knows there's a
minecart<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.750> there<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.019> will<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.260> facing<00:01:04.500> not

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
minecart in there it will be facing not

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.039 
minecart in there it will be facing not
what<00:01:04.949> if<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.339> doesn't<00:01:05.580> which<00:01:06.299> three<00:01:06.540> no<00:01:06.750> longer

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
what if it doesn't which three no longer

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.700 
what if it doesn't which three no longer
hannah's<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.619> will<00:01:07.710> be<00:01:07.799> facing<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.310> way<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
hannah's it will be facing that way and

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.590 
hannah's it will be facing that way and
the<00:01:10.710> method<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.250> loading<00:01:11.610> them<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.420> have

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
the method for loading them is you have

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.149 
the method for loading them is you have
to<00:01:12.750> come<00:01:12.900> over<00:01:12.960> here<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.439> can't<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:13.770> play

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
to come over here you can't just play

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.770 
to come over here you can't just play
some<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.610> there<00:01:14.880> because<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.479> won't<00:01:15.630> be<00:01:15.689> able

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
some in there because it won't be able

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.590 
some in there because it won't be able
to<00:01:15.869> detect<00:01:16.080> them<00:01:16.580> so<00:01:17.580> if<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.790> do<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.479> can

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
to detect them so if you do that you can

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.640 
to detect them so if you do that you can
come<00:01:18.689> over<00:01:18.810> here<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.080> just<00:01:19.170> wait<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
come over here and just wait in the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.859 
come over here and just wait in the
microchip<00:01:20.220> pop<00:01:20.400> up<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.030> didn't<00:01:24.420> very<00:01:24.689> good

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
microchip pop up and it didn't very good

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.920 
microchip pop up and it didn't very good
and<00:01:25.650> say<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.640> came<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:27.299> from<00:01:27.780> another

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
and say you came in with from another

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.780 
and say you came in with from another
station<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.040> ready<00:01:29.159> had<00:01:29.310> those<00:01:29.490> three

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
station and you ready had those three

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.630 
station and you ready had those three
full<00:01:30.150> what<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.290> does<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.770> instead<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.130> clogging

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
full what it does is instead of clogging

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.719 
full what it does is instead of clogging
up<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.790> railroad<00:01:33.329> system<00:01:34.079> over<00:01:34.740> here<00:01:35.189> outside

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
up the railroad system over here outside

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.999 
up the railroad system over here outside
I<00:01:36.119> actually<00:01:36.900> built<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.380> little<00:01:37.530> overflow

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
I actually built a little overflow

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.249 
I actually built a little overflow
detector<00:01:38.640> world<00:01:38.820> put<00:01:39.090> any<00:01:39.270> leftover<00:01:39.840> montour

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
detector world put any leftover montour

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.420 
detector world put any leftover montour
it's<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.560> way<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.770> don't<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.189> clogged

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
it's that way you don't have a clogged

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.240 
it's that way you don't have a clogged
system<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.810> that's<00:01:43.320> good<00:01:43.560> because<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.100> don't

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
system and that's good because you don't

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.679 
system and that's good because you don't
want<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.579> client<00:01:44.850> system<00:01:45.149> because<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.600> get

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
want to client system because it can get

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.600 
want to client system because it can get
pain<00:01:45.960> no<00:01:46.170> fix<00:01:46.470> everything<00:01:46.710> you'd<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.280> hit

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
pain no fix everything you'd have to hit

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.830 
pain no fix everything you'd have to hit
the<00:01:47.759> buttons<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.090> few<00:01:48.270> times<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.570> get

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
the buttons a few times just get

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.080 
the buttons a few times just get
everything<00:01:49.020> back<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:50.399> yeah<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:51.000> minute

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
everything back in but yeah in a minute

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.330 
everything back in but yeah in a minute
now<00:01:51.270> I'm<00:01:51.540> going<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.780> show<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.960> how<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.140> works

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
now I'm going to show you how it works

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.960 
now I'm going to show you how it works
alright<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.460> now<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.729> we're<00:01:53.850> down

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
alright so now that we're down

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.310 
alright so now that we're down
underneath<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.329> station<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:54.840> can<00:01:54.960> talk<00:01:55.140> about

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
underneath the station we can talk about

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.020 
underneath the station we can talk about
how<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.530> works<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.100> concept<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.700> actually

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
how it works and the concept is actually

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.789 
how it works and the concept is actually
very<00:01:57.060> simple<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.990> just<00:01:58.020> has<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.469> be<00:01:58.500> built

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
very simple it just has to be built

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.880 
very simple it just has to be built
compaq<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.520> can<00:01:59.670> bill<00:01:59.820> me<00:01:59.939> side<00:02:00.180> by<00:02:00.210> side

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
compaq so you can bill me side by side

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.139 
compaq so you can bill me side by side
so<00:02:01.890> let's<00:02:02.100> talk<00:02:02.430> about<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.790> one<00:02:02.969> right<00:02:03.090> here

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
so let's talk about this one right here

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.389 
so let's talk about this one right here
basically<00:02:03.930> say<00:02:04.500> there's<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.770> minecart<00:02:05.219> in

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
basically say there's a minecart in

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.670 
basically say there's a minecart in
there<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:06.450> want<00:02:06.600> hello<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:07.229> press<00:02:07.530> this

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
there and you want hello you press this

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.919 
there and you want hello you press this
button<00:02:07.920> which<00:02:08.369> would<00:02:08.550> send<00:02:08.819> piston<00:02:09.390> down<00:02:09.539> so

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
button which would send piston down so

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.840 
button which would send piston down so
the<00:02:10.020> power<00:02:10.259> would<00:02:10.440> extend<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.099> blanc<00:02:11.400> and

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
the power would extend to this blanc and

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.330 
the power would extend to this blanc and
this<00:02:11.910> blog<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.390> on<00:02:13.260> this<00:02:13.440> side<00:02:13.710> what<00:02:14.070> it<00:02:14.190> does

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
this blog and on this side what it does

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.490 
this blog and on this side what it does
is<00:02:14.580> merely<00:02:15.330> activates<00:02:15.990> powder<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.470> powder

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
is merely activates powder the powder

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.350 
is merely activates powder the powder
real<00:02:16.890> underneath<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.400> track<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.090> mean<00:02:18.210> the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
real underneath the track I mean the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.290 
real underneath the track I mean the
cart<00:02:18.960> so<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.290> goes<00:02:19.410> out<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.980> on<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:20.790> side<00:02:21.030> is

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
cart so it goes out and on this side is

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.970 
cart so it goes out and on this side is
where<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.630> actually<00:02:21.750> activates<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.560> Pistons

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
where it actually activates the Pistons

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.280 
where it actually activates the Pistons
or<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.790> will<00:02:23.850> go<00:02:23.910> through<00:02:24.240> this<00:02:24.420> repeater<00:02:24.900> in

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
or it will go through this repeater in

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.430 
or it will go through this repeater in
it<00:02:25.440> first<00:02:25.760> hits<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:27.090> mean<00:02:27.690> not<00:02:27.810> sorry<00:02:28.080> first

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
it first hits I mean not sorry first

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.340 
it first hits I mean not sorry first
pulls<00:02:28.980> back<00:02:29.220> this<00:02:29.460> piston<00:02:30.390> then<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.200> one

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
pulls back this piston then that one

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.140 
pulls back this piston then that one
extends<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.280> power<00:02:32.490> is<00:02:32.580> passing<00:02:33.000> back

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
extends and the power is passing back

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.400 
extends and the power is passing back
through<00:02:33.180> here<00:02:33.570> where<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:33.930> one<00:02:34.140> will<00:02:34.230> then

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
through here where this one will then

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.440 
through here where this one will then
shut<00:02:34.710> down<00:02:34.890> but<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.700> powers<00:02:35.970> still<00:02:36.000> be<00:02:36.300> going

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
shut down but the powers still be going

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.900 
shut down but the powers still be going
through<00:02:36.720> this<00:02:36.750> one<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.410> this<00:02:37.500> one<00:02:37.560> closes<00:02:38.100> last

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
through this one so this one closes last

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.690 
through this one so this one closes last
even<00:02:39.300> though<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.510> opened<00:02:39.930> first<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.550> is

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
even though it opened first and this is

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.390 
even though it opened first and this is
just<00:02:41.790> like<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.000> tricky<00:02:42.690> very<00:02:43.260> compact<00:02:43.680> abv<00:02:44.370> a

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
just like a tricky very compact abv a

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.580 
just like a tricky very compact abv a
clock<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.270> don't<00:02:45.930> have<00:02:45.990> to<00:02:46.110> build<00:02:46.290> one<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.440> those

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
clock I don't have to build one of those

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.870 
clock I don't have to build one of those
big<00:02:46.800> things<00:02:47.010> down<00:02:47.280> here<00:02:47.600> but<00:02:48.600> also<00:02:49.880> whenever

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
big things down here but also whenever

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.640 
big things down here but also whenever
the<00:02:51.210> owner's<00:02:51.570> knowledge<00:02:51.750> gets<00:02:52.260> flipped<00:02:52.530> by

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
the owner's knowledge gets flipped by

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.890 
the owner's knowledge gets flipped by
the<00:02:52.710> track<00:02:53.040> reel<00:02:53.310> we<00:02:53.940> have<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.330> only<00:02:54.510> have<00:02:54.780> it

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
the track reel we have to only have it

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.510 
the track reel we have to only have it
open<00:02:55.200> very<00:02:55.440> shortly<00:02:55.800> so<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.070> have<00:02:56.250> going

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
open very shortly so I have going

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.060 
open very shortly so I have going
through<00:02:56.760> this<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:56.940> tick<00:02:57.420> pull<00:02:58.320> shorten<00:02:58.920> or

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
through this to tick pull shorten or

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.250 
through this to tick pull shorten or
else<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.850> minecart<00:03:00.330> will<00:03:00.450> pass<00:03:00.690> right<00:03:01.050> back

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
else the minecart will pass right back

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.930 
else the minecart will pass right back
out<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.740> go<00:03:01.890> back<00:03:02.070> down<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.430> track<00:03:02.670> and

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
out and go back down the track and

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.880 
out and go back down the track and
that's<00:03:03.060> why<00:03:03.180> we<00:03:03.210> don't<00:03:03.450> want<00:03:03.600> them<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.050> that's

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
that's why we don't want them and that's

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.980 
that's why we don't want them and that's
really<00:03:05.160> all<00:03:05.460> that<00:03:05.610> it<00:03:06.090> takes<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.570> get<00:03:06.690> this<00:03:06.840> to

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
really all that it takes to get this to

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.380 
really all that it takes to get this to
work<00:03:07.020> it's<00:03:07.920> just<00:03:08.160> an<00:03:08.340> RS<00:03:08.580> nor<00:03:08.760> latch<00:03:08.820> with<00:03:09.210> some

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
work it's just an RS nor latch with some

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.320 
work it's just an RS nor latch with some
triggering<00:03:10.290> mechanisms<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.610> people<00:03:11.970> like<00:03:12.120> it

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
triggering mechanisms and people like it
