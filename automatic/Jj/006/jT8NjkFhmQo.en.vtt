00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.000
 Hello everyone that the web is arctic 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.580
 welcome today to a brand new video 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.139
 we are here as every Wednesday with a 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.380
 brand new episode from Wednesday 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:22.430
 graphic guys today the proposals 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.710
 they were two then the first of all was 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.829
 indeed let's say 3 because then the last one 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.330
 I will tell you what other serious events are, then 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.660
 let's say 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.370
 the first idea that there had been a 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.870
 written comment the video names give it a 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.800
 jack which also covers the 9th too 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.430
 strong 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.570
 was to create a wallpaper for yours 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.570
 desktop 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.250
 but I said to myself maybe it just isn't 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.780
 the most original thing in the world seen 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.640
 that if they search on google they find to 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.989
 hundreds of thousands 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.140
 maybe I told you since Wednesday 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.090
 graphic but maybe seeing that until now 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.620
 I made video precisely on how to 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.780
 help you with your channel 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.030
 youtube this time and I said to myself not 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:07.070
 I can do something that won't help you 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:13.220
 in short, so two ideas in mind then the 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:16.010
 first it was there to create an ace in 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.110
 practice with alternative number for 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.360
 practically create your own skins 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.430
 minecraft in 3d then without it will be of 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.930
 new to trodica is practically many 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.360
 computer I know they can't handle it 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.250
 there is always this problem while with a 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.270
 little program that maybe in the future if it will be 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.510
 required 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.800
 I will tell you 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.680
 precisely they are able to do 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:40.090
 quietly these skins in 3d then 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.770
 easy for everyone to work then then the 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.180
 the second one will be that of them 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.200
 create a 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.360
 a video cover then I 'm not 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.070
 call the cover we are the cover 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.230
 video because we are facebookians 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.630
 therefore we create we call video covers 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.280
 I really like it a lot, I think 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.950
 that I will also use it for some 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.920
 video because really then it is a lot 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.140
 simple in the sense that as I told you 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.340
 simplicity is always a lot for me 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.630
 important because I really like it 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.780
 so then it is very pretty to the eye ie 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.120
 when you look at it really it is a lot 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.760
 pretty because really clean 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.830
 allows you a great customization 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.030
 you can insert a logo what 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.280
 you want in the upper left part 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:31.920
 where there is precisely the bar and therefore good 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.459
 and there to make this cover here 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.599
 indeed it has been centuries since 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.220
 apparently it may seem easy because 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.590
 now you see all that speeded up 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.870
 but I swear it was all done on 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.959
 moment the very idea of ​​putting that 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.700
 coffin up there came at the time 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.250
 so let's say it's a little bit 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.629
 however, the final work was improvised 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.680
 that more photos really as much as you have 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:59.040
 already explained before I avoid this 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.180
 this option let's say or maybe in the 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.500
 cosentino where I show another 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.359
 however special video cover is fine 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.129
 in the sense that your character in 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.720
 3d as I put in my other ones too 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.750
 video so it will be a pretty thing 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.720
 pretty here is then I want to tell you too 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.959
 this Friday I will probably charge 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.400
 one or no or Friday or Thursday we will see 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.790
 tomorrow 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:30.319
 or in short I know it by the end of Friday 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.689
 week I will upload a video bar 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.680
 obviously always made live 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:39.319
 we always say challenged law of hiv 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.999
 really that has a design in mind 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.650
 but I really like it with progettino 

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:43.609
 we'll see if I can make it happen 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.950
 how I look 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.810
 but I don't doubt it therefore I recommend 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.120
 left a nice I like to support 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.379

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.079
 always look at yours every time 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.329

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.389
