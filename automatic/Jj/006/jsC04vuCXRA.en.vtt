it's<00:02:50.569> actually<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:50.989> use<00:02:51.170> of<00:02:51.319> moxibustion<00:02:51.709> on

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
it's actually the use of moxibustion on

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.949 
it's actually the use of moxibustion on
a<00:02:52.250> particular<00:02:52.730> acupuncture<00:02:53.269> point<00:02:53.540> on<00:02:53.870> the

a particular acupuncture point on the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
pinky toe of a woman that's used for

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.819 
pinky toe of a woman that's used for
this<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:56.510> that's<00:02:56.690> something<00:02:56.900> also<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.290> we<00:02:57.530> do

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
this so that's something also that we do

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.229 
this so that's something also that we do
in<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.010> office<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.459> then<00:02:58.579> teach<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.910> woman<00:02:59.150> how

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
in the office and then teach a woman how

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.990 
in the office and then teach a woman how
to<00:02:59.299> do<00:02:59.510> for<00:02:59.870> ourselves<00:03:00.370> in<00:03:01.370> those<00:03:01.549> last<00:03:01.819> few

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
to do for ourselves in those last few

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.050 
to do for ourselves in those last few
weeks<00:03:02.269> before<00:03:02.750> delivery<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.530> turn<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.829> baby

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
weeks before delivery to turn the baby

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.940 
weeks before delivery to turn the baby
and<00:03:05.060> it's<00:03:05.239> effective<00:03:05.780> it's<00:03:05.959> so<00:03:06.170> effective<00:03:06.500> and

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
and it's effective it's so effective and

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.059 
and it's effective it's so effective and
people<00:03:07.579> begin<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.269> feel<00:03:08.810> their<00:03:09.410> baby<00:03:09.680> move

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
doing it often and you know then it's

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.129 
doing it often and you know then it's
something<00:03:16.370> they<00:03:16.459> can<00:03:16.489> do<00:03:16.819> twice<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.180> day<00:03:17.540> ten<00:03:18.019> to
