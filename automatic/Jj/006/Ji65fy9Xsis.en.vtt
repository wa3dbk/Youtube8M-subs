00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
density pods on the sole which are much

density pods on the sole which are much
harder<00:01:13.380> than<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.830> rest<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.270> material

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
harder than the rest of the material

that<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.509> sole<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.930> made<00:01:15.960> out<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:17.670> idea

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
that the sole is made out of the idea

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.820 
that the sole is made out of the idea
behind<00:01:18.240> these<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.810> they<00:01:18.930> give<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.409> good

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
behind these is that they give a good

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.590 
behind these is that they give a good
feel<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.490> road<00:01:20.670> they're<00:01:21.210> certainly<00:01:21.540> very

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
feel for the road they're certainly very

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.390 
feel for the road they're certainly very
hard<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.229> certainly<00:01:22.560> notice<00:01:23.009> them<00:01:23.189> whether

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
or not they improve feel for the road I

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.380

don't<00:01:25.770> know<00:01:25.950> they<00:01:26.250> just<00:01:26.460> felt<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.330> I

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
don't know they just felt so I

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.020 
don't know they just felt so I
irritating<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.290> me<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:28.740> that's<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.700> idea

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
irritating to me but that's the idea

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.480 
irritating to me but that's the idea
behind<00:01:30.210> them<00:01:30.659> but<00:01:31.500> as<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.770> can<00:01:31.920> see<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.280> rest

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
behind them but as you can see the rest

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.550 
behind them but as you can see the rest
of<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.700> sole<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.060> made<00:01:33.479> up<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.960> one<00:01:34.200> single

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
of the sole is made up of one single

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.910 
of the sole is made up of one single
material<00:01:35.220> called<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.240> light<00:01:36.479> which<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.290> very

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
material called so light which is very

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.460 
material called so light which is very
light<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:38.790> actually<00:01:38.909> quite<00:01:39.270> firm<00:01:39.630> underfoot

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470

light it's actually quite firm underfoot
which<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.950> really<00:01:41.549> like<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:42.479> maybe<00:01:42.780> for

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
which I really like but maybe for

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.050 
which I really like but maybe for
somebody<00:01:43.439> who<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:44.189> used<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> more<00:01:44.729> cushion

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
somebody who is used to a more cushion

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.590 
somebody who is used to a more cushion
should<00:01:45.299> be<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> little<00:01:45.750> bit<00:01:45.960> harsh<00:01:47.479> but<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
should be a little bit harsh but the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.060 
should be a little bit harsh but the
main<00:01:48.780> thing<00:01:48.960> about<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.290> shoe<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.799> sort

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
main thing about the shoe is this sort

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.149 
main thing about the shoe is this sort
of<00:01:50.130> rocker<00:01:50.729> bottom<00:01:51.680> effect<00:01:52.680> what<00:01:53.040> they've

of rocker bottom effect what they've
built<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> curve<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.079> bottom

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
built in is it is a curve in the bottom

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.280 
built in is it is a curve in the bottom
of<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> shoe<00:01:56.070> which<00:01:56.670> forces<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.750> run<00:01:57.899> afford

of the shoe which forces the run afford

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.200 
of the shoe which forces the run afford
onto<00:01:58.619> their<00:01:58.770> front<00:01:59.070> foot<00:01:59.280> now<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.820> must<00:02:00.060> admit

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
onto their front foot now I must admit

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.670 
onto their front foot now I must admit
that<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.630> found<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.960> rather<00:02:01.110> disconcerting

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
that I found it rather disconcerting

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.810 
that I found it rather disconcerting
when<00:02:02.310> I

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
when I

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.360 
when I
in<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.480> shoe<00:02:03.720> I<00:02:04.020> definitely<00:02:04.770> felt<00:02:05.010> as<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.220> was

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
in the shoe I definitely felt as I was

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.160 
in the shoe I definitely felt as I was
being<00:02:05.610> pushed<00:02:05.910> forward<00:02:06.150> onto<00:02:06.450> my<00:02:06.690> forefoot

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
being pushed forward onto my forefoot

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.030 
being pushed forward onto my forefoot
which<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.310> idea<00:02:08.580> behind<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.880> ship<00:02:09.979> but<00:02:10.979> I

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
which is the idea behind the ship but I

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.980 
which is the idea behind the ship but I
must<00:02:11.370> admit<00:02:11.520> within<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.030> few<00:02:12.270> minutes<00:02:12.630> of

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
must admit within a few minutes of

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.210 
must admit within a few minutes of
running<00:02:13.230> in<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.680> was<00:02:13.830> quite<00:02:14.040> comfortable

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
running in it I was quite comfortable

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.800 
running in it I was quite comfortable
with<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.760> think<00:02:15.000> your<00:02:15.090> transition<00:02:15.570> quite

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
with it I think your transition quite

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.170 
with it I think your transition quite
quickly<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.800> wouldn't<00:02:17.520> recommend<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:18.120> for

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
quickly I wouldn't recommend it for

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.810 
quickly I wouldn't recommend it for
somebody<00:02:18.750> who<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:18.960> used<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.770> either<00:02:20.070> mid<00:02:20.490> foot

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
somebody who is used to either mid foot

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.650 
somebody who is used to either mid foot
or<00:02:21.660> either<00:02:21.990> heel<00:02:22.470> striking<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.640> normal<00:02:24.450> shoe

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
or either heel striking in a normal shoe

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.310 
or either heel striking in a normal shoe
because<00:02:25.670> certainly<00:02:26.670> after<00:02:27.020> three<00:02:28.020> or<00:02:28.110> four

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
because certainly after three or four

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.110 
because certainly after three or four
miles<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.830> could<00:02:29.010> feel<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:29.430> my<00:02:29.580> calves<00:02:29.850> that

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
miles I could feel it in my calves that

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.690 
miles I could feel it in my calves that
I<00:02:30.180> was<00:02:30.300> more<00:02:30.510> forward<00:02:30.810> on<00:02:30.900> my<00:02:31.020> toes<00:02:31.700> but

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
I was more forward on my toes but

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.340 
I was more forward on my toes but
generally<00:02:33.240> I<00:02:33.270> would<00:02:33.360> say<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.750> if<00:02:33.990> this<00:02:34.140> is<00:02:34.320> a

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
generally I would say that if this is a

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.430 
generally I would say that if this is a
shoe<00:02:35.000> that's<00:02:36.000> aimed<00:02:36.420> at<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.900> runner<00:02:37.110> who<00:02:37.320> is

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
shoe that's aimed at the runner who is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.780 
shoe that's aimed at the runner who is
looking<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:37.800> transition<00:02:38.459> into<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.730> more

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670

that you might want to try if you want

to get into minimalist forefoot running
but<00:03:01.140> again<00:03:01.410> I<00:03:01.620> would<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.040> recommend<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.700> for

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
but again I would I recommend it for

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.990 
but again I would I recommend it for
initially<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.350> few<00:03:04.890> short<00:03:05.220> runs<00:03:05.459> until<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:05.880> get

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
initially a few short runs until you get

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.910 
initially a few short runs until you get
used<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.270> it<00:03:06.390> but<00:03:07.200> if<00:03:07.320> anyone<00:03:07.590> has<00:03:07.739> any

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
used to it but if anyone has any
