the<00:03:54.669> lens<00:03:54.879> creates<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.480> image<00:03:55.599> so<00:03:56.109> when<00:03:56.290> we're

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:56.469 
the lens creates the image so when we're

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.949 
the lens creates the image so when we're
sitting<00:03:57.010> way<00:03:57.370> up<00:03:57.400> in<00:03:57.909> the<00:03:58.030> rafters<00:03:58.239> and<00:03:58.870> we're

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
sitting way up in the rafters and we're

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.599 
sitting way up in the rafters and we're
looking<00:03:59.079> at<00:03:59.349> the<00:03:59.439> monitors<00:04:00.040> and<00:04:00.280> we're<00:04:00.370> seeing

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
looking at the monitors and we're seeing

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.000 
looking at the monitors and we're seeing
the<00:04:00.819> sweat<00:04:01.180> on<00:04:01.419> the<00:04:01.569> brow<00:04:01.599> of<00:04:02.169> one<00:04:02.859> of<00:04:02.950> the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
the sweat on the brow of one of the

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.069 
the sweat on the brow of one of the
linebackers<00:04:03.639> on<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.879> field<00:04:04.120> that's<00:04:04.810> your

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
linebackers on the field that's your

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.189 
linebackers on the field that's your
lens<00:04:05.349> creating<00:04:06.280> that<00:04:06.400> beautiful<00:04:07.090> image<00:04:07.870> image

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:08.199 
lens creating that beautiful image image

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.750 
lens creating that beautiful image image
that's<00:04:08.739> correct<00:04:09.069> I<00:04:09.220> always<00:04:09.370> thought<00:04:09.609> they

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
that's correct I always thought they

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.610 
that's correct I always thought they
were<00:04:09.879> guys<00:04:10.090> out<00:04:10.419> on<00:04:10.449> the<00:04:10.720> field<00:04:10.930> next<00:04:11.229> to<00:04:11.500> him

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
were guys out on the field next to him

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.500 
were guys out on the field next to him
it<00:04:11.739> was<00:04:11.859> just<00:04:12.099> too<00:04:12.549> you<00:04:12.940> know<00:04:13.060> it's<00:04:13.389> not

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
it was just too you know it's not

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.719 
it was just too you know it's not
believable<00:04:14.079> that<00:04:14.650> they<00:04:14.979> can<00:04:15.159> get<00:04:15.280> that<00:04:15.489> close

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:15.729 
believable that they can get that close

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:16.649 
believable that they can get that close
it<00:04:15.879> looks<00:04:16.030> like<00:04:16.150> you<00:04:16.209> feels<00:04:16.419> like<00:04:16.479> you're

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:16.659 
it looks like you feels like you're

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:18.210 
it looks like you feels like you're
standing<00:04:16.930> right<00:04:16.959> next<00:04:17.169> to<00:04:17.320> him<00:04:17.470> well<00:04:17.979> to<00:04:18.070> give

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
standing right next to him well to give

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.529 
standing right next to him well to give
you<00:04:18.280> different<00:04:18.459> points<00:04:18.880> of<00:04:18.970> view<00:04:19.120> yes<00:04:19.389> they

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
you different points of view yes they

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:20.939 
you different points of view yes they
will<00:04:19.659> have<00:04:19.840> handheld<00:04:20.169> camera<00:04:20.620> men<00:04:20.739> on<00:04:20.859> the

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
will have handheld camera men on the

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:22.830 
will have handheld camera men on the
field<00:04:21.159> there'll<00:04:22.090> be<00:04:22.120> different<00:04:22.539> reverse

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
field there'll be different reverse

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.990 
field there'll be different reverse
angles<00:04:23.440> but<00:04:23.979> believe<00:04:24.400> it<00:04:24.490> not<00:04:24.580> like<00:04:24.699> if<00:04:24.849> you

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
angles but believe it not like if you

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.300 
angles but believe it not like if you
watch<00:04:25.240> an<00:04:25.389> NFL<00:04:25.720> football<00:04:25.900> game<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.830> majority

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
watch an NFL football game the majority

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.189 
watch an NFL football game the majority
of<00:04:27.550> what<00:04:27.849> you<00:04:28.000> watch<00:04:28.240> that<00:04:28.270> game<00:04:28.690> with<00:04:28.900> will<00:04:29.080> be

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
of what you watch that game with will be

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.659 
of what you watch that game with will be
cameras<00:04:29.560> that<00:04:29.680> are<00:04:29.710> up<00:04:29.860> high<00:04:29.889> and<00:04:30.099> away<00:04:30.490> from

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
cameras that are up high and away from

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.330 
cameras that are up high and away from
the<00:04:30.940> field<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.539> then<00:04:31.930> that<00:04:32.259> are<00:04:32.440> panning<00:04:33.280> and

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
the field and then that are panning and

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.730 
the field and then that are panning and
that's<00:04:33.550> what<00:04:33.909> these<00:04:34.030> lenses<00:04:34.330> do<00:04:34.750> that's<00:04:35.530> it

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
that's what these lenses do that's it

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.770 
that's what these lenses do that's it
now<00:04:36.280> what<00:04:36.460> we've<00:04:36.580> added<00:04:36.789> now<00:04:37.210> is<00:04:37.479> something

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
now what we've added now is something

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.120 
now what we've added now is something
very<00:04:37.810> new<00:04:38.050> which<00:04:38.289> is<00:04:38.409> an<00:04:38.500> auto<00:04:38.650> focus<00:04:39.099> function

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
very new which is an auto focus function

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.100 
very new which is an auto focus function
and<00:04:39.669> you'd<00:04:39.759> say<00:04:40.000> well<00:04:40.180> why<00:04:40.509> is<00:04:40.570> that<00:04:40.750> that

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
and you'd say well why is that that

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.439 
and you'd say well why is that that
important<00:04:41.710> camera<00:04:42.280> operators<00:04:42.789> for<00:04:43.030> years

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
important camera operators for years

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.439 
important camera operators for years
have<00:04:43.630> been<00:04:43.659> operating<00:04:44.349> cameras<00:04:44.800> without<00:04:44.919> it

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
have been operating cameras without it

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.900 
have been operating cameras without it
it's<00:04:46.449> high<00:04:46.690> definition

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
it's high definition

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.150 
it's high definition
this<00:04:48.720> term<00:04:49.020> in<00:04:49.200> high<00:04:49.290> definition<00:04:49.530> that<00:04:49.890> I<00:04:49.950> love

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
this term in high definition that I love

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.040 
this term in high definition that I love
it's<00:04:50.280> actually<00:04:50.520> an<00:04:50.580> optical<00:04:51.060> term<00:04:51.300> it's

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
it's actually an optical term it's

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.540 
it's actually an optical term it's
called<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.380> permissible<00:04:52.980> circle<00:04:53.430> of

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
called the permissible circle of

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.300 
called the permissible circle of
confusion<00:04:53.780> it's<00:04:54.780> a<00:04:54.840> great<00:04:55.310> permissible

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
confusion it's a great permissible

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.930 
confusion it's a great permissible
circle<00:04:57.090> of<00:04:57.360> confusion<00:04:57.920> not<00:04:58.920> great<00:04:59.250> pretty

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
circle of confusion not great pretty

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.940 
circle of confusion not great pretty
yeah<00:05:00.120> you<00:05:00.180> need<00:05:00.420> to<00:05:00.480> explain<00:05:00.840> that<00:05:01.020> yeah<00:05:01.230> the

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
yeah you need to explain that yeah the

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.890 
yeah you need to explain that yeah the
permissible<00:05:02.460> circle<00:05:02.820> of<00:05:02.940> confusion<00:05:03.090> is<00:05:03.750> the

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
permissible circle of confusion is the

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.960 
permissible circle of confusion is the
ability<00:05:04.230> of<00:05:04.530> the<00:05:04.890> human<00:05:04.920> eye<00:05:05.460> and<00:05:05.490> we<00:05:05.700> can<00:05:05.850> put

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
ability of the human eye and we can put

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.910 
ability of the human eye and we can put
a<00:05:06.000> number<00:05:06.240> two<00:05:06.510> and<00:05:06.690> that's<00:05:06.840> why<00:05:07.020> we<00:05:07.470> call<00:05:07.890> it

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
a number two and that's why we call it

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.580 
a number two and that's why we call it
that<00:05:08.160> of<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:09.210> ability<00:05:09.690> of<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:09.900> human<00:05:09.930> eye<00:05:10.530> to

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
that of the ability of the human eye to

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.860 
that of the ability of the human eye to
distinguish<00:05:11.490> what's<00:05:11.850> in<00:05:12.060> focus<00:05:12.540> and<00:05:12.660> what's

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
distinguish what's in focus and what's

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.140 
distinguish what's in focus and what's
not<00:05:13.110> in<00:05:13.320> focus<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:14.460> brain<00:05:14.730> is<00:05:14.910> a<00:05:14.970> very

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
not in focus the brain is a very

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.190 
not in focus the brain is a very
interesting<00:05:15.810> device<00:05:16.260> if<00:05:16.760> something<00:05:17.760> is

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
interesting device if something is

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.690 
interesting device if something is
slightly<00:05:19.200> out<00:05:19.470> of<00:05:19.500> focus<00:05:19.800> but<00:05:20.130> within<00:05:20.520> a

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
slightly out of focus but within a

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.210 
slightly out of focus but within a
certain<00:05:20.910> range<00:05:21.300> it'll<00:05:22.080> actually<00:05:22.350> make<00:05:22.530> it<00:05:23.040> in

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
certain range it'll actually make it in

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.370 
certain range it'll actually make it in
focus<00:05:23.490> so<00:05:23.850> in<00:05:23.970> your<00:05:24.120> brain<00:05:24.450> it's<00:05:24.840> actually<00:05:25.080> in

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
focus so in your brain it's actually in

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.170 
focus so in your brain it's actually in
focus<00:05:25.770> of<00:05:26.160> course<00:05:26.370> there's<00:05:26.520> only<00:05:26.640> one<00:05:26.970> true

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
focus of course there's only one true
