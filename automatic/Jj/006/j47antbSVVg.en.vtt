and I think an awesome example of how

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.870 
and I think an awesome example of how
you<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.259> how<00:01:43.740> do<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.549> know<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:44.850> a

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
you do this how do you you know have a

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.840 
you do this how do you you know have a
band<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.479> share<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.049> with<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.229> group<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.590> people

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
that you love and do it over a long

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.940 
that you love and do it over a long
period<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.369> time<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.659> think<00:01:52.020> Linkin<00:01:52.500> Park<00:01:52.770> is
