00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.850 

so<00:00:00.359> the<00:00:00.599> next<00:00:00.780> step<00:00:00.930> in<00:00:01.110> the<00:00:01.199> process<00:00:01.230> was

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
so the next step in the process was

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.460 
so the next step in the process was
designing<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.490> characters<00:00:02.939> in<00:00:03.899> this<00:00:04.049> case<00:00:04.319> it

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
designing the characters in this case it

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.780 
designing the characters in this case it
was<00:00:04.529> fairly<00:00:04.770> simple<00:00:05.190> since<00:00:05.460> there<00:00:05.609> were<00:00:05.670> only

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
was fairly simple since there were only

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.360 
was fairly simple since there were only
really<00:00:06.270> two<00:00:06.480> main<00:00:06.509> characters<00:00:06.899> but<00:00:07.379> it<00:00:08.189> also

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
really two main characters but it also

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.890 
really two main characters but it also
meant<00:00:08.670> those<00:00:08.820> two<00:00:09.059> characters<00:00:09.240> really<00:00:09.630> needed

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
meant those two characters really needed

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.959 
meant those two characters really needed
