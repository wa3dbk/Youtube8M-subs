that this rear wheel somewhat hits on
something<00:04:15.400> I<00:04:15.580> think<00:04:16.180> it's<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.630> engine<00:04:17.080> block

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350

something I think it's the engine block
it's<00:04:17.920> a<00:04:18.040> minor<00:04:18.250> gripe<00:04:18.609> but<00:04:18.880> it's<00:04:19.150> not<00:04:19.420> really<00:04:19.840> a

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
it's a minor gripe but it's not really a

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.630 
it's a minor gripe but it's not really a
major<00:04:20.290> issue<00:04:20.680> on<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:22.180> on<00:04:23.140> the<00:04:23.320> bike<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:23.770> one

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
major issue on the on the bike and one

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.880 
major issue on the on the bike and one
thing<00:04:24.820> I<00:04:24.910> found<00:04:25.180> out<00:04:25.510> is<00:04:25.570> that<00:04:25.930> these

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
thing I found out is that these

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.170 
thing I found out is that these
cylinders<00:04:27.310> are<00:04:27.520> on<00:04:28.180> pegs<00:04:29.020> I<00:04:29.669> think<00:04:30.669> this<00:04:30.940> will

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
cylinders are on pegs I think this will

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.750 
cylinders are on pegs I think this will
give<00:04:31.510> way<00:04:31.780> for<00:04:32.290> the

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
give way for the

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.980 
give way for the
