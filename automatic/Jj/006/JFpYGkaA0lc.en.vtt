00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:12.949 
I thought of that once there when he was

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:14.470

still<00:00:13.160> ahead<00:00:13.490> of<00:00:13.610> me<00:00:13.699> there<00:00:13.940> you<00:00:14.240> know<00:00:14.330> after

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
when we both passed Brian there I

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.100 
when we both passed Brian there I
thought<00:00:16.340> her<00:00:16.820> complete<00:00:17.180> thing<00:00:17.539> again<00:00:17.869> any
