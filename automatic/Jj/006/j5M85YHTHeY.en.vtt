on<00:00:10.380> this<00:00:10.530> channel<00:00:10.769> anymore<00:00:11.099> on<00:00:11.550> my<00:00:11.759> main

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
on this channel anymore on my main

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.730 
on this channel anymore on my main
channel<00:00:11.940> but<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.870> think<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.320> would<00:00:13.440> only<00:00:13.590> be

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.039 
channel but I think it would only be
appropriate<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:14.759> would<00:00:14.880> be<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> crime<00:00:15.059> if<00:00:15.630> I

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
appropriate and it would be a crime if I

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.840 
appropriate and it would be a crime if I
did<00:00:16.230> not<00:00:16.410> display<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.130> everyone<00:00:17.699> could
