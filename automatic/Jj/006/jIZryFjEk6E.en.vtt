00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
hi I'm Tom this is Renee we're with

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.889 
hi I'm Tom this is Renee we're with
stout<00:00:02.429> landscape<00:00:02.909> design<00:00:03.240> and<00:00:03.480> today<00:00:03.750> we're

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
stout landscape design and today we're

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.480 
stout landscape design and today we're
going<00:00:03.990> to<00:00:04.080> show<00:00:04.230> you<00:00:04.290> how<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.529> install<00:00:04.830> a<00:00:05.250> water

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
going to show you how to install a water

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.360 
going to show you how to install a water
fountain<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.330> first<00:00:07.109> step<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.560> you<00:00:08.160> need<00:00:08.189> to

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
fountain the first step is you need to

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.240 
fountain the first step is you need to
dig<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.550> hole<00:00:08.610> this<00:00:09.450> hole<00:00:09.510> was<00:00:10.139> pre<00:00:10.620> dug<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.160> we

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
dig a hole this hole was pre dug and we

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.730 
dig a hole this hole was pre dug and we
also<00:00:11.400> compacted<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.179> base<00:00:12.450> in<00:00:12.780> its<00:00:12.929> level<00:00:13.380> so

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
also compacted the base in its level so

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.279 
also compacted the base in its level so
when<00:00:13.889> we<00:00:14.009> add<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.460> base<00:00:15.299> which<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.080> going<00:00:16.230> to

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
when we add this base which is going to

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.840 
when we add this base which is going to
be<00:00:16.410> submerged<00:00:16.859> underground<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:17.730> you're

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
be submerged underground so you're

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.310 
be submerged underground so you're
actually<00:00:18.000> not<00:00:18.270> going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.539> see<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.900> there's

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
actually not going to see it there's

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.599 
actually not going to see it there's
going<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.500> be<00:00:19.590> decomposed<00:00:20.189> granite<00:00:20.220> that

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
going to be decomposed granite that

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.859 
going to be decomposed granite that
comes<00:00:20.850> up<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.240> level<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.600> we're<00:00:21.750> going

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
comes up to this level and we're going

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.660 
comes up to this level and we're going
to<00:00:21.900> put<00:00:22.050> gravel<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.560> top<00:00:22.830> okay<00:00:23.250> now<00:00:23.490> that

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
to put gravel on the top okay now that

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.230 
to put gravel on the top okay now that
we<00:00:23.760> have<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.060> pond<00:00:24.949> basin<00:00:25.949> level<00:00:26.670> what<00:00:27.119> we

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
we have this pond basin level what we

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.109 
we have this pond basin level what we
need<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.480> do<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.930> put<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.859> submersible<00:00:29.820> pump

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
need to do is put this submersible pump

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.540 
need to do is put this submersible pump
in<00:00:30.359> here<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.590> water<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.949> going<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.099> be<00:00:32.309> down

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
in here the water is going to be down

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.190 
in here the water is going to be down
here<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.090> then<00:00:33.570> there's<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.780> little<00:00:33.960> notch

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
here and then there's a little notch

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.380 
here and then there's a little notch
right<00:00:34.710> here<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:35.100> allows<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.610> cord<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.180> come

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
right here that allows the cord to come

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.630 
right here that allows the cord to come
out<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.870> go<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.500> back<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.129> electrical

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
out and go to back to the electrical

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.709 
out and go to back to the electrical
outlet<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.149> then<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.110> top<00:00:40.590> goes<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.579> here<00:00:41.940> so

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
outlet and then this top goes on here so

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.000 
outlet and then this top goes on here so
want<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> check<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.230> one<00:00:43.350> more<00:00:43.500> time<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.890> it's

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
want to check it one more time that it's

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.680 
want to check it one more time that it's
level<00:00:44.250> good<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:46.550> now<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.640> next<00:00:48.000> step<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.360> to

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
level good and now the next step is to

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.410 
level good and now the next step is to
get<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.960> mesh<00:00:49.640> and<00:00:50.640> put<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.940> over<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.239> hole

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
get that mesh and put it over the hole

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.209 
get that mesh and put it over the hole
so<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:52.020> gravel<00:00:52.680> does<00:00:52.829> not<00:00:52.980> go<00:00:53.190> down

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
so that the gravel does not go down

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.299 
so that the gravel does not go down
inside<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.090> these<00:00:54.300> holes<00:00:54.649> we've<00:00:55.649> cut<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> hole

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
inside of these holes we've cut a hole

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.549 
inside of these holes we've cut a hole
in<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> middle<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.000> mesh<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:58.170> mesh

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
in the middle of this mesh and this mesh

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.680 
in the middle of this mesh and this mesh
is<00:00:58.590> enough<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.250> go<00:00:59.730> over<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.059> edge<00:01:00.210> here

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
is enough to go over the edge here

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.360 
is enough to go over the edge here
you're<00:01:01.230> not<00:01:01.350> going<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.590> see<00:01:01.739> any<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.129> it's

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
you're not going to see any of this it's

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.619 
you're not going to see any of this it's
going<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.520> be<00:01:02.670> covered<00:01:02.850> by<00:01:03.030> decomposed

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
going to be covered by decomposed

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.420 
going to be covered by decomposed
granite<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> side<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.589> gravel<00:01:05.070> all<00:01:05.189> over

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
granite on the side and gravel all over

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.149 
granite on the side and gravel all over
the<00:01:05.549> top<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:07.110> mesh<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:07.740> now<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.010> need

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
the top so this mesh is here now we need

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.039 
the top so this mesh is here now we need
to<00:01:08.250> grab<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.700> fountain<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.450> hose<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:09.930> going

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
to grab the fountain the hose it's going

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.570 
to grab the fountain the hose it's going
to<00:01:10.110> take<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.470> from<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.710> submersible<00:01:11.340> pump

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
to take it from that submersible pump

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.429 
to take it from that submersible pump
and<00:01:11.790> put<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.510> into<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.170> then<00:01:13.320> it's

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
and put it up into this and then it's

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.550 
and put it up into this and then it's
going<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.650> spill<00:01:13.830> over<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.100> edge<00:01:18.290> yep<00:01:19.290> just

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
going to spill over the edge yep just

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.190 
going to spill over the edge yep just
like<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.280> let<00:01:21.119> me<00:01:21.210> show<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.720> so

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
like that and let me show you this so

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.649 
like that and let me show you this so
you'll<00:01:23.040> see<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.520> we've<00:01:23.970> got<00:01:24.119> some<00:01:24.180> divots

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
you'll see that we've got some divots

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.100 
you'll see that we've got some divots
down<00:01:24.900> here<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.920> soil<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.430> needs<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:27.110> put

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
down here this soil just needs to be put

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.240 
down here this soil just needs to be put
in<00:01:29.270> around<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.450> edges<00:01:30.479> here<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.259> and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
in around the edges here and and

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.690 
in around the edges here and and
compacted<00:01:33.090> really<00:01:33.360> well<00:01:33.560> all<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.890> way<00:01:35.009> up<00:01:35.159> to

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
compacted really well all the way up to

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.819 
compacted really well all the way up to
the<00:01:35.820> top<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.329> grade<00:01:36.659> all<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.170> way<00:01:37.530> around

the top of this grade all the way around

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.819 
the top of this grade all the way around
needs<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.159> be<00:01:38.220> compacted<00:01:38.900> now<00:01:39.900> after<00:01:40.650> that's

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
needs to be compacted now after that's
