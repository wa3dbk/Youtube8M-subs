00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.780 
will be out there but once you get those
crafted<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.439> get<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> power<00:01:40.710> turned<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:41.220> I'm

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
crafted and get the power turned on I'm

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.219 
crafted and get the power turned on I'm
just<00:01:41.970> going<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.329> then<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.110> just

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
just going to have to then you can just

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.490 
just going to have to then you can just
run<00:01:43.380> out<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.040> area<00:01:45.290> next<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.380> can

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
run out here to this area next you can

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.300 
run out here to this area next you can
build<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:48.229> some<00:01:49.229> like<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.710> thing<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.009> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
build is some like this thing I the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.170 
build is some like this thing I the
parts<00:01:50.579> right<00:01:51.360> here<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:51.689> going<00:01:51.840> quick<00:01:52.049> but

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
parts right here it's going quick but

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.280 
parts right here it's going quick but
it's<00:01:54.180> pretty<00:01:54.390> easy<00:01:54.450> which<00:01:54.630> plate<00:01:54.840> map<00:01:55.049> be

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
it's pretty easy which plate map be

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.630 
it's pretty easy which plate map be
careful<00:01:55.590> dropping<00:01:55.890> down<00:01:56.009> here<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.369> get<00:01:56.460> this

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
careful dropping down here to get this

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.039 
careful dropping down here to get this
last<00:01:56.850> part<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.420> don't<00:01:57.570> fall<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.899> lava

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
last part so you don't fall in the lava

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.469 
last part so you don't fall in the lava
and<00:01:58.439> get<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> game<00:01:59.310> ended<00:01:59.610> once<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.270> get<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
and get the game ended once you get the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.380 
and get the game ended once you get the
last<00:02:00.659> piece<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.619> um<00:02:01.860> craft<00:02:02.670> last<00:02:02.909> piece<00:02:03.149> and

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
last piece you um craft last piece and

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.749 
last piece you um craft last piece and
get<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> electric<00:02:04.530> trap<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.130> have<00:02:05.670> to

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
get the electric trap and you have to

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.340 
get the electric trap and you have to
have<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.880> turbine<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:06.899> good<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.079> just<00:02:07.170> have

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
have a turbine so it's good to just have

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.779 
have a turbine so it's good to just have
the<00:02:07.799> turbine<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.399> while<00:02:08.580> you're<00:02:08.670> doing

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
the turbine on you while you're doing

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.669 
the turbine on you while you're doing
this<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.629> have<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.810> have<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.959> turbine<00:02:10.319> by<00:02:10.530> at

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
this you have to have a turbine by at

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.350 
this you have to have a turbine by at
the<00:02:10.770> power<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.370> when<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.610> zombies<00:02:11.940> went<00:02:12.120> into

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
the power and when the zombies went into

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.190 
the power and when the zombies went into
it<00:02:12.450> as<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:12.629> see<00:02:12.780> here

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
it as you see here

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.010 
it as you see here
as<00:02:13.590> you'll<00:02:13.890> see<00:02:14.129> in<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.760> second<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.720> zombies

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
as you'll see in a second the zombies

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.420 
as you'll see in a second the zombies
went<00:02:16.200> into<00:02:16.379> what<00:02:16.500> they<00:02:16.650> just<00:02:16.860> burn<00:02:17.010> up<00:02:17.220> it's

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
went into what they just burn up it's

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.040 
went into what they just burn up it's
pretty<00:02:17.640> good<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.910> cover<00:02:18.090> an<00:02:18.239> area<00:02:18.390> like<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.900> have

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
pretty good to cover an area like I have

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.040 
pretty good to cover an area like I have
it<00:02:19.080> right<00:02:19.319> now<00:02:19.530> but<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.970> turbine<00:02:21.390> when<00:02:21.900> that

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
it right now but the turbine when that

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.990 
it right now but the turbine when that
runs<00:02:22.200> out<00:02:22.349> of<00:02:22.410> battery<00:02:22.800> then<00:02:23.129> it's<00:02:23.519> done<00:02:23.700> so

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
runs out of battery then it's done so

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.309 
runs out of battery then it's done so
