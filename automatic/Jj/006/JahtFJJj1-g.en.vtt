00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
because fittingly enough electricity and

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.170 
because fittingly enough electricity and
water<00:00:42.680> don't<00:00:43.680> mix<00:00:43.800> very<00:00:44.100> well<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:44.910> causes

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
water don't mix very well so it causes

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.720 
water don't mix very well so it causes
your<00:00:45.600> phone<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.140> short-circuit<00:00:46.730> collections

your phone to short-circuit collections

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.330 
your phone to short-circuit collections
on<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> board<00:00:48.210> what<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.230> should<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:50.010> strip

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
on the board what you should do is strip

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.010 
on the board what you should do is strip
out<00:00:50.520> all<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.879> bits<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.539> as<00:00:51.750> quick

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
out all the bits that you can as quick

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.910 
out all the bits that you can as quick
as<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.289> can<00:00:52.320> sim<00:00:53.309> card<00:00:53.640> any<00:00:54.000> SD<00:00:54.600> cards<00:00:55.410> battery

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
as you can sim card any SD cards battery

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.810 
as you can sim card any SD cards battery
etc<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.789> then<00:00:57.600> dry<00:00:57.989> out<00:00:58.199> up<00:00:58.770> as<00:00:59.250> much<00:00:59.579> as

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
etc and then dry out up as much as

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.869 
etc and then dry out up as much as
possible<00:01:00.000> from<00:01:00.510> inside<00:01:00.989> with<00:01:01.379> cloths<00:01:01.879> or

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
possible from inside with cloths or

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.780 
possible from inside with cloths or
tissue<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.530> absorbs<00:01:04.680> as<00:01:05.280> much<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
tissue so it absorbs as much of the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.210 
tissue so it absorbs as much of the
water<00:01:05.909> as<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.299> possibly<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.320> then<00:01:08.040> what

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
water as you possibly can and then what

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.280 
water as you possibly can and then what
I'm<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.610> do<00:01:08.790> next<00:01:09.000> which<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.659> blow<00:01:10.140> it

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
I'm going to do next which is blow it

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:49.889 
I'm going to do next which is blow it
out<00:01:10.470> with<00:01:10.740> an<00:01:10.860> air<00:01:11.010> compressor

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.480 

right<00:01:50.899> after<00:01:51.289> blowing<00:01:51.799> it<00:01:52.070> with<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:52.369> air

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
right after blowing it with the air

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.069 
right after blowing it with the air
compressor<00:01:53.030> from<00:01:53.329> as<00:01:53.539> close<00:01:53.780> as<00:01:54.020> possible

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
compressor from as close as possible

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.819 
compressor from as close as possible
without<00:01:54.679> causing<00:01:55.399> any<00:01:55.609> more<00:01:56.479> damage<00:01:56.829> the
