00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
there's really nothing special to it

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.060 
there's really nothing special to it
we've<00:00:31.080> already<00:00:31.230> gone<00:00:31.410> over<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.740> lot<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
we've already gone over a lot of the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.139 
we've already gone over a lot of the
technique<00:00:32.369> but<00:00:32.489> basically<00:00:32.790> what<00:00:32.940> i'm<00:00:33.059> going

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
technique but basically what i'm going

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.250 
technique but basically what i'm going
to<00:00:33.210> do<00:00:33.300> like<00:00:33.480> i<00:00:33.570> said<00:00:33.750> there's<00:00:33.809> just<00:00:34.020> cut<00:00:34.170> it

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
to do like i said there's just cut it

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.709 
to do like i said there's just cut it
apart<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.680> feed<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.270> let<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.480> put

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
apart and feed it to you and let you put

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.330 
apart and feed it to you and let you put
it<00:00:36.809> back<00:00:36.899> together<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:37.559> for<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.980> first<00:00:38.190> drum

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
it back together so for a first drum

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.770 
it back together so for a first drum
beat<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.610> kind<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.879> weird<00:00:38.910> little<00:00:39.210> rhythm

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
beat it's kind of a weird little rhythm

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.170 
beat it's kind of a weird little rhythm
that<00:00:40.050> kind<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.710> everywhere<00:00:41.579> honestly

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
that kind of is everywhere honestly

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.240 
that kind of is everywhere honestly
that's<00:00:43.079> why<00:00:43.200> i'm<00:00:43.320> breaking<00:00:43.620> imparts<00:00:43.980> kind<00:00:44.040> of

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
that's why i'm breaking imparts kind of

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.319 
that's why i'm breaking imparts kind of
the<00:00:44.309> easiest<00:00:44.670> thing<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.969> i'll<00:00:45.030> show<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.210> to

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
the easiest thing and i'll show it to

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:57.080 
the easiest thing and i'll show it to
you<00:00:45.420> here<00:00:54.860> to<00:00:55.860> try<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.129> learn<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.969> need

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
you here to try and learn this you need

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.180 
you here to try and learn this you need
to<00:00:57.180> try<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.449> separate<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.840> into<00:00:57.989> parts<00:00:58.410> that's

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
to try and separate it into parts that's

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.959 
to try and separate it into parts that's
the<00:00:59.250> only<00:00:59.399> way<00:00:59.489> you're<00:00:59.609> really<00:00:59.789> going<00:00:59.910> to
