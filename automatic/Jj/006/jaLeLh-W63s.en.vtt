00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
to come on a lot of the other guys we're

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.859 
to come on a lot of the other guys we're
actually<00:01:22.860> using<00:01:23.159> repose<00:01:23.729> you're<00:01:24.540> doing<00:01:24.750> this

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
actually using repose you're doing this

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.590 
actually using repose you're doing this
to<00:01:25.020> work<00:01:25.140> over<00:01:25.439> some<00:01:25.939> subsurface<00:01:26.939> vegetation

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
to work over some subsurface vegetation

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.270 
to work over some subsurface vegetation
so<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.930> short<00:01:31.170> little<00:01:31.320> six<00:01:31.650> inch<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.920> one<00:01:32.070> foot

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
so the short little six inch to one foot

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.910 
so the short little six inch to one foot
taps<00:01:32.840> it's<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.930> bit<00:01:34.110> cutting<00:01:34.409> hard<00:01:34.619> side<00:01:34.799> to

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
taps it's a bit cutting hard side to

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.680 
taps it's a bit cutting hard side to
side

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.320 

we<00:01:38.690> start<00:01:38.900> giving<00:01:39.020> it<00:01:39.380> more<00:01:40.160> longer<00:01:40.820> bushier

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
we start giving it more longer bushier

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.100 
we start giving it more longer bushier
poles<00:01:41.570> it<00:01:42.260> would<00:01:42.380> drive<00:01:42.560> that<00:01:42.770> bait<00:01:42.950> down<00:01:44.110> it

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
poles it would drive that bait down it

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.350 
poles it would drive that bait down it
won't<00:01:45.290> cut<00:01:45.470> so<00:01:45.680> hard<00:01:45.860> side<00:01:46.070> to<00:01:46.190> side<00:01:46.400> I<00:01:49.360> think

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
won't cut so hard side to side I think

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.030 
won't cut so hard side to side I think
it<00:01:50.450> know<00:01:50.600> to<00:01:50.630> reef<00:01:50.930> odds<00:01:51.140> are<00:01:51.320> alike<00:01:51.590> they're
