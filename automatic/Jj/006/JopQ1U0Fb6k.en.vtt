00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.900
 Hello, we continue with exercise 12 in 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.790
 its number 4 we replaced it our 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.450
 polynomial by the values ​​given for the 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:16.000
 letters have over know it's a 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:19.990
 third about b that is a half less m 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.480
 about n mg6 of a tree to return to 6 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.650
 fraction over 1 placed it to go back 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.150
 the fraction about n that is a quarter 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.820
 so that barbosa the extraction for 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.030
 to be able to apply oriental inter-regions more 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.440
 2 is what appears in my exercise 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.020
 now I am going to apply laws of the ear 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.010
 in this in both cases extreme product 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:46.710
 internal products 31 x 22 and placed it 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:49.030
 up over 3 per 13 and placed less 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.020
 he also applied this law of the ear 6 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:57.340
 for 4 24 1 for 11 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:01.810
 + 2 then this would be equal to two 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:07.060
 thirds minus 24 over 1 is the same as 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:10.750
 have 24 plus 2 true this would be equal to 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.130
 two thirds minus 24 plus 2 would give us 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.410
 minus 22 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.360
 finally I will do this operation of 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.270
 fractions to do this operation of 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.619
 fractions to 21 with 1 below then 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.030
 two thirds minus 22 on 1 as they are 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.430
 they have different denominators 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:32.170
 multiplied 3 by 1 3 that now in raw 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:38.560
 by at least 3 by 22 that 66 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:40.600
 2 - 66 would be minus 64 over 3 minus 64 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.450
 thirds would be the numerical value for the 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.560
 expression give 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.909
 5 then we have squared to stress 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.390
 then squared about 3 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:58.750
 - b squared times 4 raised to 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:02.770
 square over two plus m squared 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.120
 squared let's first raise the 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.740
 squares 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:12.790
 then equal 3 squared and 9 over 3 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:16.620
 minus four squares 16 over two more 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.620
 6 squares 36 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.980
 these actions after the division of 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:28.570
 up to 39 lived between 3,003 minus 16 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:32.890
 divided between 28 plus 36 videos 6 that I 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:37.630
 you do now we operate 3 minus 8 I would give 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.640
 minus 5 minus 56 equals 11 is the 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.130
 numerical value for our polynomial 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.060
 dice 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:49.290
 6 then we have three fifths that 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:54.140
 multiply but it is one third less 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:59.330
 a means that multiplies b &amp; b is four 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:02.050
 plus two multiplying of idea 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.270
 with the 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.070
 here we have several subtraction sums 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.370
 multiplications the first thing that we should 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.660
 do multiplications always 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.790
 then first three fifths for a 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:18.069
 third 3 times 1 is 3 times 5 times 3 15 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.069
 - We continue with this multiplication 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:26.939
 in order to multiply we place a 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.939
 94 now if not for 44 and 2 for 1-2 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.260
 we also place 19 under these for 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.220
 can multiply with this fraction 2 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.740
 for 1 2 and 1 for 2 2 now I'm going to 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:43.120
 simplify we can draw on this third 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:46.000
 up and down 33 divided 31 influenced 3 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.220
 if there is this exact average division 4 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.069
 divided between two has given me and this 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:55.599
 edition also two videos 2 1 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:58.340
 we continue here we have a fifth 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:00.530
 minus two plus one would give me minus one 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.060
 then I would only miss this 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.489
 then I will do that operation 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.019
 a fifth minus one to be able to do that 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.870
 attraction to the one placed you with one 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.639
 below to return it fraction and as the 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.700
 denominators are different multiplied 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:18.049
 5 by 15 and now in cross one by one one 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:21.280
 minus five times 151 minus five times 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.860
 minus four out of five 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.710
 would give me minus four fifths of that 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.260
 operation will be equal to minus four 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.210
 fifths with minus four fifths is the 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.210
 numerical value for the given polynomial
