00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:17.060
 who in his room at 2 computer has 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:23.350
 undertaken to understand all 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:27.670
 mechanical than his insolent science 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:31.860
 already I do not stop they parade and 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:36.380
 often seeing themselves overhanging 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:40.500
 far from the top of his tower the menus 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:45.720
 contingency of beasts two there for that 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:50.760
 the extreme indigence pushed it's too much 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:53.550
 con to sit on the floor today 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.830
 in the living room poor console players 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.210
 it's stupid since when the inspector 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.350
 mustache sings it wants nothing 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.510
 to say characters not enough 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.000
 the mustache inspector who is that then 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.350
 and her executives she gorillas them 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.680
 in love with public benches and has no 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.680
 culture what you do not really deserve 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.720
 indeed there are two kinds of players 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.549
 the pc players and the others the 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.759
 first sounds distils the cleverest 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.770
 will necessarily already pc players they will 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.810
 move with their pc what to go 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.369
 where there are plenty of players 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.619
 also move with their pc 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.149
 it must be multi-use then 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.820
 that it's not too much for that does it 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.549
 it's big it's in several parts and 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.710
 where he will have to invent a kind of pc but 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.270
 portable culture it is there a 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.460
 handle I even know some guys and 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.460
 gives life then have no views but 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.619
 open yeah my past it's called 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.660
 nordine because it's a computer my 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.210
 month gym gym kill i call it gamecube 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.649
 must also say the gamecube you can not 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.570
 too low attached that you do not find 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.149
 too much to customize them you can not too much 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.539
 put neon lights in it while it's 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.100
 too good we say you see rdpc he 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.760
 is closer to his machine than the 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.350
 console player 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.030
 so let's try to understand together what 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.560
 which serves more as a judgment of 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.170
 value to most observers 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.940
 watch this player 50 centimeters to 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.560
 hardly separates him from his computer then 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.030
 that this one if he wants to go back 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.620
 physically in touch with the machine 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.570
 who makes his game turn must 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.019
 move a distance of at least 3 m 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.670
 50 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.560
 so we can without creasing the 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.870
 skeptics say that the pc player is 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.860
 closer to his machine and those of 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.840
 three meters on average 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.030
 so this proximity creates intimacy 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.060
 a report that sometimes borders 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.650
 passionate alexandra why are you doing to 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.209
 but what have I done to you 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.709
 speak to their pc as she accompanies 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.140
 of their days are always astonished 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.810
 the young woman is the mood factor I 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.519
 it would put a chip update these drivers 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.950
 be careful though not to push the 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.340
 confusion too far darling I come back 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.250
 that our relationship is bad 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.730
 although nothing else is going like a bang 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.629
 so I'm going to have to format that 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.760
 the pc player m 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.250
 it is true custom customize its 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.510
 machine but it also customizes their game 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.430
 and then it becomes immediately more 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.930
 problematic for publishers ah no 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.239
 do not like them well that pc players a 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.519
 cd sagouin they do nothing at all 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.379
 crush and go on that I cracked you up game 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.099
 and go ahead that I ex sharing modes 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.730
 it's free 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.620
 put for free and that indeed the 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.540
 modding is more than a tradition on pc 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.849
 it is a priesthood for this community 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.440
 and this since the very beginning gives duke 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.700
 nukem starcraft all these young people have 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.920
 benefited from the players of 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.030
 additional optimization campaign 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.709
 graph and some of them have 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.569
 even given birth to other games 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.980
 having their own logic of play and 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.900
 operating autonomously 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.730
 warcraft 3 is a game with mechanics 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.019
 known to everyone also what was not 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.489
 the surprise of the players and 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.379
 developers that to see emerge from 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.790
 this classic base a game like ôta 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.620
 who invented a new gameplay 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.870
 proposed in the end a brand new 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.000
 experience from a simple maps of the 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.500
 original game this free mode has made 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.579
 emulated and even gave birth to a 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.200
 full genre 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.269
 the battle queen online 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.040
 multiplayer also called moba and 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.350
 whose representative in fashion and league 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.120
 of legend yes good except that lol it's not 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.540
 completely free 1Gervais type of 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.310
 riot 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.630
 they took up the same principle 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.340
 to say that they have outright pumps and 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.729
 amateurs and he makes it a case that 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.620
 market 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.419
 that's the difference between 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.039
 amateurs and professionals the engineering 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.870
 sometimes it's just to find the right one 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:24.710
 business model when a publisher on a 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.060
 pc game 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.950
 he knows that this one is going to be 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.270
 tinker in every way many 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.530
 are the players waiting for the gta 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.160
 so on pc before doing it 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.720
 acquisition 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.099
 these players know that on this 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.840
 platform only all 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.340
 fantasies will be allowed them you 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.650
 see we already see that I'm going to edit 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.450
 some cars so here a ferrari 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.680
 he replaces to tourissimo it's true that 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.060
 that's what's crazy huh anyway 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.470
 place and it stays at the machine of all 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.880
 the possible I mean on caen without 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.770
 everything is blocked from the circuit board 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.900
 distribution channels to the top 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.039
 on pc a name hack lara croft 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.050
 we had it naked and it's us who 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.789
 did it to let go of some players 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.740
 a sense of superiority 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:59.840
 the pc player sometimes think of themselves as a 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.550
 über spieler open on the novelty 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.880
 not afraid to penetrate to 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.560
 ribs 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.060
 even of the game it must be said that it is 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.250
 often very comfortable with numbers 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.530
 take it for example on 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.430
 consoles the fifa and pes but the games of 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.860
 most popular foot in the 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.180
 pc communities are the management games 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.580
 management as the series of 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.010
 football manager and for good reason as the 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.380
 fps and the rts the management game is 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.190
 historically very marked pcc on 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.410
 this platform that his and 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.030
 civilizations sin city ​​and even the sims 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.200
 this game is one of the biggest 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.670
 success of the history of video games is 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.130
 besides, the perfect example of what 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.960
 allows support the infinite modding the 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.970
 excessive customization and of course 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:42.260
 the ultimate machinima tribute that can 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:43.760
 make a player to his favorite game the 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.020
 machinima is a practice that consists of 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.850
 to consider the game as a tool for 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.960
 video creation in its own right and to 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.310
 content with its graphics engine for 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.670
 to express the most delusions 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.200
 crazy 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.760
 if we were to mention some games 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.960
 particularly exploited for this purpose 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.690
 could think of course to team fortress 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.660
 world of warcraft gta iv or again 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.100
 minecraft little anecdote player's freight 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.570
 of the attic himself made his first 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.700
 weapons as a director and editor 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.640
 by creating motor-based videos 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.440
 of dark age of camelot confirms 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.000
 pc players creativity was very 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.110
 solicited and encouraged by 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.670
 developers who have often put 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.770
 provision of the players of the publishers of 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.090
 campaign cards or even sometimes 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.010
 script editors as in 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.390
 neverwinter nights the game in the countryside 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.620
 pretty poor solo and comes with 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.540
 all the tools that might have 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.950
 need ambitious gamers who 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.540
 would like to create content and 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.520
 shepherds on a server to create their 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.930
 own persistent world then of course 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.440
 the pc player has the means of his 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.120
 ambitions 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.620
 its hardware is expensive its 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.930
 extensive knowledge and his insurance 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.210
 unshakeable but be careful not to 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.740
 confusing insurance and arrogance if the 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.030
 contempt of pc players for players 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.620
 console and sometimes palpable 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.760
 can we go so far as to say that he 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.410
 is akin to some form of 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.760
 class scorn on the part of people who 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.500
 have the means to invest in 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.850
 advanced equipment which is reminiscent of the 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.770
 is not given to everyone 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.330
 so to you who look down on what 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.130
 play on the living room consoles remember 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.410
 not this cioran phrase that said 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.850
 as soon as someone tells me about elite I 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.120
 know that I'm in the presence of a 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.120
 dumbass
