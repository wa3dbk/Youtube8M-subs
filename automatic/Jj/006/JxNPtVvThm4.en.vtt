hold it above the hook shank and we're

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.219 
hold it above the hook shank and we're
going<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:00.520> come<00:02:00.759> up<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.360> over<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:02.020> wrap

going to come up and over and wrap

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:08.310 
going to come up and over and wrap
tighten<00:02:03.810> tighter<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.670> tightest<00:02:06.930> okay<00:02:07.930> one

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
tighten tighter and tightest okay one

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.620

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.960 
two three tight tighter and tightest
then<00:02:11.560> we're<00:02:11.680> going<00:02:11.769> to<00:02:11.829> separate<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.549> bundles

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
then we're going to separate the bundles

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.979 
then we're going to separate the bundles
up<00:02:13.180> top<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.810> expose<00:02:14.769> the<00:02:14.799> hook<00:02:15.130> shank<00:02:15.989> we're

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
up top to expose the hook shank we're

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.400 
up top to expose the hook shank we're
going<00:02:17.079> to<00:02:17.170> wrap<00:02:17.350> behind<00:02:17.829> the<00:02:18.280> eye<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:18.910> hook

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
going to wrap behind the eye of the hook

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.840 
going to wrap behind the eye of the hook
like<00:02:20.410> so

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.360 

and<00:02:24.600> again<00:02:25.080> maybe<00:02:25.260> seven<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.770> eight<00:02:25.830> wraps<00:02:26.130> or

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
and again maybe seven to eight wraps or

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:42.509 
and again maybe seven to eight wraps or
so<00:02:26.810> we'll<00:02:27.810> go<00:02:27.990> ahead<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.230> we'll<00:02:28.380> whip<00:02:28.560> finish

about the base of the hook if we cut it
too<00:03:38.000> close<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.449> the<00:03:38.540> base<00:03:38.719> it'll<00:03:39.079> actually

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
too close to the base it'll actually

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.920 
too close to the base it'll actually
disappear<00:03:40.129> in<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.400> eyeball<00:03:40.969> as<00:03:41.180> its<00:03:41.419> formed
