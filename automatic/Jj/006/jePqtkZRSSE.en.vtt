as<00:00:25.380> we<00:00:25.560> know<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.300> first<00:00:27.599> release

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
as we know it this is the first release

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.669 
as we know it this is the first release
in<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.529> TLT<00:00:29.099> one<00:00:29.670> chassis<00:00:30.300> series<00:00:30.720> only<00:00:31.380> one

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
in the TLT one chassis series only one

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.440 
in the TLT one chassis series only one
other<00:00:31.890> vehicle<00:00:32.489> was<00:00:32.730> released<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.270> that

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
other vehicle was released on that

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.690 
other vehicle was released on that
chassis<00:00:33.719> but<00:00:34.440> what's<00:00:34.700> historically

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
chassis but what's historically

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.600 
chassis but what's historically
significant<00:00:36.420> about<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.989> TLT<00:00:37.350> one<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.370> that

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
significant about the TLT one is that

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.010 
significant about the TLT one is that
when<00:00:38.940> hobbyists<00:00:39.480> got<00:00:39.690> it

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
when hobbyists got it

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.130 
when hobbyists got it
they<00:00:40.350> realized<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.890> take<00:00:41.550> off<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.940> body<00:00:42.210> and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
they realized that take off the body and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.920 
they realized that take off the body and
take<00:00:43.350> off<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.890> entire<00:00:44.250> main<00:00:44.940> chassis<00:00:45.329> piece

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
take off the entire main chassis piece

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.250 
take off the entire main chassis piece
and<00:00:46.350> you're<00:00:46.860> left<00:00:47.010> with<00:00:47.129> these<00:00:47.820> axles<00:00:48.360> these

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.410 
and you're left with these axles these
axles<00:00:49.680> are<00:00:49.829> very<00:00:50.010> useful<00:00:50.460> for<00:00:50.489> custom-built

sand people quickly realize that

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.060 
sand people quickly realize that

it<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.119> me<00:01:33.240> originally<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.020> get<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.439> see

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
it to me originally so you get to see

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.300 
it to me originally so you get to see
where<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:36.329> crawler<00:01:36.960> craze<00:01:37.350> came<00:01:37.740> from<00:01:38.009> and

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
where the crawler craze came from and

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.749 
where the crawler craze came from and
what<00:01:38.909> its<00:01:39.060> humble<00:01:39.210> beginnings<00:01:39.750> were<00:01:40.579> so<00:01:41.579> here

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
what its humble beginnings were so here

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.760 
what its humble beginnings were so here
we<00:01:41.850> go<00:01:42.000> with<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.240> bill<00:01:42.420> comes<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.560> compact

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
we go with the bill comes in a compact

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.830 
we go with the bill comes in a compact
little<00:01:44.220> box<00:01:44.520> with<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> handle<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.570> it's

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
little box with a handle on it so it's

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.179 
little box with a handle on it so it's
easy<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.320> take<00:01:46.470> out<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.920> store<00:01:47.159> and

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
easy to take out of the store and

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.460 
easy to take out of the store and
everything<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.540> very<00:01:48.720> first<00:01:48.930> thing<00:01:49.079> that

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
everything and the very first thing that

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.249 
everything and the very first thing that
you<00:01:49.590> go<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.520> put<00:01:51.270> together<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.840> something<00:01:52.140> that

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
you go to put together is something that

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.960 
you go to put together is something that
you<00:01:52.380> really<00:01:52.649> don't<00:01:52.770> expect<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.520> see<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:53.939> a

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
you really don't expect to see on a

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.959 
you really don't expect to see on a
monster<00:01:54.479> truck<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.560> ball<00:01:55.969> differential

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.450 
monster truck it's a ball differential
not<00:01:57.810> only<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.290> but<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.950> pulley

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
not only that but it's a pulley

you<00:04:49.990> have<00:04:50.380> true<00:04:50.770> four-wheel<00:04:51.430> steering<00:04:51.790> but<00:04:52.390> I

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
you have true four-wheel steering but I

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.780 
you have true four-wheel steering but I
kept<00:04:52.750> it<00:04:52.870> simple<00:04:53.080> and<00:04:53.380> just<00:04:53.740> put<00:04:54.460> it<00:04:54.550> on<00:04:54.670> the

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
kept it simple and just put it on the

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.270 
kept it simple and just put it on the
front<00:04:55.030> only<00:04:55.410> now<00:04:56.410> it's<00:04:56.590> time<00:04:56.800> to<00:04:56.950> look<00:04:57.040> at<00:04:57.190> the

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
front only now it's time to look at the

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.460 
front only now it's time to look at the
shocks<00:04:57.580> and<00:04:57.910> the<00:04:58.360> inner<00:04:58.510> diameter<00:04:58.780> of<00:04:59.320> these

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
shocks and the inner diameter of these

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.590 
shocks and the inner diameter of these
shocks<00:04:59.830> is<00:05:00.040> actually<00:05:00.400> very<00:05:00.670> small<00:05:01.030> you<00:05:01.480> can

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
shocks is actually very small you can

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.170 
shocks is actually very small you can
see<00:05:01.630> on<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.140> shaft<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:02.980> piston<00:05:03.490> is<00:05:03.640> actually

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
see on the shaft the piston is actually

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.510 
see on the shaft the piston is actually
on<00:05:04.840> there<00:05:05.200> and<00:05:05.350> it's<00:05:05.500> barely<00:05:05.830> larger<00:05:06.400> in

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
on there and it's barely larger in

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.550 
on there and it's barely larger in
diameter<00:05:06.670> than<00:05:07.240> the<00:05:07.300> tiny<00:05:07.750> little<00:05:07.990> Eclipse

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
diameter than the tiny little Eclipse

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.600 
diameter than the tiny little Eclipse
that<00:05:09.220> fasten<00:05:09.850> it<00:05:09.970> on<00:05:10.120> very<00:05:10.990> small<00:05:11.320> diameter

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
that fasten it on very small diameter

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.750 
that fasten it on very small diameter
not<00:05:12.610> a<00:05:12.640> lot<00:05:13.060> of<00:05:13.260> displacement<00:05:14.260> and<00:05:14.500> no<00:05:15.340> volume

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
not a lot of displacement and no volume

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.360 
not a lot of displacement and no volume
compensation<00:05:16.680> so<00:05:17.680> you<00:05:17.770> have<00:05:17.890> to<00:05:18.010> build<00:05:18.220> these

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
compensation so you have to build these

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.550 
compensation so you have to build these
shocks<00:05:18.700> with<00:05:19.150> a<00:05:19.180> certain<00:05:19.630> amount<00:05:19.810> of<00:05:19.960> air<00:05:20.350> in

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
shocks with a certain amount of air in

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.650 
shocks with a certain amount of air in
them<00:05:20.800> to<00:05:21.280> keep<00:05:21.460> them<00:05:21.640> from<00:05:21.820> going<00:05:22.030> into<00:05:22.240> hydro

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
them to keep them from going into hydro

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.990

block<00:05:22.840> immediately<00:05:23.160> the<00:05:24.160> way<00:05:24.340> that<00:05:24.580> you<00:05:24.790> get

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
block immediately the way that you get

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.600 
block immediately the way that you get
the<00:05:25.600> amount<00:05:25.930> of<00:05:26.140> air<00:05:26.320> the<00:05:26.560> same<00:05:26.770> between<00:05:27.430> all

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
you go through the whole process four

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.810 
you go through the whole process four
times<00:05:55.810> and<00:05:56.320> you<00:05:56.530> get<00:05:56.710> four<00:05:56.980> shocks<00:05:57.280> like<00:05:57.430> so

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
times and you get four shocks like so

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.690 
times and you get four shocks like so
all<00:05:58.330> identical
