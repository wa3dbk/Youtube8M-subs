00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:12.320
 Here I continue to believe he is his 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:15.440
 wolfs want to tell you on the stove here 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.440
 stove regulator 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.869
 temperature is the position of the flaps 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.410
 In general, I want to tell a person I want to 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.010
 tell what surprised me I thought 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.000
 water car damper 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.130
 switches due to cable systems 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.780
 as usual old cars 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.790
 the name of the old will was like a ford in my 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:45.570
 in this system is very interesting that for 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:50.330
 vacuum account is no cable here 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:55.080
 But if I translate regulator won some 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:58.530
 there was a sound there was a car now 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:02.120
 a pumped up vacuum is no longer 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.800
 heard this sound and due to this 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.820
 these flaps 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.010
 switch well, I donâ€™t know reliably this 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.530
 system or not such a first time 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.780
 I generally encounter what I wanted 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.990
 vacuum and vacuum amplifiers have 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.530
 switches, these valves will run here 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:31.960
 here you can see 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:35.259
 it is permissible on the valve only there 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.549
 the vacuum is worth this here is a little thing 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.549
 move now 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.200
 here 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:03.930
 the remaining vacuum boosters are located 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.620
 from this side under the console year if 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.709
 seen out 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:15.350
 tube this apb1 it is 2 away 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:21.000
 here and they switch all these positions 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:26.100
 systems are very interesting shorter in general 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.870
 such a system in this volvo will do 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.520
 winter is coming we will see 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.520
 how reliable is the stove
