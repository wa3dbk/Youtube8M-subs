 everyone likes owls they are cute and funny 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.510
 Apparently companies asus share this 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.639
 opinion because just recently she 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.650
 launched another series of gaming 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.920

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.730
 birds of the Savin family today we 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.490
 consider one of these company Saturdays 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.710
 asus computer mouse strix club this 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.630
 wired mouse for fans of shooter and 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.000
 and the body is made of matt black 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.450
 plastic gray inserts on the sides 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.040
 only the scroll wheel is rubberized on 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.110
 bottom paddles in yellow 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.879
 winks the series logo the same 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.469

 indicator of the selected mode 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.120
 The sensitivity of the mouse is quite large. 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.280
 it fits well with the palm of your hand and 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.590
 like the owners of a wide gaming 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.870
 arms but exclude other types of grip not 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.730
 it is worth the case is well thought out so 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.129

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.530
 rubber inserts mouse is great 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.210
 in the hand and does not slip the bottom of the mouse 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.190
 looks classic around the edges 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.589
 teflon legs due to which klo 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.869
 good gliding on all surfaces and 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.330
 in the center of one of the best sensors its 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.680
 class from picsart with resolution to 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.340
 5000 children 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.400
 ucla total 8 buttons main wheel 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.860
 sensitivity shift button this and 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.659
 side arrows down up and big 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.070
 which includes sniper mode 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.409
 installing a proprietary software 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.720
 software can all be migrated to 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.180
 Use your own utility very much 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.090
 just not just two main points mouse 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.640
 and the macro here is changing the button assignment 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.470
 and operate with profiles in this tab 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.570
 set the desired dipiai level 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.100
 all four modes and sensitivity 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.750
 sniper can be customized 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.670
 sensitivity even x and y 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.950
 coordinate which is quite useful for 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.170
 shooters here is sensor calibration under 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.210
 used surface and timing 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.880
 the response of the last tab is only two 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.000
 features wheel light and logo 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.829
 they can be turned on or off but here 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.420
 here macros are written later 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.670
 come back and bind ready 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.460
 macro to one of the buttons there are no complaints 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.930
 on the side buttons move the scroll wheel 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.759
 soft and cuddly 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.240
 true main keys are pressed 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.850
 pretty easy but 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.320
 this can get used asus strix cl 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.150
 leave exceptionally good 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.150
 the impression is very comfortable and pleasant 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.430
 mouse hand does not get tired at all 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.130
 minus q is smoothness and 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.130
 This is confirmed by the test set to 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.750
 her sensor is clearly capable of more 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.150
 this is completely solved by updating the firmware 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.010
 which I think will be released soon 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.020
 testing we took two branded 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.690
 rugs asus from the same saviny series 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.660
 strix flight control and strix glide asleep 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.260
 rim they are you with dimensions of 300 to 400 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.270
 millimeters 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.880
 they are quite dense leveled in a day 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.680
 each edge stitched seriously 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.930
 increases durability base 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.210
 rubberized so the mat is not 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.670
 slides on the table light control more 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.800
 Shershan on it the mouse is less inertial 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.960
 sleeper sleeper sleek better fit 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.880
 lovers to shoot a mouse on it 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.830
 slides better horizontally than along 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.290
 verticals by the way in the utility even have 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.300
 presets for each of the rugs whole 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.460
 strix looks promising 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.740
 strix claw is a great computer 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.260
 a mouse that fits perfectly 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.110
 any type of grip and enjoy almost 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.040
 Any fan of computer games 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.230
 near future we will tell and and 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.430
 other representatives of this line 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.430
