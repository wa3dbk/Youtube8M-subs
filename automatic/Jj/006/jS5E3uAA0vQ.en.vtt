00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
anyway so one other than catch malaria

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.350 
anyway so one other than catch malaria
vaccine<00:00:54.060> instead<00:00:55.640> but<00:00:56.640> then<00:00:56.790> first<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.149> would

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
vaccine instead but then first you would

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.260 
vaccine instead but then first you would
have<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.690> invent<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.770> malaria<00:00:59.160> vaccine<00:00:59.640> right

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.639 

you<00:01:03.270> don't<00:01:03.420> think<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:03.720> possible<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:04.290> didn't

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
you don't think it's possible I didn't

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.400 
you don't think it's possible I didn't
say<00:01:04.800> that<00:01:04.940> you<00:01:05.940> know<00:01:05.970> styling<00:01:06.600> multi-tone

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
say that you know styling multi-tone

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.010 
say that you know styling multi-tone
only<00:01:08.130> by<00:01:08.280> reputation<00:01:08.550> both<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.540> them<00:01:09.660> believed

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
only by reputation both of them believed

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.469 
only by reputation both of them believed
you<00:01:10.200> could<00:01:10.350> transfer<00:01:10.950> ideology<00:01:11.790> by<00:01:12.119> breathing

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
you could transfer ideology by breathing

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.780 
you could transfer ideology by breathing
one<00:01:12.840> indoctrinated<00:01:13.649> generation<00:01:14.399> to<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.670> next

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
one indoctrinated generation to the next

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.510 
one indoctrinated generation to the next
and<00:01:15.690> eventually<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.350> would<00:01:16.560> get<00:01:16.710> genetically

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
and eventually you would get genetically

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.279 
and eventually you would get genetically
programmed<00:01:18.649> communists<00:01:19.649> I<00:01:20.899> mean<00:01:21.899> I<00:01:21.990> know<00:01:22.020> this

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
programmed communists I mean I know this

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.570 
programmed communists I mean I know this
sounds<00:01:22.470> like<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.740> little<00:01:23.039> bit<00:01:23.160> crazy<00:01:23.990> but<00:01:25.580> it
