00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 he must be like that , we do not want to 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.520
 turn so can not turn around 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.230
 stand 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.230
 16:15 now have the volunteer 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.910
 Fire brigade 3 you lay down there like that 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.619
 a dirty little one recognizes just that 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.880
 tombstones on the multiplayer maps 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.880
 century you hear voices 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:31.529
 biggest motion capture is for games 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.269
 not quiet and usually you get yourself 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.219
 for absolute professional actor 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:37.170
 but sometimes an exception 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.420
 such as america s next 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.980
 top model winner norah james die 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.460
 namely, for the multiplayer mode 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.360
 by uncharted 3 for lr tord movement 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.879
 rehearse and motion capturing of it 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.729
 What you countries means but can be so close 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.629
 you can also swallow a few or 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:56.629
 neglect or forget 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:08.689
 mobile phone case is micro transactions 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.920
 the devil peter molyneux is the devil 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.450
 clearly why offer that he is the god 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.829
 in the next month title may personify 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.229
 if only he has one last blog 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.820
 Mysterious big blogs mad klopp is 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.100
 pretty wet but for that 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.369
 maddest is to offer in app purchase 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.569
 But not so new for the battle 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.829
 $ 75,000 of the diamonds title 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:29.640
 so taste with at least the 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:31.799
 tapping power by the factor 100 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.240
 I do not know if that's good I have 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.439
 suppose it is good it is on everyone 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.439
 expensive and that's a lot 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:43.259
 gta 5 he is known to be pretty 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.909
 quickly rather like nicola alluded to 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.069
 and about the publisher should also 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.369
 be really happy because at least 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:53.149
 has him playing nearly 137 million 5 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.420
 dollar in development did not cost 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.010
 the almost 3 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:04.730
 60 million dollars again for 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:06.080
 marketing costs have been censored 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.490
 is basically a silly idea and 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.720
 sometimes simply not easy 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.460
 comprehensible why for example 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.930
 can get better and more comfortable in the 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.730
 American and European version 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.480
 by mario kart no champagne though 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.290
 they won 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.290
 in japan I'm only allowed to say that 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.990
 By the way, another game 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.690
 quite rightly made a lot of coal 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.730
 Incidentally, the highlight is probably the 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.020
 are very close to their original one 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.210
 kickstart drifted past the target 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.870
 instead of having the planned $ 27,000 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:43.110
 that's just time out 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:47.180
 645,000 dollars cashed and left of 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.910
 tresens stealing credit card to the mum 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.100
 exactly the first on a video game 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.050
 By the way, based film was super mario 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.610
 bros and no not the ones you are 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.440
 unfortunately , but one must think 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.720
 60 minutes of animation we unfortunately 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.430
 only in japan the beautiful name and 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.660
 Love Japan still hates many people 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:11.660
 me not great mario you have the 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:16.440
 teenager to 36 in or just super marios 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.300
 rescue princess peach pit lay even the 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.590
 first real movies on one 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.560
 Incidentally, video game was based as well 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.540
 Super 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:29.400
 With that said yes you often play online 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.770
 the clock still tanks with a referat max 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.750
 he often plays online namely mother the 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.220
 record for most battles in 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.650
 shortest time sometime has 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.460
 namely since spring 2014 already far 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:51.730
 over 22,000 tank battles on the 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:54.730
 xbox 360 deployed the sÃ¤ntis 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.680
 again apps and again not storms 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.480
 because though she is not great and clash 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.220
 of plants inexplicably how stupid 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.569
 Sale was none of the apps that rp as 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.010
 First a billion dollar turnover 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.540
 that was either that 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.069
 farmville or if we are on the top floor 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.959
 exclusive limited puzzles and 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.640
 dragons and one of the apps mentioned here 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.640
 is actually pretty great 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.669
 Even game developers have to go now and then 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.250
 as a clown so that there is no confusion 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.229
 is there at nintendo of america whole 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.870
 clear marking on in thuringia 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:32.590
 idea for the gentlemen a pietsch for the 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.590
 ladies so one 40 women and one 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:39.190
 baby for the likes actually gives 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.410
 By the way, if there is one 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.930
 Man and a woman have a very nice doll 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.120
 then there's the government and the one for her 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.680
 the industry is the bees and man 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.830
 could we say the wg in the forties 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.820
 he has to take care that he bites 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.930
 Do not write too much tells us 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.930
 the teeth speak up 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:07.389
 nuclear statement remaining six- channel service 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:09.190
 from streams and in quite a few and frodo 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:12.780
 just noticed against the turn 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:15.070
 that his camera is broken for mandy 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.720
 Now I have to buy a new camera 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.190
 must stand new life start up front 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.240
 then just a cell phone and that 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.620
 just grab the front 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.580
 I hope twice as much had 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.470
 it's so stupid you're supposed to be one 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.860
 not sustainable at all so you go 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.750
 not with his money 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.580
 the only thing that is sustainable is look 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.360
 times 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.319
 just look as far as I look 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.949
 I just look can I see you in the 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:41.949
 game humor
