earlier so that is all you have to do if

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.650

spots and acne marks and redness going
on<00:02:22.970> just<00:02:23.269> concentrate<00:02:23.810> on<00:02:23.840> those<00:02:24.170> areas<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.830> I

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
on just concentrate on those areas and I

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.190 
on just concentrate on those areas and I
think<00:02:25.670> using<00:02:26.390> it<00:02:26.540> or<00:02:26.720> applying<00:02:27.049> the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
think using it or applying the

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.920 
think using it or applying the
foundation<00:02:27.319> with<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:28.100> Beauty<00:02:28.459> Blender<00:02:28.780> helps<00:02:29.780> a

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
foundation with a Beauty Blender helps a

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.020 
foundation with a Beauty Blender helps a
lot<00:02:30.109> because<00:02:30.410> it<00:02:31.130> just<00:02:31.400> makes<00:02:31.670> everything

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
lot because it just makes everything

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.940 
lot because it just makes everything
super<00:02:32.329> blended<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.109> now<00:02:33.380> we're<00:02:33.590> going<00:02:33.709> to<00:02:33.799> do

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
super blended and now we're going to do

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:53.820 
super blended and now we're going to do
the<00:02:34.190> other<00:02:34.370> side<00:02:34.670> of<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.269> face

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.880 

and<00:02:55.330> this<00:02:56.330> is<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.570> foundation<00:02:56.720> all<00:02:57.380> over<00:02:57.410> in

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
and this is the foundation all over in

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.130 
and this is the foundation all over in
my<00:02:58.040> face<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.850> I<00:02:58.970> think<00:02:59.180> it<00:02:59.300> does<00:02:59.570> take<00:02:59.900> a

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
my face and I think it does take a

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.380 
my face and I think it does take a
little<00:03:00.350> bit<00:03:00.530> of<00:03:00.680> time<00:03:00.890> for<00:03:00.920> it<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:01.430> set<00:03:01.700> because

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
little bit of time for it to set because

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.740 
little bit of time for it to set because
I<00:03:02.420> can<00:03:02.780> feel<00:03:03.200> that<00:03:03.740> it<00:03:04.130> is<00:03:04.160> somewhat<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:05.030> dewy

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
I can feel that it is somewhat a dewy

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.290 
I can feel that it is somewhat a dewy
foundation<00:03:06.050> but<00:03:06.950> not<00:03:07.190> overly<00:03:07.580> dewy<00:03:07.880> so<00:03:08.150> it

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
foundation but not overly dewy so it

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.330 
foundation but not overly dewy so it
just<00:03:08.540> gives<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:08.990> the<00:03:09.140> right<00:03:09.350> amount<00:03:09.830> of<00:03:10.010> glow

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
just gives you the right amount of glow

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.490 
just gives you the right amount of glow
onto<00:03:10.760> your<00:03:10.910> face<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.480> since<00:03:12.080> I<00:03:12.320> have

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
onto your face and since I have

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.380 
onto your face and since I have
combination<00:03:13.130> skin<00:03:13.160> I'm<00:03:13.670> just<00:03:13.880> going<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.180> set

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
combination skin I'm just going to set

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.960 
combination skin I'm just going to set
this<00:03:14.600> foundation<00:03:15.200> with<00:03:15.770> powder<00:03:15.800> but<00:03:16.460> only<00:03:16.670> on

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
this foundation with powder but only on

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.580 
this foundation with powder but only on
the<00:03:17.120> areas<00:03:17.480> like<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:17.870> know<00:03:17.990> my<00:03:18.140> t-zone<00:03:18.530> area

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
the areas like you know my t-zone area

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.730 
the areas like you know my t-zone area
and<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:20.000> areas<00:03:20.360> where<00:03:20.540> I<00:03:20.570> tend<00:03:20.960> to<00:03:21.110> oil<00:03:21.410> up

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
and the areas where I tend to oil up

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.410 
and the areas where I tend to oil up
throughout<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.400> day<00:03:22.430> so<00:03:22.820> this<00:03:23.030> is<00:03:23.150> what<00:03:23.330> it

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
throughout the day so this is what it

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.840 
throughout the day so this is what it
looks<00:03:23.600> like<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:24.020> overall<00:03:24.980> I<00:03:25.250> really<00:03:25.460> like<00:03:25.730> the

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
looks like and overall I really like the

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.940 
looks like and overall I really like the
coverage<00:03:26.240> that<00:03:26.330> it<00:03:26.600> gives<00:03:26.870> because<00:03:27.380> you<00:03:27.800> know

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
coverage that it gives because you know

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.670 
coverage that it gives because you know
it<00:03:28.580> really<00:03:28.940> does<00:03:29.390> cover<00:03:30.080> up<00:03:30.350> all<00:03:30.530> those

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
it really does cover up all those

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.980 
it really does cover up all those
imperfections<00:03:31.040> like<00:03:31.550> acne<00:03:32.030> marks<00:03:32.210> dark<00:03:32.630> spots

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
imperfections like acne marks dark spots

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.380 
imperfections like acne marks dark spots
and<00:03:33.260> even<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.620> redness<00:03:33.980> if<00:03:34.220> you<00:03:34.760> saw<00:03:35.030> earlier

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
and even the redness if you saw earlier

and even the redness if you saw earlier

foundation on the t-zone area as

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.480 
foundation on the t-zone area as
something<00:03:51.080> from<00:03:51.260> Laura<00:03:51.500> Mercier<00:03:51.980> this<00:03:52.280> is

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
something from Laura Mercier this is

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.450 
something from Laura Mercier this is
their<00:03:53.020> translucent<00:03:54.020> powder<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:55.040> reason

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
their translucent powder and the reason

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.850 
their translucent powder and the reason
why<00:03:55.640> I'm<00:03:56.000> using<00:03:56.150> a<00:03:56.600> translucent<00:03:57.350> powder<00:03:57.410> is

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
why I'm using a translucent powder is

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.930 
why I'm using a translucent powder is
because<00:03:58.670> I<00:03:58.700> don't<00:03:59.270> want<00:03:59.630> to<00:03:59.810> affect<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:01.040> color

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
because I don't want to affect the color

felt<00:04:21.299> a<00:04:21.509> bit<00:04:21.810> sticky<00:04:22.199> on<00:04:22.590> areas<00:04:23.490> where<00:04:23.669> I<00:04:23.699> did

not<00:04:24.240> use<00:04:24.539> the<00:04:24.570> loose<00:04:24.990> powder<00:04:25.199> so<00:04:25.590> it's<00:04:25.800> just

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:26.009 
not use the loose powder so it's just

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.510 
not use the loose powder so it's just
you<00:04:26.160> know<00:04:26.389> a<00:04:27.389> bit<00:04:27.840> stickies<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:28.620> I<00:04:28.979> am<00:04:29.280> not

really<00:04:29.789> used<00:04:30.060> to<00:04:30.180> that<00:04:30.389> so<00:04:30.720> what<00:04:31.229> I'm<00:04:31.350> going<00:04:31.500> to

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
really used to that so what I'm going to

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.760 
really used to that so what I'm going to
do<00:04:31.680> is<00:04:31.949> set<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.400> entire<00:04:32.910> face<00:04:33.330> with<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:34.289> loose

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
do is set the entire face with the loose

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.150 
do is set the entire face with the loose
powder<00:04:35.039> and<00:04:35.660> that<00:04:36.660> way<00:04:37.020> it<00:04:37.680> won't<00:04:37.979> feel<00:04:38.340> as

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
powder and that way it won't feel as

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:50.440 
powder and that way it won't feel as
sticky<00:04:41.160> anymore

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450

my skin I personally and not bothered at
all<00:07:11.270> by<00:07:11.540> the<00:07:11.600> doing<00:07:11.960> this<00:07:12.080> because<00:07:12.440> it<00:07:12.620> is<00:07:12.740> not

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:12.770 
all by the doing this because it is not

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.860 
all by the doing this because it is not
something<00:07:13.280> that<00:07:13.490> a<00:07:13.670> little<00:07:14.030> bit<00:07:14.180> of<00:07:14.330> loose

something that a little bit of loose
powder<00:07:14.900> cannot<00:07:15.740> fix<00:07:16.100> so<00:07:16.340> I'm<00:07:16.490> probably<00:07:16.760> fine

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.270 
powder cannot fix so I'm probably fine

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.390

with<00:07:17.480> that<00:07:17.510> I<00:07:17.960> also<00:07:18.290> think<00:07:18.680> that<00:07:18.740> it<00:07:18.950> lived<00:07:19.220> up

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400

to<00:07:19.490> its<00:07:19.790> promise<00:07:19.880> that<00:07:20.540> it<00:07:20.720> is<00:07:20.870> moisturizing

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:21.650

to its promise that it is moisturizing
all<00:07:22.040> day<00:07:22.280> because<00:07:22.580> as<00:07:22.730> you<00:07:22.880> can<00:07:23.030> see<00:07:23.090> my<00:07:23.450> face

throughout the day it also said on here

that it is true because I did not put

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.710
