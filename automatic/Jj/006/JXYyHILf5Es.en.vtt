that<00:02:11.920> they<00:02:12.160> always<00:02:12.519> are<00:02:12.819> remember<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.810> have

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
that they always are remember you have

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.809 
that they always are remember you have
7,000<00:02:14.709> horsepower<00:02:15.190> here<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.459> you're<00:02:15.549> trying

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
7,000 horsepower here and you're trying

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.220 
7,000 horsepower here and you're trying
to<00:02:15.910> get<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.060> recovering<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.750> key<00:02:16.930> when<00:02:17.140> it

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
to get to recovering the key when it

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.780 
to get to recovering the key when it
spins<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.620> tire<00:02:17.799> early<00:02:18.220> like<00:02:18.370> that<00:02:18.549> you<00:02:18.640> have

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
spins the tire early like that you have

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.309 
spins the tire early like that you have
to<00:02:18.819> stay<00:02:19.030> out<00:02:19.090> of<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.239> throttle<00:02:19.599> a<00:02:19.630> lot<00:02:19.989> longer

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
to stay out of the throttle a lot longer

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.500 
to stay out of the throttle a lot longer
than<00:02:21.190> if<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.430> spins<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.849> little<00:02:21.940> further<00:02:22.269> down

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
than if it spins a little further down

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.880 
than if it spins a little further down
track<00:02:22.900> because<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.319> don't<00:02:23.500> have<00:02:23.709> that

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
track because you don't have that

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.350 
track because you don't have that
momentum<00:02:24.370> so<00:02:24.489> you<00:02:24.519> got<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.790> really<00:02:25.000> settle

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
momentum so you got to really settle

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.479 
momentum so you got to really settle
that<00:02:25.569> car<00:02:25.810> down<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.769> look<00:02:26.920> right<00:02:27.099> there<00:02:27.340> she

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
that car down you look right there she

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.920 
that car down you look right there she
gets<00:02:27.670> on<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:27.910> throttle<00:02:28.269> there<00:02:28.480> as<00:02:28.629> that<00:02:28.660> thing

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
gets on the throttle there as that thing

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.050 
gets on the throttle there as that thing
was<00:02:29.110> not<00:02:29.349> before<00:02:29.650> he<00:02:29.890> got<00:02:30.040> straight<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.879> when

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
was not before he got straight and when

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.850 
was not before he got straight and when
it<00:02:31.209> did<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.510> just<00:02:31.720> rotated<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:32.530> thing<00:02:32.709> back

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
it did it just rotated that thing back

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.520 
it did it just rotated that thing back
around<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.400> POW<00:02:33.610> right<00:02:33.970> into<00:02:34.329> the<00:02:34.420> wall<00:02:34.690> spun

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
around and POW right into the wall spun

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.750 
around and POW right into the wall spun
it<00:02:35.680> around<00:02:35.860> all<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.129> way<00:02:36.190> up<00:02:36.340> on<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.549> backside

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
it around all the way up on the backside

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.569 
it around all the way up on the backside
and<00:02:37.360> that<00:02:38.110> was<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.290> big<00:02:38.560> hit<00:02:38.769> right<00:02:39.010> there<00:02:39.040> yeah

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
and that was a big hit right there yeah

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.550 
and that was a big hit right there yeah
that<00:02:39.760> was<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:39.940> head-on<00:02:40.299> hit<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.110> wall<00:02:41.290> when

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
that was a head-on hit to the wall when

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.199 
that was a head-on hit to the wall when
it<00:02:41.590> finally<00:02:41.890> got<00:02:42.160> around<00:02:42.310> wasn't<00:02:42.849> carrying

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
it finally got around wasn't carrying

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.509 
it finally got around wasn't carrying
all<00:02:43.599> of<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:43.989> velocity<00:02:44.590> but<00:02:44.739> nevertheless<00:02:45.040> it

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
all of the velocity but nevertheless it

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.059 
all of the velocity but nevertheless it
went<00:02:45.700> head-on<00:02:45.910> in<00:02:46.269> yeah<00:02:47.019> that<00:02:47.319> was<00:02:47.500> that<00:02:47.950> was<00:02:48.040> a

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
went head-on in yeah that was that was a

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.830 
went head-on in yeah that was that was a
pretty<00:02:48.310> hard<00:02:48.519> hit<00:02:48.670> there

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.380 

that's<00:02:52.410> where<00:02:52.620> we<00:02:52.770> saw<00:02:52.980> power<00:02:53.430> still<00:02:53.880> going<00:02:54.300> to

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
that's where we saw power still going to

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.760 
that's where we saw power still going to
the<00:02:54.510> real<00:02:54.660> you'll<00:02:54.990> see<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.230> fuel<00:02:55.410> tank<00:02:55.650> out

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
the real you'll see the fuel tank out

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.110 
the real you'll see the fuel tank out
there<00:02:55.950> broken<00:02:56.340> that's<00:02:56.459> where<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.640> lot<00:02:56.790> of<00:02:56.850> fire

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
there broken that's where a lot of fire

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.820 
there broken that's where a lot of fire
came<00:02:57.420> from<00:02:57.600> when<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.959> got<00:02:58.050> on<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.380> headers<00:02:58.709> the

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
came from when it got on the headers the

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.850 
came from when it got on the headers the
fire<00:02:59.069> balls<00:02:59.310> are<00:02:59.550> already<00:02:59.850> off<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.860> which

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
fire balls are already off and which

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.059 
fire balls are already off and which
which<00:03:02.190> I'm<00:03:02.340> sure<00:03:02.580> helped<00:03:02.880> but<00:03:03.680> at<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:04.830> point

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
which I'm sure helped but at that point

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.620 
which I'm sure helped but at that point
users<00:03:05.340> wait<00:03:05.670> for<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:05.970> thing<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.240> come<00:03:06.300> to<00:03:06.480> a

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
users wait for that thing to come to a

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.510 
users wait for that thing to come to a
stop<00:03:06.840> because<00:03:07.020> she<00:03:07.380> had<00:03:07.740> smoke<00:03:07.980> breaks<00:03:08.310> well

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
stop because she had smoke breaks well

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.680 
stop because she had smoke breaks well
she<00:03:08.610> had<00:03:08.730> front<00:03:08.970> brakes<00:03:09.150> when<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.360> cars<00:03:09.540> do

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
she had front brakes when the cars do

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.090 
she had front brakes when the cars do
have<00:03:09.720> front<00:03:10.140> brakes<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:10.620> might<00:03:10.800> have<00:03:10.950> helped

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
have front brakes that might have helped

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.020 
have front brakes that might have helped
slow<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.520> down

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.330 

on<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.660> throttle<00:03:15.870> right<00:03:16.140> right<00:03:16.740> there<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.190> was

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
on the throttle right right there it was

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.089 
on the throttle right right there it was
already<00:03:17.730> rotating<00:03:18.360> around

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
already rotating around

will<00:03:19.370> they<00:03:20.060> get<00:03:20.329> in<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.599> wall<00:03:20.780> split<00:03:21.469> the<00:03:21.590> fuel

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
will they get in the wall split the fuel

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.429 
will they get in the wall split the fuel
tank<00:03:22.159> that's<00:03:23.150> where<00:03:23.329> the<00:03:23.420> fire<00:03:23.659> came<00:03:23.959> from<00:03:24.230> but

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:24.439 
tank that's where the fire came from but

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:27.369 
tank that's where the fire came from but
the<00:03:24.530> bottle<00:03:24.859> went<00:03:25.069> off<00:03:25.189> and<00:03:26.049> finally<00:03:27.049> came<00:03:27.200> to

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
the bottle went off and finally came to

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.080 
the bottle went off and finally came to
a<00:03:27.409> stop<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:27.920> it<00:03:28.189> looked<00:03:28.400> like<00:03:28.459> she<00:03:28.730> was<00:03:28.849> still

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
a stop and it looked like she was still

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.330 
a stop and it looked like she was still
trying<00:03:29.329> to<00:03:29.510> drive<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:30.109> to<00:03:30.439> a<00:03:30.469> stop<00:03:30.799> as<00:03:31.069> it<00:03:31.189> came

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
trying to drive it to a stop as it came

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.670 
trying to drive it to a stop as it came
off<00:03:31.579> the<00:03:31.760> wall<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:32.180> while<00:03:32.659> it<00:03:32.959> was<00:03:33.260> an

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
off the wall and while it was an

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.220 
off the wall and while it was an
apparent<00:03:34.040> almost<00:03:34.969> head-on<00:03:35.480> into<00:03:35.689> the<00:03:35.840> wall<00:03:36.019> it

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
apparent almost head-on into the wall it

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.050 
apparent almost head-on into the wall it
still<00:03:36.530> had<00:03:36.709> that<00:03:36.889> turning<00:03:37.370> moment<00:03:37.760> so<00:03:37.909> that

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
still had that turning moment so that

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.750 
still had that turning moment so that
was<00:03:38.209> taking<00:03:38.599> a<00:03:38.750> lot<00:03:39.139> of<00:03:39.319> energy<00:03:39.709> away<00:03:40.069> Gary

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
was taking a lot of energy away Gary

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.119 
was taking a lot of energy away Gary

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:55.189 
what you were experiencing well you

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.220 
what you were experiencing well you
think<00:03:55.340> it'd<00:03:55.489> be<00:03:55.519> easier<00:03:55.909> to<00:03:55.939> know<00:03:56.180> right<00:03:56.750> you

think it'd be easier to know right you

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.449 
think it'd be easier to know right you
think<00:03:57.379> it'd<00:03:57.530> be<00:03:57.560> harder<00:03:58.010> when<00:03:58.159> you're<00:03:58.280> going

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
think it'd be harder when you're going

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.129 
think it'd be harder when you're going
300<00:03:58.939> miles<00:03:59.060> an<00:03:59.180> hour<00:03:59.269> oh<00:03:59.449> yeah<00:03:59.480> but<00:03:59.959> really

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
300 miles an hour oh yeah but really

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.479 
300 miles an hour oh yeah but really
