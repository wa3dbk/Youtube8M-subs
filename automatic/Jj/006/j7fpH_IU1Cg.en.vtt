00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
indeed and the the painter seems to

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.920 
indeed and the the painter seems to
survive<00:01:33.030> very<00:01:33.210> well<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.630> one<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.840> don't

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
survive very well on this one I don't

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.300 
survive very well on this one I don't
think<00:01:34.200> it's<00:01:34.290> ever<00:01:34.380> been<00:01:34.470> repainted<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.130> think

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
think it's ever been repainted I think

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.310 
think it's ever been repainted I think
it's<00:01:35.460> some<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.450> its<00:01:36.600> original<00:01:36.960> color<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:37.290> I

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
it's some so its original color but I

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.319 
it's some so its original color but I
think<00:01:37.530> it's<00:01:37.650> been<00:01:37.740> repainted<00:01:38.040> at<00:01:38.340> all<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:39.210> in

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
think it's been repainted at all just in

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.230 
think it's been repainted at all just in
nice<00:01:39.509> shape<00:01:39.540> actually<00:01:40.729> around<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.790> front<00:01:41.970> end

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
nice shape actually around the front end

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.990 
nice shape actually around the front end
here<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:43.040> couple<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.189> bolts<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.700> bumper<00:01:44.970> a
