been<00:01:39.509> indicted<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.640> it<00:01:41.640> certainly<00:01:41.790> doesn't

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
been indicted so it certainly doesn't

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.969 
been indicted so it certainly doesn't
hurt<00:01:42.299> us<00:01:42.479> all<00:01:43.259> right<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.530> let's<00:01:43.680> talk<00:01:43.829> about

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
hurt us all right so let's talk about

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.130 
hurt us all right so let's talk about
some<00:01:44.130> things<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.340> I've<00:01:44.549> always<00:01:44.790> wondered

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
some things that I've always wondered

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.319 
some things that I've always wondered
okay<00:01:46.579> there's<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.640> lot<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.790> questions<00:01:48.210> about

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
okay there's a lot of questions about

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.510 
okay there's a lot of questions about
look<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.439> way<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:49.890> which<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.250> Rules<00:01:50.430> of

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
look the the way in which the Rules of

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.130 
look the the way in which the Rules of
MMA<00:01:50.670> are<00:01:51.030> created<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.720> government

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
MMA are created is that the government

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.660 
MMA are created is that the government
has<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.409> essentially<00:01:52.740> codified<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.280> into<00:01:53.490> law

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
has to essentially codified it into law

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.310 
has to essentially codified it into law
it's<00:01:54.060> like<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.329> NFL<00:01:54.479> where<00:01:54.899> if<00:01:54.990> they<00:01:55.079> want<00:01:55.229> to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
it's like the NFL where if they want to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.319 
it's like the NFL where if they want to
move<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.549> line<00:01:56.729> from<00:01:56.880> which<00:01:57.000> they<00:01:57.119> kick

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
move the the line from which they kick

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.179 
move the the line from which they kick
off<00:01:57.479> they<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.780> just<00:01:57.930> Fiat<00:01:58.380> change<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.040> it's

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
off they can just Fiat change it it's

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.649 
off they can just Fiat change it it's
different<00:01:59.549> you<00:02:00.060> guys<00:02:00.180> don't<00:02:00.240> have<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.509> go

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
different you guys don't have to go

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.060 
different you guys don't have to go
state<00:02:00.960> by<00:02:00.990> state<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.350> get<00:02:01.530> all<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.890> things

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
state by state and get all the things

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.649 
state by state and get all the things
changed<00:02:02.430> again<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:03.240> there's<00:02:03.390> been<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.540> question

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
changed again so there's been a question

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.120 
changed again so there's been a question
I've<00:02:03.899> always<00:02:04.079> wondered<00:02:04.290> when<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:04.950> go

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
I've always wondered when you go

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.429 
I've always wondered when you go
overseas<00:02:05.460> on<00:02:06.000> some<00:02:06.479> territories<00:02:07.140> not<00:02:07.290> all

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
overseas on some territories not all

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.139 
overseas on some territories not all
you're<00:02:08.009> required<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.610> do<00:02:08.759> some<00:02:08.940> self

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
you're required to do some self

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.240 
you're required to do some self
regulation<00:02:09.509> why<00:02:10.110> not<00:02:10.349> take<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.709> opportunity

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
regulation why not take the opportunity

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.610 
regulation why not take the opportunity
to<00:02:11.280> at<00:02:11.489> least<00:02:11.580> experiment<00:02:12.390> with<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.599> idea<00:02:12.959> of

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
to at least experiment with the idea of

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.080 
to at least experiment with the idea of
something<00:02:13.920> like<00:02:14.099> I<00:02:14.280> was<00:02:14.430> doing<00:02:14.519> an<00:02:14.670> example

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
something like I was doing an example

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.360 
something like I was doing an example
out<00:02:15.150> there<00:02:15.330> open<00:02:15.989> scoring<00:02:16.230> or<00:02:16.650> different<00:02:17.280> ways

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
out there open scoring or different ways

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.619 
out there open scoring or different ways
in<00:02:17.519> which<00:02:17.549> to<00:02:17.640> judge<00:02:17.790> around<00:02:18.120> because<00:02:18.480> my

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
in which to judge around because my

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.190 
in which to judge around because my
point<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:18.989> pride<00:02:19.980> was<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.250> crazy<00:02:20.909> show<00:02:21.360> but<00:02:21.989> no

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
point is pride was a crazy show but no

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.530 
point is pride was a crazy show but no
one<00:02:22.409> really<00:02:22.440> views<00:02:23.099> say<00:02:23.549> rampage<00:02:24.030> Jackson's

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
one really views say rampage Jackson's

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.899 
one really views say rampage Jackson's
wins<00:02:24.810> there<00:02:25.260> as<00:02:25.500> illegitimate<00:02:25.799> why<00:02:26.580> can't<00:02:26.819> we

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
wins there as illegitimate why can't we

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.190 
wins there as illegitimate why can't we
have<00:02:27.060> some<00:02:27.090> experimentation<00:02:27.690> in<00:02:27.900> places

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
have some experimentation in places

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.990 
have some experimentation in places
where<00:02:28.319> experimentation<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.010> possible<00:02:29.459> it's

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
where experimentation is possible it's

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.800 
where experimentation is possible it's
possible<00:02:30.799> we<00:02:31.799> we<00:02:32.310> helped<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:33.000> certainly<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.599> did

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
possible we we helped I certainly I did

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.930 
possible we we helped I certainly I did
and<00:02:34.170> lorenzo<00:02:34.620> did<00:02:34.769> helped<00:02:35.310> with<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.549> Unified

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.850 
and lorenzo did helped with the Unified
Rules<00:02:35.970> we<00:02:36.420> really<00:02:36.659> believe<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.079> them<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.379> think

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
Rules we really believe in them I think

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.890 
Rules we really believe in them I think
there<00:02:37.980> could<00:02:38.069> be<00:02:38.129> some<00:02:38.370> modifications<00:02:39.120> but<00:02:39.840> I

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
there could be some modifications but I

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.839 
there could be some modifications but I
would<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.319> wouldn't<00:02:40.860> really<00:02:40.950> want<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.370> go<00:02:41.519> away

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
would I wouldn't really want to go away

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.539 
would I wouldn't really want to go away
from<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.209> I<00:02:42.390> think<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.930> need<00:02:43.400> definitely<00:02:44.400> more

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
from it I think you need definitely more

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.720 
from it I think you need definitely more
judging<00:02:44.970> seminars<00:02:45.890> when<00:02:46.890> we<00:02:47.010> self-regulate<00:02:47.700> I

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
judging seminars when we self-regulate I

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.280 
judging seminars when we self-regulate I
run<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.209> as<00:02:48.329> if<00:02:48.510> it's<00:02:48.629> in<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.780> state<00:02:48.989> of<00:02:49.019> Nevada

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
run it as if it's in the state of Nevada

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.780 
run it as if it's in the state of Nevada
we<00:02:49.560> do<00:02:49.680> all<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:49.920> same<00:02:50.099> drug<00:02:50.340> testing<00:02:50.609> we<00:02:50.670> do

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
we do all the same drug testing we do

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.539 
we do all the same drug testing we do
everything<00:02:51.859> use<00:02:52.859> the<00:02:53.010> right<00:02:53.190> kinds<00:02:53.459> of

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
everything use the right kinds of

everything use the right kinds of
officials<00:02:53.910> we're<00:02:54.510> trying<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.870> deepen<00:02:55.349> the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
officials we're trying to deepen the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.530 
officials we're trying to deepen the
base<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.829> officials<00:02:56.220> we<00:02:56.730> have<00:02:56.940> some<00:02:57.329> from

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
base of officials we have some from

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.300 
base of officials we have some from
Poland<00:02:57.900> now<00:02:58.019> some<00:02:58.319> from<00:02:58.500> Germany<00:02:58.890> some<00:02:59.159> from

Poland now some from Germany some from

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.399 
Poland now some from Germany some from
Australia<00:02:59.849> so<00:03:00.299> we're<00:03:00.450> getting<00:03:00.599> better<00:03:00.840> but

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
Australia so we're getting better but

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.410

there<00:03:03.900> could<00:03:04.049> be<00:03:04.079> some<00:03:04.319> experimentation<00:03:04.950> I'm

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
there could be some experimentation I'm

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.270 
there could be some experimentation I'm
totally<00:03:06.359> against<00:03:06.840> open<00:03:07.109> scoring<00:03:07.319> somebody

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
totally against open scoring somebody

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
I've been scoring either but what I

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.069 
I've been scoring either but what I
would<00:03:44.819> say<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.209> something<00:03:45.540> like<00:03:45.629> instant

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
would say is something like instant

a lot of unfair criticism because they

we send them out different views they

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.080 
we send them out different views they

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
what was right the referee wasn't a

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.460 
what was right the referee wasn't a

he thought he saw he didn't see so they

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.149 
he thought he saw he didn't see so they
overturned<00:04:22.320> it<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.530> I<00:04:22.590> thought<00:04:22.770> that<00:04:22.890> was<00:04:23.010> the

overturned it and I thought that was the

believe this is a distance fight and
I've<00:07:30.860> always<00:07:31.039> thought<00:07:31.340> that<00:07:31.400> for<00:07:32.030> from<00:07:32.390> the

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 
I've always thought that for from the

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:34.930 
I've always thought that for from the
very<00:07:32.659> beginning<00:07:33.110> and<00:07:33.430> either<00:07:34.430> guy<00:07:34.729> can

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:34.940

very beginning and either guy can
convert<00:07:35.870> each<00:07:35.990> other<00:07:36.200> but<00:07:36.380> i<00:07:36.440> just<00:07:37.130> think

00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:37.219 
convert each other but i just think

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:39.399 
convert each other but i just think
it'll<00:07:37.460> be<00:07:37.490> a<00:07:37.580> decision<00:07:38.120> fight<00:07:38.479> last<00:07:39.050> question

find this criticism to be warranted or

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:53.350 
find this criticism to be warranted or
do<00:07:52.550> you<00:07:52.639> believe<00:07:52.909> that<00:07:52.940> this<00:07:53.150> is<00:07:53.300> the

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 
do you believe that this is the

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.940 
do you believe that this is the
appropriate<00:07:53.719> ref<00:07:54.080> given<00:07:54.320> the<00:07:54.380> circumstances

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:54.950 
appropriate ref given the circumstances

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.040 
appropriate ref given the circumstances
I<00:07:55.219> think<00:07:55.340> it's<00:07:55.669> the<00:07:55.760> appropriate<00:07:56.240> ref<00:07:56.450> I<00:07:56.719> think

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.050 
I think it's the appropriate ref I think

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:58.810 
I think it's the appropriate ref I think
that<00:07:57.469> comes<00:07:57.650> from<00:07:57.740> the<00:07:57.860> Maidana<00:07:58.250> first<00:07:58.580> fight

00:07:58.810 --> 00:07:58.820 
that comes from the Maidana first fight

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.480 
that comes from the Maidana first fight
and<00:07:59.200> I<00:08:00.200> don't<00:08:00.530> think<00:08:00.770> in<00:08:00.919> this<00:08:01.070> kind<00:08:01.280> of<00:08:01.340> fight

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:01.490 
and I don't think in this kind of fight

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.709 
and I don't think in this kind of fight
you're<00:08:01.610> going<00:08:01.729> to<00:08:01.789> see<00:08:01.909> much<00:08:02.030> holding<00:08:02.419> I<00:08:02.539> think

00:08:02.709 --> 00:08:02.719 
you're going to see much holding I think

00:08:02.719 --> 00:08:05.440 
you're going to see much holding I think
this<00:08:02.810> is<00:08:02.870> a<00:08:03.020> different<00:08:03.740> kind<00:08:03.770> of<00:08:04.070> fight<00:08:04.250> and<00:08:04.490> I

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:05.450 
this is a different kind of fight and I
