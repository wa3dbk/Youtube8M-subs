kind of in a rush at that point and none
of<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.469> was<00:00:37.559> really<00:00:37.860> worth<00:00:38.100> filming<00:00:38.489> anyway

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
of it was really worth filming anyway

and<00:00:42.629> then<00:00:43.340> accessories<00:00:44.340> are<00:00:44.370> just

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
and then accessories are just

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.389 
and then accessories are just
accessories<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:45.870> didn't<00:00:46.680> bother<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.039> film<00:00:47.250> any

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.060 
accessories so didn't bother to film any
of<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.170> as<00:00:49.170> I'm<00:00:49.350> recording<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.800> I

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
of that and as I'm recording this I

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.619 
of that and as I'm recording this I
already<00:00:50.219> know<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.610> didn't<00:00:51.000> film<00:00:51.480> anything

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
already know that I didn't film anything

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.760 
already know that I didn't film anything
on<00:00:52.260> my<00:00:52.530> upper<00:00:52.680> body<00:00:52.980> day<00:00:53.370> from<00:00:54.090> earlier<00:00:54.449> today

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
on my upper body day from earlier today

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.610 
on my upper body day from earlier today
it<00:00:55.770> was<00:00:56.070> 225<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.329> four<00:00:57.539> sets<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.320> bench

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
it was 225 for four sets for on bench

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.910 
it was 225 for four sets for on bench
and<00:00:59.039> then<00:00:59.960> some<00:01:00.960> overhead<00:01:01.289> breasts<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.800> some

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
other accessories but just really wasn't

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.969 
other accessories but just really wasn't
worth<00:01:05.010> filming<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.610> my<00:01:06.119> opinion<00:01:06.619> so<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> just

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
worth filming in my opinion so I just

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.310 
worth filming in my opinion so I just
filmed<00:01:08.220> all<00:01:08.460> my<00:01:08.820> sets<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.210> squats<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.869> Monday

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
filmed all my sets of squats on Monday

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.240 
filmed all my sets of squats on Monday
and<00:01:11.869> I<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.229> one<00:01:13.470> week<00:01:13.710> left<00:01:13.740> with

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
and I just have one week left with

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.880 
and I just have one week left with
doctors<00:01:14.640> or<00:01:14.820> doses<00:01:15.150> programming<00:01:15.840> at<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.770> end

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
doctors or doses programming at the end

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.249 
doctors or doses programming at the end
of<00:01:16.979> next<00:01:17.040> week<00:01:17.430> I'll<00:01:17.790> be<00:01:17.939> testing<00:01:18.210> max's<00:01:18.960> again

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
of next week I'll be testing max's again

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.100 
of next week I'll be testing max's again
so<00:01:20.159> hopefully<00:01:21.090> those<00:01:21.270> will<00:01:21.330> go<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.630> little<00:01:21.900> bit

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
so hopefully those will go a little bit

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.070 
so hopefully those will go a little bit
better<00:01:22.290> as<00:01:22.770> far<00:01:23.100> as<00:01:23.369> how<00:01:24.180> i<00:01:24.210> do<00:01:24.390> compared<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.960> my

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
better as far as how i do compared to my

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.490 
better as far as how i do compared to my
expectations<00:01:25.500> not<00:01:26.430> necessarily<00:01:27.299> as<00:01:27.960> far<00:01:28.320> as

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
expectations not necessarily as far as

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.920 
expectations not necessarily as far as
total<00:01:29.250> weight<00:01:29.430> goes<00:01:29.759> because<00:01:30.210> i<00:01:30.329> don't<00:01:30.509> expect

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
total weight goes because i don't expect

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.620 
total weight goes because i don't expect
to<00:01:31.110> hit<00:01:31.460> quite<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.670> same<00:01:32.880> numbers<00:01:33.240> i<00:01:33.390> did

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
to hit quite the same numbers i did

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.980 
to hit quite the same numbers i did
about<00:01:34.079> five<00:01:34.770> pounds<00:01:35.040> heavier<00:01:35.460> last<00:01:35.700> time<00:01:35.990> so

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
about five pounds heavier last time so

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.770 
about five pounds heavier last time so
looking<00:01:37.950> forward<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.970> then<00:01:39.299> i'll<00:01:39.540> be

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
looking forward to that and then i'll be

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.350 
looking forward to that and then i'll be
doing<00:01:39.930> my<00:01:40.259> own<00:01:40.290> programming<00:01:41.070> again<00:01:41.640> which<00:01:42.210> I

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
doing my own programming again which I

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.410 
doing my own programming again which I
enjoy<00:01:42.720> I've<00:01:43.170> already<00:01:43.979> set<00:01:44.340> up<00:01:44.460> my<00:01:44.610> program<00:01:45.090> and

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
enjoy I've already set up my program and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.560 
enjoy I've already set up my program and
it<00:01:46.409> will<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.890> for<00:01:49.610> training<00:01:50.610> days<00:01:50.759> per<00:01:51.060> week<00:01:51.090> as

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570

opposed to the 6 i'm doing now i'm going
to<00:01:55.110> have<00:01:55.200> two<00:01:55.500> active<00:01:55.860> recovery<00:01:56.460> /<00:01:57.180> mobility

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
to have two active recovery / mobility

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.770 
to have two active recovery / mobility
days<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.820> sometimes<00:01:59.820> there<00:02:00.180> will<00:02:00.299> be<00:02:00.450> some

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
days and sometimes there will be some

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.160 
days and sometimes there will be some
weight<00:02:01.020> training<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:01.590> those<00:02:01.770> days<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.850> on

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
weight training on those days but on

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.480 
weight training on those days but on
wednesday<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.439> saturday

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.870 

it's<00:02:07.820> going<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.119> be<00:02:08.300> really<00:02:09.099> heavily<00:02:10.099> based<00:02:10.520> on

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
it's going to be really heavily based on

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.510 
it's going to be really heavily based on
autoregulation<00:02:11.810> I'm<00:02:12.680> just<00:02:13.160> getting<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.430> the

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
autoregulation I'm just getting to the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.540 
autoregulation I'm just getting to the
point<00:02:13.700> in<00:02:13.849> prep<00:02:14.150> where<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:14.450> think<00:02:14.720> that's<00:02:14.930> best

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
point in prep where I think that's best

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.070 
point in prep where I think that's best
but<00:02:16.550> I<00:02:16.580> do<00:02:16.730> want<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.150> do<00:02:17.300> some<00:02:17.660> sort<00:02:17.959> of

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
but I do want to do some sort of

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.550 
but I do want to do some sort of
