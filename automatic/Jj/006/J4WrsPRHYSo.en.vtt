00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
times I could do that circuit with the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.280 
times I could do that circuit with the
dumbbells<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.760> that's<00:01:05.909> all<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.689> -

I<00:01:12.420> increase<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.290> intensity<00:01:13.710> associated<00:01:14.460> with

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
I increase the intensity associated with

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.670 
I increase the intensity associated with
these<00:01:14.760> movements<00:01:15.420> when<00:01:15.869> all<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.409> is

these movements when all I have is
dumbbells<00:01:17.580> okay<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.540> first<00:01:18.630> thing<00:01:18.780> is

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
you know the exercise order is a little

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.070 
you know the exercise order is a little
bit<00:01:22.860> off<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:24.150> you're<00:01:24.330> moving<00:01:24.720> great

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.630 
what I'm going to offer you are two
different<00:01:27.840> ways<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.290> send<00:01:28.950> all<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
different ways to a send all of the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.210 
different ways to a send all of the
exercises<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.630> you're<00:01:31.140> using<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:32.040> very

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
exercises that you're using the very

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.980 
exercises that you're using the very
first<00:01:32.460> way<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.850> send<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.689> dumbbell

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
first way to a send this dumbbell

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.490 
first way to a send this dumbbell
circuit<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:35.360> integrate<00:01:36.360> two<00:01:37.229> movements

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
circuit is to integrate two movements

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.880 
circuit is to integrate two movements
into<00:01:37.860> one<00:01:38.130> right<00:01:39.000> we'll<00:01:39.240> use<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.689> it's<00:01:40.619> kind<00:01:40.829> of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
into one right we'll use a it's kind of

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.380 
into one right we'll use a it's kind of
like<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> double<00:01:41.220> compound<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.060> take<00:01:42.210> one

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
like a double compound you take one

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.240 
like a double compound you take one
compound<00:01:42.810> movement<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.320> wrap<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:43.950> up<00:01:44.130> with

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
compound movement you wrap it up with

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.469 
compound movement you wrap it up with
another<00:01:44.369> one<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.909> do<00:01:45.119> them<00:01:45.240> together

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
another one and you do them together

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.810 
another one and you do them together
that<00:01:46.140> immediately<00:01:46.890> adds<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.310> brand<00:01:47.579> new

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
that immediately adds a brand new

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.310 
that immediately adds a brand new
stimulus<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> nervous<00:01:48.810> system<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
stimulus to the nervous system to the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.830 
stimulus to the nervous system to the

them and the other a section I want to
use<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.490> term<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.820> tension<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.210> basically<00:02:00.630> just

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
use that term a tension I basically just

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.980 
use that term a tension I basically just
mean<00:02:01.020> how<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.229> make<00:02:01.530> things<00:02:01.799> harder<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.340> to

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
presses with your lunges again you can

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.990 
presses with your lunges again you can
keep<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:03.769> overhead<00:04:04.450> or<00:04:05.450> you<00:04:05.750> can<00:04:05.870> go<00:04:05.989> just<00:04:06.110> one
