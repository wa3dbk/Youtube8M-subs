00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.430
 good afternoon my name is felipe castro 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.349
 I belong to the monkey group orizaba de la 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:12.139
 scout association of mexico mi 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.639
 project that consists in reusing the 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.070
 michelle becoming 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.200
 waterproofing for houses with ceilings 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.050
 of concrete the unicel is extremely 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.810
 contaminant the unicel to be incinerated 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.550
 the cyber acid hydrocyanic acid 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.250
 Hydrogen cyanide is highly polluting 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.369
 for the floor also when the 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.640
 unicel releases dioxins that are also 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.530
 very polluting for the environment 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.100
 generate the already well-known effects 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.319
 greenhouse acid rain and well then 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.909
 of this material is very used in 

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:48.309
 parties in packaging in stationery and 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:51.530
 well, you can easily get it 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.300
 the project is very good because then it 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.609
 It can be applied anywhere 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.479
 any place throw away this kind of 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.109
 material 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:02.810
 we can put it together and you can give it 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.140
 a life of greater use 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:09.020
 the project is based on putting together 300 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.900
 kilos of initial with these 300 kilos of 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.810
 unicel we would cover around 188 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.670
 square meters that would be made 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.220
 the service of applying them the 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.160
 waterproofing we help them 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.900
 economically because they really do not 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.000
 they would spend more than gas 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.460
 well the project consists of three 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.060
 stages the first stage is the 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.000
 collection this stage is based on in 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.860
 look for all possible contracts to 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.170
 ensure from time to time that they give us 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.410
 self-service stores stationery and 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.450
 others their level of waste in the second 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.420
 stage is the process of converting the 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.550
 initial and my first list before this stage 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.990
 this although it sounds very difficult really 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.460
 It is very simple 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.890
 is simply to use the 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.310
 half 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.940
 of kilos in liters of gasoline and about 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.569
 the amount of unicel for example if 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.840
 we had 4 kilos of initial what 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.720
 dissolve and masters in a container with 2 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.660
 liters of gasoline and well it is 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.209
 this ratio of 4 kilos 2 liters 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.360
 would reach to cover 2.5 meters 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.750
 initial land squares here in 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.150
 Mexico is pretty every year in Mexico it 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.950
 waste about 750 thousand tons 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.350
 of unicel 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.650
 normally the unicel ends in 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.310
 landfills that, in the end, are 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.890
 burned 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.820
 All garbage scheme is highly 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.180
 toxic around 46 chemicals are 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:52.060
 released when the garbage is burned 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.540
 of high temperatures in addition to the 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.209
 Benzene release from other agents 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.190
 that are carcinogenic and good that also 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.280
 they damage the ozone layer and the ecosystem 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.590
 on the other hand also good later 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.690
 in this video we will do in the demonstration 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.640
 of how the unicel becomes 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.590
 waterproof this material that is 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.019
 form after combining the initial with 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.540
 gasoline is a material in 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.120
 cycles or in really simple processes 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.390
 well then 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.260
 the unicel as you can realize weight 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:28.560
 very little and this because because inside 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.840
 the molecules of unicel there is air the 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.090
 scientific name of the unicel is the 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.430
 expanded polystyrene gasoline what 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.150
 what he's going to do is in those holes where 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.829
 there is air going to be placed was going to form va 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.690
 to form these good structures 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.269
 circular will form structures 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.970
 linear this means that it's going to 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.099
 reduce its volume can be applied 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.150
 Well, anywhere, we give it to you 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:56.340
 another use and another application to the unicel that 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.260
 apparently after busy is 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.250
 unusable, well, here we have a 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:06.060
 small base to deposit gasoline 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.459
 here we are going to make the mix nothing more 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.890
 to do the demonstration of not initiating 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:14.010
 with gasoline we are going to pour a little 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:19.380
 of gasoline in this container and then 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:21.419
 let's proceed to dissolve the unicel the 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.789
 piece that I have here of unicel is very 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.910
 small and good for that we need very 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:29.400
 little gas this weighs 10 grams here 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.590
 come on, this is a piece of unicel and 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.560
 well let's dissolve it in gasoline 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.020
 and immediately we realize that 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.180
 is consuming for gas this 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.010
 this process does not release anything else to the 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.740
 environment other than gasoline 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.139
 evaporated no reaction is a mixture 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.340
 There is nothing to worry about in terms of 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.340
 release of things 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:13.139
 we have here the waterproofing that 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:16.400
 let's occupy here we have 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.400
 besides chiclosa 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:23.770
 which is the one that we are going to apply I leave here 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:25.509
 I wrote down my email and also here I leave my 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.719
 phone so they can be in 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:30.669
 Contact me and good with clarify that 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:32.740
 is my type to take this 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:36.360
 project out thank you very much for your 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.360
 Attention and I am at your service
