00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 I flew with United Airlines on my trip to Nebraska 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 The plane left Halifax with connection at Chicago O'Hare 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 While on the ground, the passenger behind me said: 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 My God, they are throwing guitars out there! 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 The band and I exchanged looks 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 Showing our terror before that act on the asphalt, 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 And knowing to whom those projectiles belonged 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 So before leaving Chicago I notified three employees 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Who showed total indifference to me 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Unitedddddd 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 You broke my Taylor guitar 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Unitedddddd 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 What a great help you are! 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 You broke it, you should fix it 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 You are responsible, admit it 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 I should have flown with another or gone by careeee 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Because United breaks guitars. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 When I landed in Nebraska, I confirmed my suspicions 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 My Taylor had been the victim of a ruthless act of evil in the O'Hare 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 And so I begin a year to wring the bulk of Do not ask me! 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 And I'm sorry, sir, your complaint will not come to nothing! 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 The same is done by all employees of the airline, 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 from New York to New Delhi including the friendly Ms Irlweb, 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 whose last word is always: No. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 I've heard all your excuses, and you've wasted my time 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 And that attitude of yours must be finished 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Unitedddddd 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 I will not say I'll never fly with you again because maybe 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 To save the world I would probably do it, but I do not think that will happen 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 And of course I would not bring luggage, because I would break it 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 In two thousand pieces, just as you broke my heart 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 When United breaks the guitars. 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
