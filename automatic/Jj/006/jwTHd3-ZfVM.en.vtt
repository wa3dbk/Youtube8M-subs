00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.680
 and I do not 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.800
 hello to all youtube people today 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.320
 I come with another alternative story that 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.330
 would have happened if the doctor marc and hero 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.840
 I would never have revived the androids 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.609
 17 and 18 this point where the 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.039
 story begins at the moment when 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.800
 itching or broomstick to a battle 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.019
 Maki hero accepts and so the same thing happens 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.300
 in the series itch or turns out to be more 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.880
 powerful and when it's about to 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.340
 kill him comes burma and distracts them and so 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.350
 the magic doctor takes advantage and flees but in 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.630
 this alternative story even more is 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.910
 takes a little longer resulting in the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.850
 victory of itching or killing the doctor 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.280
 marc and jero also in that precise 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.380
 moment the story changes kamisama les 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.540
 warns of the arrival of cell and the 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.670
 warriors go to the place where the 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.160
 villain but our warriors were very 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.950
 weak the only one who could make him fight 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.860
 it was itchy or fused with kamisama but 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.110
 in this story they did not merge yet and 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.420
 cell kills creel and nat in xinjiang and 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.630
 trunks itch oy vegeta fought consell 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.540
 but cell beat them very fast leaves them 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.300
 dying and leaves 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.340
 Goku sei in bed and warriors z 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.380
 they were about to die but then 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.990
 itch or remember the seeds of 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.880
 hermit that he had takes away the two 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.460
 creel and neither heals vegetable and trunks 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.410
 then vegeta leaves angry trunks 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.770
 it follows and itching or it is decided to 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.630
 merge with shirt to the computer 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.180
 told him do the one that androids do not 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.550
 had been awakened and selfa at 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.140
 Dr. Macchi's laboratory and itching 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.630
 I went to the temple in ma shirt for 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.440
 merge comes to the temple and kamisama 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.350
 agrees to merge and then they start and 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.050
 choir had a very powerful vegetable power 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.600
 trunks were also more powerful because 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.700
 they had survived certain death and 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.390
 choirs without wasting more time will search 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.600
 a cell 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.460
 meanwhile Boku still did not wake him 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.040
 I could not wake the androids 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.800
 because he was not even more powerful than them 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.869
 so I needed to steal more power and 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.229
 itching or going to look for itching or it 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.090
 meet with cell and start fighting 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.580
 cell was still a little more powerful 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.690
 but then comes trunks and vegetates 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.000
 fight 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.670
 finally he is defeated but this is not 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.010
 end here you want to know what will happen in 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.230
 the following sagas this will affect the 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.870
 future positively or vice versa 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.210
 these and other questions discover the 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.840
 in the next chapter a greeting and 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.840
