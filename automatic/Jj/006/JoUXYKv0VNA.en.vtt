00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:14.970 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.910 

they<00:00:15.970> built<00:00:16.240> their<00:00:16.450> bodies<00:00:16.750> entirely<00:00:17.200> of<00:00:17.530> soft

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
these were the invertebrates mil oaken

mania<00:00:37.330> is<00:00:37.570> the<00:00:38.140> earliest<00:00:38.559> creature<00:00:38.890> we<00:00:39.129> know

mania is the earliest creature we know
of<00:00:39.489> that<00:00:40.030> we<00:00:40.150> can<00:00:40.330> truly<00:00:40.510> call<00:00:40.870> a<00:00:41.670> vertebrate

of that we can truly call a vertebrate

of that we can truly call a vertebrate
and<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:44.559> seems<00:00:44.830> clear<00:00:45.250> that<00:00:45.610> it<00:00:46.090> used<00:00:46.390> its

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
and it seems clear that it used its

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.560
