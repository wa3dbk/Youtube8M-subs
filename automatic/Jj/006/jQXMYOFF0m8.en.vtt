Cavani from Paris on German and we

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.840 
Cavani from Paris on German and we
apparently<00:00:30.119> be<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.769> 47<00:00:31.769> million<00:00:31.980> pounds<00:00:32.579> for

for him which would make make Avani the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.479 
for him which would make make Avani the
most<00:00:36.989> expensive<00:00:37.620> player<00:00:37.829> in<00:00:38.070> Liverpool's

most expensive player in Liverpool's
history<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.210> I'm<00:00:39.719> not<00:00:39.899> sure<00:00:40.079> whether<00:00:40.379> to

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
history and I'm not sure whether to

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.200 
history and I'm not sure whether to
believe<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.070> rumour<00:00:41.460> or<00:00:41.640> not<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:42.030> it's

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
believe this rumour or not but it's

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.619 
believe this rumour or not but it's
agreed<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:42.989> are<00:00:43.079> linked<00:00:43.410> with<00:00:43.579> with<00:00:44.579> a

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
agreed that we are linked with with a

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.970

really really world-class striker I

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.720 
really really world-class striker I
think<00:00:47.309> Cavani<00:00:48.440> this<00:00:49.440> deal<00:00:49.770> would<00:00:50.160> make<00:00:50.370> sense

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
think Cavani this deal would make sense

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.750 
think Cavani this deal would make sense
because<00:00:50.910> Paris<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.570> German<00:00:51.920> wants<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.100> sell

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
Suarez his goals and Kabbani would

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.969 
Suarez his goals and Kabbani would
exactly<00:01:30.930> do<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.280> also<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.380> after

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
exactly do that and also in the after

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.280 
exactly do that and also in the after
next<00:01:35.159> season<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:36.180> champions<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.780> money<00:01:36.990> will

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
next season the champions the money will

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.319 
next season the champions the money will
be<00:01:37.470> almost<00:01:37.680> double<00:01:38.070> with<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.549> BT<00:01:38.790> sports

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
be almost double with the BT sports

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.370 
be almost double with the BT sports
champions<00:01:39.869> big<00:01:40.020> deal<00:01:40.229> kicking<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.310> so

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
champions big deal kicking in so

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.160 
champions big deal kicking in so
basically<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.740> Lupo<00:01:44.310> were<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.600> miss<00:01:45.750> out<00:01:45.960> on

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
basically if Lupo were to miss out on

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.080 
basically if Lupo were to miss out on
the<00:01:46.259> Champions<00:01:46.649> League<00:01:46.710> they<00:01:47.040> would<00:01:47.250> lose<00:01:47.759> a

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
the Champions League they would lose a

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.060 
the Champions League they would lose a
lot<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.659> money<00:01:49.110> but<00:01:49.320> if<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.680> signed

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
lot of money but if we signed

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.090 
lot of money but if we signed
Cavani<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.610> think<00:01:50.909> we<00:01:51.210> would<00:01:51.360> be<00:01:51.600> nailed<00:01:52.530> on<00:01:52.799> for

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
Cavani I think we would be nailed on for

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.639 
Cavani I think we would be nailed on for
the<00:01:53.189> top<00:01:53.399> four<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.170> possibly<00:01:55.170> we<00:01:55.619> will

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
the top four and possibly we will

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.480 
the top four and possibly we will
challenge<00:01:56.460> for<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.790> title<00:01:56.990> again<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.920> come

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
challenge for the title again and come

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.980 
challenge for the title again and come
