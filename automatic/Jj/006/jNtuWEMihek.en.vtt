our<00:00:18.160> program<00:00:18.869> doesn't<00:00:20.220> sit<00:00:21.220> aspirations<00:00:22.210> for

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
our program doesn't sit aspirations for

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.050 
our program doesn't sit aspirations for
them<00:00:22.720> it<00:00:22.960> helps<00:00:23.470> them<00:00:23.800> determine<00:00:24.520> what<00:00:24.939> their

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
them it helps them determine what their

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.480 
them it helps them determine what their
own<00:00:25.180> aspirations<00:00:25.450> are<00:00:26.140> and<00:00:26.650> it<00:00:27.040> helps<00:00:27.340> them

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
own aspirations are and it helps them

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.790 
own aspirations are and it helps them
get<00:00:27.730> there<00:00:27.970> so<00:00:28.510> we<00:00:28.960> start<00:00:29.260> with<00:00:29.290> them<00:00:29.560> and<00:00:29.710> we

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
get there so we start with them and we

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.100 
get there so we start with them and we
stick<00:00:30.070> and<00:00:30.939> we<00:00:31.119> make<00:00:31.300> sure<00:00:31.480> they<00:00:31.630> get<00:00:31.779> to<00:00:31.990> the

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
stick and we make sure they get to the

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.940 
stick and we make sure they get to the
other<00:00:32.259> end<00:00:32.410> and<00:00:33.090> they<00:00:34.090> I<00:00:34.510> think<00:00:34.950> transformed

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
other end and they I think transformed

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.100 
other end and they I think transformed
through<00:00:36.190> that<00:00:36.430> process<00:00:36.670> and<00:00:37.300> they<00:00:37.450> they<00:00:37.930> have

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
through that process and they they have

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.830 
through that process and they they have
a<00:00:38.140> life<00:00:38.410> Everclear<00:00:38.970> like<00:00:39.970> doing<00:00:40.510> things<00:00:40.630> with
