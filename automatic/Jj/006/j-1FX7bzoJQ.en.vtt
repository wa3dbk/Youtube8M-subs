00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
get a lot better climbing the Pedigo

get a lot better climbing the Pedigo
cruisers<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.320> always<00:00:58.469> had<00:00:59.090> the<00:01:00.090> direct

drive motor with the geared motor a

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.770 
drive motor with the geared motor a
little<00:01:04.409> noisier<00:01:05.280> but<00:01:06.119> they<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.299> less<00:01:06.510> drag

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
little noisier but they have less drag

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.050 
little noisier but they have less drag
and<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.290> lot<00:01:07.439> more<00:01:07.470> climbing<00:01:07.979> ability<00:01:08.369> push<00:01:08.970> you

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
and a lot more climbing ability push you

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.730 
and a lot more climbing ability push you
got<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> super<00:01:09.570> low<00:01:09.810> first<00:01:10.049> gear<00:01:10.380> if<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.619> are

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
got the super low first gear if you are

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.510 
got the super low first gear if you are
climbing<00:01:10.950> pretty<00:01:11.189> hard<00:01:11.810> now<00:01:12.810> also<00:01:13.260> us<00:01:13.590> Pedigo

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
climbing pretty hard now also us Pedigo

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.520 
climbing pretty hard now also us Pedigo
is<00:01:14.729> putting<00:01:15.090> these<00:01:15.210> great<00:01:15.479> new<00:01:15.689> racks<00:01:16.140> and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
is putting these great new racks and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.520 
is putting these great new racks and
also<00:01:17.130> much<00:01:17.670> better<00:01:17.880> looking<00:01:18.210> batteries<00:01:18.720> but

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
also much better looking batteries but

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.140 
also much better looking batteries but
what's<00:01:19.740> really<00:01:19.920> cool<00:01:20.189> about<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.520> battery<00:01:20.909> is

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
what's really cool about the battery is

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.600 
what's really cool about the battery is
the<00:01:21.450> internal<00:01:21.869> design<00:01:22.170> they<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.610> upgraded

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the internal design they have upgraded

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.480 
the internal design they have upgraded
left<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.509> year<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.200> best<00:01:25.439> cells<00:01:26.009> that

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
left this year to the best cells that

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.100 
left this year to the best cells that
money<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.939> buy<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.150> from<00:01:27.509> what<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.659> understand

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
money can buy is from what I understand

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.859 
money can buy is from what I understand
so<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:29.460> batteries<00:01:29.880> are<00:01:30.060> better<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.630> stronger

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
so the batteries are better and stronger

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:31.460 
so the batteries are better and stronger
than<00:01:31.140> ever

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
than ever

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.730 
than ever
along<00:01:32.430> with<00:01:32.579> safer<00:01:33.170> now<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.229> other

along with safer now the other

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.990 
along with safer now the other

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
interceptor they have here in the shop

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.960 
interceptor they have here in the shop
is<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> black<00:01:36.450> one<00:01:37.610> because<00:01:38.610> you've<00:01:38.729> got<00:01:38.850> the
