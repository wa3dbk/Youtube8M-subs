00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
because most people just tend to do a

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.500 
because most people just tend to do a
drug<00:00:25.529> Templar<00:00:25.890> build<00:00:26.099> without<00:00:26.279> anything<00:00:26.789> like

justice the drug Templar fields and you
basically<00:00:29.130> screwed<00:00:29.580> up<00:00:29.730> or<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.390> screwed<00:00:30.660> over

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
basically screwed up or you screwed over

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.999 
basically screwed up or you screwed over
because<00:00:31.199> you're<00:00:31.380> relying<00:00:31.619> your

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
because you're relying your

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.560 
because you're relying your
hundred-percent<00:00:32.309> force<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.940> your<00:00:33.059> jump<00:00:33.360> bar

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
hundred-percent force on your jump bar

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.720

and<00:00:33.899> if<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.800> just<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.070> happens<00:00:35.370> your<00:00:35.489> enemy

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
and if it just so happens your enemy

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.900 
and if it just so happens your enemy
went<00:00:35.910> as<00:00:36.210> fast<00:00:36.649> ebay<00:00:37.649> or<00:00:37.800> fast<00:00:38.070> academy<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
went as fast ebay or fast academy and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.729 
went as fast ebay or fast academy and
then<00:00:38.969> you're<00:00:39.719> pretty<00:00:39.809> much<00:00:39.930> screwed<00:00:40.140> over<00:00:40.379> but

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
then you're pretty much screwed over but

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.590 
then you're pretty much screwed over but
it<00:00:40.920> doesn't<00:00:41.190> matter<00:00:41.250> because<00:00:41.579> now<00:00:42.360> i'll<00:00:42.540> show

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.119 
it doesn't matter because now i'll show
you<00:00:42.780> guys<00:00:42.899> how<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.050> do<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> dark<00:00:43.620> templar<00:00:43.920> build

enough in some ways that is true but
most<00:00:54.899> ways<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.320> isn't<00:00:55.620> true<00:00:55.739> because<00:00:55.850> dark

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850

pile<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:17.729> over<00:01:17.939> there<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.180> my<00:01:18.270> gateway<00:01:18.570> up<00:01:18.689> here

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
pile on over there in my gateway up here

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.109 
pile on over there in my gateway up here
in<00:01:19.439> particular<00:01:19.740> there's<00:01:20.400> no<00:01:20.520> reason<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.880> it

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.539 
in particular there's no reason to it
but<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.630> figured<00:01:22.500> if<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.740> will<00:01:22.890> ipod<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.369> over

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
but I figured if I will ipod on over

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.580 
but I figured if I will ipod on over
there<00:01:23.729> he'd<00:01:23.939> think<00:01:24.180> I'd<00:01:24.390> go<00:01:24.689> 14<00:01:25.140> Nexus<00:01:25.500> or

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
there he'd think I'd go 14 Nexus or

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.380 
there he'd think I'd go 14 Nexus or
something<00:01:25.920> with<00:01:26.040> 4th<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:27.330> might

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
something with 4th and that might

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.060 
something with 4th and that might
intimidate<00:01:27.900> him<00:01:28.229> or<00:01:28.350> something<00:01:28.650> I'm<00:01:28.920> not

ledge and again yeah this game is on
last<00:01:39.360> temple<00:01:39.630> that's<00:01:39.780> particularly<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.590> main

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
last temple that's particularly the main

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.280 
last temple that's particularly the main
reason<00:01:41.100> I'm<00:01:41.189> doing<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:42.119> build<00:01:42.960> with<00:01:43.140> tech

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
reason I'm doing this build with tech

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.600 
reason I'm doing this build with tech
surprise<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.860> want<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.070> end<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> game<00:01:44.340> early

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
surprise I want to end the game early

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.850 
surprise I want to end the game early
because<00:01:45.450> Lost<00:01:45.780> Temple<00:01:45.930> they<00:01:46.320> came<00:01:46.560> Tran

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
because Lost Temple they came Tran

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.590 
because Lost Temple they came Tran
basically<00:01:47.189> it's<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.520> rigged<00:01:47.820> for<00:01:48.000> turn<00:01:48.240> that's

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
basically it's is rigged for turn that's

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.300 
basically it's is rigged for turn that's
why<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:49.110> don't<00:01:49.229> see<00:01:49.409> pro<00:01:49.590> games<00:01:49.799> happening<00:01:50.189> on

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
why you don't see pro games happening on

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.999 
why you don't see pro games happening on
Lost<00:01:50.460> Temple<00:01:50.579> anymore<00:01:51.000> because<00:01:51.500> fact<00:01:52.500> has<00:01:52.799> it

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
Lost Temple anymore because fact has it

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.679 
Lost Temple anymore because fact has it
that<00:01:53.159> last<00:01:53.369> temple<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.850> Rick<00:01:53.970> return<00:01:54.329> with<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
that last temple is Rick return with the

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.319 
that last temple is Rick return with the
ledge<00:01:54.869> because<00:01:55.200> bob<00:01:55.649> was<00:01:56.030> cruiser<00:01:57.030> can<00:01:57.210> also

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
ledge because bob was cruiser can also

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.170 
ledge because bob was cruiser can also
get<00:01:57.600> lurkers<00:01:57.899> on<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.200> for<00:01:58.409> ZB<00:01:58.710> ZB<00:01:59.180> progress

because<00:02:07.950> lots<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.700> people<00:02:08.789> think<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.390> the

because lots of people think that the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.750 
because lots of people think that the
standard<00:02:10.319> build<00:02:10.530> order<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:10.950> basically<00:02:11.430> wonder

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
standard build order is basically wonder

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.510 
standard build order is basically wonder
you<00:02:12.180> get<00:02:12.360> your<00:02:12.540> first<00:02:12.720> or<00:02:12.930> going<00:02:13.050> out<00:02:13.200> with

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
you get your first or going out with

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.610 
you get your first or going out with
singletery<00:02:14.240> charge<00:02:14.510> but<00:02:15.200> if<00:02:15.320> you<00:02:15.410> guys<00:02:15.560> think

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
singletery charge but if you guys think

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.040 
singletery charge but if you guys think
about<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.280> ones<00:02:16.850> is<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.060> ones<00:02:17.480> out<00:02:17.780> that

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
about it the ones is the ones out that

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.170 
about it the ones is the ones out that
you<00:02:18.170> get<00:02:18.350> is<00:02:18.500> not<00:02:18.680> that<00:02:18.860> much<00:02:19.040> of<00:02:19.070> a<00:02:19.280> it's<00:02:20.030> not

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
you get is not that much of a it's not

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.420 
you get is not that much of a it's not
that<00:02:20.330> much<00:02:20.360> of<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.630> delay<00:02:20.810> because<00:02:21.110> if<00:02:21.740> you<00:02:22.040> it

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
that much of a delay because if you it

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.010 
that much of a delay because if you it
delays<00:02:22.820> your<00:02:23.000> opponent<00:02:23.360> more<00:02:23.540> than<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.780> delays

you<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:24.530> guys<00:02:24.680> might<00:02:24.830> be<00:02:24.860> wondering<00:02:25.100> why

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
you and you guys might be wondering why

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.650 
you and you guys might be wondering why
I<00:02:25.340> built<00:02:25.520> that<00:02:25.610> shield<00:02:25.940> battery<00:02:26.300> there<00:02:26.510> I

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
I built that shield battery there I

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.390 
I built that shield battery there I
didn't<00:02:27.170> really<00:02:27.350> build<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.680> shield<00:02:27.860> battery<00:02:28.280> I

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
didn't really build the shield battery I

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.880 
didn't really build the shield battery I
basically<00:02:28.670> just<00:02:29.380> tested<00:02:30.380> to<00:02:30.500> see<00:02:30.530> if<00:02:30.680> my

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
basically just tested to see if my

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.980 
basically just tested to see if my
cybernetics<00:02:31.790> core<00:02:31.970> we<00:02:32.180> SAT<00:02:32.390> there<00:02:32.420> I<00:02:32.630> didn't

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
cybernetics core we SAT there I didn't

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.090 
cybernetics core we SAT there I didn't
have<00:02:33.080> two<00:02:33.230> hundred<00:02:33.380> minerals<00:02:33.800> for<00:02:33.980> my

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
have two hundred minerals for my

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.400 
have two hundred minerals for my
cybernetics<00:02:34.580> core<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.050> shield<00:02:36.050> battery

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
cybernetics core and the shield battery

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.990 
cybernetics core and the shield battery
and<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.560> cybernetics<00:02:37.370> core<00:02:37.550> are<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.850> same

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
and the cybernetics core are the same

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.360 
and the cybernetics core are the same
size<00:02:38.210> so<00:02:38.990> I<00:02:39.020> when<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.500> went<00:02:39.800> to<00:02:39.860> receive<00:02:40.220> I

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
size so I when I went to receive I

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.740 
size so I when I went to receive I
couldn't<00:02:40.580> build<00:02:40.700> my<00:02:40.850> cybernetics<00:02:41.420> core<00:02:41.570> over

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
couldn't build my cybernetics core over

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.480 
couldn't build my cybernetics core over
there<00:02:41.930> think<00:02:42.680> about<00:02:42.830> that<00:02:42.890> for<00:02:43.070> a<00:02:43.220> while<00:02:43.250> and

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
there think about that for a while and

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.040 
there think about that for a while and
you<00:02:43.550> understand<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.270> now<00:02:44.630> I'm<00:02:44.750> going<00:02:44.930> to

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
you understand it and now I'm going to

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.570 
you understand it and now I'm going to
talk<00:02:45.170> with<00:02:45.320> my<00:02:45.440> first<00:02:45.590> in<00:02:46.010> my<00:02:46.130> two<00:02:46.190> probes

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
talk with my first in my two probes

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.580 
talk with my first in my two probes
because<00:02:47.450> I<00:02:47.720> think<00:02:47.930> this<00:02:48.020> will<00:02:48.140> doesn't<00:02:48.320> damage

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
because I think this will doesn't damage

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.530 
because I think this will doesn't damage
and<00:02:48.950> again<00:02:49.190> it's<00:02:49.490> not<00:02:49.610> as<00:02:49.820> you<00:02:50.180> can<00:02:50.330> see<00:02:50.420> I'm

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
and again it's not as you can see I'm

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.050 
and again it's not as you can see I'm
not<00:02:50.690> behind<00:02:50.870> at<00:02:51.200> all<00:02:51.440> with<00:02:51.620> this<00:02:51.800> I'm<00:02:52.060> not

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
not behind at all with this I'm not

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.460 
not behind at all with this I'm not
anything<00:02:53.360> by<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.750> time<00:02:53.900> I<00:02:54.020> attacking<00:02:54.410> I'm

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
anything by the time I attacking I'm

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.230 
anything by the time I attacking I'm
going<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.680> be<00:02:54.770> ahead<00:02:54.890> with<00:02:55.160> this<00:02:55.310> maybe<00:02:55.970> if<00:02:56.150> he

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
going to be ahead with this maybe if he

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
silicon so this if they both attack this

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.360 
silicon so this if they both attack this
Ella<00:03:19.760> can<00:03:20.060> get<00:03:20.630> to<00:03:20.900> hit<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.350> marine<00:03:22.070> as<00:03:22.250> you
