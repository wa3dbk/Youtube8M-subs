00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.900
 Okuno Island floating in the Seto Inland Sea 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.140
 There is also a history that the old Japanese army was developing poison gas 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.050
 In recent years 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.050
 Famous for being a rabbit paradise 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.460
 Around the 70's 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:57.300
 The rabbit brought in by someone is released to the island 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:01:00.610
 It is considered to have become wild one second edition while breeding 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.230
 It is a field rabbit but 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.760
 To observe the ecology of the rabbit 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.760
 Give a good environment 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:17.240
 Although some native species called Nihon'no rabbit 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:21.040
 Walking 9 scams are mostly in Europe 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.040
 Real estate people have different identity 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:31.430
 But the physiological characteristics 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.430
 The rabbit rabbit is also considered almost identical 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.780
 ana 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.340
 Hmm 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:52.670
 Speaking of rabbits still eyes big ears 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:59.110
 In fact the rabbit's hearing is very good and 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.110
 In particular, it responds sensitively to the sound of stepping through a sprig of a rose 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:11.470
 Immediately after sensing a sound that has come close 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:19.440
 I often stop moving so as to stiffen my body 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:19.440
 When I detect a sound uttered in the distance, I sometimes check the surroundings by raising my neck 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:33.390
 These are thought to Modify obtained in order to escape from predators such as fox field shop, but no 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:33.390
 From these characteristics, it may be safe to think that the rabbit senses the perspective of the sound 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:43.200
 ni 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.200
 After detecting abnormality with sound, visually investigate the behavior of drip 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:54.490
 The eye of the wolf is jumping out from the side of the face 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.490
 We can overlook almost 360 degrees 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.690
 Dry noodle 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.920
 The angle seen by both eyes is limited 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.920
 Stereoscopic vision is a can 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:11.500
 Actually the rabbit 's vision is not so good 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:16.080
 Even so, the rabbit can escape from the natural enemy 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.080
 It is because another sense organ is developing 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.550
 that is 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.860
 Olfactory 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:30.120
ãƒ¼

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:32.450
 Rabbit of flowers is always a moving, but read very human even more smell shades change in to this 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:41.140
 be able to 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:41.140
 The number of cells that sense odor is also second largest to dogs, and its sensing ability is extremely high 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:49.840
 Many animals are also called Jobi institutions 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:56.460
 Although there are organs mainly sense the pheromone 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.460
 There is an appendage which has not been clarified yet . 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:12.109
 Anatomical study of this appendage has led to the elucidation of neural networks 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:12.109
 I do not know how the rabbit recognizes the information obtained there 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:26.180
 One of the bold hypotheses is that the rabbit smells near 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:34.389
 I wonder if they recognize the movement 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:34.389
 Qualification is only an aid to the sense of hearing, but the leading role in spatial understanding is rather the sense of smell 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:47.930
 But smell substance is easy to spread on the wind 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.930
 It is doubtful that you can really create an image like a qualification by smell 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:05:01.590
 But with the ability of hearing to distinguish acting 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:07.340
 Considering having an anatomically very complex olfactory network as well 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.340
 The possibility can not be denied lightly 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.040
 For those who 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:29.790
 There is no sensor to measure the environment so much 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:34.040
 But to humanity 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:38.680
 There is power beyond the point of analysis power 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:40.180
 To create a picture of the earth with its analytical power 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.580
 That is exactly 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.580
 It can be said that it is a mission given to humanity 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.940
 Always one step ahead of the large Teku 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.940
