00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
life but it's not like people in China

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.149

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
have done a do-it-yourself medical

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.920 
have done a do-it-yourself medical
treatment<00:01:32.610> before<00:01:32.759> there<00:01:33.240> was<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.390> guy<00:01:33.509> not<00:01:33.750> too

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
treatment before there was a guy not too

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.200 
treatment before there was a guy not too
long<00:01:34.170> back<00:01:34.500> he<00:01:34.829> pretty<00:01:35.220> much<00:01:35.310> made<00:01:35.790> his<00:01:35.970> own

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
long back he pretty much made his own

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.359 
long back he pretty much made his own
arm<00:01:36.659> because<00:01:37.229> he<00:01:37.350> couldn't<00:01:37.650> get<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.860> prosthetic

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
arm because he couldn't get a prosthetic

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.800 
arm because he couldn't get a prosthetic
one<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.939> think<00:01:39.119> there's<00:01:39.270> even<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.540> story

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
one and I think there's even a story

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.270 
one and I think there's even a story
about<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.049> guy<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.409> cut<00:01:40.680> off<00:01:40.829> his<00:01:41.009> own<00:01:41.040> leg

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
about a guy that cut off his own leg
