00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
where it was pretty damn obvious that

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.410 
where it was pretty damn obvious that

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
there is no hope of him making it and he

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.130 
there is no hope of him making it and he
kept<00:02:54.690> going<00:02:54.870> like<00:02:55.200> he<00:02:55.829> was<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.510> worked<00:02:57.510> up<00:02:57.810> that

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.589 
kept going like he was so worked up that
pulling<00:02:59.010> back<00:02:59.220> just<00:02:59.519> wasn't<00:02:59.940> an<00:03:00.030> option<00:03:00.180> from

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599

the top he's as talented as you can get
the<00:03:40.730> acts<00:03:41.000> completely<00:03:41.599> on<00:03:41.959> instinct<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:42.920> his

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
the acts completely on instinct and his

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.290 
the acts completely on instinct and his
fitness<00:03:43.489> guys<00:03:44.300> in<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.629> gym<00:03:44.660> a<00:03:45.700> lot<00:03:46.700> more<00:03:46.970> than

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
fitness guys in the gym a lot more than

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.110 
fitness guys in the gym a lot more than
probably<00:03:47.959> most<00:03:48.019> people<00:03:48.650> think<00:03:48.890> and<00:03:49.280> you<00:03:50.000> know

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120

probably most people think and you know
and<00:03:50.390> I<00:03:50.870> think<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:51.319> level<00:03:51.530> he's<00:03:52.010> at<00:03:52.280> is<00:03:52.519> the

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
and I think the level he's at is the

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.070 
and I think the level he's at is the
level<00:03:53.239> i<00:03:55.090> can't<00:03:56.090> speak<00:03:56.360> for<00:03:56.420> everyone<00:03:56.750> else

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
level i can't speak for everyone else

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:12.580 
level i can't speak for everyone else
but<00:03:57.260> myself<00:03:57.440> looking<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.670> get

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.899 

Connor<00:04:13.590> has<00:04:13.860> everything<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.610> know<00:04:14.700> he's<00:04:14.790> the

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
Connor has everything you know he's the

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.729 
Connor has everything you know he's the
whole<00:04:15.030> package<00:04:15.060> I<00:04:15.689> mean<00:04:16.290> a<00:04:16.320> lot<00:04:16.470> of<00:04:16.560> guys<00:04:16.709> just

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
whole package I mean a lot of guys just

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.229 
whole package I mean a lot of guys just
charge<00:04:17.190> big<00:04:17.400> waves<00:04:17.579> and<00:04:17.790> don't<00:04:17.940> serve<00:04:18.090> small

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
charge big waves and don't serve small

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.900 
charge big waves and don't serve small
ways<00:04:18.479> but<00:04:18.660> I<00:04:18.690> think<00:04:18.959> Shane<00:04:19.169> still<00:04:19.500> enjoys

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
ways but I think Shane still enjoys

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.820 
ways but I think Shane still enjoys
surfing<00:04:20.910> two<00:04:21.090> foot<00:04:21.329> 2<00:04:21.510> 200<00:04:22.019> foot<00:04:22.440> it<00:04:22.560> doesn't

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
surfing two foot 2 200 foot it doesn't

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:33.550 
surfing two foot 2 200 foot it doesn't
bother<00:04:22.889> him

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.640 

for<00:04:34.010> me<00:04:34.130> being<00:04:34.820> Waterman<00:04:35.270> is<00:04:35.300> just<00:04:35.660> not<00:04:36.290> really

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
for me being Waterman is just not really

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.610 
for me being Waterman is just not really
setting<00:04:37.070> limitations<00:04:37.910> on<00:04:38.870> yourself<00:04:39.350> you<00:04:39.530> know

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
setting limitations on yourself you know

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.900 
setting limitations on yourself you know
I<00:04:39.680> think<00:04:39.770> of<00:04:40.010> a<00:04:40.070> Waterman<00:04:40.520> as<00:04:41.500> someone<00:04:42.500> who

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
I think of a Waterman as someone who

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.520 
I think of a Waterman as someone who
plain<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:44.090> simply<00:04:44.330> just<00:04:44.870> loves<00:04:45.380> the<00:04:45.500> ocean

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
plain and simply just loves the ocean

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.840 
plain and simply just loves the ocean
and<00:04:46.900> ya<00:04:47.900> don't<00:04:48.110> know<00:04:48.230> what<00:04:48.320> to<00:04:48.410> say<00:04:48.560> about<00:04:48.650> it

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
and ya don't know what to say about it

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.610 
and ya don't know what to say about it
