where you find our cable entry point

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.530 
where you find our cable entry point
just<00:04:09.100> here<00:04:09.310> what<00:04:09.850> this<00:04:09.940> does<00:04:10.150> is<00:04:10.300> allows<00:04:10.510> you

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
just here what this does is allows you

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.240 
just here what this does is allows you
to<00:04:10.690> bring<00:04:10.900> electrics<00:04:11.350> into<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.740> tent<00:04:11.980> looks

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
to bring electrics into the tent looks

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.680 
to bring electrics into the tent looks
like<00:04:12.430> we're<00:04:12.520> having<00:04:12.580> any<00:04:12.820> cables<00:04:13.240> running<00:04:13.510> in

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
like we're having any cables running in

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.540 
like we're having any cables running in
through<00:04:14.050> your<00:04:14.110> doors<00:04:14.470> so<00:04:15.070> I<00:04:15.130> do<00:04:15.220> that<00:04:15.460> it's

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
hopefully gonna keep out those bugs as

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.199 
hopefully gonna keep out those bugs as
well<00:04:17.340> also<00:04:18.340> just<00:04:18.609> wear<00:04:18.730> them<00:04:18.880> here<00:04:19.030> I'll

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
well also just wear them here I'll

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.370 
well also just wear them here I'll
highlight<00:04:19.420> the<00:04:19.690> ground<00:04:19.900> sheet<00:04:20.109> that<00:04:20.230> we're

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
highlight the ground sheet that we're

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.870 
highlight the ground sheet that we're
using<00:04:20.530> here<00:04:20.830> is<00:04:20.950> a<00:04:20.980> fully<00:04:21.280> sealed<00:04:21.549> growing

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
using here is a fully sealed growing

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.580 
using here is a fully sealed growing
sheet<00:04:22.060> from<00:04:22.210> front<00:04:22.480> to<00:04:22.540> back<00:04:22.630> and<00:04:23.020> say<00:04:23.200> to<00:04:23.260> side

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
sheet from front to back and say to side

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.980 
sheet from front to back and say to side
so<00:04:24.340> what<00:04:24.490> you'll<00:04:24.610> find<00:04:24.760> there<00:04:24.910> is<00:04:25.210> it's<00:04:25.630> also<00:04:25.840> a

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
so what you'll find there is it's also a

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.510 
so what you'll find there is it's also a
bathtub<00:04:26.440> style<00:04:26.680> so<00:04:26.950> it<00:04:27.040> comes<00:04:27.160> up<00:04:27.310> at<00:04:27.430> the

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
bathtub style so it comes up at the

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.590 
bathtub style so it comes up at the
edges<00:04:27.790> so<00:04:27.910> you're<00:04:28.030> not<00:04:28.120> going<00:04:28.240> to<00:04:28.300> have<00:04:28.420> any

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
edges so you're not going to have any

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.570 
edges so you're not going to have any
draft<00:04:29.140> coming<00:04:29.380> in<00:04:29.560> hopefully<00:04:30.280> you<00:04:30.370> won't<00:04:30.460> have

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
draft coming in hopefully you won't have

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.750 
draft coming in hopefully you won't have
any<00:04:30.820> sort<00:04:31.090> of<00:04:31.180> sand<00:04:31.810> or<00:04:32.140> dirt<00:04:32.350> or<00:04:32.670> things<00:04:33.670> like

any sort of sand or dirt or things like
this<00:04:34.030> also<00:04:34.870> hopefully<00:04:35.590> it's<00:04:35.770> going<00:04:35.890> to<00:04:35.950> keep

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
this also hopefully it's going to keep

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.160 
this also hopefully it's going to keep
out<00:04:36.280> those<00:04:36.520> unwanted<00:04:37.060> creepy<00:04:37.660> crawlies<00:04:38.020> -

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
highlight that the ground sheet in this

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.350 
highlight that the ground sheet in this
area<00:04:50.980> is<00:04:51.100> actually<00:04:51.220> the<00:04:51.460> exact<00:04:51.730> same<00:04:51.880> material

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
area is actually the exact same material

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.600 
area is actually the exact same material
and<00:04:53.110> this<00:04:53.230> can<00:04:53.410> be<00:04:53.530> toggled<00:04:53.740> in<00:04:54.040> to<00:04:54.490> position

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
and this can be toggled in to position

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.340 
and this can be toggled in to position
or<00:04:55.060> you<00:04:55.150> can<00:04:55.210> remove<00:04:55.600> that<00:04:55.660> if<00:04:55.990> you<00:04:56.080> don't<00:04:56.260> need

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
or you can remove that if you don't need

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.290 
or you can remove that if you don't need
to<00:04:56.500> use<00:04:56.650> it<00:04:56.800> so<00:04:57.580> I<00:04:57.610> think<00:04:57.730> now<00:04:57.880> what<00:04:58.000> we'll<00:04:58.180> do

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
to use it so I think now what we'll do

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.790 
to use it so I think now what we'll do
is<00:04:58.360> we'll<00:04:58.510> just<00:04:58.690> pop<00:04:58.870> outside<00:04:59.320> to<00:04:59.560> the<00:04:59.680> oak

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
is we'll just pop outside to the oak

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.200 
is we'll just pop outside to the oak
table<00:05:00.100> attempt<00:05:00.340> and<00:05:00.520> take<00:05:00.700> you<00:05:00.820> through<00:05:01.000> some

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
table attempt and take you through some

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.659 
table attempt and take you through some
of<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.419> features<00:05:01.570> there<00:05:02.110> and<00:05:02.590> starting<00:05:03.580> off

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
of the features there and starting off

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.070 
of the features there and starting off
with<00:05:03.850> the<00:05:04.000> fly<00:05:04.180> sheet<00:05:04.360> that<00:05:04.540> we<00:05:04.630> use<00:05:04.750> on<00:05:04.900> this

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
with the fly sheet that we use on this

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.560 
with the fly sheet that we use on this
this<00:05:05.230> is<00:05:05.380> our<00:05:05.500> oat<00:05:05.650> x<00:05:05.890> 4000<00:05:06.580> material<00:05:06.970> so

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
this is our oat x 4000 material so

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.030 
this is our oat x 4000 material so
you'll<00:05:07.870> find<00:05:08.020> it's<00:05:08.169> a<00:05:08.230> really<00:05:08.740> good<00:05:08.860> quality

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
you'll find it's a really good quality
