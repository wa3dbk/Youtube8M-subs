00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
hello and welcome back to the convection

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.680 
hello and welcome back to the convection
connection<00:00:06.839> today<00:00:07.589> in<00:00:08.250> episode<00:00:08.639> 4<00:00:08.970> Larry

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
connection today in episode 4 Larry

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.919 
connection today in episode 4 Larry
green<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.260> will<00:00:10.500> explain<00:00:10.920> why<00:00:11.250> balloons

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:11.929 
green and I will explain why balloons

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.470 
green and I will explain why balloons
bowling<00:00:12.929> balls<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.500> soda<00:00:14.190> cans<00:00:14.490> sink<00:00:15.210> or

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
bowling balls and soda cans sink or

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.429 
bowling balls and soda cans sink or
float<00:00:17.029> so<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.119> question<00:00:18.240> today<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.720> why<00:00:19.199> does

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
float so the question today is why does

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.590 
float so the question today is why does
the<00:00:19.590> helium<00:00:20.039> balloon<00:00:20.490> rise<00:00:20.910> we<00:00:21.270> know<00:00:21.390> if<00:00:21.480> we

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
the helium balloon rise we know if we

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.880 
the helium balloon rise we know if we
take<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.779> balloon<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.260> fill<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.560> with<00:00:22.710> helium

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
take a balloon we fill it with helium

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.800 
take a balloon we fill it with helium
and<00:00:23.250> then<00:00:23.789> let<00:00:23.970> go<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.420> it's<00:00:24.539> going<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.720> go

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
and then let go of it it's going to go

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.620 
and then let go of it it's going to go
way<00:00:24.960> up<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> sky<00:00:25.350> but<00:00:25.949> why<00:00:26.449> that's<00:00:27.449> right

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
way up in the sky but why that's right

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.230 
way up in the sky but why that's right
Larry<00:00:27.930> now<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.470> fact<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.699> balloon<00:00:29.970> goes

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
Larry now the fact that the balloon goes

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.330 
Larry now the fact that the balloon goes
up<00:00:30.269> when<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:30.960> let<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.140> go<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.619> proof<00:00:32.099> that

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
up when we let it go is proof that

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.340 
up when we let it go is proof that
there's<00:00:32.669> some<00:00:33.000> upward<00:00:33.300> force<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.170> balloon

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
there's some upward force on the balloon

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.260 
there's some upward force on the balloon
an<00:00:34.800> upward<00:00:35.160> force<00:00:35.190> greater<00:00:35.730> than<00:00:35.940> the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
an upward force greater than the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.760 
an upward force greater than the
downward<00:00:36.630> pull<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.870> gravity<00:00:36.960> otherwise<00:00:37.590> it

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
downward pull of gravity otherwise it

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.799 
downward pull of gravity otherwise it
wouldn't<00:00:37.950> go<00:00:38.040> up<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.820> upward<00:00:39.300> force<00:00:39.600> is

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
wouldn't go up that upward force is

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.260 
wouldn't go up that upward force is
called<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.590> buoyant<00:00:41.070> force<00:00:41.129> there's<00:00:42.090> an

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
called the buoyant force there's an

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.209 
called the buoyant force there's an
upward<00:00:42.660> buoyant<00:00:43.200> force<00:00:43.500> on<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.860> balloon

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
upward buoyant force on this balloon

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.850 
upward buoyant force on this balloon
because<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.270> air<00:00:45.450> pressure<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.469> bottom

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
because the air pressure on the bottom

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.290 
because the air pressure on the bottom
side<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.280> balloon<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.700> little<00:00:48.149> bit

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
side of the balloon is a little bit

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.119 
side of the balloon is a little bit
greater<00:00:48.570> than<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> air<00:00:49.110> pressure<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.829> top

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
greater than the air pressure on the top

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.220 
greater than the air pressure on the top
side<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.640> blue<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.780> doesn't<00:00:52.199> just

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
side of the blue but this doesn't just

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.090 
side of the blue but this doesn't just
happen<00:00:52.469> with<00:00:52.860> helium<00:00:53.190> balloons<00:00:54.920> notice<00:00:55.920> that

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
happen with helium balloons notice that

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.069 
happen with helium balloons notice that
the<00:00:56.219> bottom<00:00:56.789> layer<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.210> cheerleaders<00:00:57.750> has<00:00:57.930> to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the bottom layer of cheerleaders has to

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.930 
the bottom layer of cheerleaders has to
exert<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.410> great<00:00:58.859> pressure<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.520> hold<00:00:59.699> up<00:00:59.820> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
exert a great pressure to hold up the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.849 
exert a great pressure to hold up the
layers<00:01:00.149> above<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:01.020> same<00:01:01.199> thing<00:01:01.410> happens<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.800> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
layers above the same thing happens in a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.709 
layers above the same thing happens in a
fluid<00:01:02.070> whether<00:01:02.789> you're<00:01:02.969> at<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> bottom<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.600> an

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
fluid whether you're at the bottom of an

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.990 
fluid whether you're at the bottom of an
ocean<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:04.049> water<00:01:04.229> or<00:01:04.559> like<00:01:05.040> us<00:01:05.070> at<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> bottom

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
ocean of water or like us at the bottom

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.940 
ocean of water or like us at the bottom
of<00:01:06.119> an<00:01:06.240> ocean<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.659> air<00:01:06.930> there's<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.680> tremendous

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
of an ocean of air there's a tremendous

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.740 
of an ocean of air there's a tremendous
pressure<00:01:08.520> because<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.060> bottom<00:01:09.240> layers<00:01:09.570> of

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
pressure because the bottom layers of

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.510 
pressure because the bottom layers of
fluid<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.530> support<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> weight<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
fluid have to support the weight of the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.969 
fluid have to support the weight of the
upper<00:01:11.760> layers<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.869> case<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.080> air<00:01:13.530> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
upper layers in the case of air the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.620 
upper layers in the case of air the
weight<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> upper<00:01:14.700> layers<00:01:14.880> compresses

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
weight of the upper layers compresses

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.570 
weight of the upper layers compresses
the<00:01:15.750> bottom<00:01:16.049> layers<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.920> lower<00:01:17.100> air<00:01:17.340> is

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the bottom layers so the lower air is

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.880 
the bottom layers so the lower air is
more<00:01:17.820> dense<00:01:17.880> as<00:01:18.479> well<00:01:18.900> as<00:01:19.200> at<00:01:19.350> higher<00:01:19.560> pressure

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
more dense as well as at higher pressure

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.100 
more dense as well as at higher pressure
let's<00:01:20.640> look<00:01:20.820> again<00:01:21.000> at<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.450> helium<00:01:21.840> balloon

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
let's look again at the helium balloon

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.960 
let's look again at the helium balloon
the<00:01:22.590> air<00:01:22.770> near<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> bottom<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.850> balloon

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
the air near the bottom of the balloon

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.120 
the air near the bottom of the balloon
is<00:01:24.360> more<00:01:24.630> dense<00:01:24.960> than<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.380> air<00:01:25.619> near<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.860> top

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
is more dense than the air near the top

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.560 
is more dense than the air near the top
of<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.369> balloon<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:27.060> there<00:01:27.180> are<00:01:27.210> more

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
of the balloon so there are more

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.420 
of the balloon so there are more
molecules<00:01:27.900> pounding<00:01:28.710> on<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.920> bottom<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
molecules pounding on the bottom of the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.710 
molecules pounding on the bottom of the
balloon<00:01:29.549> than<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.060> top<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.630> balloon

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
balloon than on the top of the balloon

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.679 
balloon than on the top of the balloon
and<00:01:30.990> there<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> net<00:01:32.189> upward<00:01:32.490> buoyant<00:01:33.390> force

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
and there is a net upward buoyant force

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.310 
and there is a net upward buoyant force
the<00:01:34.530> word<00:01:34.650> buoyancy<00:01:35.189> brings<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.939> mind<00:01:36.320> buoys

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
the word buoyancy brings to mind buoys

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.740 
the word buoyancy brings to mind buoys
boats<00:01:38.040> things<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.939> float<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.299> water<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.689> i

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
boats things that float in water so i

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.270 
boats things that float in water so i
guess<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> principle<00:01:40.409> applies<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.829> water<00:01:41.040> too

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
guess the principle applies to water too

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.429 
guess the principle applies to water too
that's<00:01:41.880> exactly<00:01:42.090> right<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.689> exactly<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
that's exactly right it's exactly the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.960 
that's exactly right it's exactly the
same<00:01:43.590> principle<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.130> water<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.820> doesn't

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
same principle in water but it doesn't

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.789 
same principle in water but it doesn't
have<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.299> be<00:01:45.329> just<00:01:45.450> buoys<00:01:46.049> or<00:01:46.259> boats<00:01:46.500> that

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
have to be just buoys or boats that

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.249 
have to be just buoys or boats that
floats<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.369> water<00:01:47.450> for<00:01:48.450> instance<00:01:48.689> do<00:01:49.200> you

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
floats in water for instance do you

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.770 
floats in water for instance do you
think<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:50.399> bowling<00:01:51.000> ball<00:01:51.180> will<00:01:51.450> float<00:01:51.630> in

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
think this is bowling ball will float in

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.810 
think this is bowling ball will float in
water<00:01:51.899> well<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.500> don't<00:01:52.619> know

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
water well I don't know

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.250 
water well I don't know
there's<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.330> good<00:01:54.450> way<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.659> check<00:01:56.030> it<00:01:57.030> does<00:01:57.270> yeah

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
there's a good way to check it does yeah

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.660 
there's a good way to check it does yeah
this<00:01:58.440> is<00:01:58.530> actually<00:01:58.650> a<00:01:58.860> kitty<00:01:59.130> bowling<00:01:59.520> ball

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
this is actually a kitty bowling ball

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.790 
this is actually a kitty bowling ball
weighs<00:01:59.909> six<00:02:00.210> pounds<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.900> upward<00:02:01.380> buoyant

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
weighs six pounds the upward buoyant

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.500 
weighs six pounds the upward buoyant
force<00:02:02.040> from<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.280> water<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.760> greater<00:02:03.060> than<00:02:03.330> the

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
force from the water is greater than the

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.790 
force from the water is greater than the
weight<00:02:03.660> of<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.840> bowling<00:02:04.110> ball<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.470> it<00:02:04.500> floats

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
weight of the bowling ball so it floats

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.260 
weight of the bowling ball so it floats
another<00:02:05.700> example<00:02:05.940> is<00:02:06.420> i<00:02:07.200> have<00:02:07.500> here<00:02:08.270> regular

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
another example is i have here regular

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.590 
another example is i have here regular
pepsi<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:10.200> Diet<00:02:11.100> Pepsi<00:02:11.420> what<00:02:12.420> do<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.510> think

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
pepsi and Diet Pepsi what do you think

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.090 
pepsi and Diet Pepsi what do you think
all<00:02:12.990> happened<00:02:13.320> when<00:02:13.440> we<00:02:13.470> put<00:02:13.740> those<00:02:13.830> in<00:02:14.070> water

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
all happened when we put those in water

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.949 
all happened when we put those in water
oh<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.550> think<00:02:14.700> there's<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.000> difference<00:02:15.120> let's

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
oh you think there's a difference let's

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.190 
oh you think there's a difference let's
try<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.230> out<00:02:16.410> here's<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.160> regular<00:02:18.080> that<00:02:19.080> one

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
try it out here's the regular that one

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.930 
try it out here's the regular that one
sinks<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:20.610> now<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.850> diet<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:22.580> guy<00:02:23.580> floats

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
sinks and now the diet that guy floats

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.270 
sinks and now the diet that guy floats
that's<00:02:24.630> right<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.290> regular<00:02:25.680> pepsi<00:02:25.860> has<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.100> lot

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
that's right the regular pepsi has a lot

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.830 
that's right the regular pepsi has a lot
of<00:02:26.310> sugar<00:02:26.610> dissolved<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:27.239> it<00:02:27.330> then<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.630> makes

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
of sugar dissolved in it then that makes

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.920 
of sugar dissolved in it then that makes
it<00:02:28.020> more<00:02:28.320> dense<00:02:28.680> than<00:02:28.830> water<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:29.489> it<00:02:29.790> sinks

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
it more dense than water so it sinks

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.270 
it more dense than water so it sinks
that<00:02:30.930> develops<00:02:31.320> another<00:02:31.530> case<00:02:31.770> for<00:02:31.980> drinking

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
that develops another case for drinking

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.900 
that develops another case for drinking
diet<00:02:32.550> soda<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:34.340> guess<00:02:35.340> that's<00:02:35.580> why<00:02:35.700> they<00:02:35.880> call

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
diet soda I guess that's why they call

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.530 
diet soda I guess that's why they call
it<00:02:36.090> light<00:02:36.660> soda<00:02:38.060> next<00:02:39.060> time<00:02:39.270> on<00:02:39.450> the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
it light soda next time on the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.080 
it light soda next time on the
convection<00:02:40.290> connection<00:02:40.890> join<00:02:41.430> Larry<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.940> me

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
convection connection join Larry and me

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.770 
convection connection join Larry and me
when<00:02:42.300> it's<00:02:42.450> our<00:02:42.660> turn<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.140> float<00:02:43.530> in<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.739> air
