00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.380
 because it gives epiphany started more 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.780
 or less 30 years ago with a form of 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.120
 to honor my grandmother who has a 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.850
 floriculture of the oldest of the river 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.939
 of course, and because of this, people 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.820
 purchased five pots of orchids and 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.000
 from then on our involvement with 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.550
 these plants have been a constant and 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.899
 The orchid has grown in a 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.850
 quite intense orchids here in the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.910
 Orchid funny cost get in 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.950
 little holy little jars or 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.040
 then in collective nÃ© that are what they are 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.340
 very small seedlings, so that from this 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.960
 moment the plenary begins to do the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.680
 management so they can 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.710
 develop content and have a 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.390
 flowering and beans it is interesting that 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.500
 be beautiful so that it can be 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.800
 marketed 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.860
 there is no time at all between the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.710
 pollination that would be that crossing 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.479
 which is nothing more than to get the pollen 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.479
 hand that said of a fraud what goes 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.630
 move to another what it is 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.750
 from there until the appearance of 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.450
 a flower the result of this organization and 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.630
 this takes an average of five to six 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.630
 years 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.410
 there is a tendency of people 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.990
 that there is a difficulty 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:41.010
 very large orchids will continue 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.680
 provided you are aware of 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.440
 some basic rules of cultivation are 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.990
 This means lighting. 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.300
 Agent nation fertilization itself 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.790
 There is no 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.060
 difficulty to continue the children right 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.320
 it is so much that we always recommend that 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.240
 the orchids if you have to 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.250
 possibility you can cultivate your 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.580
 orchids on mainly trees 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.009
 in those areas whose shells are so 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.990
 very thick and not only has 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.550
 this facility is the ideal place to 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.670
 to grow orchids 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.280
 even in these places there are few orchids 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.130
 for example tolerate direct sunlight 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.220
 you have to do this is a restriction 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:28.080
 for cultivated what not to leave them 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:30.510
 sunbathing direct beginners in the 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.519

 information to obtain information from the 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.769
 other eight office and here in the orchid 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.560
 epifani we promote regularly
