00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
my fingers could easily slip off and

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.930 
my fingers could easily slip off and
touch<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.719> display<00:01:01.219> undesirably<00:01:02.219> now<00:01:02.879> you

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
touch the display undesirably now you

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.700 
touch the display undesirably now you
might<00:01:03.539> notice<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:04.110> do<00:01:04.260> have<00:01:04.439> some

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
might notice that we do have some

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.039 
might notice that we do have some
bubbles<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.549> around<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.270> display<00:01:06.810> here

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
bubbles in and around the display here

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.359 
bubbles in and around the display here
and<00:01:07.170> that's<00:01:07.290> because<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:07.830> not<00:01:07.979> actually<00:01:08.340> a

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
and that's because it's not actually a

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.580 
and that's because it's not actually a
manufacturer's<00:01:09.150> defect<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:10.200> actually<00:01:10.560> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
manufacturer's defect it's actually a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.289 
manufacturer's defect it's actually a
screen<00:01:10.979> protector<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> manufacturer

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
screen protector that the manufacturer

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.700 
screen protector that the manufacturer
puts<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> display<00:01:13.080> before<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.470> leaves<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
puts on the display before it leaves the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.649 
puts on the display before it leaves the
factory<00:01:14.159> some<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.000> guys<00:01:15.090> out<00:01:15.270> there<00:01:15.330> might

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
factory some of you guys out there might

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.090 
factory some of you guys out there might
consider<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.080> really<00:01:16.320> really<00:01:16.530> convenient<00:01:17.040> and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
consider it really really convenient and

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.740 
consider it really really convenient and
I<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:17.220> also<00:01:17.670> think<00:01:18.090> it's<00:01:18.240> actually<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.570> really

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
I do also think it's actually a really

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.719 
I do also think it's actually a really
nice<00:01:18.930> addition<00:01:19.470> for<00:01:19.500> them<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.950> include<00:01:20.430> that

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
nice addition for them to include that

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.789 
nice addition for them to include that
however<00:01:21.720> if<00:01:21.900> they're<00:01:22.080> gonna<00:01:22.229> put<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.619> it

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
however if they're gonna put it on it

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:23.840 
however if they're gonna put it on it
would<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.040> been<00:01:23.130> nice<00:01:23.250> if<00:01:23.280> they<00:01:23.520> put<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.790> on

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
would have been nice if they put it on

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.789 
would have been nice if they put it on
properly<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.390> first<00:01:24.420> time<00:01:24.720> because<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.229> OCD

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
properly the first time because the OCD

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.190 
properly the first time because the OCD
and<00:01:25.950> me<00:01:26.100> looks<00:01:27.000> at<00:01:27.119> those<00:01:27.240> bubbles<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.960> goes

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
and me looks at those bubbles and goes

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.370

crazy<00:01:28.560> now<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:30.090> 10.1<00:01:30.570> inch<00:01:30.810> IPS

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
crazy now we do have a 10.1 inch IPS

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.530 
crazy now we do have a 10.1 inch IPS
display<00:01:31.470> with<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> resolution<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.610> 1900<00:01:33.450> by

1200 but that also equates to a dpi of

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.870 
1200 but that also equates to a dpi of
about<00:01:36.780> 240<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> bit<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> low<00:01:38.850> end

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880

on the right side of the device and as
we<00:02:24.740> move<00:02:24.890> up<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.220> talk<00:02:25.460> we've<00:02:25.670> got<00:02:25.850> our

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
we move up to the talk we've got our

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.030 
we move up to the talk we've got our
aluminium<00:02:26.750> power<00:02:27.170> button<00:02:27.500> coupled<00:02:27.830> with<00:02:27.860> our

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
aluminium volume rocker and that's

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.260 
aluminium volume rocker and that's
because<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.740> build<00:02:31.250> of<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.640> device<00:02:32.030> is

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
because the build of the device is

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.150 
because the build of the device is
actually<00:02:32.630> aluminium<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.740> as<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:34.010> can<00:02:34.100> see

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
actually aluminium and as you can see

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.590 
actually aluminium and as you can see

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
flipping around to the back here a

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.080 
flipping around to the back here a
really<00:02:35.960> nice<00:02:36.140> sort<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.620> blue<00:02:37.010> dark<00:02:37.430> blue<00:02:37.490> color

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.860 
and it is all aluminum construction and
I<00:02:40.460> believe<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:40.880> should<00:02:40.970> be<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.120> unibody<00:02:41.720> design

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870

awesome<00:03:03.770> addition<00:03:04.610> however<00:03:04.790> does<00:03:05.120> it<00:03:05.240> sound

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
awesome addition however does it sound

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.410 
awesome addition however does it sound
like<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:05.810> 2013<00:03:06.440> Nexus<00:03:06.770> 7<00:03:07.240> unfortunately<00:03:08.240> not

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
like the 2013 Nexus 7 unfortunately not

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.870 
like the 2013 Nexus 7 unfortunately not
so<00:03:08.750> much<00:03:09.020> though<00:03:09.590> it's<00:03:09.860> nice<00:03:10.190> if<00:03:10.370> they<00:03:10.460> add<00:03:10.640> it

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
so much though it's nice if they add it

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.280 
so much though it's nice if they add it
and<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.120> should<00:03:11.330> be<00:03:11.480> adequate<00:03:11.780> for<00:03:12.200> the

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
and it should be adequate for the

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.900 
and it should be adequate for the
majority<00:03:12.560> of<00:03:12.740> people<00:03:13.100> out<00:03:13.250> there<00:03:13.430> if<00:03:13.580> you

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
majority of people out there if you

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.760 
majority of people out there if you
don't<00:03:13.970> have<00:03:14.510> any<00:03:14.690> headphones<00:03:15.050> lying<00:03:15.290> around<00:03:15.470> I

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
don't have any headphones lying around I

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.190 
don't have any headphones lying around I
did<00:03:16.220> find<00:03:16.490> that<00:03:16.610> at<00:03:16.850> its<00:03:17.060> highest<00:03:17.360> volume<00:03:18.020> it

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
did find that at its highest volume it

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.690 
did find that at its highest volume it
wasn't<00:03:18.590> quite<00:03:18.830> loud<00:03:19.100> enough<00:03:19.130> for<00:03:19.550> my<00:03:19.670> needs

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
wasn't quite loud enough for my needs

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.730 
wasn't quite loud enough for my needs
and<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.660> was<00:03:20.810> obviously<00:03:21.200> sounding<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:21.620> little

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
and it was obviously sounding a little

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.130 
and it was obviously sounding a little
bit<00:03:21.890> tinny<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:22.610> I<00:03:22.640> found<00:03:22.970> myself<00:03:23.120> opting<00:03:23.810> more

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
bit tinny so I found myself opting more

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.020 
bit tinny so I found myself opting more
often<00:03:24.440> than<00:03:24.590> not<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:25.130> use<00:03:25.280> my<00:03:25.430> headphones<00:03:25.880> with

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
often than not to use my headphones with

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.700 
often than not to use my headphones with
movies<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:26.450> music<00:03:26.930> or<00:03:27.080> whatever<00:03:27.230> else<00:03:27.530> I

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
movies and music or whatever else I

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.200 
movies and music or whatever else I
might<00:03:27.890> need<00:03:28.070> it<00:03:28.130> for<00:03:28.370> jumping<00:03:28.970> into<00:03:29.090> the

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
might need it for jumping into the

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
and that's pretty darn awesome if we

the applications I downloaded myself
we've<00:04:36.200> got<00:04:36.350> some<00:04:36.530> Google<00:04:36.800> applications

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
we've got some Google applications

of Chinese applications that obviously
for<00:04:45.860> myself<00:04:46.220> because<00:04:46.400> I<00:04:46.580> don't<00:04:46.640> understand

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.730 
Chinese languages I had to hide those so
that<00:04:50.570> they<00:04:50.780> wouldn't<00:04:50.990> take<00:04:51.080> up<00:04:51.290> room<00:04:51.440> on<00:04:51.560> my
