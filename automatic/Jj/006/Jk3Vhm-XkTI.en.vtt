the<00:02:29.440> steps<00:02:29.950> in<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.280> mechanics<00:02:30.819> one<00:02:31.060> by<00:02:31.300> one<00:02:31.540> so

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
the steps in the mechanics one by one so

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.180 
the steps in the mechanics one by one so
as<00:02:31.959> you're<00:02:32.080> playing<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.379> game<00:02:32.530> first<00:02:33.040> you

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
we made the randomizer mode which

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.120 
we made the randomizer mode which
randomly<00:03:26.690> makes<00:03:26.960> a<00:03:27.080> level<00:03:27.350> at<00:03:27.500> which<00:03:27.590> point<00:03:27.920> i
