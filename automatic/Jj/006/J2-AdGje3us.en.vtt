crane wear which is a piece that hasn't
been<00:00:16.800> fired<00:00:17.010> yet<00:00:17.270> most<00:00:18.270> people<00:00:18.359> prefer<00:00:18.930> to

been fired yet most people prefer to

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.230 
been fired yet most people prefer to
paint<00:00:19.380> on<00:00:19.650> bit<00:00:20.189> square<00:00:20.460> which<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.000> already

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
paint on bit square which is the already

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.470 
paint on bit square which is the already
fired<00:00:21.779> piece<00:00:22.310> it's<00:00:23.310> much<00:00:23.519> more<00:00:23.670> durable<00:00:24.090> and

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
fired piece it's much more durable and

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.660 
fired piece it's much more durable and
has<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> very<00:00:24.930> very<00:00:25.109> porous<00:00:25.560> surface<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.609> it

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
has a very very porous surface so it

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.300 
has a very very porous surface so it
accepts<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.210> glaze<00:00:27.420> very<00:00:27.779> very<00:00:28.019> well<00:00:28.310> when
