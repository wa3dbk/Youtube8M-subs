the spindle actually this the blade

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.549 
the spindle actually this the blade
itself<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.219> pretty<00:00:47.520> good<00:00:47.789> still<00:00:48.410> but<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
itself is pretty good still but the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.860 
itself is pretty good still but the
spindle<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.190> which<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.670> goes<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.629> what

okay and then I'm gonna put this in the
nutriblast<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:21.290> then<00:02:21.530> put<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.189> it<00:02:22.340> makes

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:22.609 
nutriblast and then put it and it makes

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.569 
nutriblast and then put it and it makes
a<00:02:22.939> real<00:02:23.349> load<00:02:24.349> of<00:02:24.499> crap<00:02:24.739> nice<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.129> you<00:02:25.189> can<00:02:25.310> see

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
a real load of crap nice and you can see

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.610 
a real load of crap nice and you can see
the<00:02:25.730> water<00:02:25.879> actually<00:02:26.090> in<00:02:26.659> the<00:02:27.109> bottom<00:02:27.379> you

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
the water actually in the bottom you

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.740 
the water actually in the bottom you
think<00:02:27.859> so<00:02:28.340> when<00:02:28.489> I<00:02:28.519> tighten<00:02:28.760> this<00:02:28.969> up<00:02:29.030> more<00:02:29.420> and

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
think so when I tighten this up more and

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.209 
think so when I tighten this up more and
I<00:02:29.989> think<00:02:30.170> it's<00:02:30.319> as<00:02:30.469> tight<00:02:30.680> as<00:02:30.829> it<00:02:30.950> can<00:02:30.980> go

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:31.219 
I think it's as tight as it can go

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.390 
I think it's as tight as it can go
anyway<00:02:31.489> but<00:02:31.700> anyway<00:02:32.030> let<00:02:32.840> me<00:02:32.870> just<00:02:32.930> do<00:02:33.290> that

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
anyway but anyway let me just do that

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.959 
anyway but anyway let me just do that
put<00:02:34.400> this<00:02:34.519> down<00:02:34.730> just<00:02:38.739> time<00:02:39.739> no<00:02:40.489> I'll<00:02:40.700> put<00:02:40.879> it

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:40.969 
put this down just time no I'll put it

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:49.479 
put this down just time no I'll put it
on<00:02:42.639> and<00:02:43.750> actually<00:02:44.750> it's<00:02:45.109> quite<00:02:45.139> difficult<00:02:48.489> and

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
on and actually it's quite difficult and

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.550 
on and actually it's quite difficult and
you<00:02:49.579> can<00:02:49.730> hear<00:02:49.909> the<00:02:50.060> noise<00:02:50.090> so<00:02:50.870> anyway<00:02:51.409> that's

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
you can hear the noise so anyway that's

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.699 
you can hear the noise so anyway that's
the<00:02:51.769> old<00:02:52.159> version<00:02:52.989> you<00:02:53.989> can<00:02:54.169> see<00:02:54.379> the<00:02:54.530> water

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
the old version you can see the water

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.869 
the old version you can see the water
looks<00:02:54.919> a<00:02:55.069> bit<00:02:57.459> put<00:02:58.459> on<00:02:58.669> pause<00:03:00.430> put<00:03:01.430> down<00:03:01.579> pause

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
looks a bit put on pause put down pause

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.869 
looks a bit put on pause put down pause
and<00:03:02.180> then<00:03:02.269> we<00:03:02.389> look<00:03:02.569> at<00:03:02.719> the<00:03:02.810> new<00:03:03.019> work<00:03:03.819> ok<00:03:04.819> so

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
and then we look at the new work ok so

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.459 
and then we look at the new work ok so
just<00:03:05.060> put<00:03:05.419> the<00:03:05.510> new<00:03:05.689> one<00:03:05.900> on<00:03:06.819> as<00:03:07.819> you<00:03:07.969> can<00:03:08.150> see

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:08.469 
just put the new one on as you can see

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:13.300 
just put the new one on as you can see
and<00:03:10.359> yes<00:03:11.359> up<00:03:11.989> to<00:03:12.319> I'll<00:03:12.680> put<00:03:12.889> it<00:03:12.980> down<00:03:13.010> a<00:03:13.189> bit

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
and yes up to I'll put it down a bit

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.699 
and yes up to I'll put it down a bit
lower<00:03:13.430> actually<00:03:13.939> but<00:03:14.180> if<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:14.989> just<00:03:15.199> listen<00:03:15.590> to

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
lower actually but if you just listen to

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.960 
lower actually but if you just listen to
this<00:03:17.259> again<00:03:18.259> it's<00:03:18.409> actually<00:03:19.129> difficult<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.699> do

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
this again it's actually difficult to do

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:33.339 
this again it's actually difficult to do
at<00:03:20.359> the<00:03:20.479> same<00:03:20.689> time<00:03:21.019> whoops<00:03:31.689> okay<00:03:32.689> so<00:03:32.930> this<00:03:33.199> is

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
at the same time whoops okay so this is

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.210 
at the same time whoops okay so this is
the<00:03:33.500> new<00:03:33.709> one<00:03:34.009> with<00:03:35.319> some<00:03:36.319> water<00:03:36.470> fill<00:03:36.769> day<00:03:36.949> and

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
the new one with some water fill day and

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.039 
the new one with some water fill day and
I<00:03:37.370> just<00:03:37.400> wanted<00:03:37.790> really<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.479> whole<00:03:38.629> point<00:03:38.989> of

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
I just wanted really the whole point of

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.240 
I just wanted really the whole point of
this<00:03:39.229> is<00:03:39.290> to<00:03:39.560> listen<00:03:40.120> to<00:03:41.120> how<00:03:42.069> different<00:03:43.069> it<00:03:43.220> is

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
this is to listen to how different it is

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.479 
this is to listen to how different it is
in<00:03:43.639> terms<00:03:43.909> of<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.269> noise<00:03:44.750> I<00:03:45.099> just<00:03:46.099> push<00:03:46.340> that

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
in terms of the noise I just push that

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:52.899 
in terms of the noise I just push that
down<00:03:49.389> you<00:03:50.389> can<00:03:50.599> hear<00:03:50.840> it's<00:03:50.989> just<00:03:51.909> totally

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909 
down you can hear it's just totally

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.949 
down you can hear it's just totally
different

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.729 

the<00:03:56.959> water<00:03:57.139> looks<00:03:57.379> clean<00:03:57.769> to<00:03:58.069> when<00:03:58.909> I<00:03:58.939> just

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
the water looks clean to when I just

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.969 
the water looks clean to when I just
zapped<00:04:00.739> it<00:04:01.009> whereas<00:04:02.439> what<00:04:03.439> I<00:04:03.469> think<00:04:03.680> I<00:04:03.799> want

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:03.979 
zapped it whereas what I think I want

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:08.080 
zapped it whereas what I think I want
anything<00:04:04.129> to<00:04:04.280> look<00:04:04.400> clean<00:04:04.639> at<00:04:04.819> all<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:06.699> I<00:04:07.699> just

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
anything to look clean at all and I just

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.909 
anything to look clean at all and I just
wanted<00:04:08.569> to<00:04:08.659> show<00:04:08.840> you<00:04:08.900> what<00:04:09.169> the<00:04:09.349> kit<00:04:09.650> looks

wanted to show you what the kit looks
like<00:04:10.129> that<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:10.489> comes<00:04:10.669> with<00:04:10.789> this<00:04:11.239> beaker<00:04:11.780> is

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
like that it comes with this beaker is

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.569 
like that it comes with this beaker is
the<00:04:12.049> old<00:04:12.199> beat-up<00:04:12.530> by<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:12.829> way<00:04:13.009> from<00:04:13.400> the

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
the old beat-up by the way from the

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:19.770 
the old beat-up by the way from the
original<00:04:14.090> so<00:04:14.539> let's<00:04:14.780> shame<00:04:15.280> yeah<00:04:16.870> you<00:04:17.870> get

original so let's shame yeah you get
a<00:04:20.639> new<00:04:21.639> extractor<00:04:22.330> blade<00:04:22.600> which<00:04:22.810> is<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:23.080> key

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
a new extractor blade which is the key

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.940 
a new extractor blade which is the key
of<00:04:23.590> course<00:04:23.889> and<00:04:24.750> then<00:04:25.750> you<00:04:25.870> get<00:04:26.080> a<00:04:26.320> tool<00:04:26.680> cut

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
of course and then you get a tool cut

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.000 
of course and then you get a tool cut
with<00:04:27.190> a<00:04:27.220> comfort<00:04:28.210> ring<00:04:28.480> and<00:04:28.750> a<00:04:29.290> short<00:04:29.530> cut<00:04:29.740> with

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
a handled comfort ring so the two cups

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.310 
a handled comfort ring so the two cups
are<00:04:35.950> useful<00:04:36.690> that's<00:04:37.690> all<00:04:37.840> you<00:04:37.930> get

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
but they're $20 for the extractor blades

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.270 
but they're $20 for the extractor blades
is<00:04:42.400> working<00:04:42.970> on<00:04:43.000> itself<00:04:43.360> of<00:04:43.510> course<00:04:43.630> as

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
is working on itself of course as

annoying<00:05:01.000> actually

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
annoying actually

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
I had the nutribullet thing for about a

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.210 
I had the nutribullet thing for about a
couple<00:05:06.850> in<00:05:07.180> May<00:05:07.590> so<00:05:08.590> it's<00:05:08.680> not<00:05:08.830> it's<00:05:09.100> only

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
couple in May so it's not it's only

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
couple in May so it's not it's only
about<00:05:09.370> six<00:05:09.760> months<00:05:10.180> and<00:05:10.390> that's<00:05:10.660> what<00:05:10.990> happens

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
about six months and that's what happens

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.820 
about six months and that's what happens
personally<00:05:13.240> if<00:05:13.479> every<00:05:13.930> six<00:05:14.169> months<00:05:14.500> you<00:05:14.620> just

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
personally if every six months you just

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.400 
personally if every six months you just
have<00:05:14.979> to<00:05:15.100> buy<00:05:15.250> a<00:05:15.280> new<00:05:15.660> blade<00:05:16.660> then<00:05:17.110> I<00:05:17.200> think
