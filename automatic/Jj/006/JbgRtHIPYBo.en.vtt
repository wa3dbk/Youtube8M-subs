00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
cookie cutter video guide this time it's

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.420 
cookie cutter video guide this time it's
not<00:00:04.200> going<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.410> be<00:00:04.500> as<00:00:04.589> easy<00:00:04.740> as<00:00:04.950> just<00:00:05.130> filming

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
not going to be as easy as just filming

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.990 
not going to be as easy as just filming
one<00:00:05.640> unit<00:00:05.879> like<00:00:06.089> docks<00:00:06.810> or<00:00:07.049> tank<00:00:07.849> and<00:00:08.849> that's

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
one unit like docks or tank and that's

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.759 
one unit like docks or tank and that's
because<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.750> balance<00:00:10.050> has<00:00:10.320> changed<00:00:10.620> for<00:00:10.740> the

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
because the balance has changed for the

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.080 
because the balance has changed for the
better<00:00:10.860> so<00:00:11.370> it's<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.910> lot<00:00:12.059> more

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
better so it's a lot more

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.079 
better so it's a lot more
rock-paper-scissors<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.519> BOM<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.700> actually

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
rock-paper-scissors and BOM is actually

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.720 
rock-paper-scissors and BOM is actually
quite<00:00:15.269> decent<00:00:15.630> right<00:00:15.780> now<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.560> we<00:00:16.770> do<00:00:17.430> need<00:00:17.640> to

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
quite decent right now so we do need to

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.720 
quite decent right now so we do need to
build<00:00:17.850> all<00:00:18.119> three<00:00:18.300> unit<00:00:18.600> types<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.109> that's<00:00:19.730> we

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
build all three unit types so that's we

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.700 
build all three unit types so that's we
need<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.970> build<00:00:21.090> planes<00:00:22.050> we<00:00:22.350> need<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.590> build

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
need to build planes we need to build

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.939 
need to build planes we need to build
vehicles<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.580> we<00:00:23.670> need<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.910> build<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.150> bot<00:00:24.359> okay

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
vehicles and we need to build a bot okay

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.830 
vehicles and we need to build a bot okay
we're<00:00:26.279> gonna<00:00:26.369> go<00:00:26.670> with<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.150> wonderful

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
we're gonna go with a wonderful

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.200 
we're gonna go with a wonderful
brocation<00:00:28.080> expand<00:00:28.500> build<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.580> means<00:00:30.000> we

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
brocation expand build so that means we

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.420 
brocation expand build so that means we
are<00:00:30.449> going<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.840> pick<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.349> spawn<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:31.890> has<00:00:32.250> good

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
are going to pick a spawn that has good

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.500 
are going to pick a spawn that has good
expansion<00:00:33.210> potential<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.809> one<00:00:34.079> direction<00:00:35.510> so

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
expansion potential in one direction so

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
expansion potential in one direction so
you're<00:00:36.630> gonna<00:00:36.750> check<00:00:37.020> your<00:00:37.170> spawn<00:00:37.410> positions

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
you're gonna check your spawn positions

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.560 
you're gonna check your spawn positions
it<00:00:38.129> doesn't<00:00:38.460> look<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:38.610> scary<00:00:39.000> number<00:00:39.239> two<00:00:39.390> it

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
it doesn't look like scary number two it

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.819 
it doesn't look like scary number two it
looks<00:00:39.629> like<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.050> gonna<00:00:40.140> be<00:00:40.230> number<00:00:40.500> one<00:00:40.680> and

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
looks like it's gonna be number one and

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.410 
looks like it's gonna be number one and
we're<00:00:40.950> gonna<00:00:41.040> expand<00:00:41.370> up<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.910> top<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.360> a

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
we're gonna expand up to the top to a

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.110 
we're gonna expand up to the top to a
big<00:00:42.660> metal<00:00:42.960> field<00:00:43.170> up<00:00:43.320> there<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.910> we're<00:00:44.910> going

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
big metal field up there and we're going

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.139 
big metal field up there and we're going
to<00:00:45.149> go<00:00:45.300> with<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:46.530> factory<00:00:47.070> first<00:00:47.719> okay<00:00:48.829> and

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
to go with a a factory first okay and

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.250 
to go with a a factory first okay and
without<00:00:51.149> our<00:00:51.180> factory<00:00:51.660> we're<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.079> press

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
without our factory we're going to press

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.170 
without our factory we're going to press
ctrl<00:00:52.590> on<00:00:52.710> our<00:00:52.829> keyboard<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.399> then<00:00:53.670> click<00:00:53.699> our

continuous mode with a hotkey if you

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.070 
continuous mode with a hotkey if you
haven't<00:01:02.579> already<00:01:02.640> binded<00:01:03.120> continuous<00:01:03.899> mode

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
haven't already binded continuous mode

haven't already binded continuous mode
to<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> hotkey<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.920> should<00:01:05.070> really<00:01:05.309> do<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.430> in

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
to a hotkey you should really do that in

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.030 
to a hotkey you should really do that in
the<00:01:05.909> options<00:01:06.240> menu<00:01:06.530> then<00:01:07.530> when<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.740> command

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
the options menu then when I command

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.800 
the options menu then when I command
knowing<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> qat<00:01:08.580> metal<00:01:08.939> extractor<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.570> then

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
knowing the qat metal extractor and then

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.140 
knowing the qat metal extractor and then
go<00:01:09.960> back<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.350> system<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.220> air<00:01:11.549> factory<00:01:11.909> ok

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
go back to a system the air factory ok

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.780 
go back to a system the air factory ok
just<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.479> get<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.689> air<00:01:12.840> fiber<00:01:13.140> about<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
just to get the air fiber about just the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.539 
just to get the air fiber about just the
tiny<00:01:15.180> bit<00:01:15.360> quicker<00:01:15.680> now<00:01:16.680> we<00:01:16.740> control<00:01:17.340> click

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
tiny bit quicker now we control click

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.749 
tiny bit quicker now we control click
the<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:19.110> F<00:01:19.320> ever<00:01:19.619> because<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.189> will<00:01:20.460> make<00:01:20.640> it

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the the F ever because that will make it

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.670 
the the F ever because that will make it
a<00:01:20.880> priority<00:01:21.090> build<00:01:21.600> order<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.140> overwrite

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
a priority build order and overwrite

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.980 
a priority build order and overwrite
your<00:01:22.710> continuous<00:01:23.400> mode<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.479> gonna<00:01:24.600> it's

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
your continuous mode so it's gonna it's

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.499 
your continuous mode so it's gonna it's
only<00:01:25.200> going<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.380> build<00:01:25.470> one<00:01:25.740> ok<00:01:26.240> so<00:01:27.240> after<00:01:27.330> that

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
only going to build one ok so after that

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.780 
only going to build one ok so after that
we're<00:01:27.659> gonna<00:01:27.750> get<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.960> bot<00:01:28.560> factory<00:01:28.890> into<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> PGM

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
we're gonna get a bot factory into a PGM

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.120 
we're gonna get a bot factory into a PGM
and<00:01:30.060> then<00:01:31.020> with<00:01:31.200> our<00:01:31.320> fabrication<00:01:31.710> aircraft

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
and then with our fabrication aircraft

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.310 
and then with our fabrication aircraft
is<00:01:32.250> going<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.430> go<00:01:32.549> one<00:01:32.790> mix<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.360> then<00:01:33.930> put<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.259> a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
is going to go one mix and then put on a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.560 
is going to go one mix and then put on a
radar<00:01:34.560> next<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> commander<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.299> reason

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
radar next to the commander the reason

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
radar next to the commander the reason
for<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.900> going<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.110> be<00:01:37.200> quite<00:01:37.439> obvious

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
for that is going to be quite obvious

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.249 
for that is going to be quite obvious
very<00:01:38.159> soon<00:01:38.460> basically<00:01:39.270> we<00:01:39.479> are<00:01:39.509> going<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
very soon basically we are going to

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.480 
very soon basically we are going to
build<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.619> radar<00:01:40.890> with<00:01:41.009> our<00:01:41.100> commander<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
build the radar with our commander and

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.010 
build the radar with our commander and
then<00:01:41.729> go<00:01:41.880> back<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.270> expand<00:01:42.689> without<00:01:42.840> a

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
then go back and expand without a

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.580 
then go back and expand without a
fabricator<00:01:43.909> so<00:01:47.960> it's<00:01:48.960> going<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.229> be<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> bit

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
fabricator so it's going to be a bit

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.200 
fabricator so it's going to be a bit
quick<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.950> just<00:01:50.130> watch<00:01:50.399> carefully

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.780 

so<00:01:53.930> a<00:01:53.960> command<00:01:54.620> it<00:01:54.740> goes<00:01:54.890> builds<00:01:55.250> radar<00:01:55.610> and

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
so a command it goes builds radar and

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.980 
so a command it goes builds radar and
then<00:01:55.880> we<00:01:55.970> go<00:01:56.090> back<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.630> expand<00:01:58.030> right<00:01:59.030> like

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
then we go back and expand right like

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.830 
then we go back and expand right like
that<00:02:01.090> now<00:02:02.090> we're<00:02:02.240> going<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.390> start<00:02:02.630> scouting

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
that now we're going to start scouting

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.290 
that now we're going to start scouting
with<00:02:03.140> our<00:02:03.350> hummingbird<00:02:03.680> for<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.670> enemy<00:02:05.030> and

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
with our hummingbird for the enemy and

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.730 
with our hummingbird for the enemy and
then<00:02:05.600> with<00:02:05.840> our<00:02:05.930> factory<00:02:06.320> we're<00:02:06.560> going<00:02:06.680> to

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
then with our factory we're going to

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.139 
then with our factory we're going to
control<00:02:06.979> click<00:02:07.100> a<00:02:07.400> bummer<00:02:07.640> so<00:02:07.880> that's<00:02:08.030> going

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
control click a bummer so that's going

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.550 
control click a bummer so that's going
to<00:02:08.210> priority<00:02:08.570> build<00:02:08.750> it<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.080> it's<00:02:09.289> gonna<00:02:09.410> do

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
to priority build it and it's gonna do

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.770 
to priority build it and it's gonna do
any<00:02:09.820> it's<00:02:10.820> only<00:02:10.970> going<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.180> build<00:02:11.300> one<00:02:11.540> bomber

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
any it's only going to build one bomber

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.750 
any it's only going to build one bomber
and<00:02:12.050> then<00:02:12.230> go<00:02:12.350> back<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.650> hummingbirds<00:02:12.920> ok

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
and then go back to hummingbirds ok

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.080 
and then go back to hummingbirds ok
and<00:02:14.080> then<00:02:15.080> another<00:02:15.650> bot<00:02:15.890> factory<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.670> then

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
and then another bot factory and then

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.480 
and then another bot factory and then
another<00:02:17.300> pigeon<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:18.320> then<00:02:18.980> another<00:02:19.220> bot

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
another pigeon and then another bot

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.770 
another pigeon and then another bot
factory<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.230> then<00:02:21.370> three<00:02:22.370> pigeons<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:23.690> the

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
factory and then three pigeons so the

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.810 
factory and then three pigeons so the
three<00:02:23.959> pigeons<00:02:24.380> are<00:02:24.590> there<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:25.040> allow<00:02:25.370> us<00:02:25.550> to

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
three pigeons are there to allow us to

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.090 
three pigeons are there to allow us to
get<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.150> second<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:26.750> fabricator<00:02:27.140> out<00:02:27.320> okay<00:02:28.070> so

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
get a second and fabricator out okay so

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.960 
get a second and fabricator out okay so
we<00:02:28.310> found<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.610> enemy<00:02:30.459> we<00:02:31.459> know<00:02:31.580> where<00:02:31.760> he<00:02:31.820> is

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
we found the enemy we know where he is

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.370 
we found the enemy we know where he is
we're<00:02:32.180> just<00:02:32.390> gonna<00:02:32.480> wait<00:02:32.690> for<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.930> bomber<00:02:33.260> to

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
we're just gonna wait for the bomber to

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.620 
we're just gonna wait for the bomber to
pop<00:02:33.620> out<00:02:33.739> first<00:02:33.980> before<00:02:34.160> we<00:02:34.310> reveal<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:35.480> we

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
pop out first before we reveal that we

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.260 
pop out first before we reveal that we
have<00:02:35.780> air<00:02:39.160> because<00:02:40.160> our<00:02:40.430> hummingbirds<00:02:41.120> have

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
have air because our hummingbirds have

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.270 
have air because our hummingbirds have
greater<00:02:41.600> vision<00:02:41.810> range<00:02:42.110> than<00:02:42.320> him<00:02:42.530> okay<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.100> he

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
greater vision range than him okay so he

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.699 
greater vision range than him okay so he
spotted<00:02:43.520> us<00:02:43.700> now<00:02:43.959> so<00:02:44.959> what<00:02:45.290> we're<00:02:45.380> gonna<00:02:45.440> do<00:02:45.590> is

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
spotted us now so what we're gonna do is

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.690 
spotted us now so what we're gonna do is
we're<00:02:45.830> going<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:45.980> Scout<00:02:46.250> his<00:02:46.430> build<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.860> he's

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
we're going to Scout his build and he's

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.240 
we're going to Scout his build and he's
gone<00:02:49.940> one<00:02:50.330> a<00:02:50.480> factory<00:02:50.810> into<00:02:51.080> bot<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:52.100> that

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
gone one a factory into bot so that

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.520 
gone one a factory into bot so that
means<00:02:52.400> we<00:02:52.580> are<00:02:52.610> safe<00:02:52.850> to<00:02:53.000> go<00:02:53.120> with<00:02:53.330> a<00:02:53.360> third<00:02:54.260> bot

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
means we are safe to go with a third bot

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.010 
means we are safe to go with a third bot
factory<00:02:54.830> of<00:02:54.950> our<00:02:55.100> own<00:02:55.480> if<00:02:56.480> we<00:02:56.660> had<00:02:56.810> seen<00:02:56.959> a

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
factory of our own if we had seen a

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.690 
factory of our own if we had seen a
second<00:02:57.500> air<00:02:57.560> factory<00:02:57.890> we<00:02:58.040> would<00:02:58.220> have<00:02:58.370> wanted

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
second air factory we would have wanted

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.430 
second air factory we would have wanted
to<00:02:58.730> get<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.030> second<00:02:59.510> air<00:02:59.690> factory<00:03:00.019> of<00:03:00.110> our<00:03:00.230> own

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
to get a second air factory of our own

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.190 
to get a second air factory of our own
and<00:03:00.769> if<00:03:01.400> we<00:03:01.549> had<00:03:01.700> seen<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:02.030> vehicle<00:03:02.269> factory<00:03:02.959> but

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
and if we had seen a vehicle factory but

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.100 
and if we had seen a vehicle factory but
you<00:03:03.260> would<00:03:03.410> have<00:03:03.560> wanted<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:04.660> skip<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.720> third

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
you would have wanted to skip the third

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.570 
you would have wanted to skip the third
bot<00:03:06.440> factory<00:03:06.769> and<00:03:06.920> go<00:03:07.070> straight<00:03:07.400> into

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
bot factory and go straight into

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.300 
bot factory and go straight into
vehicles<00:03:07.880> okay<00:03:08.530> so<00:03:09.530> now<00:03:09.769> we're<00:03:09.950> just<00:03:09.980> going<00:03:10.220> to

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
vehicles okay so now we're just going to

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.370 
vehicles okay so now we're just going to
attack<00:03:10.549> him<00:03:10.730> put<00:03:11.510> some<00:03:11.660> pressure<00:03:11.810> on<00:03:11.959> and

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
attack him put some pressure on and

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.650 
attack him put some pressure on and
because<00:03:13.100> we<00:03:13.250> have<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.610> radar<00:03:13.820> up<00:03:14.150> where<00:03:14.570> you

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
because we have the radar up where you

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.509 
because we have the radar up where you
can<00:03:14.840> tell<00:03:15.019> if<00:03:15.170> he's<00:03:15.290> gonna<00:03:15.470> counter<00:03:16.160> attack<00:03:16.370> us

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
can tell if he's gonna counter attack us

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.030 
can tell if he's gonna counter attack us
with<00:03:16.670> a<00:03:16.730> few<00:03:16.910> number<00:03:17.360> of<00:03:17.450> dots<00:03:17.660> or<00:03:17.989> whatever<00:03:18.230> if

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
with a few number of dots or whatever if

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.280 
with a few number of dots or whatever if
he<00:03:19.250> does<00:03:19.400> that<00:03:19.580> then<00:03:19.910> we<00:03:20.360> can<00:03:20.570> kind<00:03:20.870> of<00:03:20.900> run

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
he does that then we can kind of run

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.120 
he does that then we can kind of run
back<00:03:21.470> with<00:03:21.680> our<00:03:21.830> bomber<00:03:22.070> and<00:03:23.920> okay<00:03:24.920> not

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
back with our bomber and okay not

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.039 
back with our bomber and okay not
anymore<00:03:25.340> we<00:03:25.610> that<00:03:25.790> was<00:03:25.880> a<00:03:25.910> really<00:03:26.120> really<00:03:26.299> bad

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
anymore we that was a really really bad

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.449 
anymore we that was a really really bad
mistake<00:03:29.110> just<00:03:30.110> gonna<00:03:30.290> Riku<00:03:30.680> those<00:03:30.860> page<00:03:31.160> n<00:03:31.340> so

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
mistake just gonna Riku those page n so

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:32.680 
mistake just gonna Riku those page n so
that's<00:03:31.549> easier<00:03:31.910> for<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.120> commander<00:03:32.299> to<00:03:32.540> build

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
that's easier for the commander to build

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.380 
that's easier for the commander to build
them<00:03:34.120> so<00:03:35.120> we're<00:03:35.360> gonna<00:03:35.480> pressure<00:03:36.049> his<00:03:36.320> medal

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
them so we're gonna pressure his medal

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.569 
them so we're gonna pressure his medal
and<00:03:38.860> now<00:03:39.860> that<00:03:40.010> we're<00:03:40.130> building<00:03:40.250> in<00:03:40.489> our

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
and now that we're building in our

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.190 
and now that we're building in our
second<00:03:40.910> pigeon<00:03:41.329> we're<00:03:41.540> gonna<00:03:41.660> start<00:03:42.079> building

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
second pigeon we're gonna start building

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.550 
second pigeon we're gonna start building
our<00:03:42.709> second<00:03:43.370> fabricator<00:03:43.880> our<00:03:44.870> bot<00:03:45.110> fabricator

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
our second fabricator our bot fabricator

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.880 
our second fabricator our bot fabricator
so<00:03:45.709> same<00:03:46.220> thing<00:03:46.250> ctrl<00:03:46.940> click<00:03:47.060> it<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:48.650> just

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
so same thing ctrl click it to just

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.500 
so same thing ctrl click it to just
build<00:03:49.070> one<00:03:49.250> just<00:03:49.760> make<00:03:49.910> sure<00:03:50.030> we<00:03:50.269> are<00:03:50.420> still

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
build one just make sure we are still

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.280 
build one just make sure we are still
expanding<00:03:51.140> with<00:03:51.380> our<00:03:51.560> fabricator

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.370 

and<00:03:57.290> here<00:03:58.250> I'm<00:03:58.550> kind<00:03:59.330> of<00:03:59.360> conservative<00:04:00.200> of

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
and here I'm kind of conservative of

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.050 
and here I'm kind of conservative of
going<00:04:00.650> in<00:04:00.800> because<00:04:01.040> he<00:04:01.160> has<00:04:01.340> a<00:04:01.370> lot<00:04:01.550> of<00:04:01.580> Doc's

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
going in because he has a lot of Doc's

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.430 
going in because he has a lot of Doc's
and<00:04:02.330> there's<00:04:02.450> no<00:04:02.569> point<00:04:02.810> really<00:04:02.959> attacking

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
and there's no point really attacking

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.470 
and there's no point really attacking
where<00:04:03.800> his<00:04:03.890> commander<00:04:04.250> is<00:04:04.370> so<00:04:05.330> we're<00:04:05.450> just

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
where his commander is so we're just

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.699 
where his commander is so we're just
going<00:04:05.660> to<00:04:05.750> control<00:04:06.050> the<00:04:06.140> map<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.440> make<00:04:06.560> sure

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
going to control the map and make sure

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.650 
going to control the map and make sure
he<00:04:06.830> can't<00:04:07.069> expand<00:04:07.550> or<00:04:07.850> if<00:04:07.970> he<00:04:08.060> wants<00:04:08.180> to<00:04:08.330> expand

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
he can't expand or if he wants to expand

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.140 
he can't expand or if he wants to expand
okay<00:04:09.650> so<00:04:09.709> he's<00:04:09.950> moving<00:04:10.190> out<00:04:10.250> right<00:04:10.459> now<00:04:10.580> to<00:04:10.640> try

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
okay so he's moving out right now to try

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.670 
okay so he's moving out right now to try
and<00:04:11.300> expand<00:04:11.600> we<00:04:11.930> don't<00:04:12.200> need<00:04:12.260> to<00:04:12.380> take<00:04:12.500> that

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
and expand we don't need to take that

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.750 
and expand we don't need to take that
fight<00:04:12.860> because<00:04:13.010> our<00:04:13.310> bombers<00:04:13.580> are<00:04:13.640> our

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
fight because our bombers are our

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.150 
fight because our bombers are our
position<00:04:14.180> if<00:04:14.959> our<00:04:15.140> bombers<00:04:15.440> were<00:04:15.620> in<00:04:15.800> position

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
position if our bombers were in position

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.319 
position if our bombers were in position
we<00:04:16.280> would<00:04:16.400> take<00:04:16.549> the<00:04:16.700> fight<00:04:16.880> with<00:04:17.060> our<00:04:17.120> docks

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
we would take the fight with our docks

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.819 
we would take the fight with our docks
and<00:04:17.570> just<00:04:17.870> bomb<00:04:18.019> his<00:04:18.200> clumped<00:04:18.530> up<00:04:18.590> docks

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
and just bomb his clumped up docks

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.340 
and just bomb his clumped up docks
without<00:04:19.040> Obama<00:04:19.730> gonna<00:04:20.510> curb<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:20.840> tanks<00:04:21.169> and

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
without Obama gonna curb the tanks and

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.960 
without Obama gonna curb the tanks and
the<00:04:21.799> pigeon<00:04:22.250> with<00:04:22.400> our<00:04:22.520> second<00:04:22.850> and

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
the pigeon with our second and

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.230 
the pigeon with our second and
fabrication<00:04:23.810> BOTS<00:04:24.639> okay<00:04:25.639> so<00:04:25.700> it's<00:04:25.880> gonna<00:04:25.940> call

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
fabrication BOTS okay so it's gonna call

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.040 
fabrication BOTS okay so it's gonna call
gg

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
gg

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.810 
gg
I<00:04:27.080> don't<00:04:27.560> think<00:04:27.740> he<00:04:27.800> needed<00:04:28.070> to<00:04:28.160> do<00:04:28.310> that<00:04:28.460> but

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
I don't think he needed to do that but

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.540 
I don't think he needed to do that but
okay<00:04:29.750> say<00:04:29.990> it<00:04:30.050> say<00:04:30.200> didn't<00:04:30.470> call<00:04:30.800> GG<00:04:30.980> what<00:04:31.430> we

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
okay say it say didn't call GG what we

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.800 
okay say it say didn't call GG what we
would<00:04:31.700> do<00:04:31.820> is<00:04:31.970> we<00:04:32.180> would<00:04:32.210> keep<00:04:32.510> building

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
would do is we would keep building

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.010 
would do is we would keep building
vehicle<00:04:33.290> factories<00:04:33.650> with<00:04:33.919> our<00:04:34.010> commander<00:04:34.220> and

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
vehicle factories with our commander and

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.210 
vehicle factories with our commander and
continue<00:04:36.020> to<00:04:36.169> pressure<00:04:36.410> him<00:04:36.590> control<00:04:37.040> his

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
continue to pressure him control his

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.640 
continue to pressure him control his
metal<00:04:37.490> expansion<00:04:38.090> and<00:04:38.330> at<00:04:38.780> macro<00:04:39.050> him<00:04:39.320> in<00:04:39.500> the

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
metal expansion and at macro him in the

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.790 
metal expansion and at macro him in the
end<00:04:40.120> I'm<00:04:41.120> really<00:04:41.360> sorry<00:04:41.510> that<00:04:41.630> was<00:04:41.840> really
