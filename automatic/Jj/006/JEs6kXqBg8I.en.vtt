00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:30.420
 We are now flying round here 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.890
 a little more basic work 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.970
 make conditions to improve 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.280
 others but already the first 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.050
 to get rid of race hardness is now running a lot 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.670
 well 12 days of competition already behind us 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.530
 from the first preparatory races where 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.790
 we each one yesterday as today 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.650
 could celebrate a double victory all over 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.989
 racers with whom you can compete 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:01:02.610
 could have been there and for us is the first 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:01:04.320
 Great test we stand together with the 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.119
 Crane start going 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.650
 carl is already a bit ahead 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.600
 he has already won four times for me 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.130
 would be the first time and after we are in 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.930
 is last year became the second 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.049
 Of course the victory is the big goal 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.630
 the new rock scene the day i hit 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.340
 Everyone has always been waiting 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.070
 features at a glance all important 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.150
 data are super recognizable has the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.890
 Mountain biking if it is uneasy anyway 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.110
 you can also see the rock scene 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.370
 the entire height profile and madita pro 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.920
 So man is that means you can 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.750
 actually it's good to read what 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.000
 many are still coming and rising like 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.310
 long it takes for that is it's so 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.290
 much easier but the dirt navigation 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.630
 there's still a super cool feature with 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.000
 gypsy's card material and clay material 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.830
 when we arrived here in south africa 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.090
 I just have a route 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.490
 downloaded and then within 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.590
 the shortest time was right at box 10 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.330
 on it and a made on say 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.940
 drove off or just stroked 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.920
 nachgefahren super easy I super cool 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.140
 Everything works with intent 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.420
 has that some driver coupe fast 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.740
 That's what it was 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.550
 amazing how good it all is 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.790
 had worked 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.160
 After Vox 9 was really a great one 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.110
 consistent development has one 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.910
 gps and especially now with the 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.620
 anti plus connection that we provide services 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.340
 can see there the super nice 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.580
 cleaned up 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.820
 when exactly the information will do that 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.630
 click picture 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.060
 for that, especially the performance 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.970
 warm and in comparison with each other 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.130
 sigma has been a partner of the team since 2007 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.080
 so from the beginning while the care series 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.190
 drivers look at us as a team in the 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.190
 work really continued
