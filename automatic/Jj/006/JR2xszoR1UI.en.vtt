00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.440 
sword which is about a mill at this
point<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.700> remember<00:01:39.150> when<00:01:39.270> these<00:01:39.420> things

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
point to I remember when these things

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.140 
point to I remember when these things
were<00:01:39.750> like<00:01:40.020> five<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.860> ten<00:01:41.100> mil<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.579> expensive

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
were like five to ten mil is expensive

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.880 
were like five to ten mil is expensive
because<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.600> saradomin<00:01:42.990> sword<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.680> whip

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
because the saradomin sword and the whip

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.670 
because the saradomin sword and the whip
were<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> best<00:01:44.460> weapons<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.060> game<00:01:45.329> but<00:01:46.229> thing

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
were the best weapons in game but thing

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.100 
were the best weapons in game but thing
is<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.490> saradomin<00:01:47.850> sword<00:01:48.450> had<00:01:48.689> an<00:01:48.840> advantage

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
is the saradomin sword had an advantage

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.410 
is the saradomin sword had an advantage
because<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:50.100> had<00:01:50.250> an<00:01:50.340> option<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.000> allows<00:01:51.030> you

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
because it had an option that allows you

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.480 
because it had an option that allows you
to<00:01:51.450> only<00:01:51.780> train<00:01:52.229> strengthen<00:01:52.770> people<00:01:53.280> were
