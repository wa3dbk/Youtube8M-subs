all the time I want to keep my hands
braced<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.500> study

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.190 

important<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.040> always<00:03:06.220> compress<00:03:06.849> the<00:03:07.090> top<00:03:07.330> so

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
important to always compress the top so

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.350 
important to always compress the top so
that<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.410> don't<00:03:08.470> get<00:03:08.800> any<00:03:09.010> excess<00:03:09.489> slag

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.350 

best<00:03:29.100> thing<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.460> do<00:03:29.610> is<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:29.880> shut<00:03:30.150> your<00:03:30.300> eyes

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
best thing to do is to shut your eyes

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.000 
best thing to do is to shut your eyes
when<00:03:30.840> you're<00:03:30.930> doing<00:03:31.230> that

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
when you're doing that

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.940 
when you're doing that
and<00:03:32.250> strictly<00:03:32.730> go<00:03:32.909> with<00:03:33.120> feel

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
and strictly go with feel

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.650 
and strictly go with feel
because<00:03:35.520> your<00:03:35.700> eyes<00:03:35.849> will<00:03:36.120> do<00:03:36.270> nothing<00:03:36.420> but

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
because your eyes will do nothing but

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.759 
because your eyes will do nothing but
the<00:03:36.989> Soria<00:03:37.379> is<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.920> watch<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.430> spinning<00:03:39.090> clay

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
the Soria is you watch the spinning clay

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.120 
the Soria is you watch the spinning clay
because<00:03:40.769> what<00:03:41.190> happens<00:03:41.610> is<00:03:41.760> you

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
because what happens is you

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.050 
because what happens is you
a<00:03:43.220> concentric<00:03:44.030> mark<00:03:45.040> on<00:03:46.040> this<00:03:46.280> wheel<00:03:46.580> and<00:03:46.850> you

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
a concentric mark on this wheel and you

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.680 
a concentric mark on this wheel and you
can<00:03:47.240> almost<00:03:47.420> create<00:03:47.990> a<00:03:48.020> psychedelic<00:03:48.590> design

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
can almost create a psychedelic design

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.690 
can almost create a psychedelic design
now<00:03:50.690> if<00:03:50.960> i<00:03:51.140> watch<00:03:51.470> that<00:03:51.830> it<00:03:52.130> becomes<00:03:52.550> very

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
now if i watch that it becomes very

disorienting so the best thing to do

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:01.020
