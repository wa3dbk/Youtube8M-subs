00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.529 
on her back and look up at the things
dangling<00:07:03.729> and<00:07:04.089> that<00:07:04.180> would<00:07:04.300> keep<00:07:04.419> her

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:04.539 
dangling and that would keep her

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:06.269 
dangling and that would keep her
entertained<00:07:04.810> for<00:07:05.199> a<00:07:05.259> long<00:07:05.469> time<00:07:05.740> she<00:07:05.979> loved

00:07:06.269 --> 00:07:06.279 
entertained for a long time she loved

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:07.980 
entertained for a long time she loved
that<00:07:06.580> and<00:07:06.999> sometimes<00:07:07.419> I'd<00:07:07.509> kind<00:07:07.719> of<00:07:07.779> crawl

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990 
that and sometimes I'd kind of crawl

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.269 
that and sometimes I'd kind of crawl
under<00:07:08.289> there<00:07:08.439> and<00:07:08.560> lay<00:07:08.710> with<00:07:08.860> her<00:07:09.039> so<00:07:09.249> she

00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:09.279 
under there and lay with her so she

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:11.040 
under there and lay with her so she
loved<00:07:09.639> that<00:07:09.819> so<00:07:10.360> those<00:07:10.479> are<00:07:10.629> just<00:07:10.659> some<00:07:10.839> I

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.050 
loved that so those are just some I

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.230 
loved that so those are just some I
guess<00:07:11.259> for<00:07:11.710> some<00:07:12.339> things<00:07:12.550> you<00:07:12.639> can<00:07:12.819> do<00:07:12.969> to

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240 
guess for some things you can do to

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.559 
guess for some things you can do to
entertain<00:07:13.659> and<00:07:14.110> stimulate<00:07:14.789> your<00:07:15.789> baby<00:07:16.029> from<00:07:16.270> 0

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:16.569

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:18.370 
to 3 months of age and then just one

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.159 
to 3 months of age and then just one
thing<00:07:18.520> to<00:07:18.639> keep<00:07:18.789> in<00:07:18.909> mind<00:07:18.969> as<00:07:19.389> well<00:07:19.569> as<00:07:19.599> a<00:07:19.749> final

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:20.169 
thing to keep in mind as well as a final

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:22.889 
thing to keep in mind as well as a final
note<00:07:20.229> that<00:07:20.740> all<00:07:20.889> babies<00:07:21.129> develop<00:07:21.899> differently

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:22.899 
note that all babies develop differently

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:25.320 
note that all babies develop differently
in<00:07:23.800> a<00:07:23.979> different<00:07:24.009> stages<00:07:24.699> so<00:07:24.729> some<00:07:25.029> babies

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.330 
in a different stages so some babies

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.820 
in a different stages so some babies
obviously<00:07:25.719> walk<00:07:25.960> as<00:07:26.169> early<00:07:26.409> as<00:07:26.469> like<00:07:26.589> eight

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:26.830 
obviously walk as early as like eight

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.619 
obviously walk as early as like eight
months<00:07:27.219> and<00:07:27.370> some<00:07:27.909> don't<00:07:28.149> walk<00:07:28.330> until

00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:28.629 
months and some don't walk until

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:30.899 
months and some don't walk until
eighteen<00:07:29.050> months<00:07:29.529> some<00:07:30.099> sit<00:07:30.399> up<00:07:30.520> sooner<00:07:30.879> than

00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:30.909 
eighteen months some sit up sooner than

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:33.389 
eighteen months some sit up sooner than
others<00:07:31.149> some<00:07:31.749> served<00:07:31.990> across<00:07:32.349> so<00:07:32.740> you<00:07:33.279> know

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:33.399 
others some served across so you know

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:35.429
