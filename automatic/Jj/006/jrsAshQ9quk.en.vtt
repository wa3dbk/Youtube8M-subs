00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.800
 pretty wacky and those same dreams we have 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.960

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.310
 so you only have a brief I wanted big 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.470
 that's a challenge because it's really 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.400
 nice and funny enough so called 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.170
 rockstar ask them to do a 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.160
 glitch with me that's what I 'm going 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.920

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.600
 I hope you enjoy this video 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.940
 and then we're right after 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.320
 the debrief that we can call it like 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.320
 it was going to just now 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:13.220
 hello i'm good at rockstar games 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:18.799
 tell me where you play at Gta 5 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:21.140
 often disagree you're a woman 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.030
 and you or gta 5 poquet tell me 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.310
 I would have a little question actually it does not 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.899
 is calling you I would actually like to have 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.130
 a little further on the land but 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.749
 on the ps store actually it costs 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.829
 really expensive and so suddenly I 

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:32.299
 would like to know if you can help me 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.439
 to make a money glitch because there I 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.509
 galley a bit when you have to be two 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.899
 to do it so it's not if you 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.899
 can help me 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:52.700
 yes on the bottom on the game what you 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:53.929
 can not but is what I actually 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.920
 would like to do a glitch so do not know 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:02:13.340
 if you can help me you have to be at 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:15.500
 two to do it you'll never see me 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:23.900
 it's discreet 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:25.130
 was discreet did not think had to win any 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:32.540
 since then from the world you tell me 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:33.709
 you will not see me no it is a pity and 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.150
 you can not give money knox 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.110
 okay because the activities 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.670
 frankly does not pay much 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.670
 man's suit that's a pity that would be 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.920
 frankly noted down rated frankly 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.330
 that money should be improved 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.380
 we win a little more in the next 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.510
 patches because frankly there in 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.920
 galley all you put dlc with 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.310
 far too much to buy 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.310
 not enough money 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.209
