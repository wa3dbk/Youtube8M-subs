braiding<00:00:28.019> it's<00:00:28.590> got<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.830> little<00:00:29.099> bit<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.429> shine

braiding it's got a little bit of shine
to<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:30.179> but<00:00:30.449> not<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:30.869> much<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.380> looks

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
to it but not so much that it looks

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.650 
to it but not so much that it looks
greasy<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.790> just<00:00:32.969> kind<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.180> helps<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
greasy and it just kind of helps the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.690 
greasy and it just kind of helps the
hair<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.020> stick<00:00:34.380> together<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.860> little<00:00:35.219> bit<00:00:35.430> and

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
hair to stick together a little bit and

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.240 
hair to stick together a little bit and
create<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.630> really<00:00:37.170> nice<00:00:37.380> clean<00:00:37.739> looking

cross over the two outside strand and

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.979 
cross over the two outside strand and
then<00:00:50.010> I'm<00:00:50.370> continuing<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.600> sort<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.840> a

French braid or cornrow style braid I'm
going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> be<00:00:56.190> adding<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.239> break<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.809> wire

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
going to be adding in the break the wire

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.160 
going to be adding in the break the wire
to<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> braid<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.520> after<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.420> get<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.809> couple

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
to the braid just after I get a couple

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.689 
to the braid just after I get a couple
of<00:01:01.230> turns<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.100> there's<00:01:02.250> something<00:01:02.430> that's

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
of turns in so there's something that's

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.390 
of turns in so there's something that's
to<00:01:02.820> get<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.290> here's<00:01:04.290> my<00:01:04.470> wire<00:01:04.650> I've<00:01:04.920> created<00:01:05.189> a

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
to get to here's my wire I've created a

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.880 
to get to here's my wire I've created a
little<00:01:05.580> loop<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.479> end<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:07.500> almost<00:01:07.680> like

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
little loop on the end it's almost like

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.950 
little loop on the end it's almost like
a<00:01:08.010> hook<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.640> I'm<00:01:08.700> sliding<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.240> into<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.600> middle

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
a hook so I'm sliding it into the middle

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.289 
a hook so I'm sliding it into the middle
of<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> braid<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.650> then<00:01:11.280> pulling<00:01:11.610> back<00:01:11.760> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
of the braid and then pulling back and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.929 
of the braid and then pulling back and
that<00:01:12.510> hook<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.560> help<00:01:14.250> attach<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.820> so

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
that hook is going to help attach it so

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.760 
that hook is going to help attach it so
it<00:01:15.060> doesn't<00:01:15.210> slide<00:01:15.600> out<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.259> continue

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
it doesn't slide out as I continue

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.530 
it doesn't slide out as I continue
braiding

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.170 

as<00:01:25.540> I'm<00:01:26.290> braiding<00:01:26.530> in<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.860> wire<00:01:27.070> I<00:01:27.460> am<00:01:27.700> every

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
as I'm braiding in the wire I am every

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.090 
as I'm braiding in the wire I am every
time<00:01:28.390> I<00:01:28.420> cross<00:01:28.750> over<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.229> right<00:01:29.440> strand<00:01:29.799> I'm

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
time I cross over the right strand I'm

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.460 
time I cross over the right strand I'm
crossing<00:01:30.580> it<00:01:30.700> over<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:31.240> hair<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:31.720> then

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
crossing it over the hair and then

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.800 
crossing it over the hair and then
underneath<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.250> wire<00:01:33.640> when<00:01:34.299> I<00:01:34.330> cross<00:01:34.630> the

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
underneath the wire when I cross the

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.230 
underneath the wire when I cross the
left<00:01:35.049> strand<00:01:35.350> I<00:01:35.619> cross<00:01:36.250> it<00:01:36.280> over<00:01:36.520> both<00:01:36.909> the

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
left strand I cross it over both the

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.920 
left strand I cross it over both the
hair<00:01:37.690> and<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.200> wire

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.469 

so<00:01:42.930> right<00:01:43.140> strand<00:01:43.500> over<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.340> hair<00:01:44.550> under<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
so right strand over the hair under the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.370 
so right strand over the hair under the
wire<00:01:46.700> left<00:01:47.700> strand<00:01:48.120> I'm<00:01:48.450> adding<00:01:49.080> a<00:01:49.140> little<00:01:49.229> bit

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
wire left strand I'm adding a little bit

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.890 
wire left strand I'm adding a little bit
of<00:01:49.560> hair<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.920> it

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
of hair to it

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.990

cross<00:01:51.900> it<00:01:52.110> over<00:01:52.260> both<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.950> wire<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.940> hair

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
cross it over both the wire and the hair

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.370 
cross it over both the wire and the hair
continuing<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.210> slave<00:01:57.479> will<00:01:57.840> help<00:01:58.170> to

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
continuing in this slave will help to

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.620 
continuing in this slave will help to
make<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.800> wire<00:01:59.160> completely<00:01:59.940> invisible<00:02:00.210> as

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
make the wire completely invisible as

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.960 
make the wire completely invisible as
long<00:02:01.229> as<00:02:01.380> you've<00:02:01.530> got<00:02:01.560> enough<00:02:01.950> hair<00:02:02.190> that<00:02:02.820> will

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
long as you've got enough hair that will

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.370 
long as you've got enough hair that will
cover<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.390> if<00:02:03.570> you're<00:02:03.720> trying<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.080> a<00:02:04.110> really

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
cover it if you're trying to do a really

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.260 
cover it if you're trying to do a really
tiny<00:02:04.590> braid<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.040> might<00:02:05.190> not<00:02:05.430> completely<00:02:05.759> cover

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
tiny braid it might not completely cover

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.240 
tiny braid it might not completely cover
but<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.440> best<00:02:07.590> way<00:02:07.770> I've<00:02:07.920> found<00:02:07.950> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
but this is the best way I've found to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.480 
but this is the best way I've found to
keep<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.610> really<00:02:09.479> nice<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.690> clean<00:02:09.979> I'm<00:02:10.979> sort

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
keep it really nice and clean I'm sort

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.160 
keep it really nice and clean I'm sort
of<00:02:11.550> creating<00:02:11.850> this<00:02:12.000> braid<00:02:12.240> to<00:02:12.390> follow<00:02:12.690> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
of creating this braid to follow the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.440 
of creating this braid to follow the
hairline<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> similar<00:02:15.090> technique

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
hairline this is a similar technique

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.949 
hairline this is a similar technique
that<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.690> used<00:02:16.050> for<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.880> Little<00:02:18.420> Red<00:02:18.540> Riding

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
that I used for the Little Red Riding

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.420 
that I used for the Little Red Riding
Hood<00:02:19.140> look<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.770> I'm<00:02:19.860> going<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.070> show<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.220> at

Hood look that I'm going to show you at

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.940 
Hood look that I'm going to show you at
the<00:02:20.550> end<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.910> video<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:22.590> just<00:02:22.770> want<00:02:22.890> to

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
the end of the video and I just want to

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.620 
the end of the video and I just want to
show<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.160> here<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:23.640> can<00:02:23.880> turn<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.450> wire

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
show you here that you can turn the wire

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.320 
show you here that you can turn the wire
and<00:02:25.020> turn<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.860> braid<00:02:26.130> as<00:02:26.400> you're<00:02:26.760> continuing

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
and turn the braid as you're continuing

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.930 
and turn the braid as you're continuing
along<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:28.320> all<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.620> did<00:02:28.770> was<00:02:29.220> just<00:02:29.459> bend<00:02:29.760> the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
along so all I did was just bend the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.940 
along so all I did was just bend the
wire<00:02:30.090> into<00:02:30.480> place<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.989> then<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.320> am<00:02:31.530> following

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
wire into place and then I am following

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.750 
wire into place and then I am following
the<00:02:32.310> hair<00:02:32.489> line<00:02:32.730> down<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.450> side<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.870> head

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
the hair line down the side of the head

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.310 
the hair line down the side of the head
same<00:02:35.760> technique<00:02:36.180> when<00:02:36.600> I'm<00:02:36.720> crossing<00:02:37.170> over

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
same technique when I'm crossing over

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.380 
same technique when I'm crossing over
the<00:02:37.560> left<00:02:37.769> strand<00:02:38.070> I'm<00:02:38.400> crossing<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.269> over

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
the left strand I'm crossing it over

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.140 
the left strand I'm crossing it over
both<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.750> wire<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.530> hair<00:02:40.820> when<00:02:41.820> I<00:02:41.850> cross

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
both the wire and the hair when I cross

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.970 
both the wire and the hair when I cross
over<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.540> right<00:02:42.690> strand<00:02:43.019> I<00:02:43.170> cross<00:02:43.410> over<00:02:43.830> the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
over the right strand I cross over the

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.620 
over the right strand I cross over the
hair<00:02:44.190> under<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.000> wire<00:02:46.730> I'm<00:02:47.730> only<00:02:48.000> adding<00:02:48.239> hair

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
hair under the wire I'm only adding hair

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.130 
hair under the wire I'm only adding hair
to<00:02:48.660> one<00:02:49.320> side<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.830> my<00:02:49.950> braid<00:02:50.220> here<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.840> as<00:02:51.840> I

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
to one side of my braid here and as I

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.520 
to one side of my braid here and as I
work<00:02:52.470> down<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.950> head<00:02:53.160> I'm<00:02:54.019> pulling<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.200> braid

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
work down the head I'm pulling the braid

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.350 
work down the head I'm pulling the braid
sort<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:55.950> away<00:02:56.250> from<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.640> head<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:56.820> wanted<00:02:57.209> this

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
sort of away from the head I wanted this

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.319 
sort of away from the head I wanted this
to<00:02:57.540> be<00:02:57.660> able<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.900> stand<00:02:58.290> up<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.790> defy<00:02:59.790> gravity

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
to be able to stand up and defy gravity

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.009 
to be able to stand up and defy gravity
so<00:03:00.989> I<00:03:01.070> need<00:03:02.070> a<00:03:02.100> little<00:03:02.370> bit<00:03:02.549> of<00:03:02.700> hair<00:03:03.030> that's

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
so I need a little bit of hair that's

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:14.850 
so I need a little bit of hair that's
following<00:03:04.470> away<00:03:05.040> from<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.400> head

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:58.640 

you

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.200 

once<00:03:59.650> I<00:03:59.800> get<00:03:59.950> to<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.190> point<00:04:00.400> where<00:04:00.670> I<00:04:00.700> want<00:04:01.120> the

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
once I get to the point where I want the

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.550 
once I get to the point where I want the
braid<00:04:01.390> to<00:04:01.510> stop<00:04:01.750> I'm<00:04:01.960> just<00:04:02.200> gonna<00:04:02.320> continue

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
braid to stop I'm just gonna continue

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.860 
braid to stop I'm just gonna continue
braiding<00:04:03.190> down<00:04:03.610> the<00:04:03.790> wire<00:04:03.940> without<00:04:04.240> adding

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
braiding down the wire without adding

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.870 
braiding down the wire without adding
new<00:04:05.020> hair<00:04:05.050> so<00:04:05.860> same<00:04:06.070> process<00:04:06.550> when<00:04:06.730> I'm

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
new hair so same process when I'm

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.370 
new hair so same process when I'm
crossing<00:04:07.300> over<00:04:07.420> the<00:04:07.690> left<00:04:07.870> strand<00:04:08.110> I'm

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
crossing over the left strand I'm

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.800 
crossing over the left strand I'm
crossing<00:04:09.130> it<00:04:09.190> over<00:04:09.310> both<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:09.700> hair<00:04:10.180> and<00:04:10.480> the

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
crossing it over both the hair and the

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.690 
crossing it over both the hair and the
wire<00:04:10.960> when<00:04:11.770> I'm<00:04:11.890> crossing<00:04:12.280> over<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.550> right

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
strand I cross over the hair under the

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.060 
strand I cross over the hair under the
wire<00:04:15.720> here<00:04:16.720> I'm<00:04:16.840> using<00:04:16.989> a<00:04:17.230> pair<00:04:17.440> of<00:04:17.470> pliers

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
wire here I'm using a pair of pliers

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.610 
wire here I'm using a pair of pliers
with<00:04:18.459> a<00:04:18.489> wire<00:04:18.730> cutter<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:19.780> go<00:04:20.140> ahead<00:04:20.230> and<00:04:20.470> cut

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
with a wire cutter to go ahead and cut

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.890 
with a wire cutter to go ahead and cut
the<00:04:20.739> excess<00:04:21.100> wire<00:04:21.400> and<00:04:21.730> then<00:04:22.300> I'm<00:04:22.420> going<00:04:22.690> to

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
the excess wire and then I'm going to

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.320 
the excess wire and then I'm going to
wrap<00:04:23.230> a<00:04:23.260> rubber<00:04:23.500> band<00:04:23.650> around<00:04:24.070> both<00:04:24.850> the<00:04:25.060> hair

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
wrap a rubber band around both the hair

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.150 
wrap a rubber band around both the hair
and<00:04:25.540> the<00:04:25.840> wire<00:04:26.020> I<00:04:26.260> want<00:04:26.410> to<00:04:26.470> have<00:04:26.560> a<00:04:26.590> little<00:04:27.040> bit

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
and the wire I want to have a little bit

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.620 
and the wire I want to have a little bit
of<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.400> wire<00:04:27.550> hanging<00:04:27.880> out<00:04:28.120> from<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.420> bottom

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.960 
of the wire hanging out from the bottom
of<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.260> braid<00:04:29.500> just<00:04:29.740> so<00:04:30.340> that<00:04:30.460> I<00:04:30.490> know<00:04:30.610> it's

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
of the braid just so that I know it's

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.850 
of the braid just so that I know it's
not<00:04:31.030> going<00:04:31.330> to<00:04:31.390> slide<00:04:31.630> back<00:04:31.660> in<00:04:32.110> and<00:04:32.350> unravel

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
not going to slide back in and unravel

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.320 
not going to slide back in and unravel
now<00:04:35.860> you'll<00:04:36.040> see<00:04:36.220> since<00:04:36.490> I<00:04:36.580> have<00:04:36.730> that<00:04:36.910> wire<00:04:37.090> in

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
now you'll see since I have that wire in

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.210 
now you'll see since I have that wire in
there<00:04:37.510> I<00:04:37.540> can<00:04:37.900> go<00:04:38.020> ahead<00:04:38.110> and<00:04:38.230> pose<00:04:38.560> this<00:04:38.830> braid

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
there I can go ahead and pose this braid

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.700 
there I can go ahead and pose this braid
and<00:04:39.430> shape<00:04:39.730> it<00:04:39.940> into<00:04:40.120> whatever<00:04:40.660> shape<00:04:40.870> I<00:04:41.320> like

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.810 

here's<00:04:44.710> a<00:04:44.770> photo<00:04:45.040> shoot<00:04:45.280> I<00:04:45.370> did<00:04:45.580> where<00:04:45.790> I

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
here's a photo shoot I did where I

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
here's a photo shoot I did where I
created<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:47.080> little<00:04:48.040> red<00:04:48.190> riding-hood

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
created a little red riding-hood

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.870 
created a little red riding-hood
out<00:04:49.840> of<00:04:50.050> hair<00:04:50.320> using<00:04:51.040> the<00:04:51.070> same<00:04:51.520> braiding

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
out of hair using the same braiding

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.720 
out of hair using the same braiding
technique<00:04:52.390> I<00:04:52.690> just<00:04:52.930> started<00:04:53.470> with<00:04:53.740> a<00:04:54.130> couple

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
technique I just started with a couple

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.720 
technique I just started with a couple
of<00:04:54.820> packs<00:04:55.090> of<00:04:55.420> braiding<00:04:56.050> hair<00:04:56.310> and<00:04:57.310> did

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
of packs of braiding hair and did

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.490 
of packs of braiding hair and did
basically<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.270> same<00:04:58.390> technique<00:04:58.750> I<00:04:59.110> just<00:04:59.320> used

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
basically the same technique I just used

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.370 
basically the same technique I just used
a<00:04:59.590> doll<00:04:59.770> head<00:05:00.040> as<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.850> mold<00:05:01.150> basically<00:05:01.600> as<00:05:02.020> I<00:05:02.230> was

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
a doll head as a mold basically as I was

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.930 
a doll head as a mold basically as I was
creating<00:05:02.740> it<00:05:02.860> so<00:05:03.070> it<00:05:03.670> was<00:05:03.760> completely

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
creating it so it was completely

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:13.260 
creating it so it was completely
detached<00:05:04.600> from<00:05:04.750> her<00:05:05.050> head

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.790 

as<00:05:14.270> an<00:05:14.480> extra<00:05:14.660> added<00:05:14.990> bonus<00:05:15.020> here's<00:05:15.620> how<00:05:15.740> to

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
as an extra added bonus here's how to

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.220 
as an extra added bonus here's how to
remove<00:05:16.130> the<00:05:16.610> wire<00:05:16.970> from<00:05:17.300> the<00:05:17.390> hair<00:05:17.600> I<00:05:17.750> just

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
remove the wire from the hair I just

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.050 
remove the wire from the hair I just
undid<00:05:18.560> the<00:05:18.680> rubber<00:05:18.860> band<00:05:19.190> at<00:05:19.370> the<00:05:19.490> end<00:05:19.700> just

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
undid the rubber band at the end just

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.060 
undid the rubber band at the end just
give<00:05:20.420> a<00:05:20.450> little<00:05:20.540> push<00:05:21.020> to<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.560> wire<00:05:21.740> at<00:05:22.040> the

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
give a little push to the wire at the

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.980 
give a little push to the wire at the
bottom<00:05:22.520> and<00:05:22.700> then<00:05:23.150> you<00:05:23.270> can<00:05:23.450> slide<00:05:23.750> it<00:05:23.960> right

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
bottom and then you can slide it right

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.530 
bottom and then you can slide it right
up<00:05:24.260> through<00:05:24.470> the<00:05:24.620> top<00:05:24.830> by<00:05:25.100> the<00:05:25.160> hook<00:05:25.520> that<00:05:26.030> you

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
up through the top by the hook that you

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.040 
up through the top by the hook that you
originally<00:05:27.140> created
