00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 I love how they are I am the child and 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.750
 Well, today I'm here again to 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.540
 teach them another tutorial 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.560
 and 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.350
 [Music] 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:16.940
 Well , today's tutorial is going to 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.890
 do another one of these smoke trick by 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.779
 certainly not necessarily have to 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.090
 being with a cigar can also be with 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.100
 a play what you use that does not 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.500
 it matters what smoke is good 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.720
 to do it and well then the trick that 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.180
 I'm going to show you today are the famous 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.900
 smoke habits because I'm sure that 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.820
 you know what they are yes no 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.590
 but well this trick had it 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.660
 asked here at school about 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.940
 comrades told me there is nothing of 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.180
 Teach me how to make the aritos of a very 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.060
 that the fuck then good because here is 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.590
 I will teach them and good the steps to 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.230
 make the base kick rings 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.850
 following his new number one that 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.830
 they have to do as he had told them in 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.840
 the previous video is that they have to 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.780
 give you a good cast to edit cigar 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.939
 a good one because as I already had 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.770
 said in the previous video if you give a 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.960
 small, maybe you can hardly notice 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.200
 the trick that the smoke does not come out so 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.450
 thick enough so that it can be seen well 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.250
 and as I said, I'm sure 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.049
 that you want to be noticed 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.539
 to show it to someone or whatever 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.579
 but well that 's the problem of each 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.469
 fifth number two the next thing that 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.439
 have to do is that after that 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:31.159
 he has plugged in the cigar they have to 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:34.280
 hold the smoke in your mouth like three 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.340
 to five seconds and then they have to 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.860
 put your mouth in the angle to make 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.950
 to blow the aritos has to be in 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.380
 way a voice can be like that with the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.599
 lip service or as I do 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.020
 half with the lips for more inside or 

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:50.020
 less so 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.799
 if that is the angle at which you have to 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.130
 be your mouth to be able to do 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.500
 If you want, you can also 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.360
 make side of your mouth a little bigger 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.539
 so that the rings can come out a bit 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.670
 larger the glass number 3 what 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.039
 next thing they have to do is that 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.590
 after they have already put their mouth 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.519
 in the right angle and all that have 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:20.239
 to take out the smoke in this way to 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.310
 that they leave the booths one by one and 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.959
 they can do it in different ways there 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.220
 some that do it as if they were 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.530
 doing so 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.410
 there are others who do it half blowing 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.680
 something like what 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.050
 I personally this is the way 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.330
 I'll tell it as I do as 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.010
 it's easier for me to get it out with the 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.430
 language 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:49.760
 it's about half doing your language well 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.329
 and they understand me something like this 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.239
 but when they have their mouths on the 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:03:00.079
 sideways have to try not to 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:03.819
 touch this part the inside part 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:06.579
 of the plane so they are pushed 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.790
 with the tongue and then they start dating 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:11.230
 the aritos and well then a test of 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.870
 that these three steps that I just finished 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.060
 give could work is that I'm going to 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.329
 make the 1-month rings so that the 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.329
 see 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.769
 but 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.940
 the smoke rings would be something 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.920
 A) Yes 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.140
 and well, this was the tutorial today 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.270
 I hope you liked it and that if 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.010
 They want to try it, so they can do it and 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.530
 Well, I also want to thank you 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.840
 the schoolmates that I 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.360
 they said that if I could teach them to do 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.670
 this trick you also if you want 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.990

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.300

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.530
 You can make them in a video so that 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.530
