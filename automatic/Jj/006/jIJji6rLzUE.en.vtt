at<00:00:32.790> Extreme<00:00:32.820> Rules<00:00:33.530> but<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.559> do<00:00:34.680> indeed<00:00:35.130> thing

this match will take place I think all

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.209 
this match will take place I think all
of<00:00:37.469> us<00:00:37.829> are<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.610> majority<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:39.120> us<00:00:39.480> do<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.860> think

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
of us are the majority of us do I think

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.400 
of us are the majority of us do I think
this<00:00:41.309> match<00:00:41.610> will<00:00:41.969> take<00:00:42.239> place<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.660> mean<00:00:42.840> out<00:00:43.320> of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
this match will take place I mean out of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.470 
this match will take place I mean out of
all<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.800> matches<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.190> could<00:00:44.610> take<00:00:44.789> place<00:00:44.850> at

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
all the matches that could take place at

all the matches that could take place at
Extreme<00:00:45.780> Rules<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.140> think<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.410> one's<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
Extreme Rules I think this one's the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.270 
Extreme Rules I think this one's the
most<00:00:47.010> obvious<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.910> one's<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.239> most<00:00:49.280> likely

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
most obvious this one's the most likely

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.630 
most obvious this one's the most likely
to<00:00:50.489> happen<00:00:51.140> given<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.170> there's<00:00:53.129> been<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.370> lot

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
to happen given that there's been a lot

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.819 
to happen given that there's been a lot
of<00:00:53.670> interaction<00:00:54.510> between<00:00:54.870> Ryback<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.559> John

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
of interaction between Ryback and John

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.479 
of interaction between Ryback and John
Cena<00:00:56.370> ever<00:00:57.270> since<00:00:57.660> right<00:00:58.050> back<00:00:58.320> hit<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.219> shell

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
Cena ever since right back hit the shell

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.410 
Cena ever since right back hit the shell
shock<00:00:59.520> on<00:01:00.030> John<00:01:00.480> Cena<00:01:00.750> which<00:01:00.989> was<00:01:01.910> like<00:01:02.910> two

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
shock on John Cena which was like two

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.880 
shock on John Cena which was like two
weeks<00:01:03.570> ago<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.229> really<00:01:04.409> hasn't<00:01:04.619> been<00:01:04.769> that

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
weeks ago so it really hasn't been that

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.330 
weeks ago so it really hasn't been that
long<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.670> there's<00:01:05.880> only<00:01:06.000> been<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.780> two

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
long and there's only been to two

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.710 
long and there's only been to two
instances<00:01:08.340> where<00:01:08.729> Ryback<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.330> John<00:01:09.510> Cena

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
instances where Ryback and John Cena

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.270 
instances where Ryback and John Cena
I've<00:01:09.869> had<00:01:09.990> any<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.740> know<00:01:10.770> physical

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
but pretty much John Cena's focus and

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.660 
but pretty much John Cena's focus and
ryback's<00:01:18.360> focus<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.560> been<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.340> know<00:01:20.460> each

other Ryback is no longer feuding with
Mark<00:01:24.420> Henry<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.810> John<00:01:25.380> Cena<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:26.070> no<00:01:26.340> longer

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
Mark Henry and John Cena is no longer

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.060 
Mark Henry and John Cena is no longer
feuding<00:01:27.210> with<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.600> block<00:01:27.780> at<00:01:28.020> least<00:01:28.350> not<00:01:28.650> at

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
feuding with the block at least not at

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.789 
feuding with the block at least not at
this<00:01:29.130> moment<00:01:30.200> especially<00:01:31.200> with<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.650> rock

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
this moment especially with the rock

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.980 
this moment especially with the rock
being<00:01:32.070> injured<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.610> stuff<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.150> was<00:01:33.689> thinking

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
being injured and stuff I was thinking

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.140 
being injured and stuff I was thinking
maybe<00:01:34.110> Extreme<00:01:34.530> Rules<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.610> rock<00:01:35.790> would<00:01:35.970> get<00:01:36.119> a

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
maybe Extreme Rules the rock would get a

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.450 
maybe Extreme Rules the rock would get a
rematch<00:01:36.390> with<00:01:36.869> John<00:01:36.930> Cena<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.220> then<00:01:38.369> he

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
rematch with John Cena but then he

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.330 
rematch with John Cena but then he
suffered<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.850> injury<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.810> looks<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.860> Ryback

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
suffered the injury so looks like Ryback

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.270 
suffered the injury so looks like Ryback
is<00:01:41.820> now<00:01:42.060> going<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.659> face<00:01:42.869> John<00:01:43.229> Cena<00:01:43.259> for<00:01:44.100> this

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
is now going to face John Cena for this

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.520 
is now going to face John Cena for this
championship<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.149> he's<00:01:45.960> gonna<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.200> facing

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
championship and he's gonna be facing

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.249 
championship and he's gonna be facing
John<00:01:46.860> Cena<00:01:47.220> as<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.430> heel<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.810> gonna<00:01:48.960> be

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
John Cena as a heel so this is gonna be

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.870 
John Cena as a heel so this is gonna be
I<00:01:49.590> was<00:01:50.009> gonna<00:01:50.100> say<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.579> gonna<00:01:50.700> be

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
I was gonna say this is gonna be

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.030 
I was gonna say this is gonna be
ryback's<00:01:51.509> first<00:01:51.750> matches<00:01:52.020> heel<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:52.890> don't

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
ryback's first matches heel but we don't

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.179 
ryback's first matches heel but we don't
know<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:54.229> because<00:01:55.229> he<00:01:55.409> could<00:01:55.560> compete<00:01:55.950> on

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
know that so because he could compete on

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.270 
know that so because he could compete on
Raw<00:01:56.430> before<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.810> pay-per-view<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:59.009> that

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
Raw before the pay-per-view and that

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.459

title would be right back I thought
maybe<00:04:39.210> if<00:04:39.750> Ryback<00:04:40.289> would<00:04:40.440> challenge<00:04:40.680> for<00:04:40.949> the

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.379 
maybe if Ryback would challenge for the
championship<00:04:41.430> it<00:04:41.729> be<00:04:41.879> maybe<00:04:42.090> around

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
championship it be maybe around

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.420

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
SummerSlam or something like that so I

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.010

happen<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:46.860> things<00:04:47.759> change<00:04:48.210> so<00:04:49.110> if<00:04:49.830> you<00:04:50.069> know

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.159
