00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
one that is curved at the end where it

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.880 
one that is curved at the end where it
can<00:01:37.799> go<00:01:37.920> around<00:01:38.159> your<00:01:38.340> finger<00:01:38.820> if<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.500> get<00:01:40.680> bit

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
it has stuck and it does leave a small

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.770 
it has stuck and it does leave a small
ring<00:03:00.079> but<00:03:01.079> hardly<00:03:01.860> enough<00:03:02.370> suction<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.910> suck

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
ring but hardly enough suction to suck

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.170

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
suction cups here and I took this little

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.850 
suction cups here and I took this little
ADB<00:04:13.310> tourniquet<00:04:13.959> sort<00:04:14.959> of<00:04:15.080> gizmo<00:04:15.440> it's

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
ADB tourniquet sort of gizmo it's

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.069

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
labeled as the tourniquet I don't see it

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.319 
labeled as the tourniquet I don't see it
working<00:04:18.109> all<00:04:18.560> that<00:04:18.709> great<00:04:19.010> but<00:04:19.850> I<00:04:19.910> threw<00:04:20.090> it<00:04:20.209> in

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
working all that great but I threw it in

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.969 
working all that great but I threw it in
here<00:04:20.630> it<00:04:20.780> did<00:04:20.930> originally<00:04:21.139> come<00:04:21.650> in<00:04:21.799> this

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
here it did originally come in this

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:27.100 
here it did originally come in this
cheaper<00:04:22.880> one<00:04:23.290> mm<00:04:25.360> the<00:04:26.360> way<00:04:26.510> this<00:04:26.690> one<00:04:26.930> works

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
cheaper one mm the way this one works

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.860 
cheaper one mm the way this one works
you<00:04:27.320> take<00:04:27.530> one<00:04:27.710> of<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:27.830> suction<00:04:28.250> cups<00:04:28.660> you<00:04:29.660> put

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.200 
you take one of the suction cups you put
it<00:04:29.960> on<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.200> end<00:04:30.410> and<00:04:31.160> then<00:04:31.729> it's<00:04:31.880> just<00:04:32.000> like

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
it on the end and then it's just like

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.320 
it on the end and then it's just like
you're<00:04:32.800> injecting<00:04:33.800> something<00:04:34.310> into<00:04:34.550> your<00:04:34.880> arm

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330
