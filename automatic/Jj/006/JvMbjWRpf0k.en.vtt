the left this is the old one on the
right<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.890> would<00:00:29.519> show<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.880> packaging

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
right I would show you the packaging

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.200 
right I would show you the packaging
except<00:00:30.810> my<00:00:31.080> new<00:00:31.289> ones<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.890> got<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.610> bluefin

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
except my new ones I got the bluefin

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.120 
except my new ones I got the bluefin
versions<00:00:33.660> which<00:00:33.840> means<00:00:34.050> they<00:00:34.260> were<00:00:34.320> destroyed

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
versions which means they were destroyed

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.549 
versions which means they were destroyed
for<00:00:35.340> distribution<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.510> US<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
for distribution in the US and the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.830 
for distribution in the US and the
original<00:00:37.980> one<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.399> have<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.850> Japanese<00:00:39.329> version

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
original one I have the Japanese version

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.530 
original one I have the Japanese version
I'm<00:00:39.989> not<00:00:40.200> sure<00:00:40.579> if<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.730> even<00:00:41.940> had<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> bluefin

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
I'm not sure if it even had a bluefin

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.639 
I'm not sure if it even had a bluefin
version<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.930> be<00:00:42.960> honest<00:00:43.290> because<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.500> wasn't

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
version to be honest because I wasn't

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.229 
version to be honest because I wasn't
collecting<00:00:44.070> them<00:00:44.219> currently<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.879> was<00:00:45.059> buying

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
collecting them currently I was buying

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.389 
collecting them currently I was buying
them<00:00:45.420> after<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.320> fact<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.100> can't<00:00:47.280> really

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
them after the fact so I can't really

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.799 
them after the fact so I can't really
compare<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.879> packages<00:00:48.270> they<00:00:48.450> have<00:00:48.539> different

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
compare the packages they have different

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.540 
compare the packages they have different
stickers<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.289> things<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.649> them<00:00:49.860> but<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.370> far

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
stickers and things on them but as far

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.060 
stickers and things on them but as far
as<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.789> figures<00:00:51.210> go<00:00:51.480> let's<00:00:52.020> for<00:00:52.559> example

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
as the figures go let's for example

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.060 
as the figures go let's for example
let's<00:00:53.280> grab<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.940> face<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:55.860> either

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
let's grab a face that I have for either

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.150 
let's grab a face that I have for either
one<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:57.030> remember<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.629> new<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.800> on<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
one so remember the new one is on the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.060 
one so remember the new one is on the
left<00:00:59.280> the<00:01:00.180> old<00:01:00.390> one<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.320> right<00:01:01.620> let's

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
left the old one is on the right let's

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.770 
left the old one is on the right let's
see<00:01:02.250> if<00:01:02.340> there<00:01:02.550> are<00:01:02.579> any<00:01:02.760> major<00:01:03.180> differences

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
see if there are any major differences

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.630 
see if there are any major differences
this<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.199> my<00:01:04.379> first<00:01:04.710> time<00:01:04.890> actually<00:01:05.159> looking

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
this is my first time actually looking

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.789 
this is my first time actually looking
at<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:05.960> also<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.110> I'm<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> little<00:01:07.439> bit<00:01:07.560> curious

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
at this also so I'm a little bit curious

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.640 
at this also so I'm a little bit curious
just<00:01:08.520> like<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.850> guys<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.810> looks<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.380> other

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
just like you guys it looks like other

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.190 
just like you guys it looks like other
than<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.580> know<00:01:11.700> just<00:01:11.909> production<00:01:12.240> variation

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
than you know just production variation

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.230 
than you know just production variation
like<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.040> paint<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> right<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> little

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
like the paint on the right is a little

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.840 
like the paint on the right is a little
sloppy<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.740> little<00:01:17.159> bit<00:01:17.280> sloppy<00:01:17.490> under

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
sloppy just a little bit sloppy under

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.390 
sloppy just a little bit sloppy under
the<00:01:17.970> eyes<00:01:18.090> they<00:01:18.810> look<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.380> everything<00:01:20.009> is

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
the eyes they look like everything is

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.749 
the eyes they look like everything is
identical<00:01:21.920> again<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.070> one's<00:01:23.310> like<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> little

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
identical again this one's like a little

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.190 
identical again this one's like a little
sloppy<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.150> between<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> eyes<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.930> one's<00:01:25.140> a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
sloppy in between the eyes this one's a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.630 
sloppy in between the eyes this one's a
little<00:01:25.320> sloppy<00:01:25.619> under<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> eyes

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
little sloppy under the eyes

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.730 
little sloppy under the eyes
like<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.150> said<00:01:27.210> production<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.020> variation

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
like I said production of variation

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.219 
like I said production of variation
let's<00:01:28.950> see<00:01:29.450> let's<00:01:30.450> pull<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.750> figure<00:01:31.049> itself

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
let's see let's pull the figure itself

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.740 
let's see let's pull the figure itself
out<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.950> see<00:01:32.520> if<00:01:32.670> those<00:01:32.880> faces<00:01:33.360> look<00:01:33.540> any

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
out and see if those faces look any

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.160 
out and see if those faces look any
different<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:36.560> we<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:38.750> what<00:01:39.750> looks<00:01:40.049> like

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
different so we have what looks like

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.859 
different so we have what looks like
again<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:41.009> production<00:01:41.549> variation<00:01:42.390> maybe

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
again just production variation maybe

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.590 
again just production variation maybe
slightly<00:01:43.829> cleaner<00:01:44.399> for<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> lines<00:01:45.119> under<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
slightly cleaner for the lines under the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.230 
slightly cleaner for the lines under the
eyes<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:46.110> little<00:01:46.470> bit<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.700> one<00:01:47.939> looks<00:01:48.149> like

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
eyes a little bit this one looks like

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.980 
eyes a little bit this one looks like
it's<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.630> little<00:01:48.899> thick<00:01:49.140> again<00:01:50.390> but<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.810> might

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
it's a little thick again but that might

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.899 
it's a little thick again but that might
just<00:01:52.020> be<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.619> one<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:53.100> can't<00:01:53.430> really<00:01:53.610> count

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
just be this one so I can't really count

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.569 
just be this one so I can't really count
that<00:01:54.060> as<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> difference<00:01:55.049> as<00:01:55.530> far<00:01:55.590> as<00:01:55.860> tones<00:01:56.250> in

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
that as a difference as far as tones in

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.499 
that as a difference as far as tones in
the<00:01:56.790> hair<00:01:58.219> maybe<00:01:59.219> there's<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.700> little<00:02:00.060> bit<00:02:00.479> more

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
the hair maybe there's a little bit more

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.410 
the hair maybe there's a little bit more
shading<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.290> new<00:02:01.439> one<00:02:01.680> maybe<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.850> old<00:02:03.240> one

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
shading in the new one maybe the old one

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.749 
shading in the new one maybe the old one
looks<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.719> little<00:02:03.750> bit<00:02:04.290> fainter<00:02:04.770> again<00:02:05.579> it's

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
looks a little bit fainter again it's

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.459 
looks a little bit fainter again it's
not<00:02:06.030> enough<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.540> can't<00:02:06.840> say<00:02:07.049> it's<00:02:07.200> just

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
not enough that I can't say it's just

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.729 
not enough that I can't say it's just
you<00:02:07.890> know<00:02:08.009> production<00:02:08.550> variation<00:02:09.739> sometimes

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
you know production variation sometimes

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.260 
you know production variation sometimes
the<00:02:11.009> machines<00:02:11.370> or<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.580> people<00:02:11.940> just<00:02:12.120> don't

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
the machines or the people just don't

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
the machines or the people just don't
put<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.599> paint<00:02:12.810> down

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
put the paint down

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.640

nothing's<00:02:24.629> super<00:02:25.079> obvious<00:02:25.230> because<00:02:25.680> I've<00:02:25.799> had

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
nothing's super obvious because I've had

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.309 
nothing's super obvious because I've had
like<00:02:26.730> for<00:02:26.909> example<00:02:27.269> two<00:02:27.540> different<00:02:27.900> Goku's

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
like for example two different Goku's

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.960 
like for example two different Goku's
that<00:02:28.560> had<00:02:28.709> different<00:02:29.129> levels<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.549> shading

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
that had different levels of shading

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.460 
that had different levels of shading
like<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.269> can<00:02:30.420> see<00:02:30.569> here<00:02:30.780> his<00:02:30.989> chest<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.439> a

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
like you can see here his chest is a

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.280 
like you can see here his chest is a
little<00:02:31.769> bit<00:02:31.890> more<00:02:32.010> pink<00:02:32.280> than<00:02:32.459> this<00:02:32.609> one<00:02:32.819> I

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
little bit more pink than this one I

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.420 
little bit more pink than this one I
can't<00:02:34.290> say<00:02:34.500> it's<00:02:34.650> enough<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.099> it's<00:02:35.220> actually

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
can't say it's enough that it's actually

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.869 
can't say it's enough that it's actually
a<00:02:35.849> difference<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.659> the<00:02:36.959> make<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:38.099> I'm<00:02:38.519> gonna<00:02:38.640> go

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
a difference in the make so I'm gonna go

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.690 
a difference in the make so I'm gonna go
with<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.299> far<00:02:39.569> they<00:02:39.900> are<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.319> same<00:02:40.590> let's<00:02:41.489> look

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
with so far they are the same let's look

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.699 
with so far they are the same let's look
at<00:02:41.879> the<00:02:42.030> Purple's<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.569> chests<00:02:43.079> look<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.500> same

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
at the Purple's the chests look the same

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.679 
at the Purple's the chests look the same
for<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.129> shirt<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.609> the<00:02:44.730> shoulder<00:02:45.299> pieces

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:45.689 
for the shirt and the shoulder pieces

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:49.309 
for the shirt and the shoulder pieces
the<00:02:45.930> belts<00:02:46.290> look<00:02:46.500> about<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.920> same<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.780> pants

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
the belts look about the same the pants

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.140 
the belts look about the same the pants
I'm<00:02:49.920> gonna<00:02:50.220> say<00:02:50.459> it's<00:02:50.609> just<00:02:50.760> production

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
I'm gonna say it's just production

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.460 
I'm gonna say it's just production
variation<00:02:51.569> because<00:02:51.840> even<00:02:52.169> those<00:02:52.319> like

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
variation because even those like

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.349 
variation because even those like
grayish<00:02:53.040> areas<00:02:53.430> that<00:02:53.669> we<00:02:53.819> were<00:02:54.000> talking<00:02:54.209> about

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
grayish areas that we were talking about

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.659 
grayish areas that we were talking about
on<00:02:54.599> the<00:02:54.720> old<00:02:54.870> one<00:02:55.079> here<00:02:55.349> back<00:02:56.040> when<00:02:56.189> I<00:02:56.250> reviewed

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:56.669 
on the old one here back when I reviewed

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.449 
on the old one here back when I reviewed
it<00:02:56.790> looks<00:02:57.000> like<00:02:57.180> fading<00:02:57.959> almost<00:02:58.349> a<00:02:58.620> brand<00:02:59.220> new

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
it looks like fading almost a brand new

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.550 
it looks like fading almost a brand new
one<00:02:59.669> has<00:02:59.909> that<00:03:00.120> same<00:03:00.359> coloration<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.109> I'm

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
one has that same coloration so I'm

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.979 
one has that same coloration so I'm
gonna<00:03:01.739> say<00:03:02.099> that's<00:03:02.430> all<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.819> same<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.299> the

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
gonna say that's all the same to the

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.860 
gonna say that's all the same to the
boots<00:03:04.260> on<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.950> old<00:03:05.159> one<00:03:05.430> do<00:03:05.760> look<00:03:06.120> slightly

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
boots on the old one do look slightly

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.879 
boots on the old one do look slightly
different<00:03:07.470> as<00:03:07.560> far<00:03:07.590> as<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.859> coloration<00:03:08.519> goes

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
different as far as the coloration goes

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.190 
different as far as the coloration goes
I<00:03:10.889> guess<00:03:11.459> it's<00:03:11.669> possible<00:03:12.269> that<00:03:12.419> that's<00:03:12.599> not<00:03:12.900> a

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
I guess it's possible that that's not a

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.860 
I guess it's possible that that's not a
common<00:03:13.980> thing<00:03:14.129> but<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.430> looks<00:03:14.700> pretty<00:03:15.389> obvious

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
common thing but it looks pretty obvious

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.050 
common thing but it looks pretty obvious
to<00:03:16.049> me<00:03:16.079> that<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.590> bolt<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:17.220> boots<00:03:17.430> on<00:03:17.699> the<00:03:17.879> old

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
to me that the bolt the boots on the old

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.240 
to me that the bolt the boots on the old
one<00:03:18.329> which<00:03:18.479> is<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.750> right<00:03:18.930> side<00:03:19.169> are<00:03:19.440> browner

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
one which is the right side are browner

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.490 
one which is the right side are browner
whereas<00:03:20.879> these<00:03:21.030> have<00:03:21.329> more<00:03:21.659> of<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.870> muted<00:03:22.109> color

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
whereas these have more of a muted color

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.099 
whereas these have more of a muted color
just<00:03:23.310> by<00:03:23.729> the<00:03:23.790> slightest<00:03:24.419> of<00:03:24.540> margins

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
just by the slightest of margins

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.780 
just by the slightest of margins
hopefully<00:03:25.889> it's<00:03:26.010> even<00:03:26.250> showing<00:03:26.430> up<00:03:26.579> on<00:03:26.760> camera

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
hopefully it's even showing up on camera

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.640 
hopefully it's even showing up on camera
it's<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.540> little<00:03:27.840> bit<00:03:27.959> different<00:03:28.169> than<00:03:28.500> the

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
it's a little bit different than the

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.219 
it's a little bit different than the
shading<00:03:29.040> in<00:03:29.159> those<00:03:29.400> folds<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.060> wrinkles<00:03:30.229> same

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:31.229 
shading in those folds and wrinkles same

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:32.750 
shading in those folds and wrinkles same
issue<00:03:31.470> it's<00:03:31.739> a<00:03:31.799> little<00:03:32.190> bit<00:03:32.340> different<00:03:32.669> I

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
issue it's a little bit different I

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.099 
issue it's a little bit different I
think<00:03:33.030> so<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.299> boots<00:03:33.540> are<00:03:33.780> slightly

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
think so the boots are slightly

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.770 
think so the boots are slightly
different<00:03:34.519> if<00:03:35.519> that's<00:03:35.790> uniform<00:03:36.329> you<00:03:36.449> guys<00:03:36.599> can

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
different if that's uniform you guys can

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.509 
different if that's uniform you guys can
let<00:03:36.900> me<00:03:37.049> know<00:03:37.079> if<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.590> guys<00:03:37.739> have<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.220> old<00:03:38.340> one

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
let me know if you guys have the old one

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.909 
let me know if you guys have the old one
and<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:38.699> new<00:03:38.849> one<00:03:39.500> compare<00:03:40.500> them<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:40.799> let<00:03:40.889> me

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
and the new one compare them and let me

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.460 
and the new one compare them and let me
know<00:03:41.010> because<00:03:41.190> I'm<00:03:41.790> curious<00:03:42.180> also<00:03:42.419> if<00:03:42.959> they

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
know because I'm curious also if they

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.670 
know because I'm curious also if they
are<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:44.010> same<00:03:44.040> or<00:03:44.669> not<00:03:45.239> as<00:03:45.750> mine<00:03:46.139> or<00:03:46.169> as<00:03:46.530> each

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
are the same or not as mine or as each

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.860 
are the same or not as mine or as each
other<00:03:46.919> but<00:03:47.190> it<00:03:47.310> looks<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:47.729> me<00:03:47.760> like<00:03:47.940> this

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
other but it looks to me like this

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.099 
other but it looks to me like this
wasn't<00:03:49.109> not<00:03:49.409> intentional<00:03:50.129> but<00:03:50.159> definitely<00:03:50.819> a

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
wasn't not intentional but definitely a

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.270 
wasn't not intentional but definitely a
production<00:03:52.109> difference<00:03:52.650> not<00:03:52.859> just<00:03:53.159> a

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
production difference not just a

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.240 
production difference not just a
variation<00:03:53.989> the<00:03:54.989> boot<00:03:55.169> color<00:03:55.409> is<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.620> little<00:03:55.949> bit

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
variation the boot color is a little bit

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.219 
variation the boot color is a little bit
different<00:03:56.669> again<00:03:57.449> everything<00:03:57.810> else<00:03:57.959> looks

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:58.229 
different again everything else looks

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:01.009 
different again everything else looks
about<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.799> same<00:03:59.010> let's<00:03:59.220> look<00:03:59.400> at<00:03:59.489> the<00:04:00.019> Cape

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
about the same let's look at the Cape

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.780 
about the same let's look at the Cape
see<00:04:01.739> if<00:04:01.829> that<00:04:02.010> looks<00:04:02.159> about<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.639> same<00:04:04.790> looks

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
see if that looks about the same looks

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:06.979 
see if that looks about the same looks
like<00:04:05.909> the<00:04:06.030> shading<00:04:06.299> might<00:04:06.569> be<00:04:06.689> a<00:04:06.720> little

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
like the shading might be a little

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.780 
like the shading might be a little
heavier<00:04:07.290> on<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.560> new<00:04:07.799> one<00:04:08.040> but<00:04:08.250> again<00:04:08.549> that

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
heavier on the new one but again that

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.599 
heavier on the new one but again that
might<00:04:09.120> just<00:04:09.540> be<00:04:09.659> the<00:04:09.959> way<00:04:10.109> it's<00:04:10.290> it<00:04:10.919> happened

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
might just be the way it's it happened

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.179 
might just be the way it's it happened
to<00:04:11.669> come<00:04:11.849> out<00:04:12.000> that<00:04:12.239> way<00:04:12.479> this<00:04:13.379> one<00:04:13.650> does<00:04:13.949> look

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
to come out that way this one does look

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:15.920 
to come out that way this one does look
definitely<00:04:14.459> darker<00:04:15.120> with<00:04:15.239> that<00:04:15.419> bluish<00:04:15.720> green

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
definitely darker with that bluish green

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.199 
definitely darker with that bluish green
shading<00:04:16.349> than<00:04:16.500> this<00:04:16.680> one<00:04:16.889> but<00:04:17.099> again<00:04:17.130> I<00:04:17.609> can't

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
shading than this one but again I can't

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.830 
shading than this one but again I can't
say<00:04:18.479> for<00:04:18.509> certain<00:04:19.849> so<00:04:20.849> one<00:04:21.090> last<00:04:21.269> thing<00:04:21.539> to

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
say for certain so one last thing to

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.860 
say for certain so one last thing to
check<00:04:21.870> is<00:04:22.409> the<00:04:22.710> arms<00:04:23.099> the<00:04:23.969> old<00:04:24.180> ones<00:04:24.419> arm<00:04:24.630> did

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
check is the arms the old ones arm did

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.510 
check is the arms the old ones arm did
not<00:04:25.020> fall<00:04:25.289> off<00:04:25.320> on<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.680> original<00:04:26.219> that<00:04:26.460> was

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
not fall off on the original that was

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.020 
not fall off on the original that was
only

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
only

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.300 
only
on<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.300> SD<00:04:27.660> CC<00:04:28.230> version<00:04:28.710> so<00:04:28.890> let's<00:04:28.920> see<00:04:29.220> if

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
on the SD CC version so let's see if

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.740 
on the SD CC version so let's see if
this<00:04:29.520> guy's<00:04:29.700> arm<00:04:30.090> falls<00:04:30.450> off<00:04:30.660> super<00:04:31.290> easily<00:04:32.750> my

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
this guy's arm falls off super easily my

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.510 
this guy's arm falls off super easily my
cats<00:04:34.020> trying<00:04:34.260> to<00:04:34.320> sneak<00:04:34.560> over<00:04:34.740> here<00:04:34.920> it's

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
cats trying to sneak over here it's

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.750 
cats trying to sneak over here it's
really<00:04:36.000> stiff<00:04:36.540> and<00:04:37.200> if<00:04:38.100> we<00:04:38.370> break<00:04:38.700> that

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
really stiff and if we break that

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.690 
really stiff and if we break that
stiffness<00:04:39.360> I<00:04:39.780> can't<00:04:39.990> even<00:04:40.080> do<00:04:40.380> it<00:04:40.520> does<00:04:41.520> the

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
stiffness I can't even do it does the

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.200 
stiffness I can't even do it does the
bicep<00:04:42.120> want<00:04:42.330> to<00:04:42.420> fall<00:04:42.660> off<00:04:42.930> afterwards<00:04:44.210> maybe

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
bicep want to fall off afterwards maybe

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.060 
bicep want to fall off afterwards maybe
it's<00:04:45.450> really<00:04:45.720> stiff<00:04:46.080> well<00:04:46.440> that<00:04:46.590> popped<00:04:46.860> off

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
it's really stiff well that popped off

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.280 
it's really stiff well that popped off
maybe<00:04:47.760> it's<00:04:47.970> really<00:04:48.150> stiff<00:04:48.750> because<00:04:49.140> they

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
maybe it's really stiff because they

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.030 
maybe it's really stiff because they
fixed<00:04:49.650> it<00:04:49.770> that<00:04:49.950> could<00:04:50.370> be<00:04:50.420> the<00:04:51.420> case<00:04:51.830> cat<00:04:52.830> just

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
fixed it that could be the case cat just

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.970 
fixed it that could be the case cat just
