big gripes all along had been I thought

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.270 
big gripes all along had been I thought
people<00:00:42.210> should<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.540> talking<00:00:42.750> more<00:00:43.280> people

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
people should be talking more people

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.310 
people should be talking more people
meeting<00:00:44.430> Tilt<00:00:44.700> owners<00:00:45.059> managers<00:00:45.840> talking

meeting Tilt owners managers talking

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.080 
meeting Tilt owners managers talking
more<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> players<00:00:48.230> and<00:00:49.670> there's<00:00:50.670> legal

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
more to the players and there's legal

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.639 
more to the players and there's legal
reasons<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.809> they<00:00:51.899> weren't<00:00:52.079> doing<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.410> but

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
reasons that they weren't doing that but

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.770 
reasons that they weren't doing that but
I<00:00:52.739> still<00:00:53.000> think<00:00:54.000> there<00:00:54.149> were<00:00:54.270> ways<00:00:54.480> they<00:00:54.660> could

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
I still think there were ways they could

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.119 
I still think there were ways they could
have<00:00:54.899> gotten<00:00:55.050> more<00:00:55.320> information<00:00:55.800> out<00:00:55.920> and

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
have gotten more information out and

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.529 
have gotten more information out and
then<00:00:56.460> got<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:58.640> but<00:00:59.640> so<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.820> think<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.390> good

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
then got out but so I think it's good

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.060 
then got out but so I think it's good
and<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.780> appreciate<00:01:01.199> how<00:01:01.350> we're<00:01:01.500> doing<00:01:01.680> those

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
and I appreciate how we're doing those

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.250 
and I appreciate how we're doing those
interviews<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.609> think<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:02.879> good<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.260> anyone

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
interviews I think it's good for anyone

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.719 
interviews I think it's good for anyone
with<00:01:04.439> knowledge<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.890> situation<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.580> do

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
with knowledge of the situation to do

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.010 
with knowledge of the situation to do
things<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.630> try<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.810> put

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
things like that and try to put

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.240 
things like that and try to put
information<00:01:07.350> out<00:01:07.710> there<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.479> I<00:01:09.680> know<00:01:10.680> some

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
information out there and I know some

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
information out there and I know some
people<00:01:11.490> were<00:01:11.580> saying<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.939> Howard<00:01:12.210> was

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
people were saying that Howard was

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.820 
people were saying that Howard was
biased<00:01:12.720> or<00:01:12.840> defending<00:01:13.170> himself<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.650> mean

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
biased or defending himself but I mean

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.170 
biased or defending himself but I mean
my<00:01:13.950> take<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.400> was<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.580> thought<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.820> he<00:01:15.030> was

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
my take on it was I thought that he was

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.179 
my take on it was I thought that he was
doing<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.140> surprisingly<00:01:16.619> good<00:01:16.710> job<00:01:17.009> of

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
doing like a surprisingly good job of

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.969 
doing like a surprisingly good job of
trying<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.520> give<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> facts<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.450> not

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
trying to give just the facts and not

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.630 
trying to give just the facts and not
obviously<00:01:19.979> he's<00:01:20.100> going<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.369> biased

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
obviously he's going to be biased

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.710 
obviously he's going to be biased
obviously<00:01:21.030> he's<00:01:21.150> going<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.330> defend<00:01:21.450> himself

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
obviously he's going to defend himself

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.240 
obviously he's going to defend himself
you<00:01:22.170> know<00:01:22.200> everyone's<00:01:22.619> hated<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.040> him<00:01:23.130> for

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
you know everyone's hated on him for

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.310 
you know everyone's hated on him for
however<00:01:23.340> long<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.729> year<00:01:24.180> for<00:01:24.930> months<00:01:25.200> or

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
however long a year for months or

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.010 
however long a year for months or
something<00:01:26.360> but<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.390> thought<00:01:27.570> he<00:01:27.659> was<00:01:27.780> doing<00:01:27.869> a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
something but I thought he was doing a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.780 
something but I thought he was doing a
pretty<00:01:28.140> good<00:01:28.259> job<00:01:28.380> trying<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.130> be<00:01:29.250> fairly

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
pretty good job trying to be fairly

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.740 
pretty good job trying to be fairly
objective<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.770> I<00:01:32.180> mean<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.390> been<00:01:33.509> really

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
objective and I mean I have been really

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.969 
objective and I mean I have been really
unhappy<00:01:33.990> with<00:01:34.140> him<00:01:34.350> for<00:01:34.470> about<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.680> year<00:01:34.950> of

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
unhappy with him for about a year of

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.289 
unhappy with him for about a year of
that<00:01:35.159> time<00:01:35.340> because<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.610> thought<00:01:35.820> he<00:01:36.090> had<00:01:36.180> done

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
that time because I thought he had done

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.310 
that time because I thought he had done
a<00:01:36.329> lot<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.570> things<00:01:36.720> wrong<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.200> I've

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
a lot of things wrong and then I've

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.740 
a lot of things wrong and then I've
talked<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.950> him<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.329> from<00:01:39.329> what<00:01:39.479> I've<00:01:39.600> heard

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
talked to him and from what I've heard

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.969 
talked to him and from what I've heard
of<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.930> story<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.259> seems<00:01:40.439> like<00:01:40.619> he<00:01:40.740> tried<00:01:40.950> to

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
of the story it seems like he tried to

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.200 
of the story it seems like he tried to
do<00:01:41.159> what<00:01:41.369> he<00:01:41.430> thought<00:01:41.579> was<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.790> right<00:01:41.970> thing

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
do what he thought was the right thing

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.149 
do what he thought was the right thing
there's<00:01:42.720> still<00:01:42.899> stuff<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.229> did<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.560> don't

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
there's still stuff you did that I don't

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.920 
there's still stuff you did that I don't
agree<00:01:44.369> with<00:01:45.680> but<00:01:47.390> you<00:01:48.390> can't<00:01:48.570> fault<00:01:48.780> someone

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
agree with but you can't fault someone

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.880 
agree with but you can't fault someone
too<00:01:49.079> much<00:01:49.229> when<00:01:49.350> they're<00:01:49.470> trying<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.680> do<00:01:49.770> what

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
too much when they're trying to do what

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.260 
too much when they're trying to do what
they<00:01:49.950> thinks<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.250> right<00:01:50.369> thing<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.060> seems

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
they thinks the right thing and it seems

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.150 
they thinks the right thing and it seems
like<00:01:51.390> he<00:01:51.479> tried<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.750> do<00:01:51.840> that

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
like he tried to do that

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.740 
like he tried to do that
there's<00:01:54.300> obviously<00:01:55.300> we're<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.450> bunch<00:01:55.600> of

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
there's obviously we're a bunch of

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.170 
there's obviously we're a bunch of
issues<00:01:55.840> with<00:01:56.170> Full<00:01:56.590> Tilt<00:01:56.800> there<00:01:57.010> was<00:01:57.180> nowhere

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
near enough oversight for a company that

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.770 
near enough oversight for a company that
was<00:01:59.830> valued<00:02:00.220> at<00:02:00.340> that<00:02:00.460> much<00:02:00.610> money<00:02:00.820> it's

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
was valued at that much money it's

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.030 
was valued at that much money it's
probably<00:02:02.050> valued<00:02:02.290> like<00:02:02.470> a<00:02:02.530> billion<00:02:02.800> dollars

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040

be the first sort of signed on Full Tilt

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.010

Pro<00:02:32.820> so<00:02:33.820> I<00:02:33.850> haven't<00:02:34.090> talked<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.390> Gus<00:02:34.570> that<00:02:34.810> much

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
Pro so I haven't talked to Gus that much

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.290 
Pro so I haven't talked to Gus that much
about<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:36.130> Full<00:02:36.400> Tilt<00:02:36.580> situation<00:02:37.030> but<00:02:37.180> from

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
about the Full Tilt situation but from

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.210 
about the Full Tilt situation but from
what<00:02:37.450> I've<00:02:37.540> heard<00:02:37.720> from<00:02:38.140> other<00:02:38.800> people<00:02:39.130> it

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
what I've heard from other people it

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
what I've heard from other people it
seemed<00:02:39.430> like<00:02:39.550> he<00:02:39.640> tried<00:02:39.850> to<00:02:39.970> handle

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
seemed like he tried to handle

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.090 
seemed like he tried to handle
everything<00:02:40.450> well<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.560> tried<00:02:41.770> to<00:02:41.860> do<00:02:41.980> the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
everything well and you tried to do the

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.949 
everything well and you tried to do the
right<00:02:42.250> things<00:02:42.490> do<00:02:43.360> whatever<00:02:43.630> would<00:02:43.780> get<00:02:43.870> the

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
right things do whatever would get the

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.020 
right things do whatever would get the
players<00:02:44.170> paid<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.800> handle<00:02:45.550> himself<00:02:45.700> pretty

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
players paid and handle himself pretty

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.400 
players paid and handle himself pretty
ethically<00:02:46.360> so<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:46.660> think<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.930> makes<00:02:47.080> sense<00:02:47.170> that

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
ethically so I think it makes sense that

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.199 
ethically so I think it makes sense that
you<00:02:47.530> would<00:02:47.560> be<00:02:48.280> signed<00:02:48.490> by<00:02:48.610> Joe<00:02:50.250> yeah<00:02:51.280> Yolo

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
you would be signed by Joe yeah Yolo

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.160 
you would be signed by Joe yeah Yolo
