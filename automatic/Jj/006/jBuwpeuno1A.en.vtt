00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.580
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.800
 new video 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.389
 Today I'll show you a wlan 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.330
 hotspot from your mac 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.730
 you have to publish it in 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.250
 the system settings go and under 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.029
 network if you are using the internet 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.150
 be connected 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.449
 After that we have to release on the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.330
 click and here under internet release 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.880
 once you choose the connection like that 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.030
 internet in the way comes in ours 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.790
 of course you are easynet and here 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.680
 We can then choose with what that 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.329
 all should be broadcast as that 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.469
 internet and here we hook wlan 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.530
 then we can still do the wlan 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.590
 option set the name once here 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.850
 our wlan hotspots once the channels 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.460
 and the encryption and so the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.020
 security here you can choose without 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.660
 which I would not recommend 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.130
 because everyone can log in and 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:12.030
 go to the internet and here more personally 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.250
 wpa2 if you have wpa2 selected 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.590
 Enter a password below 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.040
 that makes fast if you then 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.450
 you just clicked on ok 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.060
 and then you just have to use the internet 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.580
 switch on release and have to go here 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.950
 still wlan activate and on start 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.840
 click and then you see up here too 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.170
 already where usually the wlan 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.270
 symbol is as the five bars are here 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.640
 now this is such a small one 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.360
 edition and then you see here 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.759
 already content release enabled and here 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.770
 Do you see your hotspot? 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.270
 video has fallen over me a lot 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.430
 a thumbs up or maybe for 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.189
 an abo happy and then hopefully 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.540
 Let's see you again in the next video 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.540
 So, until the next one
