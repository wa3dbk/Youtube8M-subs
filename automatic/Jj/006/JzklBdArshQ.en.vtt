00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
construction toys and make them pink to

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.350 
construction toys and make them pink to
appeal<00:01:10.780> to<00:01:10.810> girls<00:01:11.080> and<00:01:11.530> while<00:01:12.220> yeah<00:01:12.760> it's<00:01:13.030> true

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
more to us than that so I've spent the

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.120 
more to us than that so I've spent the
last<00:01:19.090> year<00:01:19.660> researching<00:01:20.320> this<00:01:20.590> how<00:01:20.890> do<00:01:20.950> you

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
last year researching this how do you

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.400 
last year researching this how do you
get<00:01:21.250> girls<00:01:21.640> to<00:01:21.910> like<00:01:21.940> a<00:01:22.060> construction<00:01:22.450> toy<00:01:23.020> it

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
get girls to like a construction toy it

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.990 
get girls to like a construction toy it
all<00:01:23.800> kind<00:01:24.040> of<00:01:24.190> came<00:01:24.370> down<00:01:24.610> to<00:01:24.820> one<00:01:24.970> simple

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
all kind of came down to one simple

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.540 
all kind of came down to one simple
thing<00:01:25.570> boys<00:01:26.020> like<00:01:26.260> building<00:01:26.650> and<00:01:27.010> girls<00:01:27.370> like

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
thing boys like building and girls like

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.520 
thing boys like building and girls like
reading<00:01:27.880> so<00:01:28.570> I<00:01:28.600> came<00:01:28.990> up<00:01:29.230> with<00:01:29.290> a<00:01:29.440> really

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
reading so I came up with a really

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.220 
reading so I came up with a really
simple<00:01:30.100> idea<00:01:30.520> what<00:01:31.480> if<00:01:31.570> I<00:01:31.660> put<00:01:31.870> those<00:01:31.990> two

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
simple idea what if I put those two

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.860 
simple idea what if I put those two
things<00:01:32.260> together<00:01:32.650> spatial<00:01:33.610> plus<00:01:33.820> verbal<00:01:34.210> book

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
things together spatial plus verbal book

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.590 
things together spatial plus verbal book
series<00:01:35.200> plus<00:01:35.710> building<00:01:36.310> 10<00:01:36.550> and<00:01:36.880> that's<00:01:37.390> how

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
series plus building 10 and that's how

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.219 
series plus building 10 and that's how
goldieblox<00:01:38.110> was<00:01:38.350> born<00:01:39.570> doodle

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
goldieblox was born doodle

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.399 
goldieblox was born doodle
and<00:01:43.229> then

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
and then

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:57.429 
and then
look<00:01:45.409> you<00:01:45.530> hear<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:45.740> dogs<00:01:45.920> been<00:01:46.720> nice<00:01:56.439> you

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
look you hear the dogs been nice you
