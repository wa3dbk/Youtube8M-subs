00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.399 
splitting up the Hogs is also a nice
idea<00:01:53.939> especially<00:01:54.479> if<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.930> base<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.290> really

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
idea especially if the base is really

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.959 
idea especially if the base is really
spread<00:01:55.920> out<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.670> there's<00:01:56.790> not<00:01:56.909> a

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
spread out like this and there's not a

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.209 
spread out like this and there's not a
heavy<00:01:57.270> defensive<00:01:57.930> concentration<00:01:58.619> rule

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
heavy defensive concentration rule

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.730 
heavy defensive concentration rule
number<00:01:59.460> three<00:01:59.880> hit<00:02:00.479> bases<00:02:00.930> walled<00:02:01.140> with<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
number three hit bases walled with the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.410 
number three hit bases walled with the
Hogs<00:02:01.950> while<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.310> heroes<00:02:02.670> are<00:02:02.820> still<00:02:03.090> alive

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
Hogs while the heroes are still alive

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.870 
Hogs while the heroes are still alive
now<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.140> may<00:02:04.409> seem<00:02:04.469> like<00:02:04.890> an<00:02:05.009> obvious<00:02:05.250> tip

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
now this may seem like an obvious tip

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.089 
now this may seem like an obvious tip
but<00:02:06.360> I've<00:02:06.479> actually<00:02:06.659> seen<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.110> few<00:02:07.560> replays

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
but I've actually seen a few replays

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.550 
but I've actually seen a few replays
where<00:02:08.640> attackers<00:02:09.209> would<00:02:09.599> wait<00:02:09.959> until<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
where attackers would wait until the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.309 
where attackers would wait until the
heroes<00:02:10.920> died<00:02:11.250> down<00:02:11.550> before<00:02:12.540> they<00:02:12.750> deployed

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
heroes died down before they deployed

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.059 
heroes died down before they deployed
the<00:02:13.349> hog

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
the hog

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.589 
the hog
and<00:02:14.250> that's<00:02:14.700> really<00:02:14.879> a<00:02:14.969> recipe<00:02:15.329> for<00:02:15.480> disaster

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
and that's really a recipe for disaster

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.360 
and that's really a recipe for disaster
you're<00:02:16.079> really<00:02:16.290> counting<00:02:16.650> on<00:02:16.739> those<00:02:16.860> heroes

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
you're really counting on those heroes

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.479 
you're really counting on those heroes
to<00:02:18.090> end<00:02:18.719> the<00:02:18.900> golems<00:02:19.230> if<00:02:19.439> still<00:02:19.739> alive<00:02:20.069> to<00:02:20.370> help

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
to end the golems if still alive to help

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.309 
to end the golems if still alive to help
suck<00:02:20.819> up<00:02:20.969> some<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.239> that<00:02:21.359> defensive<00:02:21.780> attention

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
suck up some of that defensive attention

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.170 
suck up some of that defensive attention
so<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.829> house<00:02:23.010> can<00:02:23.310> do<00:02:23.489> their<00:02:23.730> work<00:02:23.760> without

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
so the house can do their work without

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.059 
so the house can do their work without
the<00:02:24.390> expose<00:02:24.750> hammering<00:02:25.319> on<00:02:25.439> them<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.769> entire

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
the archer towers are what not are

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.929 
the archer towers are what not are

it's better that way more beneficial to

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.500 
it's better that way more beneficial to
your<00:02:37.470> overall<00:02:37.829> success<00:02:38.239> rather<00:02:39.239> than

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
your overall success rather than

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.670 
your overall success rather than
targeting<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:40.049> hogs<00:02:40.319> you<00:02:40.379> want<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.590> keep

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
targeting the hogs you want to keep

targeting the hogs you want to keep
those<00:02:40.889> hogs<00:02:41.099> alive<00:02:41.519> obviously<00:02:41.870> that's<00:02:42.870> the

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
those hogs alive obviously that's the

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.599 
those hogs alive obviously that's the
key<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.319> any<00:02:43.469> good<00:02:43.680> hog<00:02:43.859> nur<00:02:44.010> attack<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.459> this

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
key to any good hog nur attack so this

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.780 
key to any good hog nur attack so this
is<00:02:44.730> another<00:02:44.969> attack<00:02:45.359> by<00:02:45.389> a<00:02:46.040> signal<00:02:47.040> puke<00:02:47.459> from

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
is another attack by a signal puke from

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.910 
is another attack by a signal puke from
the<00:02:48.269> I<00:02:48.810> don't<00:02:49.139> know<00:02:49.200> how<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.379> pronounce<00:02:49.560> their

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
the I don't know how to pronounce their

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.129 
the I don't know how to pronounce their
name<00:02:50.099> but<00:02:50.459> they're<00:02:50.609> backwards<00:02:51.540> slash<00:02:51.840> team

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
name but they're backwards slash team

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.780 
name but they're backwards slash team
and<00:02:52.409> they're<00:02:53.189> actually<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.459> really<00:02:53.669> really

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
and they're actually a really really

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.149 
and they're actually a really really
good<00:02:54.030> clan<00:02:54.419> and<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:54.930> can<00:02:55.049> see<00:02:55.230> I'd<00:02:55.379> have<00:02:55.620> taken

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
good clan and you can see I'd have taken

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.309 
good clan and you can see I'd have taken
a<00:02:56.370> few<00:02:57.180> people<00:02:57.359> have<00:02:57.450> commented<00:02:58.019> that<00:02:58.079> they'd

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
a few people have commented that they'd

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.009 
a few people have commented that they'd
like<00:02:58.439> to<00:02:58.500> see<00:02:58.739> max<00:02:59.159> basses<00:02:59.669> go<00:03:00.090> hoed<00:03:00.419> rather

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
like to see max basses go hoed rather

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.899 
like to see max basses go hoed rather
than<00:03:01.260> lower<00:03:01.530> level<00:03:01.889> bases<00:03:02.189> but<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:02.370> always<00:03:02.609> try

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
than lower level bases but I always try

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.509 
than lower level bases but I always try
to<00:03:02.939> say<00:03:03.180> consistent<00:03:03.870> with<00:03:04.319> my<00:03:04.500> replays<00:03:04.980> that

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
to say consistent with my replays that

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.339 
to say consistent with my replays that
when<00:03:05.669> the<00:03:05.790> attacker<00:03:06.150> has<00:03:06.450> low<00:03:06.659> level<00:03:06.989> heroes

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
when the attacker has low level heroes

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.009 
when the attacker has low level heroes
in<00:03:07.620> low<00:03:08.220> level<00:03:08.579> troops<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.180> like<00:03:09.389> to<00:03:09.510> focus<00:03:09.720> on

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
in low level troops I like to focus on

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.569 
in low level troops I like to focus on
lower<00:03:10.260> level<00:03:10.590> bases<00:03:11.010> because<00:03:11.159> those<00:03:11.459> are

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
lower level bases because those are

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.460 
lower level bases because those are
really<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.849> bases<00:03:12.180> they<00:03:12.299> should<00:03:12.569> be<00:03:12.750> able<00:03:13.200> to

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
really the bases they should be able to

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.229 
really the bases they should be able to
three-star<00:03:14.159> and<00:03:14.459> those<00:03:14.819> are<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.030> type<00:03:15.209> of

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
three-star and those are the type of

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.509 
three-star and those are the type of
bases<00:03:15.659> that<00:03:15.689> are<00:03:15.840> gonna<00:03:16.079> be<00:03:16.260> their<00:03:16.560> mirror<00:03:17.220> in

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
bases that are gonna be their mirror in

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.129 
bases that are gonna be their mirror in
the<00:03:17.639> war<00:03:17.849> map<00:03:18.090> type<00:03:18.569> of<00:03:18.690> devices<00:03:18.900> they're

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
the war map type of devices they're

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.780 
the war map type of devices they're
gonna<00:03:19.260> be<00:03:19.440> targeting<00:03:19.859> so<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.340> can<00:03:20.459> see<00:03:20.669> this

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
gonna be targeting so you can see this

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.240 
gonna be targeting so you can see this
first<00:03:21.030> attack<00:03:21.359> here<00:03:21.690> is<00:03:21.840> going<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.620> be<00:03:22.799> he<00:03:23.010> uses

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
first attack here is going to be he uses

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.849 
first attack here is going to be he uses
a<00:03:23.280> heal<00:03:23.609> spell<00:03:23.639> rather<00:03:24.209> early<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.959> signal<00:03:25.470> puke

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
a heal spell rather early a signal puke

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.920 
a heal spell rather early a signal puke
and<00:03:25.949> I'm<00:03:26.849> not<00:03:27.030> sure<00:03:27.180> if<00:03:27.269> I<00:03:27.329> would<00:03:27.479> recommend

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
and I'm not sure if I would recommend

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.539 
and I'm not sure if I would recommend
that<00:03:28.109> but<00:03:28.319> it<00:03:28.409> ends<00:03:28.650> up<00:03:28.709> working<00:03:28.949> out<00:03:29.220> for<00:03:29.489> him

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
that but it ends up working out for him

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.759 
that but it ends up working out for him
sometimes<00:03:30.180> these<00:03:30.840> things<00:03:30.900> can<00:03:31.349> just<00:03:31.470> end<00:03:31.680> up

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
sometimes these things can just end up

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.259 
sometimes these things can just end up
working<00:03:32.010> out<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:32.609> does<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.030> can't

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
working out and this does so I can't

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.000 
working out and this does so I can't
really<00:03:33.479> criticize<00:03:33.629> too<00:03:34.079> hard<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:34.470> would<00:03:34.709> have

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
really criticize too hard I would have

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.439 
really criticize too hard I would have
probably<00:03:35.310> said<00:03:35.489> that<00:03:35.639> for<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.849> hog<00:03:36.030> portion

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:36.449 
probably said that for the hog portion

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.780 
probably said that for the hog portion
if<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.629> was<00:03:36.750> my<00:03:36.900> own<00:03:36.930> attack<00:03:37.440> but<00:03:38.069> like<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.549> said

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
if it was my own attack but like I said

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.460 
if it was my own attack but like I said
it<00:03:38.970> actually<00:03:39.120> works<00:03:39.419> out<00:03:39.659> well<00:03:39.870> or<00:03:40.229> I<00:03:40.260> would

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470
