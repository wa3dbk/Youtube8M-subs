00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.499
 Hello 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:11.469
 This time to 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.899
 Doll's fate 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:15.779
 The crow may be in front 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.310
 What I climbed in the moon 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.630
 2 How does the light come in? 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.579
 That 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:23.340
 While making a sound like p22 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.869
 I want to do it 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:26.949
 Basically 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.949
 It is unique to omar aqueous 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.810
 Using water while putting out 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.170
 I got it 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.520
 It's about getting closer to the highlight 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.520
 I will use it while masking 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.030
 Let me see 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.140
 We have put up masking even where supported by the roots of finance 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.950
 Was 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.940
 After the rice, I will give you a face of kiss with a focus on the eyes 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.720
 End 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.710
 I have come to the center because I want you to see the procedure 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.390
 I think 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.770
 Though we spread behind me when we say that it is the highlight 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.430
 Yes white eyes 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.430
 In fact I think that I hardly get in sight 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.550
 Most of the stations 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.840
 Because it is in the anime silence 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.840
 Basically all the latest has been darkened 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.870
 Hot spot 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.470
 It is influenced by the word that it is surprising that it is a white eye 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.410
 I can not do it 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.960
 The final is good 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.420
 Press s 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.830
 Eventually 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.200
 Featured in the theater 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.420
 I have lost my eyes 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.400
 Often 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.400
 Brush carefully 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.470
 Jarrett first feature 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.740
 It is 2007 fiscal year 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.060
 I will be responsible for employment 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.060
 This is my case, but 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.729
 Lend the result 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.219
 Next time to go 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.219
 Sakurai 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.899
 Create a gradient 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:21.719
 At this time on the first floor completely changed 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:22.739
 The water- 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.739
 Selling fifth year 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.299
 Already 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.049
 Even as old as a passer 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:40.899
 I want to make a gradation 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:43.899
 I'm going brighter going north 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:48.289
 Lenovo position 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.499
 It has been innocent since the line bandwidth was released 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.189
 There were too many reports 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:09.999
 I took a little water so I wipe it off 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:12.989
 This gradation is still alive 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.989
 Without isolation and without gradation in 1 out 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:17.489
 Suddenly 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.459
 Yes it has become bright 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.459
 The numbers will come out 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.009
 I got water 

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:30.009
 I took a little moisture after aiming at home 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.779
 This is a candidate 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:39.129
 next 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.129
 The face of the fifth day 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:45.969
 That's good fortune 

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:50.539
 Other 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:01.369
 A little bit of business 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:10.919
 US Army Hitomi Nakano 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:14.209
 Mandarake complex 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.209
 Small swing 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:28.819
 I had a strong barrier to work 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.560
 Because it is something like general affairs year from a little lower 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.560
 The light came in, but it gets brighter 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:05.870
 It works normally 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.259
 Where the light hit 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:10.909
 It is not bright if you wear hunting clothes and there are many customers 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:13.129
 It is so even though it is crunchy 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:16.110
 It becomes bright 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.740
 It is revival 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.120
 Because it was aic June 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.400
 Black ko 2 lost 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.400
 A little slowly 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:49.219
 It is said that I have a son 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:53.629
 Fight against this country 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.259
 Because I 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:11.689
 Well around 

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:16.839
 I brightened a little more 

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:28.369
 I'm talking about Ema skin 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.960
 It is good to apply for a visa to turn it later 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.259
 After all this transparency and this highlight 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:41.999
 At the northeast gate 

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:45.219
 Highlights are darker and brighter 

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:46.770
 That's good 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.190
 In this gradation 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.620
 I only do highlight 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.860
 Because it seems transparent like a crow 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.330
 Normal and back light tomorrow report is dark 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.470
 The light is on, but it is dark and the other side is lighter 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.889
 The fb ball is transparent while being anchored 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:04.550
 It is a glassy one 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.080
 It is characteristic of 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.899
 It was buried with advertisement 

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:11.449
 Please try it 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:13.060
 What did you think 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.149
 Yeah 

00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:17.039
 It's good that the moment when I took the masking, a sense of transparency came out 

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:18.169
 I think it was 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:21.169
 Yes Japanese art you can hear the light 

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:23.380
 The other side gets brighter 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.699
 It is opposite to normal 

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:27.740
 And so much Toyomitsu came and it was in a dark place 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.439
 The number has unexpectedly entered 

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:31.830
 Tamano who says from one sense 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.009
 Because I think it is a big feature 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:36.430
 Throwing this 

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.160
 Yes try to see if a sense of transparency will come out 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:39.740
 please look
