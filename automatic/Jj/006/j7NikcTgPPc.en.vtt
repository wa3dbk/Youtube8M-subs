00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.160
 today we arrived at the beautiful lake in 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.980
 mainly to test 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.210
 from the company kosadaka wobblers who 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.300
 intended 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.780
 different fishing starting there shallow water 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.660
 average depth still meter and a half 23 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.300
 that is, we will try different sizes 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.400
 at different depths 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.840
 today the weather is changing 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.840
 cavity will be able to use 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.620
 different colors which makes up 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.170
 pretty big color here is 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.900
 very different fish predatory fish and 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.280
 pike perch 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.150
 happens here sometimes it burns well 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.880
 worse but most importantly what we have 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.360
 there is an absolute different arsenal 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.720
 crankbaits that today should show 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.540
 yourself in different weather 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.370
 at different depths that is how they are 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:33.440
 we work together with vadim today 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.450
 let's do it together today we understand 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.910
 and more work this since 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.270
 one and a half meters to average 3 whose option 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.610
 from one and a half to 3 3 tons of meters if 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.770
 will succeed or want to try rubber 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.350
 we look a little bit deeper 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.070
 that what is there something today will show the lake 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:55.130
 this gravity this gravity is just 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.560
 real explosive bomb today 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.690
 I'm sure I 'll catch something on him 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.060
 perch so surely wobbler sinking 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.810
 quickly seeking it when 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.789
 falling in water 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.519
 immersion he still has and 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.360
 thunder so now sways horn it gets up 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.819
 something not at all 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.200
 completely indescribably owned betel 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.349
 little ones 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.980
 and ravda it is good of course in no way since 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:27.099
 the main fisherman want to catch a huge 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.730
 big fish I somehow prefer 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.190
 such a field 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.459
 bigger size for example yes 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.800
 the fact that we flew into the water water more 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.950
 so unclear my opinion that it can 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.410
 work very well let's say any very 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.799
 bright color especially pike loves and more 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:49.340
 greenish yellowish 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:55.310
 general colors kosadaka 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:59.860
 now it releases 10 species 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.040
 colors from more annoying whether not 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.280
 annoying 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:08.140
 calm tones as if adapted for 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.880
 any types and methods of fishing and 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.549
 virtually any weather circumstances 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.549
 and the state of the water 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:20.420
 what can i say under and he is 90 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.549
 plating it works like that let's say up to a meter 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.549
 even a meter or two can always go but 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.859
 he thinks very well about the crack of two or two 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:32.329
 with a full meter because he has 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:35.150
 such a game its own game is not easy 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:37.250
 side and with each jerk he will play 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.500
 a small side game that gives 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.420
 Shilka irritation same perch 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.000
 there is for example here's one option that 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.889
 there should always be two wobblers then 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.380
 there is one brighter aggressive 2 2 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:54.109
 principle and probably think more 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.540
 natural under the hem of her pick up on 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:59.450
 for example in the morning it is lighter and darker 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.150
 yes it will always give such a contrast 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.579
 eat or you throw more natural 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.069
 or aggressive checked aggressive 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:12.280
 you put the natural, or vice versa, and 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:15.680
 Of course the role of size for example flash 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.680
 who is also looking for such a perch joke 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.530
 maybe even more in the fall but he has 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.350
 there is the same shock. highly 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:28.470
 I naturally look like a fry 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:33.060
 all kosadaka wobblers are stocked 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.970
 capsules with a magnetic ball which 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.630
 when casting play a role 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:42.420
 bullets that is dropping down attached 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.960
 centrifugal pull and more straight and 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:48.120
 far sent this bait given 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.370
 the fact that today we came specifically to 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:55.500
 this body of water and will try to catch 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:59.220
 this is the predator there perch pike 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:02.100
 and zander but on small enough 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.230
 the depths we did not take the whole range 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.340
 wobblers are just perfect 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.960
 The minimum number of cranks that are 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.880
 we took with us though 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.530
 the gamma decree of attack is tremendously huge 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.520
 passes and poker and surface whales 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.520
 plotters and 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:26.840
 ratlin its depths and all sorts 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.700
 trolling models here but today we 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.590
 we will catch you all the same here on this 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.080
 it's not called kosadaka 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:36.050
 this firm is kosadaka but this is not all 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.950
 range of that well that it produces and 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.500
 what does she offer 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.100
 I look very dark weather and water 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.990
 try to pause more 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.060
 maybe more pause 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:51.920
 a little to respond to the position 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:53.060
 in another way i will try to use 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.380
 gravity 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:06:01.280
 classics sinking jerky wobbler that is 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:05.150
 with simple direct posting it gives 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:08.510
 such a small enough game is forming 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:14.020
 more than through the learned I estimate though 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:14.020
 both that and other fish beat him without problems 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.900
 This is a small but nice watch will come out 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:39.820
 good speech about look she very very 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:41.199
 gently took such a good one more 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:45.729
 kilogram and a half 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:49.060
 you can live yes and yes but she is small 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:56.940
 banger such a type did yes and very quietly 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:56.940
 Carefully took what neatly
