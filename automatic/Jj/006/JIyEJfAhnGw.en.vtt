with this new

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330 
with this new
point<00:01:24.330> system<00:01:24.840> there<00:01:25.350> are<00:01:25.380> no<00:01:25.710> soft<00:01:26.010> ones

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
point system there are no soft ones

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.190 
point system there are no soft ones
anymore<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:27.000> can't<00:01:27.270> come<00:01:27.480> in<00:01:27.630> here<00:01:27.660> you<00:01:28.080> know

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
anymore you can't come in here you know

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.830 
anymore you can't come in here you know
like<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.950> used<00:01:28.980> to<00:01:29.370> you<00:01:29.910> know<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.210> got<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.390> think

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
like you used to you know we got I think

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.780 
like you used to you know we got I think
seven<00:01:31.170> eight<00:01:31.290> hundred<00:01:31.440> thousand<00:01:34.700> for<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
seven eight hundred thousand for the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.180 
seven eight hundred thousand for the
point<00:01:36.060> system<00:01:36.300> so<00:01:36.690> that's<00:01:36.900> that's<00:01:37.890> probably

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
point system so that's that's probably

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.070 
point system so that's that's probably
one<00:01:38.580> of<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.760> real<00:01:38.970> negatives<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> point

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
one of the real negatives of the point

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.830 
one of the real negatives of the point
system<00:01:40.320> for<00:01:40.710> me<00:01:40.830> it's<00:01:41.550> a<00:01:41.760> force<00:01:42.090> they<00:01:42.510> force

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
system for me it's a force they force

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.420 
system for me it's a force they force
everybody<00:01:43.260> to<00:01:43.500> run<00:01:43.830> when<00:01:44.040> they<00:01:44.160> probably

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
everybody to run when they probably

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.400 
everybody to run when they probably
wouldn't<00:01:44.940> from<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.840> trainer<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.320> owner

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
wouldn't from a trainer and owner

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.540 
wouldn't from a trainer and owner
standpoint<00:01:47.160> but<00:01:48.650> you<00:01:49.650> just<00:01:49.860> like<00:01:50.070> everything

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
standpoint but you just like everything

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.280 
standpoint but you just like everything
to<00:01:50.670> fall<00:01:50.850> into<00:01:51.120> place<00:01:51.240> little<00:01:51.810> bit<00:01:51.930> here<00:01:52.110> all

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
to fall into place little bit here all

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
I'd rather not have seen but it looks

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.900 
I'd rather not have seen but it looks
like<00:02:34.230> that's<00:02:34.500> all<00:02:34.739> behind<00:02:34.980> him<00:02:35.280> now<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.730> work

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400

he<00:02:38.610> just<00:02:38.640> hugged<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.360> bark<00:02:39.630> on<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.170> outside

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
he just hugged that bark on the outside

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.830 
he just hugged that bark on the outside
came<00:02:40.920> as<00:02:41.070> straight<00:02:41.310> as<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.610> dye<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:42.150> we're

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
came as straight as the dye is so we're

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.550 
came as straight as the dye is so we're
in<00:02:42.900> pretty<00:02:43.080> good<00:02:43.260> shape

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.340 
some source well the seasoning is
important<00:03:48.130> but<00:03:48.460> I<00:03:49.000> think<00:03:49.330> more<00:03:49.780> importantly

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
important but I think more importantly

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.560 
important but I think more importantly
is<00:03:50.410> how<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.740> horses<00:03:51.190> disposition<00:03:52.060> handles

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
is how the horses disposition handles

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.600 
is how the horses disposition handles
the<00:03:53.170> who<00:03:53.350> part<00:03:53.620> of<00:03:53.800> what<00:03:53.980> we<00:03:54.130> have<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.460> go

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
the who part of what we have to go

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.970 
the who part of what we have to go
through<00:03:54.910> I<00:03:55.210> think<00:03:55.930> a<00:03:56.200> horse<00:03:56.440> with<00:03:56.650> three<00:03:56.860> or

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
through I think a horse with three or

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.010 
through I think a horse with three or
four<00:03:57.190> outs<00:03:57.400> could<00:03:57.760> probably<00:03:58.000> be<00:03:58.330> more

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
four outs could probably be more

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.050 
four outs could probably be more
seasoned<00:03:59.650> than<00:03:59.770> one<00:04:00.070> with<00:04:00.310> seven<00:04:00.820> or<00:04:00.940> eight

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
seasoned than one with seven or eight

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.520 
seasoned than one with seven or eight
outs<00:04:01.270> if<00:04:01.540> he's<00:04:01.660> got<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:02.080> right<00:04:02.230> disposition

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
outs if he's got the right disposition

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.640 
outs if he's got the right disposition
what<00:04:03.340> happens<00:04:03.730> over<00:04:03.910> there<00:04:04.240> is<00:04:04.600> a<00:04:04.660> sum<00:04:05.440> of<00:04:05.470> them

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
what happens over there is a sum of them

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.750 
what happens over there is a sum of them
when<00:04:05.740> they<00:04:05.830> get<00:04:05.980> over<00:04:06.100> there<00:04:06.310> and<00:04:06.400> get<00:04:06.490> in<00:04:06.610> that

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
when they get over there and get in that

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.580 
when they get over there and get in that
situation<00:04:06.940> they<00:04:07.510> come<00:04:07.720> untrained<00:04:08.200> a<00:04:08.320> little

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
situation they come untrained a little

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.040 
situation they come untrained a little
bit<00:04:08.770> and<00:04:09.040> so<00:04:09.790> you're<00:04:10.060> always<00:04:10.270> wondering<00:04:10.780> a

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
bit and so you're always wondering a

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.750 
bit and so you're always wondering a
little<00:04:11.230> bit<00:04:11.380> about<00:04:11.560> how<00:04:12.430> they're<00:04:12.610> gonna

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
little bit about how they're gonna

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.970 
little bit about how they're gonna
handle<00:04:12.940> it<00:04:13.240> for<00:04:13.450> example<00:04:13.720> when<00:04:13.990> I<00:04:14.110> ran<00:04:14.350> Tabasco

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
handle it for example when I ran Tabasco

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.920 
handle it for example when I ran Tabasco
cat<00:04:15.220> here<00:04:15.490> he<00:04:16.030> had<00:04:16.150> a<00:04:16.180> lot<00:04:16.420> of<00:04:16.540> trouble

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
cat here he had a lot of trouble

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.740 
cat here he had a lot of trouble
handling<00:04:17.230> it<00:04:17.500> and<00:04:17.739> yet<00:04:18.239> winning<00:04:19.239> colors<00:04:19.450> went

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
handling it and yet winning colors went

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.990 
handling it and yet winning colors went
over<00:04:19.959> there<00:04:20.080> and<00:04:20.110> stood<00:04:20.350> like<00:04:20.530> a<00:04:20.590> statue<00:04:20.739> so<00:04:21.370> it

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
over there and stood like a statue so it

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.090 
over there and stood like a statue so it
just<00:04:22.570> depends<00:04:22.930> on<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.230> discus<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:23.890> know<00:04:24.040> the

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
just depends on the discus to know the

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.950 
just depends on the discus to know the
horse<00:04:24.370> I<00:04:24.580> think<00:04:24.610> more<00:04:25.000> than<00:04:25.060> anything<00:04:25.270> you've

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
horse I think more than anything you've

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.900 
horse I think more than anything you've
learned<00:04:26.110> against<00:04:26.380> both<00:04:26.620> both<00:04:26.980> of<00:04:27.280> American

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
learned against both both of American

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.400 
learned against both both of American
Pharoah<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:28.240> Dortmund<00:04:28.630> two<00:04:28.810> big<00:04:28.960> boys<00:04:29.140> with

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
Pharoah and Dortmund two big boys with

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.290 
Pharoah and Dortmund two big boys with
this<00:04:29.590> worst<00:04:29.830> having<00:04:30.400> seen<00:04:30.610> both<00:04:30.790> of<00:04:30.820> those<00:04:31.000> two

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
this worst having seen both of those two

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.060 
this worst having seen both of those two
how<00:04:31.480> would<00:04:31.630> you<00:04:31.750> canter<00:04:32.140> and<00:04:32.170> control<00:04:32.590> compare

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
how would you canter and control compare

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.470 
how would you canter and control compare
contrasting<00:04:33.610> and<00:04:33.730> maybe<00:04:33.940> which<00:04:34.120> one<00:04:34.270> of<00:04:34.300> them

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
contrasting and maybe which one of them

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.470 
contrasting and maybe which one of them
were<00:04:34.570> easy<00:04:34.750> most<00:04:35.550> we're<00:04:36.550> all<00:04:36.760> worrying<00:04:37.270> me

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
were easy most we're all worrying me

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.080 
were easy most we're all worrying me
because<00:04:37.780> there<00:04:38.620> are<00:04:38.650> outstanding<00:04:39.040> horses<00:04:39.880> in

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
because there are outstanding horses in

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.020 
because there are outstanding horses in
my<00:04:40.240> opinion<00:04:40.720> American<00:04:41.200> Pharoah<00:04:41.470> was<00:04:42.030> way

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
my opinion American Pharoah was way

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.120 
my opinion American Pharoah was way
ahead<00:04:43.270> of<00:04:43.540> Dortmund<00:04:43.930> I<00:04:44.580> I<00:04:46.140> think<00:04:47.140> I<00:04:47.440> have<00:04:47.890> not

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
ahead of Dortmund I I think I have not

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.740 
ahead of Dortmund I I think I have not
been<00:04:48.340> that<00:04:48.520> impressed<00:04:48.970> with<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.270> horse<00:04:49.420> for<00:04:49.660> a

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
been that impressed with the horse for a

been that impressed with the horse for a
long<00:04:49.900> time<00:04:50.230> I<00:04:50.500> mean<00:04:50.740> we<00:04:51.430> ran<00:04:51.730> at<00:04:51.940> him<00:04:51.970> in

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
long time I mean we ran at him in

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.330 
long time I mean we ran at him in
Arkansas<00:04:52.780> we<00:04:52.990> had<00:04:53.080> a<00:04:53.110> perfect<00:04:53.680> trip<00:04:53.920> we<00:04:54.100> ran
