00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:07.120
 today I wanted to see a beauty council 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.960
 of style I actually have a couple of 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.509
 black shoes that I bought once 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.339
 I bought them for a party and 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.440
 I really did not like it 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.170
 I had ordered some black shoes 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.390
 with silver and they were not on time 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.430
 so I bought a basic shoe but 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.990
 I do not like it 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.260
 I usually try to wear shoes that 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.230
 have some detail is that or that they are 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.750
 originals so I decided to transform 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.450
 these black shoes on shoes with a 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.830
 I'm going to show you what it is that 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:46.060
 I did this is the basic black shoe like 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:50.280
 I told them cue shoes in the mouth 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:54.160
 of fish has a small bow but it is 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.280
 an opaque black that does not really not 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.420
 Highlights the work that I am going to 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.800
 do 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:06.580
 add what is called dust 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.399
 velvet I did it in red because 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.399
 I think it's the color that is going to come 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.750
 season and I did only half of the 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.060
 shoe 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.149
 because I liked it so combined black with 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.610
 red and I also liked the texture of the 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.970
 opaque black and the velvet that is so 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.340
 soft in red we could make it complete 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.300
 if you will like it and there is a great variety 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:35.350
 of colors of this velvet powder 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:38.230
 generally this powder comes like this 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.770
 to see I do not know if I can not focus well 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:45.130
 well in a few small bottles 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:49.000
 it's called velvet powder this is from 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.670
 Amadora brand and it usually comes for 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.380
 Do some decorated or do not put the 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.679
 transparent glaze and then place 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.399
 the velvet powder in this 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:02.979
 opportunity we are going to use it to improve 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:07.240
 Some shoes, what I did was buy 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:10.090
 the glue that is a contact tail 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.849
 permanent is actually tail of 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.500
 carpenter a little diluted in water like this 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.660
 that could use carpenter's glue 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.840
 White glue 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.640
 the plastic is a bit weak for this 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.340
 kind of work so preferable with 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.730
 I'll show you the good carpenter 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.630
 the steps already having the position the 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:35.360
 glue what I'm going to do is 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.360
 add the powder 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.489
 slowly it is well distributed 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.349
 maybe they need to rotate so that it falls 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.349
 all right 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:10.450
 well and this sector also 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.080
 two 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.280
 and a little more 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.370
 leo 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:59.420
 and what we are going to do now is with the 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:03.310
 hand let's give it a little pressure 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:07.020
 so that it would be better 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:10.350
 just see with your finger 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.950
 and this adheres perfectly 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.090
 now let's remove the surplus 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.620
 and there we have 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:23.440
 I do not know if it looks 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:27.010
 we have the sector of the bun 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.820
 velvet powder with the remainder 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.760
 in the sheet we put it together and return it to 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.920
 put in the sieve to make another 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.660
 shoe sector well up to complete 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.930
 all the parties that want to could 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.900
 just make the bun like I did half 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.120
 of the shoe or the full shoe is in 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.290
 you who touch you want to put your 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:54.160
 footwear hope you liked me 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:56.020
 I love them they have a different touch 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.570
 let's say I'm only going to have his 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.880
 these shoes but then I'm not going to 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.970
 see nowhere 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.450
 They are unique so I think pretty good 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.450
 see you
