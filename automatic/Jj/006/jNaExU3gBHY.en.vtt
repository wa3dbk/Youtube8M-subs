you got a twist and she got pretty close
to<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.930> that's<00:00:55.230> good<00:00:55.590> work

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.800 

it's<00:01:04.119> out<00:01:04.210> of<00:01:04.330> six<00:01:04.509> three<00:01:05.880> well<00:01:06.880> yes<00:01:07.540> that's

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
it's out of six three well yes that's

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.899 
it's out of six three well yes that's
what<00:01:08.020> they've<00:01:08.200> submitted<00:01:08.470> a<00:01:08.890> 6-3<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.580> judges

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
what they've submitted a 6-3 the judges

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.490 
what they've submitted a 6-3 the judges
have<00:01:10.060> to<00:01:10.090> decide<00:01:10.240> whether<00:01:10.810> enough<00:01:11.229> of<00:01:11.380> the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
have to decide whether enough of the

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.639 
have to decide whether enough of the
vault<00:01:11.710> was<00:01:11.979> shown<00:01:12.250> in<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:12.549> straight<00:01:12.759> position

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
vault was shown in the straight position

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.620 
vault was shown in the straight position
and<00:01:14.649> I<00:01:15.250> think<00:01:15.280> they'll<00:01:15.640> feel<00:01:15.880> it<00:01:16.180> has<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.540> be

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
and I think they'll feel it has to be

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.539 
and I think they'll feel it has to be
2/3<00:01:17.110> of<00:01:17.290> its<00:01:17.439> shown<00:01:17.649> straight<00:01:18.100> mm-hmm<00:01:20.549> yes

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
2/3 of its shown straight mm-hmm yes

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.550 
2/3 of its shown straight mm-hmm yes
given<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.090> 6-3<00:01:22.890> 15<00:01:23.890> point<00:01:24.220> zero<00:01:24.640> six<00:01:25.000> six

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
given the 6-3 15 point zero six six

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.510 
given the 6-3 15 point zero six six
challenging<00:01:26.560> for<00:01:26.710> a<00:01:26.799> medal<00:01:27.100> then<00:01:27.280> as

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
challenging for a medal then as

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.580 
challenging for a medal then as
predicted<00:01:28.950> colors<00:01:29.950> are<00:01:30.039> going<00:01:30.189> to<00:01:30.280> be

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.319 

score<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.340> beat<00:01:35.780> 15.3<00:01:36.780> overall<00:01:37.820> so<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.060> vault

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
score to beat 15.3 overall so this vault

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.999 
score to beat 15.3 overall so this vault
has<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.750> go<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.899> little<00:01:40.110> higher<00:01:40.500> than<00:01:40.860> that
