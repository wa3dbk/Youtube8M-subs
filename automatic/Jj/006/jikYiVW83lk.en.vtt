00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.750
 hello netizens 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.740
 this is the chapter 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.560
 of animation 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.109
 of flash course 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:12.269
 created by video tutorials point ps 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:17.740
 in this exercise we are going to learn that an object that is standing 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.949
 For a while 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.390
 see how he knows that the rest 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.750
 well a text this moment stopped so that it can be read and disappears by 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.140
 our right 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.030
 let's see how to get the objects that are standing 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.030
 during the suspension 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.240
 new file if we accept 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.910
 we make ourselves a bit of a place 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.970
 and we create the object that we want animal as it can always come out manifested an 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.700
 object drawn by you 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.700
 eye an image that we have important 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.730
 match 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.040
 grandson efe a month 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.160
 points 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.950
 the selection 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.950
 Remember the rules I have here 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.060
 symbol 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.180
 covered 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.300
 create interpolation 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.750
 in the time 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.080
 eat insert keyframe 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.690
 and we will make the changes that we want 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.250
 If we want to continue encouraging, as is the case, then go to the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.920
 right we will not go through step number one but we will go directly we will say 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.060
 to step 2-2 alak explained when we do it but remember this 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.320
 manual 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.390
 that said brother marc that had to be a symbol 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.790
 opted to modify convert the symbol 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.620
 k-lite movie for now 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.900
 accent 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.439
 if you the object is where I want it to be at the beginning of our dimension 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.250
 in this case to the left I fulfilled like him 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.009
 the ink and I put it 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.580
 on the left 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.090
 10 is the mac apple dependent yes it can already start souls 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.210
 the energy procedure 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.660
 create interpolation 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.990
 put with the right button on the frame of the timeline 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:15.739
 and I tell him to create motion interpolation well with this I'm not 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.739
 saying we're going to you animal 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:20.979
 in the time 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:23.979
 the frame 15 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.020
 insert frame claret course with the right button 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.020
 the access to insert keyframes 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.869
 we are giving this time 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:36.239
 Step achieved 3 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.449
 made the change I take the object and put it in the middle of the screen 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.120
 If I want to see how the migration is running, the head was damaged. 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.349
 red harvest activities term does the left I see how we are staying 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.709
 this animation 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:53.609
 we said 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.300
 that if we wanted to continue encouraging 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.950
 tegucigalpa we will prohibit step 13 serve actually passed one forgiveness 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.789
 let's go to step two what does it mean 

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:06.279
 in the time 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:12.169
 selected the frame 40 insert a keyframe right button insert 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:14.049
 keyframe 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.840
 and how I want it to be quiet 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.840
 I will not make any changes 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:21.519
 to end 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.080
 for example we want it to move to our right 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:28.329
 He went like wolves in time 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.459
 50 frame 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.459
 insert the keyframe accusing with the right button 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.539
 key conforama inserts that made the changes I take the object 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:41.539
 by the v and I move it to the right 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:46.650
 let's see how it is staying hold the control key and 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:49.469
 Prieto entered 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:51.010
 from the left 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.079
 these moments and this if it goes away 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.809
 towards our network 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:58.709
 very closed 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.089
 suppose now I want to change the speed 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:07.129
 as it was the frame was injured and if I want them to go faster 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.129
 mobiles up to 10 efe 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.919
 certainly less time in this room is left and ten of those center this 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:17.500
 shape 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.470
 will give me much faster for example being and 5 irak quick click or the 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.669
 frame 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:24.949
 I keep tight 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:26.139
 and dragged him 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.139
 let's see how it is with so little time 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.050
 and he goes 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.050
 he is a little higher still and goes quietly 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.930
 another way now we have lengthened a lot how long is still let's remove 

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:46.190
 frames in this way for example 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.069
 I keep person from 15 dragged until 25 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:52.699
 if I want to remove scam 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.909
 these frames here to make it faster 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:58.779
 so that this team with less time 

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:03.059
 right-click and it is that this form of frames is missing look 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:04.430
 that has been displaced 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.490
 these frames that we had on the right 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.809
 what have we got 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:11.089
 that between quiet estate 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:13.529
 i is still 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:16.120
 there is less time 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.740
 intro 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.740
 they are less time stopped and it goes at a speed 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.860
 iron to be able to work 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:32.379
 Now suppose I want him to be still, start to stand still 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.099
 in the part that infected 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:38.389
 I move it to the bottom 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.089
 in this forum the butter remembers that it was in this part of up here 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:44.740
 each keyframe 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.970
 memorize a position 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.360
 change 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.379
 yes the frame 1 I'm up here already in frame 5 I'm down here the 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:55.520
 animation 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.809
 it will be this 

00:05:57.809 --> 00:06:00.770
 Now that I remember the machine who frames 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.100
 I'm here I was upstairs look 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.219
 explained here we are going up 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:08.809
 then it will also create an animation that lowers 

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:12.650
 comes from the left in frame 5 I get below 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.719
 and as of frame 29 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:16.330
 I have it up 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.479
 It has a tendency to rise and then it goes away 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.449
 how are we going to correct this 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:26.319
 so that it remains here quiet for a while we will select this frame 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:29.360
 key and we will copy and paste it here 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:32.199
 pulse with the right button 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:35.050
 I copy photo hours 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.470
 messi had where I want to hit here that are derailing and I'm going to paste 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.360
 right button I must frames 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.319
 with this we have done that here in this program access key 

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:49.169
 and in this here this entity in the same place 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:50.419
 yes two things 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:52.399
 they are in the same place 

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:54.830
 they are still 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.460
 and to finish, notice that he would move them to the right 

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:01.740
 let's see how it is 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.740
 I keep tight the belt grip control 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:10.529
 and it's going slower so fast 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:12.199
 and we're going to win more
