00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the bit work just enough pressure to

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.689 
the bit work just enough pressure to

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699

other one's going down the center and
then<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.090> cross<00:03:32.270> rails<00:03:32.570> so<00:03:37.060> it's<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.150> first

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330
