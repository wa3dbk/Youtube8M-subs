00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.020
 the kid over here gets that 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.390
 probably every now that 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.799
 vodafone we are so exactly 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.480
 one year here on the mobile world 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.250
 congress in barcelona the first time 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.500
 viewed with the special feature here 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.969
 behind an e-ink display that is the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.130
 does not consume electricity 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.410
 And now a year later, here is the 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.410
 presented successor so it looks 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.449
 of course, the new jota also has 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.849
 again the ink display on the back 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.890
 but as you can easily see 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.380
 significantly bigger and above all 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.200
 now touch capable that is if 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.820
 For example , I unlock here now 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.040
 I am at the point again 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.180
 used back on the last app 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.190
 and in that case it was here now 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.809
 for example, keep book and then 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.210
 is of course much easier and 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.250
 native just here through the pages too 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.050
 scroll as such there was here and 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.070
 to operate with this fish gestures the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.170
 not always that way either 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.640
 worked or stopped, for example 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.170
 just when i'm in facebook easy 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.750
 click anywhere on it and say yes 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.820
 like that of course much more pleasant 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.680
 and he is how to recognize easily 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.530
 can also be rounded slightly that means that 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.570
 device is altogether more pleasant in the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.430
 hand as the predecessor of still here so 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.710
 a bit with this wedge-shaped 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.150
 thing that I've never understood and 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.810
 then everything is much edgier and 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:19.200
 angular so much more sexy that 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.159
 new jota from the front screen is 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.670
 now amulet 51 big that means 5 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.420
 inch 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.939
 that's supposed to get you to 442 ppp 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.140
 So a very high pixel density as you 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.299
 recognize this easily 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.530
 there is anyway amulet 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.990
 no problems with the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.329
 Contrast so excellent quality 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.890
 and the back in this 4.7 inches 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.390
 but then with a resolution of 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.720
 540 x 960 pixels what then a density 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.090
 of 235 ppi leads now is too 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.960
 really everything on board was even after 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.950
 Kat four nfc and above all things too 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.259
 recharge wireless that's me 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.810
 have this built- in again 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.549
 this built-in battery because of this 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.780
 front display rear display that is 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.729
 By the way, everything is still beta 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.860
 So pray tell which is still almost a 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.629
 until the end of the year 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.290
 year will come on the market with us 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.599
 therefore please 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.760
 do not consider it like that now 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.430
 currently works and looks like so 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.540
 here it is not all beta 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.890
 good in the hand and when I say then 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.109
 okay now I just hang this up 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.840
 my charging station then that is the sooner 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:28.629
 wirelessly loaded 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.670
 The battery has 2550 milliamp hours 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.230
 internally and this one sees that 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.540
 It is also very easy to charge everywhere 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.239
 Of course I can do that too 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.069
 quickly then quickly everywhere in the office 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.540
 For example, I'll load that now 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.260
 once in the daytime 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.599
 So much less problematic dual 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.819
 Career hsdpa that means also in the umts-net 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.280
 42 megabits per second in the 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.340
 go download I have an 8 megapixel 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.530
 camera with a lightning next to it so 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.090
 really everything where you would say that 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.169
 makes a very slim foot 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.400
 a very good impression 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:02.349
 Of course, now it comes completely 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.000
 crucially on the price on that 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.700
 jutta phone has not yet 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.379
 Betrayed but the ceo told me yes 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.840
 will stop then if it is on the 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.609
 Market comes to have fair market prices 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.439
 So for example, the devices 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.540
 have a snapdragon 800 in there like 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:19.769
 this one in the similar price range 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.060
 and then, as it were, this display 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.829
 free stop with it at this 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.150
 So that's what I think 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.669
 be the first one 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.139
 impression that only in vodafone here from 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:31.139
 mobile world congress in barcelona
