00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.790
 Well, let's see what a 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.189
 pyre led light to illuminate a 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.740
 room a room what is the edge 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.280
 of a bed here we have a room 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.670
 normal and the bed a few candles 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.960
 Now to put some light 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:25.360
 and we're going to turn off the general light is worth and 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.360
 we turn on what would be the led cable 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.110
 We have different colors 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:36.390
 we have a remote control 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:39.150
 we can choose red blue green wrong in 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.880
 everything what the walls are because they go to 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:46.730
 game really are good links 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.770
 there you can see it still I have not 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.010
 stuck well or nothing is temporary but 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.350
 good 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.109
 you see that they are simply a lot of 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.410
 lighting bulbs can I change the 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:00.260
 color with the remote control 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.640
 white light for example illuminates enough 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.280
 the room looks great 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.080
 with the light is then you have a lot 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.750
 of colors apart from the green red and blue 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.430
 and then you have the effects for example 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.320
 this one that is automatic I do not touch anything and 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.410
 it is changing color going very fast 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.360
 then I have two buttons to download 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:27.570
 the speed I'm giving him and he's going slower 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.670
 If I increase the speed, it becomes 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.520
 crazy of so much light simply so that 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.140
 They are three led bulbs 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.830
 you do not see anything with these resolutions 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.440
 but I'm changing one or the other 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.830
 illuminates everything that is the edge of the 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.600
 bed 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.190
 this can be stuck on the bed by the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.940
 roof wherever 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.760
 valech 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:54.580
 then we have more effects as they can 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.750
 be this that only white 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.840
 well, changing 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.030
 what is the intensity the same can I 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.720
 control the speed with the command to 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.580
 distance 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.930
 and then we have another effect that is the 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.340
 more normal that is changing 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.340
 gradually there are colors 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.610
 It can go slower 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.680
 it's typical that you know about lights that go 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.880
 changing if we see the wall 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.020
 they are changing everything 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.910
 little by little 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.010
 and then the last effect that good comes 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.530
 to be like the first but more forced 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.530
 the three colors red blue green 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.530
 and the same can go up the speed 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.530
 download it 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.030
 this is good because then save 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.730
 plenty of power for windows 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.560
 shops 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.560
 to light a house perfectly 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.360
 well nothing this is all 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.360
 and let's see a bit in general how 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.580
 It works, it can be turned off 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.580
 I light that directly with the command 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.569
 if we are in what is the bed so that 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.430
 you have an idea the walls are 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.430
 they illuminate vale 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.380
 does not bother any of the light is a light 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.380
 we put it in red 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:13.530
 and nothing what is the viewer and others that 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.530
 are the cables here we can see 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.040
 this is the one that transforms what is 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.820
 comes from electric power a 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.130
 Transformer goes through this controller 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.790
 and it was plugged directly so 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.250
 we can see what the cable is worth and 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.500
 this here is the infrared receiver 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.390
 it's a small cable 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.400
 they spy well you need to aim 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.770
 directly because it bounces off the 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.540
 walls and then take it perfectly 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.690
 has two connectors this is one that does not 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:50.530
 I use it you could put another one else 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.530
 Strip lights are plugged in here and ready 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:01.000
 it's really little more 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:03.880
 this has no greater mystery 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.490
 our connector is seen here with this 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.570
 plugged into this cable and it starts 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.570
 directly the leds 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:18.370
 they have a strip to paste it what 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:21.760
 it would be the reverse this is a 13 m strip 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:24.750
 comes a little detached and you can 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.750
 stick to either side 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.840
 I leave her here on the floor 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.330
 and command 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.510
 it would be this there are bigger ones with more 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:44.449
 options more buttons but hey this is 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:48.819
 small is manageable does not occupy anything 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.819
 voucher turned off 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:55.470
 change colors 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.449
 he produced white blue green white are 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.910
 all three working at the same time 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:04.070
 a little 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:08.540
 and the different shades 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:11.650
 it's an idea all those areas can be 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.650
 put this dark purple 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.980
 that day this 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.199
 ancap and this is the speed 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.750
 Well, little more aired putting more 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:47.380
 things on the floor in the room and what 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.380
 we will see 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.570
 see you later
