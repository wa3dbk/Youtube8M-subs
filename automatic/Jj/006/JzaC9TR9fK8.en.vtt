00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 what's going on people welcome to the eleventh 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.340
 part of android gamer development 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.410
 tutorials for news.de my name is 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.809
 dennis of utah and in this tutorial 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.910
 We will conflict with our wide 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.490
 We will go back to work 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.220
 the homepage batterien.de click on 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.779
 tutorials game app development of africa 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.930
 whole year and click on tutorial 11 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.840
 we need a method and 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.730
 touch events we write about 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.210
 So we have to have that over 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.210
 implementation 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:45.740
 available and in this method 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.660
 we need a loop before that 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.060
 the complete list of our spreitz 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.420
 goes through from top to bottom so from 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.160
 the highest position to the lowest 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.790
 and see through 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:03.140
 if our our touch event is ours 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:06.500
 Touch on the screen over 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.430
 pen with one with the position of a 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.670
 strikes and if that agrees so 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.170
 if now the 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.799
 position of this dispute with the event 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:25.240
 So agrees with the nonsense event 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:27.820
 should be a random colors of the new 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.970
 be created and the 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:37.920
 accused broad is to be deleted 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.920
 and thus not several spreitz the 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.369
 so that not several spreitz in the 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.340
 moments we take on the dispute 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.220
 click on it to delete the under 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.399
 circumstances are drawn on top of each other 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.880
 we will need this break 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:59.530
 only one of the spreads deleted and 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.280
 Although the top and also need 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.289
 we threatened a synchronous one 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.209
 and that will be on touch event in 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:11.819
 dealt with a different thread than 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:13.480
 our drawing and if we are ours 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.690
 control method 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.290
 and if we are at the same moment 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.840
 perform the touch event like the 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.570
 another fred performs a drawing 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.250
 then we will get a conflict and vice versa 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.000
 We need this to prevent this 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.910
 synchro mostly 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.550
 and this method remove the sprite 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.220
 we have not implemented yet 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.130
 and this is actually quite simple and 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.200
 while deleting this method 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.100
 or removed this method 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.530
 So the famous sprite from the list 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.530
 the index wide here 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:01.850
 So the index is passed and 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:04.600
 delete also the number the 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.980
 matching sprite was assigned so 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.350
 almost the color if you like and 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.130
 Now we find the whole time in ours 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.530
 program 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:17.740
 to copy that we add that here 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.450
 at the bottom 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.890
 and 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.010
 need now 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.569
 which is a touched method as well 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.250
 we still insert imports 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:33.230
 if you do not have control straw and 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.500
 Now let's start one this method 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.740
 create method is touch and type sprite 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.740
 and 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.340
 this is not supposed to shine in front of street 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.340
 be but 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.459
 this expression here 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.980
 and what this expression does 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:06.629
 is in 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:09.150
 reflect whether the area of ​​touches 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.700
 was or the positions the 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.680
 was touched 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.959
 would be in the area is in the once 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:21.109
 is located and where do we still have the 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:26.240
 create method remove sprite 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.240
 we create a dispute 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.740
 the content here in the say 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.740
 principle, you can just copy that 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.550
 and overwrite the whole 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.550
 so 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.220
 then we need a statement 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.320
 2 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.309
 and 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:59.149
 Now we save the whole and click 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:05:00.159
 on play ran to test what we here 

00:04:59.149 --> 00:05:02.719
 achieved 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:04.759
 Here we see the twelve again 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:08.209
 now created looks 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:12.080
 I even look at a it and it 

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:14.479
 have been recreated click it would 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.159
 recreated again and had one 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.889
 Random color so if I am up now 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:21.550
 it may be yellow clique whole blue 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:24.259
 but also have a different color 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.080
 and if now two pieces on top of each other 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:30.529
 because I'm clique on it now 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.059
 both deleted that is because of me 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:34.669
 show you the effect if I 

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:37.509
 Just clicked the mouse so hold 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:41.149
 Now I click times continuously without 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:44.800
 so without clicking again only 

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:48.289
 by holding on to the mouse button 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.610
 I always destroy this wide and around 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.219
 we still have to prevent that 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.259
 insert these two lines into the code 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:57.670
 and also another shop 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:06:01.910
 brace shows you this briefly 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:04.650
 that's why we come here in Germany and 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:07.020
 need another one here 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.790
 more business braces with it 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.750
 whole neatly indented again 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:14.759
 we press control ship but that 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:19.680
 fittingly engaged now we need 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:21.860
 Click this variable load and paste 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.160
 We now as a field 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.340
 and indeed 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.220
 just go over it so now 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:33.720
 Let's talk the whole thing and let's go 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.720
 even the engine is running 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.250
 and it sounds like it 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.780
 where are now two trip over each other 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.080
 now here the blue and the yellow are 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.419
 on top of each other and it will only be the blue one 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.979
 destroyed I think so click 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:53.460
 I take a look and hold the view 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:57.090
 So hold down the mouse button and 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:07:01.669
 zack because something still happens and you 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:06.979
 only see every 300 milliseconds 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:06.979
 is it possible to destroy a ninth ? 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:16.890
 that is of course ineffective because of 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:20.880
 player we will get punished 

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:23.090
 but more in the next tutorials 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.610
 I hope you could follow had fun 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:29.310
 learned something and subscribed to the channel 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:31.590
 check out the homepage and get dressed 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.820
 the next tutorial rhine and until then 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.820
 I wish you all the best
