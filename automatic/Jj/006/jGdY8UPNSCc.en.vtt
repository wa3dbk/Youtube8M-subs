the computer this morning trying to film

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.830 
the computer this morning trying to film
a<00:00:10.320> video<00:00:10.440> that<00:00:10.830> wasn't<00:00:11.040> you<00:00:11.820> know<00:00:11.969> projecting

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
a video that wasn't you know projecting

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.959 
a video that wasn't you know projecting
this<00:00:13.019> this<00:00:13.469> weird<00:00:13.769> red<00:00:14.099> color<00:00:14.340> into<00:00:14.610> my<00:00:14.730> face

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
this this weird red color into my face

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.540 
this this weird red color into my face
and<00:00:15.740> fiddling<00:00:16.740> with<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.949> lighting<00:00:17.220> all<00:00:17.369> over

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
and fiddling with the lighting all over

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.279 
and fiddling with the lighting all over
the<00:00:17.640> room<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:17.850> then<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.029> realized<00:00:18.449> maybe<00:00:19.050> it's

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
the room and then I realized maybe it's

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.929 
the room and then I realized maybe it's
not<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.650> room<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.279> he's<00:00:20.400> done<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.640> lighting

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
not the room and he's done the lighting

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.250 
not the room and he's done the lighting
maybe<00:00:21.480> it's<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.720> computer

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
maybe it's the computer

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.939 
maybe it's the computer
sure<00:00:22.800> enough<00:00:23.539> it<00:00:24.539> was<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.720> computer<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.470> now<00:00:25.920> I

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
sure enough it was the computer so now I

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.589 
sure enough it was the computer so now I
have<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.340> fix<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.730> all<00:00:26.820> I'll<00:00:27.150> be<00:00:27.210> able<00:00:27.510> to

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
because I find that as my shoulders get

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.650 
because I find that as my shoulders get
wider<00:05:59.740> it's<00:06:00.100> just<00:06:00.400> it's<00:06:00.640> that<00:06:00.700> optical<00:06:01.360> same

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
wider it's just it's that optical same

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.330 
wider it's just it's that optical same
with<00:06:01.840> my<00:06:01.990> lats<00:06:02.320> get<00:06:02.620> water<00:06:02.800> it's<00:06:03.070> the<00:06:03.190> alcohol

with my lats get water it's the alcohol

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.000 
with my lats get water it's the alcohol
illusion<00:06:04.180> of<00:06:04.300> the<00:06:04.450> v-shape<00:06:05.230> so<00:06:05.530> it<00:06:05.620> makes<00:06:05.800> the

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
illusion of the v-shape so it makes the

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.240 
illusion of the v-shape so it makes the
whole<00:06:06.690> the<00:06:07.690> whole<00:06:07.720> hip<00:06:08.350> area
