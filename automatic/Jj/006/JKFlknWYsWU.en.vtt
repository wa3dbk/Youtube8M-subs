00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.399 

I'm<00:01:21.070> in<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.310> box<00:01:21.550> then<00:01:22.510> you<00:01:22.600> first<00:01:22.900> subset<00:01:23.380> of

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
I'm in the box then you first subset of

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.080 
I'm in the box then you first subset of
would<00:01:23.650> ready<00:01:23.890> to<00:01:24.070> kill<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.580> oven<00:01:24.790> so

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
would ready to kill the oven so

would ready to kill the oven so
basically<00:01:25.750> secure<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.140> oven<00:01:26.380> we're<00:01:27.160> gonna

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
basically secure the oven we're gonna

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.890 
basically secure the oven we're gonna
have<00:01:27.430> to<00:01:27.550> light<00:01:27.729> a<00:01:27.760> small<00:01:28.000> fire<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.479> start<00:01:28.750> with

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
have to light a small fire to start with

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.690 
have to light a small fire to start with
and<00:01:29.140> then<00:01:29.530> slowly<00:01:29.800> over<00:01:30.100> about<00:01:30.250> eight<00:01:30.490> hours

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
and then slowly over about eight hours

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.640 
and then slowly over about eight hours
build<00:01:31.240> it<00:01:31.360> up<00:01:31.479> so<00:01:32.050> it<00:01:32.140> gets<00:01:32.290> a<00:01:32.440> full

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
build it up so it gets a full

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.580 
build it up so it gets a full
temperature<00:01:33.159> and<00:01:33.369> the<00:01:33.430> idea<00:01:33.700> is<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:34.470> dry<00:01:35.470> out

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
temperature and the idea is to dry out

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.680 
temperature and the idea is to dry out
the<00:01:35.619> other<00:01:35.800> zero<00:01:36.369> residual<00:01:37.030> moisture<00:01:37.180> that

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
the other zero residual moisture that

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.940 
the other zero residual moisture that
might<00:01:37.869> be<00:01:37.990> in<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.140> other<00:01:38.229> so<00:01:38.500> doesn't<00:01:38.680> crack

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
might be in the other so doesn't crack

00:01:38.950 --> 00:02:47.250 
might be in the other so doesn't crack
you're<00:01:39.310> using<00:01:39.490> it

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:18.339 

this<00:03:07.070> is<00:03:07.220> just<00:03:07.690> homemade

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:26.760

00:03:26.770 --> 00:04:07.309 

okay<00:03:27.550> let's<00:03:28.240> say<00:03:28.420> ten<00:03:29.050> he<00:03:29.110> goes

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319
