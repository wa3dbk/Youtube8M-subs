 vitamin c 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.300
 once in the body a study in 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.369
 laboratory has recently demonstrated that the 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.380

 consumption regularly read 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.880
 prescribed 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.610

 coriander too closely because they can 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.180
 generate vertigo from other trials 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.940
 experimental studies show that

 good cholesterol in the blood this 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.850
 phenomenon would obviously come from the 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.250

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.140
 through the intestine thanks to coriander this 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.440
 which results in an effective decrease 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.700
 of the cholesterol level of an organism it 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.010
