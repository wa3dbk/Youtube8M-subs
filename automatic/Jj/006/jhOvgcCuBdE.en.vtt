00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.950 
here on the side and then pull back boom
and<00:01:49.020> then<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.829> basically<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.579> will<00:01:51.000> pull<00:01:51.869> it

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
and then you basically just will pull it

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.270 
and then you basically just will pull it
all<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.049> way<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.500> then<00:01:52.680> lift<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.009> up<00:01:53.130> and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
all the way and then lift it up and

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.520 
all the way and then lift it up and
that's<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.210> your<00:01:54.360> old<00:01:54.509> face<00:01:54.720> plate<00:01:55.020> right

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
that's it so your old face plate right

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.139 
that's it so your old face plate right
here<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:56.390> there<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:58.670> I'll<00:01:59.670> set<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.000> aside

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
here is there and I'll set this aside

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.969 
here is there and I'll set this aside
and<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.869> how<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.110> want<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.560> slide<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.890> in

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and this is how you want to slide it in

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.310 
and this is how you want to slide it in
so<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.310> sony<00:02:02.610> logo<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.450> way<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.630> says<00:02:03.840> sony<00:02:04.170> in

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
so the sony logo the way it says sony in

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.200 
so the sony logo the way it says sony in
the<00:02:04.439> front<00:02:04.710> will<00:02:05.310> be<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.610> front<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.060> of
