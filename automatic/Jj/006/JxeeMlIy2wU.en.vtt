00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.900

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.460
 does that avs 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.080
 today is Thursday and legs to 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.219
 sanaa so I love you of the scene it's 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.600
 to talk to you about the instruction on 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.890
 youtube so already I warn you of 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.420
 sorry if I speak four hours or what 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.760
 but I think I can tell you 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.860
 on his youtube experience so I 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.070
 started right away first I 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.440
 started to great videos in may by little 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.490
 near April last maziane and I'm 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.870
 remember that the first youtube of this 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.460
 that I was watching was enjoy phoenix 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.370
 and it's thanks to her that I started 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.690
 to like youtube so I think afterwards in 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.640
 watching this video I came across 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.899
 full folder you buzz is a little bit all 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.399
 those who are on this colleague's 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.289
 class was really finally it's 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.579
 always but it's true but youtube and 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.679
 to refer so it's really she who 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.899
 pushed me to make repeat videos 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.429
 and I threw myself enjoined so there is 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.280
 a day last year so a 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:55.390
 about a year and I had made myself a 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.620
 each character but eventually 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.559
 I had given up because there 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.760
 had summer coming and it makes me that 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.530
 did not have too much opportunity to 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.900
 to make videos and in addition I pret 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.120
 charter and I do not know yet 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.700
 and so we'll say one day with alix on 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.590
 decided to create the channel biou beach 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.390
 finally bihan new france has changed brief 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.800
 so it was in September and from 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.190
 of picking that it materialized 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.810
 all that is to say that we started 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.950
 post videos not at all 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.620
 regularly but when we started 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.060
 we started to post and our 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.850
 first subscribers came as 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.080
 as you go and that's a little bit shorter in 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.250
 matter finally I do not talk too much 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.600
 number we all know who knows it's 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.460
 like that it came to me to create a 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.710
 extra chain and in their excellences 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.670
 youtube too I went to 2000 top 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.870
 the miners it's really something 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.030
 awesome I think if you have 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.160
 the opportunity to go in october do that's 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.900
 frankly do not hesitate if you are 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.340
 all alone to a grater how who will come 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.630
 you speak all do not leave 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.330
 recently I created a chain 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.220
 personal from the pascal-eric tube it's a 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.530
 uncomplicated to see easily 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.910
 we are not in college 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.020
 but it is not too good there 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.310
 did not find much time for 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.780
 make videos together so I get 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.790

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.500
