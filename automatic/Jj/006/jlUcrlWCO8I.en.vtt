00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.670

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.019
 world champion surprising that world champion second round of 10 percent 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.610

 so against the match 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.640
 promote halfway 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.420

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.880

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.880
 just rock hard 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.760
 this year with a lot more women than men it seems they have of course 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.950
 may or may not

 the driver of the parties must happen 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.920
 catch the club early in the race 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.600
 I have a completely new picture with the proposal than others I know 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.010
 more than seventy are injured 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.010

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.450
 place in the world 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.280
 Until now, that has always been the case and measure it 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.679
 but also learn how to become a champion later 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:09.279

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.619
