then<00:01:11.369> cut<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.850> bottom<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> jamb<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
then cut the bottom of the jamb so the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.350 
then cut the bottom of the jamb so the
flooring<00:01:13.680> fits<00:01:13.920> snugly<00:01:14.520> underneath<00:01:14.970> this

six<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.329> eight<00:01:42.509> inches<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.470> strengthens

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
six to eight inches so it strengthens

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.800 
six to eight inches so it strengthens
