00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.840
 doppelgänger 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:26.710
 the word that may not tell you anything 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:30.449
 but if I say double walker 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.449
 the double ghost 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.680
 it's basically a figure 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:42.620
 and mythical present many legends 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:46.460
 Folklore of different cultures 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.320
 and that possibly belong to the 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:54.410
 fiction 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:56.820
 but a lot of people this gives a lot 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.540
 veracity 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.200
 doubled walker your double 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.200
 ghost 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:29.490
 in fact the word is a derivation in 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.700
 which as I said before the double that 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.690
 walks by your side that was a term that 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.620
 was coined by the novelist writer 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:43.610
 shampoo 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.610
 in 1796 shampoo 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:51.670
 sometimes referring to a twin 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.920
 evil that can be in another 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.020
 dimension and that sometimes we also 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.600
 refers to the phenomenon of bilocation 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.149
 It looks like fantasy or science fiction 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.829
 but within the hidden mysteries of 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:10.739
 world this phenomenon and I say it clearly 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:14.430
 this phenomenon is one of the most 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:17.819
 excel in the paranormal world and 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.410
 there are thousands of believers in this 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.069
 planet 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:27.709
 People say that 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:31.830
 the double gamer has the need and the 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:35.690
 ability to imitate the true being 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.730
 that is, the living person from whom it derives 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.750
 and there are many theories about why 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.960
 your existence or creation happening these 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.920
 since it is a hidden nature or 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:54.370
 magical works 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:57.190
 they are double or shadows created 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.950
 this enigma this is a phenomenon has 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.670
 very solid roots in Nordic cultures 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:07.060
 and Germanic especially are full of 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.129
 Myths is full of legends and with it 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.640
 a mixture of fantasy and reality in 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:17.240
 those cultures are believed to 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.319
 see your own ghostly self is an augury 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.670
 important 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.670
 of one's death 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.090
 someone said 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:33.240
 the one who sees his double is going to die 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.970
 if someone 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.640
 a man ghost of himself 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:44.760
 of someone else is said to bode bad 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.760
 luck in predicting a disease 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.610
 although this 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:54.740
 this is 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:59.230
 part of Nordic mythology makes us 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.230
 think that according to science 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.580
 what is being investigated now what 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:10.240
 atoms can be duplicated in 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.330
 different states and in different 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.360
 dimensions 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.750
 It can make us think that perhaps 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.540
 we can have a double 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.430
 just like us but what is 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:29.480
 clear and this I almost dare to 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:32.950
 to affirm it is that each one of us in 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.950
 this dimension in this we live are 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.950
 unique 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.260
 thank you very much for listening to this 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.260
 Program 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:56.120
 through the demonstration maybe the 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.029
 research allows line back 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.779
 monster of many heads rule the 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:02.779
 sea ​​World
