00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
want to look through here and different

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.880 
want to look through here and different
years<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:11.880> rosters<00:01:12.270> for<00:01:12.390> ps2<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.200> 2009

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
years for rosters for ps2 this one 2009

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.760 
years for rosters for ps2 this one 2009
to<00:01:14.010> 2010<00:01:14.490> that'll<00:01:14.790> be<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.030> upcoming<00:01:15.270> season

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
with the rosters for the ps2 or ps3

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.440 
with the rosters for the ps2 or ps3
especially<00:03:58.700> because<00:03:58.850> I<00:03:59.000> don't<00:03:59.180> know<00:03:59.269> how<00:03:59.360> to

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
especially because I don't know how to

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.020 
especially because I don't know how to
do<00:03:59.570> it<00:03:59.660> for<00:03:59.780> the<00:03:59.840> ps3<00:04:00.050> at<00:04:00.260> all<00:04:00.380> I<00:04:01.030> honestly

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
do it for the ps3 at all I honestly

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.550 
do it for the ps3 at all I honestly
don't<00:04:02.180> think<00:04:02.420> this<00:04:02.570> helps<00:04:02.840> with<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.050> ps3<00:04:03.290> I

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
don't think this helps with the ps3 I

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.600 
don't think this helps with the ps3 I
don't<00:04:03.769> think<00:04:03.920> you<00:04:03.980> can<00:04:04.130> use<00:04:04.280> this<00:04:04.370> with<00:04:04.519> the

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
don't think you can use this with the

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.090 
don't think you can use this with the
ps3<00:04:05.030> so<00:04:05.780> before<00:04:06.050> you<00:04:06.140> go<00:04:06.230> out<00:04:06.260> buy<00:04:06.530> this<00:04:06.739> ps3

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
ps3 so before you go out buy this ps3

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.770 
ps3 so before you go out buy this ps3
users<00:04:07.370> I<00:04:07.700> would<00:04:07.880> definitely<00:04:08.239> check<00:04:08.420> this<00:04:08.570> site

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
users I would definitely check this site

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.509 
users I would definitely check this site
first<00:04:09.050> and<00:04:09.410> make<00:04:09.620> sure<00:04:09.650> you<00:04:09.950> figure<00:04:10.310> out<00:04:10.430> how

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
first and make sure you figure out how

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.030 
first and make sure you figure out how
to<00:04:10.580> do<00:04:10.730> it<00:04:10.850> before<00:04:10.970> you<00:04:11.090> buy<00:04:11.239> anything

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
to do it before you buy anything

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.619 
to do it before you buy anything
so<00:04:13.040> that's<00:04:13.250> my<00:04:13.400> suggestion<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:14.180> hopefully
