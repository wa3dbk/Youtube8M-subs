expanded outward and as soon as I began
pulling<00:06:04.220> my<00:06:04.460> knees<00:06:04.730> defaulted<00:06:05.600> right<00:06:06.260> back

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
pulling my knees defaulted right back

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.710 
pulling my knees defaulted right back
into<00:06:06.680> that<00:06:06.800> forward<00:06:07.250> position<00:06:07.730> they<00:06:08.150> caved<00:06:08.480> in

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
into that forward position they caved in

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.690 
into that forward position they caved in
as<00:06:08.960> soon<00:06:09.320> as<00:06:09.380> I<00:06:09.470> felt<00:06:09.680> them<00:06:09.740> cave<00:06:09.980> in<00:06:10.190> I<00:06:10.370> just

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
as soon as I felt them cave in I just

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.370 
as soon as I felt them cave in I just
dropped<00:06:10.940> the<00:06:11.030> bar<00:06:11.240> not<00:06:11.690> even<00:06:11.810> worth<00:06:12.020> trying<00:06:12.200> to

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
dropped the bar not even worth trying to

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.740 
dropped the bar not even worth trying to
finish<00:06:12.530> the<00:06:12.710> rep<00:06:12.890> so<00:06:13.670> it's<00:06:13.820> evident<00:06:14.210> that<00:06:14.240> sumo

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
finish the rep so it's evident that sumo

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.480 
finish the rep so it's evident that sumo
is<00:06:14.900> not<00:06:15.080> for<00:06:15.350> me<00:06:15.380> I<00:06:15.500> just<00:06:15.560> have<00:06:15.830> no<00:06:16.040> strength<00:06:16.340> in

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
is not for me I just have no strength in

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.340 
is not for me I just have no strength in
the<00:06:16.550> sumo<00:06:16.820> stance<00:06:17.030> and<00:06:17.630> yes<00:06:17.870> I<00:06:18.020> could<00:06:18.170> practice

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
the sumo stance and yes I could practice

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.480 
the sumo stance and yes I could practice
and<00:06:18.620> practice<00:06:18.710> and<00:06:18.890> practice<00:06:18.980> and<00:06:19.220> build<00:06:19.430> it

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
and practice and practice and build it

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.980 
and practice and practice and build it
up<00:06:19.610> but<00:06:20.000> quite<00:06:20.180> honestly<00:06:20.210> if<00:06:20.630> it's<00:06:20.750> this<00:06:20.930> hard

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 
up but quite honestly if it's this hard

up but quite honestly if it's this hard
now<00:06:21.440> do<00:06:22.280> you<00:06:22.370> really<00:06:22.550> think<00:06:22.790> it's<00:06:22.910> ever<00:06:23.030> going

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
now do you really think it's ever going

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.220 
now do you really think it's ever going
to<00:06:23.270> get<00:06:23.330> to<00:06:23.420> the<00:06:23.510> point<00:06:23.660> where<00:06:23.810> it's<00:06:23.930> an<00:06:23.990> elite

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
to get to the point where it's an elite

issue<00:06:36.110> with<00:06:36.530> conventional<00:06:37.100> polling<00:06:37.400> i've

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
issue with conventional polling i've

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.760 
issue with conventional polling i've
discovered<00:06:37.940> is<00:06:38.120> simply<00:06:38.570> that<00:06:38.600> my<00:06:39.200> lower<00:06:39.470> body

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
discovered is simply that my lower body

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.890 
discovered is simply that my lower body
strength<00:06:40.010> isn't<00:06:40.340> there<00:06:40.880> as<00:06:41.090> you<00:06:41.510> can<00:06:41.600> see<00:06:41.780> my

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
strength isn't there as you can see my

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.270 
strength isn't there as you can see my
whole<00:06:42.080> body<00:06:42.230> tilts<00:06:42.590> forward<00:06:42.620> to<00:06:42.980> be<00:06:43.040> giving

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
whole body tilts forward to be giving

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.790 
whole body tilts forward to be giving
the<00:06:43.370> pole<00:06:43.580> and<00:06:43.790> my<00:06:44.720> hips<00:06:44.900> kind<00:06:45.320> of<00:06:45.410> shoot<00:06:45.560> up<00:06:45.710> a

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
the pole and my hips kind of shoot up a

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.950 
the pole and my hips kind of shoot up a
little<00:06:46.010> bit<00:06:46.100> and<00:06:46.220> it's<00:06:46.370> because<00:06:46.640> my<00:06:46.670> legs<00:06:47.240> kind

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
little bit and it's because my legs kind

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.750 
little bit and it's because my legs kind
of<00:06:48.050> default<00:06:48.620> and<00:06:48.800> give<00:06:48.980> up<00:06:49.130> on<00:06:49.280> the<00:06:49.370> weight<00:06:49.520> and

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:49.760 
of default and give up on the weight and

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.120 
of default and give up on the weight and
they<00:06:50.180> give<00:06:50.330> it<00:06:50.450> right<00:06:50.540> to<00:06:50.690> my<00:06:50.720> back<00:06:51.050> so<00:06:51.830> i<00:06:51.860> need

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.130 
they give it right to my back so i need

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.220 
they give it right to my back so i need
to<00:06:52.160> find<00:06:52.400> a<00:06:52.490> way<00:06:52.640> to<00:06:53.150> basically<00:06:53.510> strengthen<00:06:54.080> up

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:54.230 
to find a way to basically strengthen up

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.000 
to find a way to basically strengthen up
the<00:06:54.980> lower<00:06:55.190> body<00:06:55.750> portion<00:06:56.750> of<00:06:56.960> my<00:06:57.560> deadlift

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.010 
the lower body portion of my deadlift

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.030 
the lower body portion of my deadlift
but<00:06:58.850> it's<00:06:59.390> more<00:07:00.020> specific<00:07:00.560> to<00:07:00.680> the<00:07:00.800> actual

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:01.040 
but it's more specific to the actual

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.070 
but it's more specific to the actual
dead<00:07:01.370> lift<00:07:01.580> itself<00:07:02.000> because<00:07:02.600> obviously<00:07:02.750> you

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
dead lift itself because obviously you

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.630 
dead lift itself because obviously you
guys<00:07:03.200> have<00:07:03.350> seen<00:07:03.470> me<00:07:03.590> squat<00:07:03.860> I<00:07:04.070> squad<00:07:04.460> a<00:07:04.490> good

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:04.640 
guys have seen me squat I squad a good

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.920 
guys have seen me squat I squad a good
amount<00:07:04.760> of<00:07:04.850> weight<00:07:05.000> I<00:07:05.180> have<00:07:05.390> decent<00:07:05.780> leg

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930 
amount of weight I have decent leg

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.600 
amount of weight I have decent leg
strength<00:07:06.200> in<00:07:06.320> general<00:07:06.740> so<00:07:07.100> it's<00:07:07.220> not<00:07:07.310> just<00:07:07.370> as

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610 
strength in general so it's not just as

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.760 
strength in general so it's not just as
simple<00:07:07.760> as<00:07:08.000> squat<00:07:08.450> more<00:07:08.690> get<00:07:08.990> stronger<00:07:09.230> legs<00:07:09.500> I

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:09.770 
simple as squat more get stronger legs I

simple as squat more get stronger legs I
need<00:07:10.250> to<00:07:10.340> find<00:07:10.550> a<00:07:10.640> way<00:07:10.760> to<00:07:10.820> actually

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 
need to find a way to actually
