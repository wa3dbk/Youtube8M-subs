00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.430
 sunlight as fr point for this new video tutorial 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.770
 which will be dedicated to accessibility 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.790
 so for the visually impaired and hard of hearing the iphone pocket pc 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.949
 correctly 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.949
 so for accessibility on the iphone we have several options 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:18.539
 so 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.539
 the appeal making adjustments 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:23.859
 dominique giraud 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.109
 and we go down 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.259
 accessibility 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.729
 so we end up with many of the options 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:31.630
 so we did not see that 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.330
 who will allow us to party 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.170
 of 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.090
 ikea canada federate phone to say everything that happens from the button 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.660
 detect the pages shows this woman 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.170
 We need you 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.870
 which made it possible to make a magnifying glass survey of women for 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.420
 visually impaired people 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.560
 we do not have the white on black which allowed to invert the colors 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.210
 mono audio 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.300
 to the gift for them was from stereo 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.460
 denunciation of the attitude of driving schools ction of capital letters 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.340
 so we are in order firstly the receiver 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.900
 so we see the activities 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.640
 in a leaflet 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.640
 with age accessibility 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.470
 so we find ourselves in the lead with women who are breastfeeding all that is 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.220
 past 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.820
 following on the button 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.820
 accessibility to come 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.600
 accessibility 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.329
 now that comedies 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.329
 that it's a button and who writes sexuality away 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.720
 main 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.590
 we will believe that still 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.360
 so there I'm not ashamed in the calendar what makes a cross on the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.330
 calendar 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.910
 calendar 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.160
 each time the screen quickly to offer 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.170
 here is montreal April 17 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.450
 but for the moment I had above 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.450
 light and its calendar 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.030
 Thursday, March 25th event fits 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.730
 Thursday March 25th event is selected m 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.279
 so with everyone 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:16.029
 everything that happens on every tissue a sheep system its text 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:19.819
 why will sit calendar stay 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.339
 the wise 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:23.139
 each time the screen quickly 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:25.889
 if I want to create a message 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:27.760
 the wise each text 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.129
 autocorrect 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.129
 accept the acrobatic skier activated 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.089
 each time the screen quickly clogged because insertion trolling 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.749
 so the double ticket in the context 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:40.449
 for manufacturing 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:43.309
 but if I will write at each stop 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:46.309
 because that kind of double click on every being 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.519
 it's its price 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:49.699
 remove 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:52.199
 and on this price but also to remove axis 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:55.199
 if not for a hundred and then I can say that the letter 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.209
 the circuit 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.439
 our patience has fallen behind but with the Russians 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.439
 how was it the first hour 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:12.269
 the only thing that with age 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.149
 with 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:15.399
 so for the activity on the beaches 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:18.869
 and to be at his side of israel in fact you have to use three fingers 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:21.139
 etc. had reported 30 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.489
 he lost a week 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.579
 general the latter has itself display 43 kilograms of the allier 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.779
 and do what we want 

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:34.569
 especially because accessibility 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:35.420
 general 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.469
 general 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:40.559
 with age accessibility axp at that time I knew it was not the 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:43.779
 chairman of saxo general bank sarkozy 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.299
 for the knowledge 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.699
 axis 3 5% 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:51.709
 when he will be accepted tomorrow the whole team 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.479
 raffle for the solar 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:55.670
 according to the white house 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.240
 our columns that prevents the magnifying glass on the phone 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.589
 the fight is activated 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:01.489
 it is therefore 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.629
 the personal site production 10th 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:04.430
 a power 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.430
 in hike blocked when the three fingers on the screen 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:12.929
 moreover even three fingers 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.989
 we are dealing with an om 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.139
 including fifteen men on your screen 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.159
 we are moving 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:27.580
 with three fingers in party 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.719
 a spot on virtually narrower displaced 

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:33.770
 but it can for some people 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.960
 a little visually impaired improved the navigation quality on the 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.930
 phone 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.930
 and to zoom out for them double click with 3 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.849
 so percent quescom to others at the level of accessibility 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:50.650
 we certainly do not know that it's not enough colors for people 

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:52.610
 cut of mali to see 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.370
 but it colorizes after all and white it's pretty clear the authority 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.639
 so we ask that for keeping quiet m dance 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.409
 but no, if they're good from the beginning 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:07.409
 and so for them what does it do like your 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.830
 when in more than three times on the main button so either one can 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.050
 activate the trainer either in gold platinum on the bench 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.050
 to ask what is active besides doing nothing 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.830
 so here is what we can say about accessibility on the iphone 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.150
 he had the idea after in the agenda the realization and in the ergonomics it is 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.270
 not always that 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.460
 but hey it's a great start 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.360
 she soon on the blog and r and if you have other suggestions of two 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.710
 citizens tell me hi
