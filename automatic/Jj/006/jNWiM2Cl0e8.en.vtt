immediately hostile I could redo it I
would<00:00:43.680> probably<00:00:43.860> be<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> little<00:00:44.430> less

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
would probably be a little less

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.860 
would probably be a little less
aggressive<00:00:44.760> just<00:00:45.360> because<00:00:45.570> there<00:00:45.719> actually

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
aggressive just because there actually

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.840 
aggressive just because there actually
are<00:00:46.170> Sprint<00:00:46.559> defenders<00:00:47.039> who<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.340> process

the popularity that it did know and I

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.589 
the popularity that it did know and I
would<00:02:08.280> argue<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.580> if<00:02:08.789> Sprint<00:02:09.090> had<00:02:09.270> been<00:02:09.479> in

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
would argue that if Sprint had been in

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.330 
would argue that if Sprint had been in
Halo<00:02:09.810> 2<00:02:10.050> would<00:02:10.259> not<00:02:10.289> have<00:02:10.619> been<00:02:10.770> popular

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
Halo 2 would not have been popular

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.670 
Halo 2 would not have been popular

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
or at least not as popular so for those

love it now I would argue that scrimping

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.559 
love it now I would argue that scrimping
in<00:02:17.370> Halo<00:02:17.550> 2<00:02:17.760> would<00:02:17.910> have<00:02:18.000> only<00:02:18.120> began<00:02:18.420> the

been in that game people would see how
good<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:45.900> is<00:03:46.109> no<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.950> would<00:03:47.190> still<00:03:47.430> be<00:03:47.459> bad<00:03:47.820> it

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
good it is no it would still be bad it

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.819 
good it is no it would still be bad it
would<00:03:48.359> still<00:03:48.600> be<00:03:48.630> frustrating<00:03:49.380> in<00:03:49.470> fact<00:03:49.709> it

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
would still be frustrating in fact it

would still be frustrating in fact it
would<00:03:49.950> be<00:03:49.980> even<00:03:50.220> worse<00:03:50.340> than<00:03:50.760> Halo<00:03:51.030> 4<00:03:51.269> because

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
would be even worse than Halo 4 because

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.420 
would be even worse than Halo 4 because

sprint while Halo 4 was and we still
hated<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.130> I<00:03:56.280> know<00:03:56.459> this<00:03:56.700> video<00:03:56.850> isn't<00:03:57.269> that

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
hated it I know this video isn't that

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.330 
hated it I know this video isn't that
long<00:03:57.600> but<00:03:57.959> honestly<00:03:58.260> what<00:03:58.680> more<00:03:58.890> can<00:03:59.010> I<00:03:59.100> say

long but honestly what more can I say
this<00:03:59.910> argument<00:04:00.180> is<00:04:00.390> bad<00:04:00.570> it<00:04:00.959> doesn't<00:04:01.230> take

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
this argument is bad it doesn't take

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.840 
this argument is bad it doesn't take
