have been a bit frustrated that they
can't<00:05:30.630> plug<00:05:30.840> their<00:05:30.960> Nexus<00:05:31.290> 7's<00:05:31.620> into<00:05:32.160> the

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
can't plug their Nexus 7's into the

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.140 
can't plug their Nexus 7's into the
television<00:05:32.700> through<00:05:33.210> an<00:05:33.360> MHL<00:05:33.900> cable<00:05:35.000> but<00:05:36.000> it's

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
television through an MHL cable but it's

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.330 
television through an MHL cable but it's
going<00:05:36.270> to<00:05:36.360> be<00:05:36.450> limited<00:05:36.630> to<00:05:37.160> televisions<00:05:38.160> that

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
going to be limited to televisions that

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.920 
going to be limited to televisions that
presumably<00:05:38.700> can<00:05:39.150> support<00:05:39.510> this<00:05:39.660> type<00:05:39.720> of

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
presumably can support this type of

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.610 
presumably can support this type of
Wi-Fi<00:05:40.530> direct<00:05:41.330> transfer<00:05:42.330> so<00:05:42.960> it's<00:05:43.200> a<00:05:43.350> bit<00:05:43.530> of

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
Wi-Fi direct transfer so it's a bit of

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.930 
Wi-Fi direct transfer so it's a bit of
an<00:05:43.710> improvement<00:05:43.830> but<00:05:44.280> unfortunately<00:05:44.820> i'm<00:05:44.910> not

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
an improvement but unfortunately i'm not

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.159 
an improvement but unfortunately i'm not
going<00:05:45.180> to<00:05:45.270> be<00:05:45.360> able<00:05:45.390> to<00:05:45.570> test<00:05:45.780> it<00:05:45.900> because<00:05:46.080> i

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
going to be able to test it because i

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:47.890 
going to be able to test it because i
don't<00:05:46.380> have<00:05:46.470> a<00:05:46.500> television<00:05:46.770> that<00:05:47.220> supports<00:05:47.729> it

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
don't have a television that supports it

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.390 
don't have a television that supports it
there's<00:05:48.900> going<00:05:49.050> to<00:05:49.110> be<00:05:49.169> a<00:05:49.260> new<00:05:49.590> clock<00:05:50.130> app

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
there's going to be a new clock app

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.060 
there's going to be a new clock app
again<00:05:51.300> a<00:05:51.600> bit<00:05:51.960> superfluous<00:05:52.440> since<00:05:52.830> there<00:05:52.950> are

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
again a bit superfluous since there are

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.750 
again a bit superfluous since there are
so<00:05:53.100> many<00:05:53.250> different<00:05:53.550> apps<00:05:54.360> available<00:05:54.510> anyway

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
so many different apps available anyway

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.270 
so many different apps available anyway
again<00:05:56.760> another<00:05:57.740> type<00:05:58.740> of<00:05:58.770> feature<00:05:59.070> that's

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
again another type of feature that's

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.640 
again another type of feature that's
available<00:05:59.520> already<00:06:00.000> if<00:06:00.600> you<00:06:00.810> download<00:06:01.440> it

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
available already if you download it

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.370 
available already if you download it
it's<00:06:01.889> a<00:06:02.039> days<00:06:02.370> daydream<00:06:03.300> screensaver<00:06:03.419> and<00:06:04.229> so

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
it's a days daydream screensaver and so

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.379 
it's a days daydream screensaver and so
it's<00:06:04.500> going<00:06:04.620> to<00:06:04.680> take<00:06:04.740> pictures<00:06:05.460> presumably

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
it's going to take pictures presumably

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.930 
it's going to take pictures presumably
from<00:06:06.570> your<00:06:06.780> gallery<00:06:06.990> or<00:06:07.620> maybe<00:06:08.130> it<00:06:08.280> can<00:06:08.460> access

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
from your gallery or maybe it can access

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.659 
from your gallery or maybe it can access
it<00:06:09.090> from<00:06:09.120> websites<00:06:09.930> perhaps<00:06:10.320> but<00:06:10.590> it's<00:06:11.340> a

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
it from websites perhaps but it's a

tap it's going to do some sort of

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:23.330 
tap it's going to do some sort of
magnifying<00:06:21.419> and<00:06:21.889> capabilities<00:06:22.889> which<00:06:23.070> will

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
magnifying and capabilities which will

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.980 
magnifying and capabilities which will
be<00:06:23.430> interesting<00:06:24.030> and<00:06:24.950> that's<00:06:25.950> pretty<00:06:26.190> much<00:06:26.310> it

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
be interesting and that's pretty much it

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.450 
be interesting and that's pretty much it
I've<00:06:27.990> almost<00:06:28.229> sounded<00:06:28.560> a<00:06:28.650> bit<00:06:28.680> downcast<00:06:29.190> about
