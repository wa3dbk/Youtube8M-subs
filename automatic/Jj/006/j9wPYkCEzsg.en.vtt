00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
I think this would be an always way to

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.580 
I think this would be an always way to
do<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:38.840> first<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:40.020> all<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> thing<00:00:40.410> that

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
do it so first of all the thing that

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.200 
do it so first of all the thing that
really<00:00:40.710> struck<00:00:40.920> me<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.100> poor<00:00:41.430> post<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.969> that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
really struck me that poor post is that

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.619

they<00:00:42.300> actually<00:00:42.750> support<00:00:43.789> pup<00:00:44.789> 8<00:00:44.969> which<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
they actually support pup 8 which is the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.220 
they actually support pup 8 which is the
antique<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> puppy<00:00:46.440> mill<00:00:47.450> campaign<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.719> a

it's<00:03:50.320> not<00:03:50.440> just<00:03:50.769> treats<00:03:51.070> so<00:03:51.370> it's<00:03:51.580> kind<00:03:52.150> of

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
it's not just treats so it's kind of

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.699 
it's not just treats so it's kind of
like<00:03:52.390> functional<00:03:52.870> stuff<00:03:53.140> that<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.440> owner<00:03:53.590> can

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
like functional stuff that the owner can

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.710 
like functional stuff that the owner can
use<00:03:53.980> as<00:03:54.130> well<00:03:54.340> another<00:03:55.180> thing<00:03:55.390> it<00:03:55.450> was<00:03:55.540> in<00:03:55.660> the

you just run with this as well and give

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.320 
you just run with this as well and give
it<00:04:00.190> to<00:04:00.220> him<00:04:00.370> in<00:04:00.430> a<00:04:00.489> minute<00:04:00.580> it's<00:04:00.850> a<00:04:00.940> stack<00:04:01.299> of

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330

the<00:04:03.400> dog<00:04:03.580> shoe<00:04:04.860> and<00:04:05.860> this<00:04:06.070> obviously<00:04:06.250> is<00:04:06.519> for

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
the dog shoe and this obviously is for

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.610 
the dog shoe and this obviously is for
little<00:04:06.940> dogs

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
little dogs

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.100 
little dogs
so<00:04:08.459> that's<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:08.849> good<00:04:09.000> idea<00:04:09.629> he<00:04:09.780> talked<00:04:09.930> about

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
so that's a good idea he talked about

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.990 
so that's a good idea he talked about
these<00:04:10.170> before<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.920> he<00:04:11.310> just<00:04:11.489> likes<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.849> carry

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
these before and he just likes to carry

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.660 
these before and he just likes to carry
them<00:04:12.239> around<00:04:12.330> so<00:04:12.900> um<00:04:13.230> we'll<00:04:14.129> see<00:04:14.370> how<00:04:14.489> that

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
them around so um we'll see how that

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:15.740 
them around so um we'll see how that
goes

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
goes

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.840 
goes
yeah<00:04:16.290> he's<00:04:16.590> more<00:04:16.769> into<00:04:17.040> histories<00:04:17.430> than<00:04:17.669> he<00:04:17.729> is

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
yeah he's more into histories than he is

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.610 
yeah he's more into histories than he is
into<00:04:18.060> actually<00:04:18.389> putting<00:04:18.630> any<00:04:18.810> effort<00:04:19.079> into

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
into actually putting any effort into

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.020 
into actually putting any effort into
cheering<00:04:19.949> things<00:04:20.130> like<00:04:20.310> this<00:04:20.489> but<00:04:20.669> he<00:04:20.790> doesn't

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
cheering things like this but he doesn't

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.039 
cheering things like this but he doesn't
like<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.209> carry<00:04:21.359> them<00:04:21.510> around<00:04:21.630> so<00:04:21.930> I<00:04:21.959> think

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
like to carry them around so I think

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.150 
like to carry them around so I think
this<00:04:22.229> would<00:04:22.350> probably<00:04:22.380> be<00:04:22.650> quite<00:04:22.770> popular

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
this would probably be quite popular

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.070 
this would probably be quite popular

really<00:04:26.790> are<00:04:26.910> a<00:04:26.940> third<00:04:27.090> idea<00:04:27.210> especially<00:04:27.449> if

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
really are a third idea especially if

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.480 
really are a third idea especially if
you<00:04:27.750> do<00:04:27.870> have<00:04:28.169> a<00:04:28.440> dog<00:04:28.860> that<00:04:28.889> kind<00:04:29.220> of<00:04:29.280> choose

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.400 
we're not sure about at the fire once
again<00:04:57.210> I<00:04:57.240> think<00:04:57.419> it's<00:04:57.690> because<00:04:57.870> he's<00:04:58.020> lazy<00:04:58.229> and

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
again I think it's because he's lazy and

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.409 
again I think it's because he's lazy and
can't<00:04:58.800> actually<00:04:58.979> be<00:04:59.400> bothered<00:04:59.760> to<00:05:00.000> do<00:05:00.210> them

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
can't actually be bothered to do them

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:01.550 
can't actually be bothered to do them
because<00:05:00.600> they<00:05:00.900> don't<00:05:01.110> they<00:05:01.200> are<00:05:01.289> throw

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
because they don't they are throw

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.629 
because they don't they are throw
everything<00:05:02.130> out<00:05:02.960> and<00:05:03.960> I've<00:05:04.470> given<00:05:04.650> it<00:05:04.889> one<00:05:05.250> by

bench<00:05:08.940> I<00:05:09.590> don't<00:05:10.590> know<00:05:10.770> why<00:05:11.900> they<00:05:12.900> smell<00:05:13.169> really

nice<00:05:13.500> and<00:05:14.310> they<00:05:14.370> look<00:05:14.520> like<00:05:14.700> they're<00:05:14.910> just

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
nice and they look like they're just

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.560 
nice and they look like they're just
dried<00:05:15.570> papaya<00:05:16.639> so<00:05:17.639> they<00:05:17.760> were<00:05:17.820> very<00:05:17.880> so<00:05:18.240> idea

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
dried papaya so they were very so idea

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.870 
dried papaya so they were very so idea
and<00:05:18.780> of<00:05:18.840> course<00:05:18.990> they<00:05:19.139> look<00:05:19.289> fat<00:05:19.650> I<00:05:19.979> don't<00:05:20.550> got

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
and of course they look fat I don't got

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.100 
and of course they look fat I don't got
that<00:05:20.910> much<00:05:21.060> sugar<00:05:21.389> in<00:05:21.600> them<00:05:21.720> they<00:05:21.840> don't<00:05:21.960> know

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
that much sugar in them they don't know

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.170 
that much sugar in them they don't know
something<00:05:22.950> so<00:05:23.340> I<00:05:23.370> think<00:05:23.490> they<00:05:23.700> were<00:05:23.760> very<00:05:23.880> nice

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
because you know I think bigger dogs

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.010 
because you know I think bigger dogs
would<00:05:30.000> probably<00:05:30.240> appreciate

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
would probably appreciate

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.779
