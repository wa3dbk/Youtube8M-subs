00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
itself is 1.33 he only added a scrap for

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.830

the<00:02:31.170> pain<00:02:31.410> but<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.130> could<00:02:32.430> get<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.970> lot<00:02:33.510> more

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
the pain but you could get a lot more

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
others like sometimes the reason why

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.850 
others like sometimes the reason why

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
they are listing the item for cheaper is

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.520 
they are listing the item for cheaper is
because<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.700> is<00:03:47.910> hard<00:03:48.210> to<00:03:48.420> sell<00:03:48.660> not<00:03:49.050> because

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
because it is hard to sell not because

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.220 
because it is hard to sell not because
you<00:03:50.400> know<00:03:50.550> they<00:03:51.030> just<00:03:51.060> want<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.810> get<00:03:51.960> it<00:03:52.080> out<00:03:52.170> of

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
you know they just want to get it out of

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.960 
you know they just want to get it out of
their<00:03:52.470> inventory<00:03:52.710> it's<00:03:53.280> because<00:03:53.520> they've<00:03:53.760> had

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
their inventory it's because they've had

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.130 
their inventory it's because they've had
it<00:03:54.150> forever<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:54.810> just<00:03:54.840> cannot<00:03:55.350> sell<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:55.800> so

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
it forever and just cannot sell it so

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.000 
it forever and just cannot sell it so

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
this is what I've been doing recently

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.720 
this is what I've been doing recently
and<00:03:59.640> it<00:04:00.180> seems<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.540> be<00:04:00.630> working<00:04:00.810> pretty<00:04:01.290> well

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
and it seems to be working pretty well

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.110 
and it seems to be working pretty well
if<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:02.970> would<00:04:03.510> just<00:04:03.750> just<00:04:04.530> sit<00:04:04.830> here<00:04:05.220> all<00:04:05.459> day

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.850 
buy it I mean that's what I do and a lot
of<00:06:26.940> people<00:06:27.240> do<00:06:27.389> that<00:06:27.539> too<00:06:27.780> so<00:06:28.380> it's<00:06:28.530> gonna<00:06:28.650> be<00:06:28.830> a

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
of people do that too so it's gonna be a

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.800 
of people do that too so it's gonna be a
whole<00:06:29.190> lot<00:06:29.430> harder<00:06:29.700> to<00:06:29.970> find<00:06:30.180> deals<00:06:30.360> on<00:06:30.570> here

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
whole lot harder to find deals on here

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.580 
whole lot harder to find deals on here
but<00:06:31.349> it<00:06:31.740> works<00:06:32.400> I<00:06:32.729> mean<00:06:32.820> it<00:06:33.300> is<00:06:33.450> possible

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
but it works I mean it is possible

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.720 
but it works I mean it is possible
so<00:06:34.740> that's<00:06:35.660> that's<00:06:36.660> pretty<00:06:37.050> much<00:06:37.260> all<00:06:37.680> I<00:06:38.340> can

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:38.730 
so that's that's pretty much all I can

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.720 
so that's that's pretty much all I can
tell<00:06:38.880> you<00:06:39.060> in<00:06:39.680> how<00:06:40.680> to<00:06:40.710> make<00:06:40.980> money<00:06:41.400> when

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:41.730 
tell you in how to make money when

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:42.890

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
you're first starting out this is

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.670 
you're first starting out this is
probably<00:06:43.740> the<00:06:44.040> best<00:06:44.340> way<00:06:44.580> to<00:06:44.850> do<00:06:45.450> it<00:06:45.660> I<00:06:46.440> hope

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680
