to concentrate on the people who live in
those<00:00:23.250> places<00:00:23.640> because<00:00:24.980> the<00:00:25.980> people<00:00:26.310> are<00:00:26.939> the

can<00:00:31.140> speak<00:00:31.529> much<00:00:31.980> more<00:00:32.309> eloquently<00:00:33.000> because

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
can speak much more eloquently because

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.440 
can speak much more eloquently because
there's<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.170> much<00:00:34.350> more<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.700> can<00:00:35.910> see

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
there's so much more that you can see

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.440 
there's so much more that you can see
from<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.930> buildings<00:00:37.879> one<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.149> things

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
from the buildings one of the things

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.450 
from the buildings one of the things
that<00:00:39.690> attracted<00:00:40.170> my<00:00:40.320> attention<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:41.040> that

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
that attracted my attention is that

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.119 
that attracted my attention is that
there<00:00:41.640> were<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.000> many<00:00:42.120> churches<00:00:42.920> then<00:00:43.920> of

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
there were so many churches then of

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.740 
there were so many churches then of
course<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.640> churches<00:00:45.180> became<00:00:45.570> very

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
course the churches became very

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.660 
course the churches became very
important<00:00:46.230> because<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.860> churches<00:00:47.309> are<00:00:47.460> such

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
important because the churches are such

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.959 
important because the churches are such
signature<00:00:48.270> buildings<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.579> they<00:00:50.579> allow<00:00:50.940> for

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
signature buildings that they allow for

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.770 
signature buildings that they allow for
the<00:00:51.449> greatest<00:00:51.829> assertion<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:53.129> taste<00:00:53.730> from<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
the greatest assertion of taste from the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.459 
the greatest assertion of taste from the
people<00:00:55.110> themselves<00:00:56.300> almost<00:00:57.300> everything<00:00:58.199> had

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
people themselves almost everything had

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.639 
people themselves almost everything had
a<00:00:58.500> chance<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.070> becoming<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.879> church<00:01:00.350> most<00:01:01.350> of

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
a chance of becoming a church most of

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.830 
a chance of becoming a church most of
them<00:01:01.800> were<00:01:01.949> released<00:01:02.280> or<00:01:02.789> fronts<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.690> the

oftentimes the banks I realized that the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.200 
oftentimes the banks I realized that the
buildings<00:01:11.520> had<00:01:11.790> they<00:01:11.970> imprint<00:01:13.760> not<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:15.030> that

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
buildings had they imprint not just that

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.730

but<00:01:16.979> also<00:01:17.220> time<00:01:18.170> so<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.040> buildings<00:01:20.520> you

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
but also time so in the buildings you

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.370 
but also time so in the buildings you
could<00:01:21.030> read<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> little<00:01:21.659> bit<00:01:21.960> about<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
could read a little bit about the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.070 
could read a little bit about the
history<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:23.009> place<00:01:23.189> then<00:01:24.180> later<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.049> got

history of a place then later on I got

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.230 
history of a place then later on I got
the<00:01:25.590> idea<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.950> coming<00:01:26.460> back<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.970> same
