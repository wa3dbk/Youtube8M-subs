twice it melted properly first time but

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.210 
twice it melted properly first time but
the<00:01:35.550> second<00:01:36.000> time<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.810> turned<00:01:37.350> into<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.740> big

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
the second time it turned into a big

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.790 
the second time it turned into a big
clump<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.060> couldn't<00:01:39.869> be<00:01:39.960> recovered<00:01:40.380> anymore

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
30 seconds both times so I'll recommend

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.499 
30 seconds both times so I'll recommend

came up with while most recipes ask you
to<00:02:10.770> butter<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.190> ramekins<00:02:11.670> with<00:02:11.850> your<00:02:12.120> hand

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
to butter the ramekins with your hand

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.480 
to butter the ramekins with your hand

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
which will of course get dirty and

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.270 
which will of course get dirty and
greasy<00:02:14.930> my<00:02:15.930> tip<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.650> pour<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.100> melted

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
greasy my tip is to pour the melted

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.580 
greasy my tip is to pour the melted
butter<00:02:17.640> into<00:02:17.910> your<00:02:18.150> other<00:02:18.420> ramekin<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:19.440> that
