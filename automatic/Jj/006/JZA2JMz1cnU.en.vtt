hi my name is George Mackenzie I'm not a
doctor<00:00:03.090> but<00:00:03.270> I<00:00:03.419> have<00:00:03.659> had<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:03.899> lot<00:00:04.140> of<00:00:04.200> kidney

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.900 
doctor but I have had a lot of kidney
problems<00:00:04.589> through<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.190> years<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:05.790> I've

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
problems through the years and I've

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.369 
problems through the years and I've
learned<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.330> lot<00:00:06.359> about<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.870> different<00:00:07.170> types

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.680 
learned a lot about the different types
of<00:00:07.560> kidney<00:00:07.799> disorders<00:00:08.340> so<00:00:09.059> I've<00:00:09.150> created<00:00:09.330> this

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690
