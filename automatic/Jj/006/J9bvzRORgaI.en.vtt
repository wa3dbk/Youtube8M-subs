I<00:00:15.800> to<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.160> Carmen<00:00:17.640> on<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.850> tube<00:00:18.380> Carm<00:00:19.380> 3d<00:00:19.680> on

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
I to the Carmen on the tube Carm 3d on

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.420 
I to the Carmen on the tube Carm 3d on
the<00:00:19.890> tube<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:21.560> this<00:00:22.560> video<00:00:22.860> is<00:00:23.040> going<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.310> be<00:00:23.369> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
the tube and this video is going to be a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.720 
the tube and this video is going to be a
poly<00:00:24.210> flow<00:00:25.430> don't<00:00:26.430> know<00:00:26.490> if<00:00:26.580> you've<00:00:26.700> heard

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
poly flow don't know if you've heard

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.960 
poly flow don't know if you've heard
that<00:00:26.910> term<00:00:27.240> before<00:00:27.300> but<00:00:28.130> I<00:00:29.130> think<00:00:29.820> after

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
that term before but I think after

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.340 
that term before but I think after
watching<00:00:30.270> this<00:00:30.510> you'll<00:00:30.720> get<00:00:30.870> a<00:00:30.900> good<00:00:31.050> idea

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.350 
watching this you'll get a good idea

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.710 
watching this you'll get a good idea
what<00:00:31.530> it's<00:00:31.680> all<00:00:31.800> about<00:00:33.500> this<00:00:34.500> can<00:00:34.710> apply<00:00:34.980> to

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
what it's all about this can apply to

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.320 
what it's all about this can apply to
any<00:00:36.720> kind<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.320> subdivided<00:00:38.150> object<00:00:39.150> whether

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
any kind of a subdivided object whether

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.869 
any kind of a subdivided object whether
it's<00:00:39.800> this<00:00:40.800> funky<00:00:41.190> thing<00:00:41.400> you're<00:00:41.550> looking<00:00:41.760> at

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
it's this funky thing you're looking at

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.960 
it's this funky thing you're looking at
here<00:00:42.089> or<00:00:42.330> you<00:00:43.170> know<00:00:43.290> organic<00:00:43.860> shapes<00:00:44.640> and

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
here or you know organic shapes and

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.950 
here or you know organic shapes and
sizes<00:00:45.890> so<00:00:46.890> let's<00:00:47.370> get<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.659> can<00:00:48.809> see

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
sizes so let's get to it you can see

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.270 
sizes so let's get to it you can see
here<00:00:49.409> I<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.769> a<00:00:50.330> sort<00:00:51.330> of<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:52.280> greenhouse

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
here I have a sort of like a greenhouse

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.579 
here I have a sort of like a greenhouse
type<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.940> shape<00:00:54.180> here<00:00:54.570> with<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:55.640> chimney

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
type of shape here with a chimney

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.750 
type of shape here with a chimney
extrusion<00:00:58.589> thing<00:00:58.800> going<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.129> up<00:00:59.370> at<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.580> top

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
extrusion thing going on up at the top

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.130 
extrusion thing going on up at the top
and<00:01:01.640> you<00:01:02.640> know<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:03.860> pretty<00:01:04.860> rough<00:01:05.960> quick<00:01:06.960> and

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
and you know it's pretty rough quick and

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.380 
and you know it's pretty rough quick and
dirty<00:01:07.490> let's<00:01:08.490> see<00:01:08.640> what<00:01:08.760> happens<00:01:09.090> when<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.240> hit

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
dirty let's see what happens when I hit

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.609 
dirty let's see what happens when I hit
the<00:01:09.450> tab<00:01:09.690> key<00:01:11.000> obviously<00:01:12.000> get<00:01:12.479> smoother<00:01:12.899> but

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
the tab key obviously get smoother but

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.450 
the tab key obviously get smoother but
let<00:01:13.890> me<00:01:13.920> take<00:01:14.159> these<00:01:14.340> wires<00:01:14.909> off<00:01:15.530> and<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:17.250> you

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
let me take these wires off and if you

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.410 
let me take these wires off and if you
look<00:01:17.640> closer<00:01:20.539> you<00:01:21.539> will<00:01:21.659> see<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:23.420> not

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
look closer you will see that it's not

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.870 
look closer you will see that it's not
super<00:01:24.810> clean

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.319 

it<00:01:31.420> could<00:01:31.630> be<00:01:31.780> better<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:35.490> if<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:37.180> were<00:01:37.299> to

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
it could be better and if you were to

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.359 
it could be better and if you were to
render<00:01:37.689> this<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:38.020> would<00:01:38.140> be<00:01:38.320> horrible<00:01:38.590> I'll<00:01:39.220> be

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
render this it would be horrible I'll be

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.160 
render this it would be horrible I'll be
honest<00:01:39.610> with<00:01:39.729> you<00:01:39.880> but<00:01:40.570> there<00:01:40.750> is<00:01:40.869> room<00:01:40.899> for

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
honest with you but there is room for

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.880 
honest with you but there is room for
improvement<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:43.380> basically<00:01:44.380> this<00:01:44.530> is<00:01:44.590> a<00:01:44.710> way

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
improvement so basically this is a way

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.130 
improvement so basically this is a way
to<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:46.090> know<00:01:46.210> if<00:01:46.509> you<00:01:46.659> were<00:01:46.810> doing<00:01:46.960> something

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
to you know if you were doing something

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.690 
to you know if you were doing something
that<00:01:47.590> demanded<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:50.590> most<00:01:50.799> perfect<00:01:51.399> looking

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
that demanded the most perfect looking

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.490 
that demanded the most perfect looking
model<00:01:52.030> possible<00:01:52.539> this<00:01:52.810> is<00:01:53.020> what<00:01:53.289> you<00:01:53.409> would

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
model possible this is what you would

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.559 
model possible this is what you would
employ<00:01:53.829> you<00:01:54.610> might<00:01:54.789> not<00:01:54.909> want<00:01:55.060> to<00:01:55.149> use<00:01:55.420> this

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
employ you might not want to use this

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.639 
employ you might not want to use this
you<00:01:55.840> know<00:01:55.929> in<00:01:56.110> every<00:01:56.380> effort<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:58.590> now<00:01:59.590> you

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
you know in every effort but now you

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.340 
you know in every effort but now you
will<00:01:59.920> be<00:02:00.069> armed<00:02:00.399> with<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.819> knowledge<00:02:01.350> about

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
will be armed with the knowledge about

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.919 
will be armed with the knowledge about
this<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:03.000> let's<00:02:04.000> get<00:02:04.209> to<00:02:04.270> it<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.619> problem<00:02:06.039> with

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
this so let's get to it the problem with

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:17.009 
this so let's get to it the problem with
this<00:02:07.929> is<00:02:08.259> that<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.750> flow<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.440> these<00:02:15.840> loops<00:02:16.840> of

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
this is that the flow of these loops of

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.759 
this is that the flow of these loops of
polygons<00:02:17.910> are<00:02:18.910> not<00:02:19.090> uniform<00:02:19.660> so<00:02:20.319> you<00:02:20.410> get<00:02:20.530> one

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
polygons are not uniform so you get one

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.319 
polygons are not uniform so you get one
here<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.130> one<00:02:21.190> goes<00:02:21.489> in<00:02:21.640> this<00:02:21.700> direction<00:02:21.760> you

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
here and one goes in this direction you

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.979 
here and one goes in this direction you
got<00:02:22.450> this<00:02:22.630> one<00:02:23.430> right<00:02:24.430> here<00:02:24.489> it<00:02:25.480> just<00:02:25.720> ends

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
got this one right here it just ends

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.530 
got this one right here it just ends
abruptly<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:28.980> when<00:02:29.980> this<00:02:30.250> ends<00:02:30.549> abruptly<00:02:31.000> on

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
abruptly and when this ends abruptly on

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.890 
abruptly and when this ends abruptly on
a<00:02:32.010> curve<00:02:33.010> like<00:02:33.730> this<00:02:33.760> when<00:02:34.540> things<00:02:34.750> are

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
a curve like this when things are

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.330 
a curve like this when things are
changing<00:02:35.290> directions<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:37.600> get<00:02:37.840> these

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
changing directions you get these

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.330 
changing directions you get these
artifacts<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:40.560> we're<00:02:41.560> looking<00:02:41.650> at<00:02:41.890> here<00:02:44.340> now

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
artifacts that we're looking at here now

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.039 
artifacts that we're looking at here now
technically<00:02:45.910> I<00:02:46.980> put<00:02:47.980> my<00:02:48.069> wires<00:02:48.280> back<00:02:48.519> on

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
technically I put my wires back on

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.520 
technically I put my wires back on
technically<00:02:50.049> these<00:02:52.049> when<00:02:53.049> you<00:02:53.079> got<00:02:53.260> five

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
technically these when you got five

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.970 
technically these when you got five
lines<00:02:53.829> going<00:02:54.100> into<00:02:54.340> one<00:02:54.459> point<00:02:55.799> does<00:02:56.799> not

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
lines going into one point does not

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.170 
lines going into one point does not
render<00:02:57.250> this<00:02:57.609> bad<00:02:58.709> okay<00:02:59.709> it<00:03:00.489> looks<00:03:00.519> bad<00:03:00.880> here

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
render this bad okay it looks bad here

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.479 
render this bad okay it looks bad here
in<00:03:01.329> OpenGL<00:03:01.900> but<00:03:02.139> when<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.380> renders<00:03:02.680> is<00:03:02.920> not

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
in OpenGL but when it renders is not

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.629 
in OpenGL but when it renders is not
quite<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:03.880> bad<00:03:04.060> but<00:03:04.989> there<00:03:05.620> is<00:03:05.769> still<00:03:06.310> room<00:03:06.459> for

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639 
quite so bad but there is still room for

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.900 
quite so bad but there is still room for
improvement<00:03:07.350> if<00:03:08.350> you<00:03:08.530> have<00:03:08.739> by<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.579> way<00:03:09.700> if

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
improvement if you have by the way if

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.140 
improvement if you have by the way if
you<00:03:10.000> do<00:03:10.090> have<00:03:10.440> six<00:03:11.440> lines<00:03:12.280> going<00:03:12.639> into<00:03:12.880> a<00:03:12.910> point

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
you do have six lines going into a point

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.379 
you do have six lines going into a point
then<00:03:13.930> you<00:03:13.959> will<00:03:14.260> definitely<00:03:14.850> get<00:03:15.850> artifacts

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
then you will definitely get artifacts

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:20.520 
then you will definitely get artifacts
when<00:03:16.630> you<00:03:16.780> render<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.260> image<00:03:17.500> out<00:03:18.299> but<00:03:19.530> anyway

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
when you render the image out but anyway

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.330 
when you render the image out but anyway
I'm<00:03:20.739> I'm<00:03:21.340> digressing<00:03:21.970> so<00:03:22.590> let's<00:03:23.590> move<00:03:24.250> on

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
I'm I'm digressing so let's move on

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.309 
I'm I'm digressing so let's move on
let's<00:03:26.300> see<00:03:26.480> there's<00:03:26.690> a<00:03:26.750> number<00:03:26.930> of<00:03:27.019> ways<00:03:27.080> I

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
let's see there's a number of ways I

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.449 
let's see there's a number of ways I
could<00:03:27.379> do<00:03:27.560> this<00:03:27.680> I<00:03:27.860> think<00:03:28.129> what<00:03:28.280> I<00:03:28.310> may<00:03:28.640> do<00:03:28.700> is

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
could do this I think what I may do is

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.440 
could do this I think what I may do is
delete<00:03:31.459> all<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.330> poly<00:03:32.510> grounds<00:03:33.310> polygons

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
delete all the poly grounds polygons

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.100 
delete all the poly grounds polygons
polygons<00:03:35.450> surrounding<00:03:36.290> this<00:03:36.410> tube<00:03:38.110> delete

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
polygons surrounding this tube delete

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.890 
polygons surrounding this tube delete
well<00:03:39.530> just<00:03:39.830> cut<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.129> pipe<00:03:40.250> on<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.430> next<00:03:40.700> layer

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.960 

okay<00:03:45.069> now<00:03:46.069> i'm<00:03:46.190> going<00:03:46.280> to<00:03:46.370> select<00:03:46.519> this<00:03:46.700> edge

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
okay now i'm going to select this edge

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:54.729 
okay now i'm going to select this edge
loop<00:03:51.099> and<00:03:52.750> i'm<00:03:53.750> going<00:03:53.870> to<00:03:53.930> go<00:03:54.019> into<00:03:54.170> another

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
loop and i'm going to go into another

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.729 
loop and i'm going to go into another
view<00:03:55.129> here<00:03:56.380> and<00:03:57.380> extrude<00:03:59.500> actually<00:04:00.500> i'll<00:04:00.590> just

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
view here and extrude actually i'll just

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:10.370 
view here and extrude actually i'll just
at<00:04:00.829> the<00:04:00.920> e<00:04:00.950> key<00:04:01.310> and<00:04:01.519> scale<00:04:02.090> it<00:04:05.230> okay

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.590 

so<00:04:11.010> let<00:04:11.340> me<00:04:11.370> stop<00:04:11.670> here<00:04:11.880> and<00:04:12.060> hit<00:04:12.210> the<00:04:12.360> tab<00:04:12.570> key

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
so let me stop here and hit the tab key

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.170 
so let me stop here and hit the tab key
Ken<00:04:13.080> and<00:04:14.780> as<00:04:15.780> you<00:04:15.900> can<00:04:16.020> see<00:04:16.430> this<00:04:17.430> is<00:04:17.670> really

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
Ken and as you can see this is really

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.490 
Ken and as you can see this is really
quite<00:04:18.600> clean<00:04:18.950> going<00:04:19.950> all<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.220> way<00:04:20.310> around<00:04:21.500> of

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
quite clean going all the way around of

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.830 
quite clean going all the way around of
course<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.890> problem<00:04:23.010> is<00:04:26.120> this<00:04:27.120> new<00:04:27.330> edition

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
course the problem is this new edition

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.790 
course the problem is this new edition
does<00:04:27.960> not<00:04:28.140> flow<00:04:28.410> into<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:31.110> structure<00:04:31.470> that<00:04:31.680> we

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
does not flow into the structure that we

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.600 
does not flow into the structure that we
want<00:04:32.010> it<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.190> go<00:04:32.310> into<00:04:32.490> and<00:04:33.020> there's<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:35.490> my

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
want it to go into and there's the to my

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.100 
want it to go into and there's the to my
knowledge<00:04:35.790> there's<00:04:36.120> no<00:04:36.270> easy<00:04:36.540> way<00:04:36.660> to<00:04:36.780> do<00:04:36.960> that

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
knowledge there's no easy way to do that

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.640 
knowledge there's no easy way to do that
you<00:04:37.260> just<00:04:37.290> basically<00:04:39.170> move<00:04:40.170> the<00:04:40.290> stuff<00:04:40.500> around

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
you just basically move the stuff around

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.690 
you just basically move the stuff around
until<00:04:41.160> it's<00:04:42.620> pleasing<00:04:43.620> to<00:04:43.890> your<00:04:43.980> eye<00:04:46.280> now<00:04:47.280> as

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
until it's pleasing to your eye now as

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.360 
until it's pleasing to your eye now as
you'll<00:04:48.030> notice<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.510> silhouette<00:04:48.990> of<00:04:49.170> the<00:04:49.650> we

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
you'll notice the silhouette of the we

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.120 
you'll notice the silhouette of the we
move<00:04:50.400> this<00:04:50.670> back<00:04:50.850> up<00:04:51.200> the<00:04:52.200> original<00:04:52.620> structure

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
move this back up the original structure

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.410 
move this back up the original structure
here<00:04:53.340> from<00:04:53.910> here<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.210> here<00:04:54.450> here<00:04:54.750> to<00:04:54.840> here<00:04:54.900> etc

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
here from here to here here to here etc

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.790 
here from here to here here to here etc
this<00:04:57.420> is<00:04:57.480> implied<00:04:57.990> when<00:04:58.260> you<00:04:58.380> hit<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.560> tab<00:04:58.770> key

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
this is implied when you hit the tab key

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.710 
this is implied when you hit the tab key
it<00:04:59.730> rounds<00:05:00.120> out<00:05:00.240> so<00:05:01.820> if<00:05:02.820> you<00:05:03.360> use<00:05:03.570> your

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
it rounds out so if you use your

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.180 
it rounds out so if you use your
imagination<00:05:04.560> like<00:05:06.230> imagine<00:05:07.230> a<00:05:07.320> curve<00:05:07.620> going

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
imagination like imagine a curve going

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.920 
imagination like imagine a curve going
through<00:05:09.530> these<00:05:10.530> junctures<00:05:11.220> then<00:05:12.120> you<00:05:12.810> would

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
through these junctures then you would

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.310 
through these junctures then you would
want<00:05:13.140> this<00:05:13.350> line<00:05:14.930> to<00:05:15.930> be<00:05:16.110> maybe<00:05:16.530> right<00:05:16.800> here

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
want this line to be maybe right here

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.630 
want this line to be maybe right here
I'm<00:05:19.320> just<00:05:19.560> tracing<00:05:20.010> it<00:05:20.100> as<00:05:20.190> if<00:05:20.340> they're

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
I'm just tracing it as if they're

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.330 
I'm just tracing it as if they're
connecting<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.470> wear<00:05:22.470> that<00:05:22.650> curve<00:05:22.920> will<00:05:23.160> be

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
connecting to wear that curve will be

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
connecting to wear that curve will be
when<00:05:23.610> they<00:05:23.760> subdivide<00:05:26.780> same<00:05:27.780> thing<00:05:27.990> here

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.260 

and<00:05:36.569> like<00:05:37.319> that<00:05:37.879> so<00:05:38.879> we're<00:05:39.030> getting<00:05:39.150> closer<00:05:41.270> go

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
and like that so we're getting closer go

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.260 
and like that so we're getting closer go
back<00:05:42.419> to<00:05:42.569> my<00:05:42.659> perspective<00:05:43.169> view<00:05:44.030> and<00:05:45.030> let's

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
back to my perspective view and let's

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.570 
back to my perspective view and let's
see<00:05:45.509> I<00:05:45.539> think<00:05:45.719> I'll<00:05:46.050> just<00:05:46.169> add<00:05:46.800> some<00:05:46.830> polygons

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
see I think I'll just add some polygons

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:59.320 
see I think I'll just add some polygons
now<00:05:47.819> put<00:05:48.419> my<00:05:48.569> wires<00:05:48.810> back<00:05:49.080> on

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.800 

this<00:05:59.930> may<00:06:00.139> require<00:06:01.240> working<00:06:02.240> some<00:06:02.419> things<00:06:02.449> up

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
this may require working some things up

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.559 
this may require working some things up
and<00:06:03.020> redoing<00:06:03.319> things<00:06:03.650> a<00:06:03.860> few<00:06:04.009> times<00:06:04.220> to<00:06:04.610> get<00:06:05.509> it

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:05.569 
and redoing things a few times to get it

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:07.689 
and redoing things a few times to get it
just<00:06:05.900> right<00:06:05.990> but<00:06:06.439> for<00:06:07.189> right<00:06:07.370> now<00:06:07.400> I'll<00:06:07.669> just

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:07.699 
just right but for right now I'll just

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:09.879 
just right but for right now I'll just
fill<00:06:08.030> up<00:06:08.060> these<00:06:08.300> holes<00:06:08.560> and<00:06:09.560> we'll<00:06:09.710> deal<00:06:09.860> with

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
fill up these holes and we'll deal with

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:15.040 
fill up these holes and we'll deal with
that<00:06:09.979> later<00:06:13.240> okay<00:06:14.240> I<00:06:14.270> got<00:06:14.509> a<00:06:14.539> five<00:06:14.780> point

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
that later okay I got a five point

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.830 
that later okay I got a five point
polygon<00:06:15.169> here<00:06:15.650> so<00:06:15.770> that's<00:06:15.919> not<00:06:16.069> going<00:06:16.219> to<00:06:16.310> fly

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
polygon here so that's not going to fly

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:25.360 
polygon here so that's not going to fly
but<00:06:17.840> it's<00:06:18.110> just<00:06:18.349> for<00:06:18.409> now<00:06:23.680> I'm<00:06:24.680> just<00:06:24.770> matching

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
but it's just for now I'm just matching

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:34.059 
but it's just for now I'm just matching
them<00:06:27.849> matching<00:06:28.900> hole<00:06:29.900> a<00:06:30.139> with<00:06:30.879> HB<00:06:31.879> and<00:06:33.069> there

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:34.069 
them matching hole a with HB and there

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:36.909 
them matching hole a with HB and there
is<00:06:34.190> a<00:06:34.219> differing<00:06:34.669> number<00:06:34.969> of<00:06:35.090> polygons<00:06:35.919> for

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 
is a differing number of polygons for

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:38.589 
is a differing number of polygons for
each<00:06:36.979> one<00:06:37.250> so<00:06:37.520> it's<00:06:37.759> expected<00:06:38.300> you're<00:06:38.479> going

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 
each one so it's expected you're going

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.749 
each one so it's expected you're going
to<00:06:38.659> get<00:06:38.780> some<00:06:39.020> five<00:06:39.979> pointers<00:06:40.400> and<00:06:40.550> three

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:40.759 
to get some five pointers and three

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:42.730 
to get some five pointers and three
pointers<00:06:41.120> here<00:06:41.150> and<00:06:41.419> there<00:06:41.539> we'll<00:06:42.349> just<00:06:42.590> worry

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
pointers here and there we'll just worry

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:51.629 
pointers here and there we'll just worry
about<00:06:42.770> that<00:06:43.069> later

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:51.639 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:54.569 

ok
