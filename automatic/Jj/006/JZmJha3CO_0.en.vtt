00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
audio so I guess my suitemate when he's

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.600 
audio so I guess my suitemate when he's
playing<00:02:31.110> video<00:02:32.110> games<00:02:32.380> or<00:02:33.010> his<00:02:33.190> computer<00:02:33.519> game

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
playing video games or his computer game

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.809 
playing video games or his computer game
sometimes<00:02:33.940> they<00:02:34.060> like<00:02:34.420> omens<00:02:35.410> up<00:02:35.500> YouTube<00:02:35.830> and

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.979 

he<00:02:39.819> just<00:02:40.030> listens<00:02:40.299> to<00:02:40.420> music<00:02:40.510> so<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:40.810> guess<00:02:40.959> it's

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
he just listens to music so I guess it's

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.920 
he just listens to music so I guess it's
good<00:02:41.230> for<00:02:41.410> him<00:02:41.620> but<00:02:42.540> it's<00:02:43.540> definitely<00:02:43.720> not

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
good for him but it's definitely not

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.259 
good for him but it's definitely not
good<00:02:44.049> if<00:02:44.140> you're<00:02:44.230> watching<00:02:44.319> an<00:02:44.530> LP<00:02:44.970> don't<00:02:45.970> save
