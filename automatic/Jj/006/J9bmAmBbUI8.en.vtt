00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello guys we make together 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.660
 finally a more effective foundation 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.139
 tanned for the summer the foundation is 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.210
 I put this one inside one 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.449
 of these plastic containers for 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.550
 foods and is virtually identical to 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.430
 that of the other time therefore also in the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.099
 procedure you will need a mortar is one 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.710
 mask or something to cover your nose 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.300
 and mouth during the procedure then 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.369
 quickly review all the 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.079
 ingredients eventually put them on 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.590
 link in the old information box 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.200
 video if you want to learn more 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.690
 we will use dioxide in Italy 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.960
 it serves to write our fund 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.629
 activity the cosmetic talc which it confers 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.050
 silkiness and that also gives adherence to the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.969
 face and then this is a difference 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.010
 compared to the old mineral foundation 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.710
 instead of white clay 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.420
 we will use this pink clay 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.359
 because to make a more foundation 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.540
 dark I thought of going right to 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.490
 decrease that given white effect 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.830
 from the base powders therefore also 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.290
 from white clay then with clay 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.350
 rose that has a complexion on pink 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.930
 brownish we will naturally go to create 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.060
 a darker color base than there is 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.490
 make it look too loaded and not 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.530
 let us use after red site or 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.810
 too much or yellow site then then 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:36.030
 going over the oxides we need the oxide 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:38.040
 yellow the red oxide the blue oxide is 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.079
 this time unlike the other 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.170
 We will also use mineral foundation 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.240
 the ultra marine pink or pink oxide that 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.420
 will serve to dampen the effect 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.640
 too much lobster or too much yellow given 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.560
 from guests and so I thought of 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.020
 use these two products a 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.000
 foundation that is darker but from the 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.799
 very natural effect 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.869
 I will show you a slot of this 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.600
 foundation at the end of the video anyway 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.549
 is not seen so well in video camera ad 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.580
 anyway in the blog post you will find 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.720
 also the swatches and well photographed 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.310
 with the camera 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.050
 so now we can 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.120
 to start I leave you the recipe immediately 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.459
 overlay put pause and 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.849
 copy sail and then start with the 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.849
 method 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.650
 before I begin, I remember guys 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.840
 to use the mask 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.270
 so if you don't have it you can 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.090
 also use a scarf a scarf 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.160
 anyway something to protect you because 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.890
 when we go to mix the 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.680
 powders are going to rise in the air 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.530
 and it's not good to breathe them now 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.600
 maybe you will wonder why not 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.550
 it is good to breathe the dust 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.500
 here is the question I had asked me too 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.420
 at the beginning when I started doing 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.820
 the mineral foundation so I asked 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.190
 to my friend noemi and told me that it is 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.209
 a matter of fine dust 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.760
 already the powders that we go 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.830
 use are quite fine when 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.450
 I was making to mix with the mortar 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.610
 we further crush them 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.160
 fly in the air and our apparatus 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.980
 Respiratory can not block 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.750
 all sizes of powders a little 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.140
 she said as for particulate matter 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.190
 atmospheric so we protect ourselves 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.860
 using a protection 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.170
 so now I first add the 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.310
 basic powders starting with dioxide 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.049
 of titanium 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.930
 now I add the cosmetic stage 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:34.080
 finally I also add the pink clay that 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.850
 will serve to give a coloring 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.440
 naturally darker without use 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.580
 of oxides that we will stop anyway 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.130
 later however in this case 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.230
 avoiding the white clay that was there 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.560
 in the previous recipe it will be easier 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:54.870
 remove the pale effect now 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.870
 we mix the basic powders together 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.060
 add the yellow challenge and mix 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.790
 add the red oxide and mix 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.980
 let's add him 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:18.040
 marine pink and mix 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.739
 finally we also add the blues reds 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:25.260
 then we mix and then we begin to 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.260
 crush well with our mortar 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:33.750
 and that's it, they went on to about 5 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.180
 10 minutes and my mineral foundation is 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.970
 perfectly blended therefore not 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.610
 you have to find more lumps inside or 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.890
 residues of oxides of various colors if 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.110
 you have to crush well well beware 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.520
 also breaks because I understand that there 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.490
 can you get tired 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.350
 and also with the summer mask yes 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.610
 risked and reached to suffocate 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.280
 then take breaks 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.510
 get away is a breath 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.660
 fresh air 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:03.180
 so this is the final color a 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.510
 I really like it enough is enough 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.820
 dark in summer remember that anyway the 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.830
 your complexion must be equal between 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.480
 face and neck so if you want then 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.460
 darken further 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.650
 I advise you to use a land 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.680
 tanning because otherwise you risk 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.720
 to be a little too full on the face 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.660
 however if you want to find out I leave you 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.700
 the link in the information box of the place 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.670
 on my blog where to see how 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.980
 to be able to darken it further if instead 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.690
 you have very light skin like me and 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.640
 maybe in winter it is penalized 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.370
 clear recipe that you want a foundation 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.410
 the darker I suggest you do that 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.510
 medium dark I made the other one 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.040
 time for the darker complexions the 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.960
 which I really find myself in summer 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.390
 great while this is for me 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.120
 really too dark now I will give it to 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.950
 my mom and my friends so vi 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.570
 I do however see a slot on the 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.060
 palm of my hand to make you understand 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.730
 what color my hand has 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.650
 rather pale also because still 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.780
 I did n't even get a bit of sunshine 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.720
 so I don't know if you can see how 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.120
 this hand is noticeably lighter 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.710
 of the other and is also covered because 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.290
 obviously the mineral foundation from a 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.760
 great fair opacity look for the line of 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.920
 darker background than mine 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:20.100
 natural color that is a lot 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:23.470
 very pale so now I have nothing left 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.210
 other than to go and put it inside 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.030
 a package then ours 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.560
 summer mineral foundation is completed 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.360
 as usual for further information e 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.250
 information go and see the ditch 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.420
 my blog of which you find the link in the box 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.100
 information 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.100
 a kiss and the next hello
