00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
not as hard as it looks what we do is we

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.360 
not as hard as it looks what we do is we
have<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:34.090> movie<00:01:34.240> on<00:01:34.420> our<00:01:34.570> iPad<00:01:34.990> so<00:01:35.620> we'll<00:01:36.220> just

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
have the movie on our iPad so we'll just

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.730 
have the movie on our iPad so we'll just
watch<00:01:36.760> the<00:01:37.000> clip<00:01:37.180> you<00:01:37.750> know<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:38.140> make<00:01:38.500> sure<00:01:38.650> we

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
watch the clip you know and make sure we

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
watch the clip you know and make sure we
got<00:01:38.830> everything<00:01:38.890> in<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.250> exact<00:01:39.430> same<00:01:39.580> spot

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
got everything in the exact same spot

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.120 
got everything in the exact same spot
and<00:01:40.150> you<00:01:40.930> know<00:01:41.050> and<00:01:41.230> then<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:41.560> then<00:01:41.710> just<00:01:41.890> hit

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
and you know and then and then just hit

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.290 
and you know and then and then just hit
film<00:01:42.430> and<00:01:42.610> do<00:01:42.670> it<00:01:42.760> ourselves

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
film and do it ourselves

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.810 
film and do it ourselves
so<00:01:43.659> it's<00:01:44.050> actually<00:01:44.260> pretty<00:01:44.860> pretty<00:01:45.460> simple

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
so it's actually pretty pretty simple

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.060 
so it's actually pretty pretty simple
procedure<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:47.140> when<00:01:47.320> did<00:01:47.409> you<00:01:47.530> start<00:01:47.560> filming

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070
