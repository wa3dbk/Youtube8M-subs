00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.319 
more I guess and let them just sit for
about<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.770> minute<00:01:46.979> what<00:01:47.579> stars<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.030> him<00:01:48.119> as<00:01:48.240> they

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
about a minute what stars to him as they

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.100 
about a minute what stars to him as they
start<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.810> open<00:01:50.630> look<00:01:51.630> at<00:01:51.720> that

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
start to open look at that

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.389 
start to open look at that
they<00:01:52.380> are<00:01:52.560> big<00:01:52.890> fat<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.000> juicy<00:01:55.250> can't<00:01:56.250> wait

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
they are big fat and juicy can't wait

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.300 
they are big fat and juicy can't wait
for<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:57.750> could<00:01:57.899> sit<00:01:58.170> here<00:01:58.200> waiting<00:01:59.189> for

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
for that you could sit here waiting for

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.490 
for that you could sit here waiting for
your<00:01:59.399> muscles<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.759> cook<00:02:00.030> all<00:02:00.270> day<00:02:00.329> long

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
your muscles to cook all day long

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.760 
your muscles to cook all day long
ever-changing<00:02:02.399> landscape<00:02:03.560> anyway<00:02:04.560> there's<00:02:04.710> a

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
ever-changing landscape anyway there's a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.520 
ever-changing landscape anyway there's a
sizzle<00:02:05.100> coming<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.430> these<00:02:05.689> and<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.810> wine<00:02:07.229> is

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
sizzle coming on these and that wine is

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.800 
sizzle coming on these and that wine is
starting<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.099> make<00:02:08.429> those<00:02:09.000> muscles<00:02:09.420> open<00:02:09.569> up

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
starting to make those muscles open up

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.360 
starting to make those muscles open up
so<00:02:10.440> as<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.709> starts<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.069> happen

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
so as it starts to happen

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.250 
so as it starts to happen
we<00:02:11.819> now<00:02:11.970> need<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.330> cream<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.720> go<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.080> just

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
we now need that cream to go in so just

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.830 
we now need that cream to go in so just
a<00:02:13.319> little<00:02:13.470> bit

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
a little bit

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.259 
a little bit
cream<00:02:14.129> comes<00:02:15.129> off<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.519> boil<00:02:15.700> at<00:02:15.849> that<00:02:16.000> stage

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
cream comes off the boil at that stage

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.490 
cream comes off the boil at that stage
and<00:02:16.599> this<00:02:17.500> sort<00:02:17.709> of<00:02:17.769> half<00:02:18.010> open<00:02:19.170> we<00:02:20.170> now<00:02:20.319> need

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
and this sort of half open we now need

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.170 
and this sort of half open we now need
them<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.739> fully<00:02:20.980> open<00:02:21.069> they<00:02:21.760> just<00:02:21.940> give<00:02:22.150> up

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
them to fully open they just give up

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.490 
them to fully open they just give up
their<00:02:22.480> juices<00:02:22.750> they<00:02:22.959> give<00:02:23.110> up<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.349> little

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
their juices they give up that little

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.830 
their juices they give up that little
bit<00:02:23.590> of<00:02:23.680> sea<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.970> you<00:02:25.180> in<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.450> way<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:25.629> nice

plumped lovely mussels to eat off the
top<00:02:30.040> it's<00:02:30.340> not<00:02:30.370> really<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.700> way<00:02:30.790> they<00:02:30.910> have<00:02:31.030> it

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
top it's not really the way they have it

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.240 
top it's not really the way they have it
here<00:02:31.180> in<00:02:31.510> East<00:02:32.379> Greenland<00:02:32.680> dualists<00:02:33.129> was

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
here in East Greenland dualists was

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.440 
here in East Greenland dualists was
saying<00:02:33.459> they<00:02:33.580> they<00:02:33.790> helped<00:02:33.970> them<00:02:34.090> put<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.299> into

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
while one of those icebergs out there

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.910 
while one of those icebergs out there
cracks<00:02:49.420> or<00:02:49.720> rolls<00:02:50.019> over<00:02:50.319> or<00:02:50.500> something<00:02:50.829> I

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
cracks or rolls over or something I

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.620 
cracks or rolls over or something I
don't<00:02:51.040> know<00:02:51.099> but<00:02:51.130> it's<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.459> really<00:02:51.819> eerie<00:02:52.239> sound
