00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.530
 In this chapter we will make a final review of the main concepts and 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.530
 ideas exposed in the audiovisual present 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.660
 General concepts 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.120
 sick building syndrome 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.500
 is the name given to a set of diverse symptoms presented by the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.000
 individuals of a property or plant thereof while working or remaining in 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.540
 the 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.700
 the degree of involvement of these symptoms 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.190
 must be greater than 20% 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.109
 The OMS 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:26.789
 difference between temporary and permanently sick buildings 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.290
 in practice sick buildings are usually equipped with 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.290
 forced air conditioning systems 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.990
 symptoms and indeed on health 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.280
 the symptoms to diagnose a sick building syndrome the 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.230
 we can group in 5 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.560
 ocular upper respiratory tract 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.880
 pulmonary 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.880
 cutaneous and general 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.190
 a determining factor in the syndrome syndrome 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.530
 is the direct relationship between these symptoms and the permanence of the person 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.010
 in the building 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.800
 we must differentiate between the symptoms of the syndrome and the 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.890
 diseases typical of a certain industrial activity pop what have been 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.890
 dice 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.049
 chemical contaminants 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:24.909
 the effects of certain substances on the body are unknown 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.909
 when exposure that very low concentrations 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:31.109
 and for long periods of time 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.059
 some of the main chemical pollutants that we can find in the 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:37.989
 interior of a non-industrial building are 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.579
 carbon dioxide 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.969
 carbon monoxide 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:44.949
 tobacco smoke 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.399
 Construction materials 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:49.389
 fiberglass 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.669
 asbestos fiber 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:53.489
 formaldehyde 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.259

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:06.029
 radon 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:09.029
 and chlorine 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:13.789
 biological contaminants 

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:20.349
 Biological contaminants are basically classified into three groups 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:23.569
 Infectious agents 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:24.869
 antigens 

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:27.259
 and toxins 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:31.149
 biological pollutants do not have type valuation criteria 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:33.179
 technical 

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:36.179
 the architectural factors 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.579
 the design and the own conception of the architectural work are fundamental 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.149
 in your individual building relationship 

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:47.469
 from the point of view of the health conditions of people who 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:48.220
 they make use 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.869
 and enjoy it 

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:54.719
 the main problematic elements focus on the following points 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.389
 economic and psychosocial factors 

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:09.329
 the office should consider the ideal relationship between people and 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:09.989
 machines 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.989
 for an optimal performance of both resources 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.639
 epidemiology and questionnaires 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.580
 The main symptoms that make up the syndrome are 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.669
 eye irritation nose iberbanda 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.150
 Dry skin and mucous membranes 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.979
 cutaneous erythema 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.960
 mental fatigue and drowsiness 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.659
 cef alex 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.180
 dizziness 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.200
 increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:53.319
 The main objectives of the symptom questionnaire are 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.710
 identification of the problem 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:58.660
 second 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.719
 location 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:04.229
 of the analysis of the answer are we will have 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.580
 on the one hand if there is a prevalence of symptoms greater than 20% 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:09.569
 and on the other 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:12.569
 the type and location of complaints 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.520
 ventilation and air conditioning 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.040
 ventilation and air conditioning systems 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.169
 swear a preponderant role in the risk of microbiological proliferation 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.030
 in its transfer to the environment 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.030
 and in his inaction on the part of the exposed people 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:41.080
 the main sources of biological contamination related to the systems 

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:43.939
 of ventilation and air conditioning are 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:45.650
 the outside air 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.770
 filtration systems 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.229
 cooling systems 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.180
 the humidifiers 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.139
 the porous materials 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.139
 and the air inside the premises 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:02.099
 the control of microbiological contamination in indoor environments 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:05.840
 it can be achieved with a good design of the systems 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.840
 and an effective maintenance program for the facilities 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.550
 indoor air quality control 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.879
 the situation is more frequent risk for the occupants of a 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.249
 building are 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:25.469
 exposure to irritating or radioactive toxic substances 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:28.879
 and the induction of infections or allergies 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:31.770
 the problem of sick building syndrome 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.950
 has been enhanced with the design of increasingly hermetic buildings 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.950
 and with a greater operator of air circulation 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:43.710
 There are four strategies aimed at controlling the quality of indoor air 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.889
 in polluting sources 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:49.199
 deficiencies in ventilation 

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:50.860
 the cleaning of the air 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.860
 and the exposure of the occupants of the building 

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:58.490
 the economic cost that the increases in support can represent 

00:06:58.489 --> 00:06:59.979
 it's ventilation air 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:03.600
 It does not have to mean a major mind spending chaos 

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:09.979
 action methodology 

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:13.259
 initial investigation 

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:15.689
 inspection measures yya 

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:19.099
 ventilation measures and climate indicators 

00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:21.719
 and medical examination and associated research
