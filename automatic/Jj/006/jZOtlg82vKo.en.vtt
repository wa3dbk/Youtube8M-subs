00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
you can see using a few cable ties then

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.499 
you can see using a few cable ties then
I've<00:00:13.590> just<00:00:13.950> got<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.219> HDMI<00:00:14.790> going<00:00:15.269> all<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.480> way

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509

I've just got the HDMI going all the way
around<00:00:15.830> the<00:00:16.830> pole<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.820> as<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.119> can<00:00:18.240> see<00:00:18.449> here

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
around the pole and as you can see here

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.439 
around the pole and as you can see here
I'll<00:00:18.900> just<00:00:19.080> highlight<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:20.420> HDMI<00:00:21.420> cable

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
I'll just highlight it the HDMI cable

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.950 
I'll just highlight it the HDMI cable
plugs<00:00:22.170> directly<00:00:22.850> into<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:24.119> HDMI<00:00:24.420> converter

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
plugs directly into a HDMI converter

plugs directly into a HDMI converter
that<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:26.490> purchased<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:28.920> converter<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.760> got

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
that I purchased the converter I got

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.670 
that I purchased the converter I got
that<00:00:30.449> for<00:00:31.170> about<00:00:31.380> 50<00:00:31.710> pounds<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.840> ebay<00:00:33.840> as<00:00:34.500> I'm

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
China so I was a bit dubious at first

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.049 
China so I was a bit dubious at first
but<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:40.440> came<00:00:40.620> down<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.160> worked<00:00:41.370> perfectly

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
but it came down and worked perfectly

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.510 
but it came down and worked perfectly
the<00:00:42.210> first<00:00:42.329> time<00:00:42.860> as<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.980> can<00:00:44.040> see<00:00:44.280> got<00:00:44.460> a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
and of just being masked there by a

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.160 
and of just being masked there by a
cable<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.610> hidden<00:00:50.879> super<00:00:51.270> VGA<00:00:51.570> cable<00:00:52.050> as<00:00:52.140> well

and from there that goes round and the
video<00:00:56.100> element<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.579> plug<00:00:56.789> directly<00:00:57.000> into<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
video element is plug directly into the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.020 
video element is plug directly into the
projector<00:00:58.379> now<00:00:58.859> obviously<00:00:59.219> with<00:00:59.430> converters

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
projector now obviously with converters

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.740 
projector now obviously with converters
scart<00:01:00.780> cables<00:01:01.289> or<00:01:01.590> VGA<00:01:02.280> converters<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.570> could

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
scart cables or VGA converters you could

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.600 
scart cables or VGA converters you could
actually<00:01:03.899> get<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> composite<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:05.159> outfit

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
actually get the composite to outfit

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.050 
actually get the composite to outfit
anywhere<00:01:06.140> at<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> side<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> audio<00:01:08.100> not<00:01:08.820> to

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
anywhere at the side of the audio not to

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.750 
anywhere at the side of the audio not to
use<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.600> speakers<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:11.070> projector<00:01:11.580> I'm

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
use the speakers of the projector I'm

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.240 
use the speakers of the projector I'm
going<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.180> use<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.659> little<00:01:13.409> set<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.740> external

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
going to use the little set of external

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.249 
going to use the little set of external
speakers<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.880> I've<00:01:15.000> plugged<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.509> just<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:16.200> a

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
speakers that I've plugged in just for a

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.840 
speakers that I've plugged in just for a
bit<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.409> extra<00:01:16.710> base<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> bit<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.580> extra

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
bit of extra base and a bit of extra

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.840 
bit of extra base and a bit of extra
oomph<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:19.369> that's<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> whole<00:01:20.610> kind<00:01:20.790> of

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
oomph and that's the whole kind of

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.880 
oomph and that's the whole kind of
system<00:01:21.150> there<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.860> Apple<00:01:22.860> TV<00:01:23.479> strapped<00:01:24.479> in

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
system there so Apple TV strapped in

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.460 
system there so Apple TV strapped in
using<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> little<00:01:26.580> HDMI<00:01:27.119> converter<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.869> then

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
using a little HDMI converter and then

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.350 
using a little HDMI converter and then
the<00:01:28.890> composite<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.549> go<00:01:29.729> out<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.030> anything

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
the composite can go out to anything

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.630 
the composite can go out to anything
really<00:01:30.540> now<00:01:31.049> as<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.259> see<00:01:31.460> projects<00:01:32.460> quite

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
really now as you can see projects quite

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.880 
really now as you can see projects quite
nicely<00:01:32.820> onto<00:01:33.090> my<00:01:33.299> wall<00:01:33.509> obviously<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:34.740> not

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
nicely onto my wall obviously it's not

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.670 
nicely onto my wall obviously it's not
HD<00:01:35.250> as<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.400> said<00:01:35.670> there<00:01:36.140> it<00:01:37.140> does<00:01:37.380> look<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> little

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
HD as I said there it does look a little

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.319 
HD as I said there it does look a little
bit<00:01:37.799> darker<00:01:38.220> in<00:01:38.250> my<00:01:38.400> rooms<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.030> lighting

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
bit darker in my rooms just the lighting

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.359 
bit darker in my rooms just the lighting
on<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.509> camera<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.049> makes<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.799> look<00:01:40.979> a

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
on the camera here makes it look a

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.609 
on the camera here makes it look a
little<00:01:41.610> bit<00:01:41.820> greyed<00:01:42.509> out<00:01:42.540> but<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.170> works<00:01:43.320> just

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
little bit greyed out but it works just

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.069 
little bit greyed out but it works just
as<00:01:44.090> anything<00:01:45.090> would<00:01:45.210> work<00:01:45.360> I've<00:01:45.630> got<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> little

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
recordings of my iPhone and then use the

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.800

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
so that's how I do it hopefully you'll

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.080 
so that's how I do it hopefully you'll
get<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.630> do<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:49.870> as<00:02:49.960> well
