00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.659

 party with a lot of affection 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:51.759
 because it is a party even expected by our population so it is us having a 

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:57.149
 customer is very difficult today that our city hall is more 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:59.999
 we could not let this party go 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:06.279
 Why is it a party here, our population waiting, so we 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:12.919
 we're doing the best that we can is each and every one to our 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.539

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.259
 an interesting race because it's not easy 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:41.259
 to provide an entire event of this level 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.589
 with only temptation of the city 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:49.889
 so we are counting heavily on sponsorship support we are 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.139

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:54.609
