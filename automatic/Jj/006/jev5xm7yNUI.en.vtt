explain in layman's terms whether a

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.050 
explain in layman's terms whether a
snowstorm<00:00:14.730> disproves<00:00:15.389> global<00:00:15.780> warming<00:00:17.060> well

snowstorm disproves global warming well
first<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.420> all<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.570> doesn't<00:00:18.720> know<00:00:19.140> but<00:00:20.010> we

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
first of all it doesn't know but we

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.010 
first of all it doesn't know but we
remind<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.670> global<00:00:21.240> warming<00:00:21.270> was<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
remind you that global warming was the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.529 
remind you that global warming was the
first<00:00:22.410> term<00:00:22.980> for<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:23.580> phenomenon<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.390> we

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
first term for this phenomenon that we

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.960 
first term for this phenomenon that we
now<00:00:24.720> call<00:00:24.990> climate<00:00:25.470> change<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.760> it's<00:00:26.880> very

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
now call climate change so it's very

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.519 
now call climate change so it's very
reasonable<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> snowstorm<00:00:28.349> in

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
reasonable that a snowstorm in

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.740 
reasonable that a snowstorm in
Washington<00:00:28.980> that's<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.490> severe<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.240> a

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
Washington that's this severe is a

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.900 
Washington that's this severe is a
result<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.470> climate<00:00:31.769> change<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.399> it

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
result of climate change is it

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.590 
result of climate change is it
consistent<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:34.710> have<00:00:35.270> extreme<00:00:36.270> weather

consistent to have extreme weather
conditions<00:00:36.840> like<00:00:37.469> big<00:00:37.829> storms<00:00:38.309> or<00:00:38.550> even

this<00:00:52.289> would<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.500> consistent<00:00:53.129> with<00:00:53.370> such<00:00:53.640> a
