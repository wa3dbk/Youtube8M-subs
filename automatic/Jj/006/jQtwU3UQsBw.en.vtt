run what you can to facilitate this is
to<00:00:29.689> just<00:00:30.230> wet<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:30.650> paper<00:00:30.830> first<00:00:31.960> again<00:00:32.960> so

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
to just wet the paper first again so

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.299 
to just wet the paper first again so
that<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:33.590> water<00:00:34.600> runs<00:00:35.600> and<00:00:36.019> it<00:00:36.470> gives<00:00:37.129> you<00:00:37.280> a

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
that the water runs and it gives you a

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.250 
that the water runs and it gives you a
lot<00:00:37.640> more<00:00:37.670> fluidity<00:00:38.390> when<00:00:38.660> you<00:00:38.780> put<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.050> color

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
lot more fluidity when you put the color

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.100 
lot more fluidity when you put the color
on<00:00:39.790> well<00:00:40.790> you<00:00:40.879> have<00:00:41.059> to<00:00:41.210> remember<00:00:41.330> though<00:00:41.809> by

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
on well you have to remember though by

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.860 
on well you have to remember though by
adding<00:00:42.739> the<00:00:43.040> paint<00:00:43.309> to<00:00:43.760> the<00:00:44.000> water<00:00:44.239> area<00:00:44.690> the

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
adding the paint to the water area the

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.469 
adding the paint to the water area the
wet<00:00:45.080> area<00:00:45.500> is<00:00:45.739> that<00:00:46.519> it<00:00:46.729> will<00:00:46.820> dilute<00:00:47.150> color

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:47.479 
wet area is that it will dilute color

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:50.020 
wet area is that it will dilute color
and<00:00:47.870> what<00:00:48.530> we<00:00:48.650> don't<00:00:48.799> want<00:00:49.100> is<00:00:49.309> anything<00:00:49.729> too

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
and what we don't want is anything too

little bit reluctant to move here we go

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.020 
little bit reluctant to move here we go
we're<00:01:02.989> getting<00:01:03.080> a<00:01:03.229> bit<00:01:03.379> stronger<00:01:03.949> now<00:01:04.190> I'm

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
we're getting a bit stronger now I'm

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.010 
we're getting a bit stronger now I'm
just<00:01:05.269> letting<00:01:05.420> basically<00:01:06.229> any<00:01:06.500> color<00:01:07.810> run<00:01:08.810> in

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
just letting basically any color run in

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
and mix with the other colors with the

and mix with the other colors with the
random<00:01:16.640> wash<00:01:17.060> of<00:01:17.299> course<00:01:17.510> there's<00:01:17.869> nothing

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
random wash of course there's nothing

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.000 
random wash of course there's nothing
particular<00:01:19.640> in<00:01:19.880> mind<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:21.170> main<00:01:21.350> thing<00:01:21.650> is<00:01:21.800> I'm

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
particular in mind the main thing is I'm

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.250 
particular in mind the main thing is I'm
letting<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.430> color<00:01:22.700> mix<00:01:23.060> on<00:01:23.300> the<00:01:23.570> paper<00:01:23.810> and

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
letting the color mix on the paper and

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.250 
letting the color mix on the paper and
be<00:01:25.160> spontaneous<00:01:25.910> and<00:01:26.090> do<00:01:26.300> its<00:01:26.480> own<00:01:26.630> thing<00:01:26.690> I

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
be spontaneous and do its own thing I

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.160 
be spontaneous and do its own thing I
don't<00:01:27.740> particularly<00:01:28.490> want<00:01:28.790> any<00:01:29.180> hard<00:01:29.750> shapes

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
don't particularly want any hard shapes

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.190 
don't particularly want any hard shapes
so<00:01:30.740> if<00:01:30.950> I<00:01:31.100> get<00:01:31.160> if<00:01:31.610> I<00:01:31.760> get<00:01:31.820> any<00:01:32.210> hard<00:01:32.510> edges<00:01:32.720> I

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
so if I get if I get any hard edges I

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.000 
so if I get if I get any hard edges I
just<00:01:33.980> soften<00:01:34.340> them<00:01:34.460> slightly<00:01:34.730> and<00:01:35.800> just<00:01:36.800> let

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
just soften them slightly and just let

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.970 
just soften them slightly and just let
the<00:01:37.160> paint<00:01:37.430> do<00:01:37.670> its<00:01:37.820> own<00:01:37.970> thing<00:01:38.680> thats<00:01:39.680> related

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
the paint do its own thing thats related

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.790 
the paint do its own thing thats related
to<00:01:40.420> nothing<00:01:41.420> at<00:01:41.570> all

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
to nothing at all

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.300 
to nothing at all
but<00:01:43.220> what<00:01:44.030> I'll<00:01:44.150> be<00:01:44.270> able<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:44.510> do<00:01:44.810> is<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:45.860> paint

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
but what I'll be able to do is to paint

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.670 
but what I'll be able to do is to paint
something<00:01:46.670> on<00:01:46.940> top<00:01:47.150> of<00:01:47.210> it<00:01:47.480> or<00:01:47.750> do<00:01:47.990> a<00:01:48.020> pen<00:01:48.350> and

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
something on top of it or do a pen and

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.399 
something on top of it or do a pen and
wash<00:01:48.950> study<00:01:49.280> on<00:01:49.550> top<00:01:49.820> of<00:01:49.970> it<00:01:50.150> and<00:01:50.360> end<00:01:50.990> up<00:01:51.230> with

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
wash study on top of it and end up with

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.710 
wash study on top of it and end up with
color<00:01:51.740> which<00:01:52.520> I<00:01:52.670> would<00:01:52.850> never<00:01:53.030> have<00:01:53.180> dreamt<00:01:53.450> of

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
color which I would never have dreamt of

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.810 
color which I would never have dreamt of
putting<00:01:54.470> on<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:54.770> subject<00:01:55.430> in<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.670> first

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
putting on the subject in the first

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.500 
putting on the subject in the first
place

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
place

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.930 
place
the<00:01:57.260> reason<00:01:57.680> for<00:01:57.710> doing<00:01:57.920> this<00:01:58.340> is<00:01:58.580> that<00:01:58.610> it

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
the reason for doing this is that it

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.870 
the reason for doing this is that it
frees<00:01:59.240> up<00:01:59.270> your<00:01:59.750> style<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:00.440> it<00:02:01.130> helps<00:02:01.490> to<00:02:01.670> make

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
frees up your style and it helps to make

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.960 
frees up your style and it helps to make
your<00:02:02.240> painting<00:02:02.930> style<00:02:03.290> more<00:02:03.710> imaginative<00:02:04.250> to

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
your painting style more imaginative to

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.450 
your painting style more imaginative to
work<00:02:05.540> on<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.930> pre-wash<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.409> random<00:02:07.040> pre-wash

that<00:02:07.700> i<00:02:07.729> did<00:02:07.970> earlier<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.750> I've<00:02:09.440> picked<00:02:09.679> a

that i did earlier and I've picked a

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.860 
that i did earlier and I've picked a
scene<00:02:10.099> or<00:02:10.399> Venice<00:02:10.970> which<00:02:11.209> I<00:02:11.360> think<00:02:11.569> will<00:02:11.690> suit

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
scene or Venice which I think will suit

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.289 
scene or Venice which I think will suit
it<00:02:12.019> quite<00:02:12.260> nicely<00:02:12.470> I<00:02:12.980> haven't<00:02:13.700> tried<00:02:13.849> to<00:02:14.030> match

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
it quite nicely I haven't tried to match

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.740 
it quite nicely I haven't tried to match
anything<00:02:14.870> but<00:02:15.709> I<00:02:15.950> see<00:02:16.310> that<00:02:16.549> this<00:02:16.730> warm<00:02:17.120> area

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
anything but I see that this warm area

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.039 
anything but I see that this warm area
here<00:02:18.230> which<00:02:18.470> has<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:19.400> lovely<00:02:19.940> glow<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.659> is

here which has a lovely glow to it is

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.620 
here which has a lovely glow to it is
going<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.620> be<00:02:21.709> very<00:02:22.010> useful<00:02:22.220> for<00:02:22.550> catching<00:02:23.420> the

going to be very useful for catching the
highlights<00:02:24.260> on<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:25.760> people<00:02:25.940> queuing<00:02:26.900> up

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
highlights on the the people queuing up

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.790 
highlights on the the people queuing up
for<00:02:27.350> the

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
for the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.970 
for the
the<00:02:27.920> taxis<00:02:28.460> in<00:02:28.730> other<00:02:28.940> words<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.300> gondolas

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
the taxis in other words the gondolas

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.500 
the taxis in other words the gondolas
now<00:02:30.980> rather<00:02:31.250> than<00:02:31.370> start<00:02:31.790> with<00:02:32.030> pain<00:02:32.300> this

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
now rather than start with pain this

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.810 
now rather than start with pain this
time<00:02:32.740> although<00:02:33.740> this<00:02:33.890> is<00:02:34.070> completely<00:02:34.580> dry

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
time although this is completely dry

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.180 
time although this is completely dry
sometimes<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.690> pain<00:02:35.960> leaves<00:02:36.320> to<00:02:36.650> heavier

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
sometimes the pain leaves to heavier

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.210 
sometimes the pain leaves to heavier
mark<00:02:37.520> so<00:02:38.150> I'm<00:02:38.300> just<00:02:38.510> going<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.780> sketch<00:02:39.260> in<00:02:39.590> with

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
mark so I'm just going to sketch in with

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.450 
mark so I'm just going to sketch in with
the<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:41.810> paint<00:02:42.050> a<00:02:42.380> little<00:02:42.740> bit<00:02:43.070> of<00:02:43.160> painting

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
the the paint a little bit of painting

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.710 
the the paint a little bit of painting
some<00:02:44.080> water<00:02:45.080> very<00:02:45.650> thin<00:02:46.070> watery<00:02:46.640> paint<00:02:47.000> so

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
some water very thin watery paint so

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.120 
some water very thin watery paint so
that<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:47.930> can<00:02:48.290> get<00:02:48.800> a<00:02:49.040> general<00:02:49.670> sort<00:02:49.910> of<00:02:50.120> plan

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
that I can get a general sort of plan

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.290 
that I can get a general sort of plan
and<00:02:52.870> working<00:02:53.870> into<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:55.580> pre-wash<00:02:56.060> is

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
and working into the the pre-wash is

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.860 
and working into the the pre-wash is
rather<00:02:56.480> good<00:02:56.630> because<00:02:57.230> you're<00:02:58.100> no<00:02:58.520> longer

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
rather good because you're no longer

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.470 
rather good because you're no longer
governed<00:02:59.870> by<00:03:00.160> copying<00:03:01.160> colors<00:03:01.820> that's<00:03:02.180> in<00:03:02.360> the

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
governed by copying colors that's in the

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.540 
governed by copying colors that's in the
scene<00:03:02.720> so<00:03:03.590> it's<00:03:03.710> particularly<00:03:04.040> good<00:03:04.280> if<00:03:04.460> you

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
scene so it's particularly good if you

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.070 
scene so it's particularly good if you
have<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:04.910> work<00:03:05.060> from<00:03:05.300> photos<00:03:05.780> or

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
have to work from photos or

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.460 
have to work from photos or
black-and-white<00:03:06.950> sketches<00:03:08.140> because<00:03:09.140> you're

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
black-and-white sketches because you're

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.900 
black-and-white sketches because you're
no<00:03:09.680> longer<00:03:09.920> near<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.400> scene<00:03:15.100> you<00:03:16.100> tend<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:16.790> be

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
no longer near the scene you tend to be

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.210 
no longer near the scene you tend to be
a<00:03:16.940> little<00:03:17.270> bit<00:03:17.390> more<00:03:17.710> willing<00:03:18.710> to<00:03:18.860> take<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.070> risk

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
a little bit more willing to take a risk

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.150 
a little bit more willing to take a risk
in<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:19.730> gamble<00:03:20.150> with<00:03:20.420> color<00:03:20.810> mixing<00:03:21.350> with<00:03:22.010> this

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
in a gamble with color mixing with this

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.510 
in a gamble with color mixing with this
process<00:03:22.690> sometimes<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:24.350> works<00:03:24.620> really<00:03:25.280> well

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
process sometimes it works really well

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.240 
process sometimes it works really well
and<00:03:26.030> you<00:03:26.660> can't<00:03:26.930> believe<00:03:27.140> that<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.770> the<00:03:27.800> wash

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
and you can't believe that the the wash

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.100 
and you can't believe that the the wash
wasn't<00:03:28.730> determined<00:03:29.210> for<00:03:29.660> that<00:03:29.840> particular

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
wasn't determined for that particular

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.890 
wasn't determined for that particular
scene<00:03:33.100> so<00:03:34.100> that's<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.520> plan<00:03:34.760> of<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.660> main

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
scene so that's the plan of the the main

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.990 
scene so that's the plan of the the main
area<00:03:36.470> where<00:03:36.830> all<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.340> figures<00:03:37.730> will<00:03:37.970> be

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
area where all the figures will be

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.920 
area where all the figures will be
standing<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:39.290> keeping<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.770> whole<00:03:39.980> thing<00:03:40.340> as

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
standing and keeping the whole thing as

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.600 
standing and keeping the whole thing as
simple<00:03:41.930> in<00:03:42.170> shapes<00:03:42.650> as<00:03:42.890> possible

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
simple in shapes as possible

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.490 
simple in shapes as possible
remember<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:44.420> theory<00:03:44.750> about<00:03:44.840> looking<00:03:45.350> for

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
remember the theory about looking for

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.600 
remember the theory about looking for
the<00:03:45.590> big<00:03:45.770> shapes<00:03:46.070> first<00:03:46.520> and<00:03:47.200> from<00:03:48.200> that<00:03:48.610> you

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
the big shapes first and from that you

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.220 
the big shapes first and from that you
can<00:03:49.790> work<00:03:49.970> into<00:03:50.300> the<00:03:51.020> little<00:03:51.290> shapes<00:03:53.080> so<00:03:54.080> I'm

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
can work into the little shapes so I'm

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.470 
can work into the little shapes so I'm
simply<00:03:54.680> using<00:03:55.000> some<00:03:56.000> of<00:03:56.120> these<00:03:56.209> lovely

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
simply using some of these lovely

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.640 
simply using some of these lovely
contours<00:03:57.350> of<00:03:58.750> the<00:03:59.750> ends<00:04:00.230> of<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.500> gondolas

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
contours of the ends of the gondolas

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.229 
contours of the ends of the gondolas
right<00:04:03.650> so<00:04:03.860> that's<00:04:04.040> the<00:04:04.280> main<00:04:04.459> drawing<00:04:04.910> done

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
right so that's the main drawing done

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.210 
right so that's the main drawing done
that's<00:04:05.510> about<00:04:05.780> as<00:04:05.989> much<00:04:06.020> drawing<00:04:06.590> as<00:04:06.830> I<00:04:06.950> need

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
that's about as much drawing as I need

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.740 
that's about as much drawing as I need
to<00:04:07.400> do<00:04:09.489> finally<00:04:10.489> I'm<00:04:10.790> going<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.090> add<00:04:11.270> the<00:04:11.450> pen

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
to do finally I'm going to add the pen

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.610 
to do finally I'm going to add the pen
and<00:04:12.140> I've<00:04:12.800> decided<00:04:13.160> that<00:04:13.610> I'll<00:04:13.970> be<00:04:14.620> quite

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
and I've decided that I'll be quite

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.349 
and I've decided that I'll be quite
speeding<00:04:16.580> with<00:04:17.290> the<00:04:18.290> drawing<00:04:18.590> with<00:04:19.549> a<00:04:19.580> pen<00:04:19.910> I'm

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
speeding with the drawing with a pen I'm

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.409 
speeding with the drawing with a pen I'm
going<00:04:20.900> to<00:04:21.020> keep<00:04:21.950> it<00:04:22.100> to<00:04:22.310> just<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.730> brown<00:04:23.000> pen

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
going to keep it to just the brown pen

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.750 
going to keep it to just the brown pen
on<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:24.560> light<00:04:25.160> areas<00:04:25.730> and<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:27.440> black<00:04:27.560> pen<00:04:28.070> in

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
on the light areas and the black pen in

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.480 
on the light areas and the black pen in
the<00:04:29.690> dark<00:04:29.900> areas<00:04:30.169> and<00:04:30.680> that<00:04:30.980> will<00:04:31.160> help<00:04:31.340> to

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
the dark areas and that will help to

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.870 
the dark areas and that will help to
keep<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:32.630> whole<00:04:32.810> thing<00:04:33.169> I<00:04:33.580> think<00:04:34.580> fairly

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
keep the whole thing I think fairly

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.870 
keep the whole thing I think fairly
fairly<00:04:35.870> simple<00:04:36.320> so<00:04:36.979> it's<00:04:37.100> just<00:04:37.220> a<00:04:37.400> few<00:04:37.610> lines

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
fairly simple so it's just a few lines

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.450 
fairly simple so it's just a few lines
here<00:04:38.090> and<00:04:38.450> there<00:04:38.570> to<00:04:38.750> pull<00:04:39.020> it<00:04:39.140> together<00:04:39.460> over

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
here and there to pull it together over

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.770 
here and there to pull it together over
here<00:04:41.030> might<00:04:41.360> have<00:04:41.539> a

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
here might have a

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.250 
here might have a
few<00:04:42.370> little<00:04:43.370> sort<00:04:43.790> of<00:04:43.850> details<00:04:44.720> with<00:04:45.050> the

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
few little sort of details with the

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.190 
few little sort of details with the
windows<00:04:48.250> very<00:04:49.250> light<00:04:49.550> touch<00:04:49.880> with<00:04:50.120> a<00:04:50.150> pen<00:04:50.450> so

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
windows very light touch with a pen so

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.440 
windows very light touch with a pen so
it's<00:04:51.320> obviously<00:04:51.650> watercolor<00:04:52.070> is<00:04:52.610> doing<00:04:53.060> the

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
it's obviously watercolor is doing the

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.560 
it's obviously watercolor is doing the
main<00:04:53.630> part<00:04:54.020> in<00:04:54.380> this<00:04:54.680> piece<00:04:54.950> and<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:56.060> pain<00:04:56.300> has

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
main part in this piece and the pain has

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.860 
main part in this piece and the pain has
just<00:04:56.870> sort<00:04:57.050> of<00:04:57.169> added<00:04:57.620> as<00:04:57.800> a<00:04:57.860> secondary

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
just sort of added as a secondary

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.470 
just sort of added as a secondary
importance<00:05:00.220> it's<00:05:01.220> just<00:05:01.430> in<00:05:01.610> those<00:05:01.820> darker

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
importance it's just in those darker

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.440 
importance it's just in those darker
areas<00:05:03.130> bring<00:05:04.130> in<00:05:04.280> a<00:05:04.430> little<00:05:04.700> bit<00:05:04.850> of<00:05:04.970> the<00:05:05.210> the

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
areas bring in a little bit of the the

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.830 
areas bring in a little bit of the the
black<00:05:05.810> pen<00:05:06.200> now<00:05:06.850> you<00:05:07.850> might<00:05:08.030> use<00:05:08.330> that<00:05:08.600> to

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
black pen now you might use that to

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.610 
black pen now you might use that to
strengthen<00:05:09.380> up<00:05:09.500> some<00:05:09.830> of<00:05:09.980> the<00:05:11.110> the<00:05:12.110> features

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
strengthen up some of the the features

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.790 
strengthen up some of the the features
such<00:05:12.950> as<00:05:12.980> these<00:05:13.370> pillars<00:05:14.590> so<00:05:15.590> there's<00:05:15.740> a

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
such as these pillars so there's a

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.100 
such as these pillars so there's a
stronger<00:05:16.190> line<00:05:16.580> coming<00:05:16.970> in<00:05:17.180> now<00:05:17.450> even<00:05:17.900> a<00:05:17.960> bit

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
stronger line coming in now even a bit

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.620 
stronger line coming in now even a bit
of<00:05:18.230> shading<00:05:19.900> wouldn't<00:05:20.900> do<00:05:21.050> any<00:05:21.230> harm<00:05:21.320> there

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
of shading wouldn't do any harm there

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.659 
of shading wouldn't do any harm there
this<00:05:23.630> particular<00:05:24.140> shape<00:05:24.770> is<00:05:25.010> a<00:05:25.040> lovely<00:05:25.280> bold

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
this particular shape is a lovely bold

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.560 
this particular shape is a lovely bold
shape<00:05:26.090> that<00:05:26.510> I<00:05:27.220> made<00:05:28.220> a<00:05:28.250> feature<00:05:28.970> of<00:05:29.210> I

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
shape that I made a feature of I

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.390 
shape that I made a feature of I
specially<00:05:30.140> went<00:05:30.350> round<00:05:30.590> it<00:05:30.890> and<00:05:31.010> did<00:05:31.160> a<00:05:31.190> bit<00:05:31.370> of

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
specially went round it and did a bit of

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.800 
specially went round it and did a bit of
negative<00:05:31.760> painting<00:05:32.800> so<00:05:33.800> I<00:05:33.860> just<00:05:34.070> need<00:05:34.250> to<00:05:34.280> keep

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
negative painting so I just need to keep

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.980 
negative painting so I just need to keep
building<00:05:35.810> up<00:05:36.169> the<00:05:36.620> areas<00:05:37.040> that<00:05:37.070> I<00:05:37.250> want<00:05:37.340> to

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
building up the areas that I want to

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.650 
building up the areas that I want to
make<00:05:38.990> more<00:05:39.350> of<00:05:39.820> and<00:05:40.820> that<00:05:41.120> little<00:05:41.389> bit<00:05:41.630> of

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
make more of and that little bit of

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:48.940 
make more of and that little bit of
maybe<00:05:42.139> cross<00:05:42.410> hatching<00:05:47.500> to<00:05:48.500> give<00:05:48.650> me<00:05:48.770> some

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
maybe cross hatching to give me some

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.270 
maybe cross hatching to give me some
definition<00:05:49.610> elsewhere<00:05:50.890> you<00:05:51.890> see<00:05:52.100> how<00:05:52.250> a

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
definition elsewhere you see how a

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.940 
definition elsewhere you see how a
little<00:05:52.760> touch<00:05:53.150> of<00:05:53.180> shadings<00:05:53.900> just<00:05:54.320> enough<00:05:54.740> to

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
little touch of shadings just enough to

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:04.810 
little touch of shadings just enough to
give<00:05:55.130> you<00:05:55.400> the<00:05:55.930> effect

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.980 

maybe<00:06:05.510> since<00:06:05.870> this<00:06:06.140> one<00:06:06.440> has<00:06:06.740> a<00:06:06.790> figure<00:06:07.990> we

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
maybe since this one has a figure we

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.990 
maybe since this one has a figure we
could<00:06:09.290> make<00:06:09.920> more<00:06:10.190> of<00:06:11.140> this<00:06:12.220> no<00:06:13.220> feces<00:06:13.790> no

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
could make more of this no feces no

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.460 
could make more of this no feces no
detail<00:06:14.510> I<00:06:15.970> think<00:06:16.970> finally<00:06:17.480> just<00:06:18.080> bring<00:06:18.440> that

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
detail I think finally just bring that

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.560 
detail I think finally just bring that
little<00:06:19.100> bit<00:06:19.250> forward<00:06:19.790> I<00:06:19.940> think<00:06:19.970> some<00:06:20.390> of<00:06:20.420> the

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
little bit forward I think some of the

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.810 
little bit forward I think some of the
brown<00:06:20.810> pins<00:06:21.290> since<00:06:21.710> I'm<00:06:21.860> not<00:06:22.010> diluting<00:06:22.640> it

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
brown pins since I'm not diluting it

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.580 
brown pins since I'm not diluting it
it's<00:06:23.360> going<00:06:23.600> to<00:06:23.690> stay<00:06:23.930> quite<00:06:24.320> Brown<00:06:26.440> so<00:06:27.440> I'll

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
it's going to stay quite Brown so I'll

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.680 
it's going to stay quite Brown so I'll
use<00:06:27.860> a<00:06:27.890> little<00:06:28.160> touch<00:06:28.580> of<00:06:28.640> that<00:06:28.850> to<00:06:31.690> strengthen

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
use a little touch of that to strengthen

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.430 
use a little touch of that to strengthen
that<00:06:33.260> up<00:06:33.530> and<00:06:34.330> really<00:06:35.330> I<00:06:35.360> think<00:06:35.600> that's<00:06:36.170> just

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
that up and really I think that's just

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.920 
that up and really I think that's just
about<00:06:36.620> it<00:06:36.980> because<00:06:37.520> the<00:06:38.030> whole<00:06:38.240> thing<00:06:38.570> still

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
about it because the whole thing still

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.260 
about it because the whole thing still
has<00:06:39.200> that<00:06:39.350> freedom<00:06:39.950> of<00:06:40.100> color<00:06:40.370> have<00:06:41.000> never

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
has that freedom of color have never

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.140 
has that freedom of color have never
lost<00:06:41.600> that<00:06:41.750> freshness<00:06:42.500> the<00:06:43.370> danger<00:06:43.820> is<00:06:43.970> if

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
lost that freshness the danger is if

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.210 
lost that freshness the danger is if
I've<00:06:44.270> tried<00:06:44.540> to<00:06:44.690> apply<00:06:45.080> too<00:06:45.200> much<00:06:45.680> color<00:06:46.010> on

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.220 
I've tried to apply too much color on

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.820 
I've tried to apply too much color on
top<00:06:46.400> of<00:06:46.550> the<00:06:46.640> wash<00:06:46.850> it<00:06:47.240> could<00:06:47.570> go<00:06:47.750> muddy<00:06:48.020> so<00:06:48.770> you

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
top of the wash it could go muddy so you

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.240 
top of the wash it could go muddy so you
have<00:06:49.100> to<00:06:49.480> resist<00:06:50.480> the<00:06:50.690> temptation<00:06:51.020> to<00:06:51.620> try<00:06:51.800> and

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250 
have to resist the temptation to try and

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.400 
have to resist the temptation to try and
change<00:06:52.640> the<00:06:52.940> colors<00:06:53.300> back<00:06:53.480> into<00:06:53.900> reality
