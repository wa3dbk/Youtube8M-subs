so<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.509> hook<00:01:36.600> our<00:01:36.780> hose<00:01:36.929> up<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.259> this

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
so we can just hook our hose up to this

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.779 
so we can just hook our hose up to this
so<00:01:37.590> I'll<00:01:38.039> kind<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.280> show<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.490> what<00:01:38.520> I'm<00:01:38.729> doing

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
so I'll kind of show you what I'm doing

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:56.080 
so I'll kind of show you what I'm doing
here

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.069 

okay<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.270> first<00:01:57.479> thing<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.630> did<00:01:57.720> was<00:01:57.869> just

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
okay so the first thing you did was just

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.420 
okay so the first thing you did was just
add<00:01:58.229> an<00:01:58.380> adapter<00:01:58.740> here<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.250> have<00:01:59.369> a

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
add an adapter here so I can have a

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.889 
add an adapter here so I can have a
clean<00:01:59.640> out<00:01:59.880> what's<00:02:00.119> called<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.600> clean<00:02:00.780> out

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
clean out what's called a clean out

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.270 
clean out what's called a clean out
adapter<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.409> has<00:02:01.590> threaded<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> two<00:02:02.100> inch

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
adapter just has threaded a two inch

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.999 
adapter just has threaded a two inch
fitting<00:02:02.460> here<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.330> that<00:02:03.780> way<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.140> can<00:02:04.530> use<00:02:04.799> this

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
fitting here and that way I can use this

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.410 
fitting here and that way I can use this
one<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.280> don't<00:02:05.490> want<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.700> hose<00:02:05.820> hooked<00:02:06.060> up<00:02:06.270> to

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
one I don't want the hose hooked up to

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.690 
one I don't want the hose hooked up to
it<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.899> we're<00:02:07.020> not<00:02:07.110> on<00:02:07.259> vacation<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:08.580> just

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
it so we're not on vacation I can just

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.160 
it so we're not on vacation I can just
unscrew<00:02:08.910> this<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.420> fill<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.720> with<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.989> hose

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
unscrew this and fill it with the hose

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.559 
unscrew this and fill it with the hose
and<00:02:10.560> then<00:02:11.310> put<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:11.790> back<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.180> just<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.450> keep

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
and then put this back on just to keep

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.290 
and then put this back on just to keep
bugs<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:12.989> debris<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.349> stuff<00:02:13.470> like<00:02:13.709> that<00:02:13.890> out

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
bugs and debris and stuff like that out

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:21.320 
bugs and debris and stuff like that out
but<00:02:15.300> what<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.480> want<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.810> hook<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.050> hose<00:02:16.200> up<00:02:20.330> I'll

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
but what I want to hook the hose up I'll

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:37.610 
but what I want to hook the hose up I'll
be<00:02:21.420> able<00:02:21.599> to<00:02:21.690> screw<00:02:21.930> this<00:02:22.110> adapter<00:02:22.590> on

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.259 

just<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.310> street<00:02:38.580> elbow<00:02:38.879> here<00:02:39.090> with<00:02:39.239> a

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
just a street elbow here with a

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.369 
just a street elbow here with a
three-quarter<00:02:39.930> inch<00:02:39.959> thread<00:02:40.319> at<00:02:40.379> the<00:02:40.470> bottom

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
three-quarter inch thread at the bottom

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.229 
three-quarter inch thread at the bottom
and<00:02:43.379> then<00:02:44.280> I'm<00:02:44.370> just<00:02:44.519> using<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.790> 3/4<00:02:45.209> inch

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
and then I'm just using a 3/4 inch

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.740 
and then I'm just using a 3/4 inch
irrigation<00:02:46.550> nipple<00:02:47.550> here<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:47.970> then<00:02:48.569> I<00:02:48.599> this

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
irrigation nipple here and then I this

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.250 
irrigation nipple here and then I this
was<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.200> hard<00:02:49.349> part<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:50.489> hose<00:02:50.910> threads<00:02:51.720> the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
was the hard part the hose threads the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.900 
was the hard part the hose threads the
male<00:02:52.470> hose<00:02:52.739> threads<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.310> hose<00:02:53.430> I'm<00:02:53.640> hooking

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
male hose threads the hose I'm hooking

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.520 
male hose threads the hose I'm hooking
up<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.150> this<00:02:54.269> is<00:02:54.480> actually<00:02:54.629> not<00:02:55.019> a<00:02:55.080> standard

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
up to this is actually not a standard

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.559 
up to this is actually not a standard
pipe<00:02:55.739> thread<00:02:56.040> it's<00:02:56.250> different<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:56.879> so<00:02:57.480> you

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
pipe thread it's different and so you

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:58.850 
pipe thread it's different and so you
have<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.810> get<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:58.019> adapter<00:02:58.440> it<00:02:58.500> goes<00:02:58.620> from

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
have to get this adapter it goes from

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.880 
have to get this adapter it goes from
pipe<00:02:59.069> threads<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.390> hose<00:03:00.569> hose<00:03:01.440> adapter

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
pipe threads to the hose hose adapter

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.640 
pipe threads to the hose hose adapter
here<00:03:02.129> and<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:03.209> this<00:03:03.810> was<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.140> tricky<00:03:04.410> part<00:03:04.590> to

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
here and so this was the tricky part to

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.350 
here and so this was the tricky part to
find<00:03:04.950> for<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:05.310> but<00:03:05.549> we<00:03:05.910> found<00:03:06.060> her<00:03:06.269> at<00:03:06.330> the

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
find for this but we found her at the

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.240 
find for this but we found her at the
hardware<00:03:06.510> store<00:03:06.810> at<00:03:06.870> Ace<00:03:06.959> Hardware<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.530> I'm

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
hardware store at Ace Hardware so I'm

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.550 
hardware store at Ace Hardware so I'm
just<00:03:08.370> going<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.549> screw<00:03:08.730> this<00:03:08.849> in<00:03:09.030> here<00:03:09.269> and

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
just going to screw this in here and

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.630 
just going to screw this in here and
I'll<00:03:10.560> have<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.799> tighten<00:03:11.010> all<00:03:11.160> this<00:03:11.310> up<00:03:11.489> of

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
I'll have to tighten all this up of

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:23.229 
I'll have to tighten all this up of
course<00:03:11.880> I'm<00:03:12.630> sure<00:03:12.840> it's<00:03:12.989> gonna<00:03:13.110> leak<00:03:13.380> all

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.030 

right<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.390> chickens<00:03:24.750> are<00:03:24.900> getting<00:03:25.170> ready<00:03:25.950> for

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
right the chickens are getting ready for

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.220 
right the chickens are getting ready for
water<00:03:26.430> already<00:03:26.930> and<00:03:27.930> away<00:03:29.599> alright<00:03:30.599> so<00:03:30.780> I<00:03:31.049> put

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
water already and away alright so I put

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.289 
water already and away alright so I put
a<00:03:31.260> clean-out<00:03:31.640> adaptor<00:03:32.640> on<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.819> bottom<00:03:33.180> of

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
a clean-out adaptor on the bottom of

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.199 
a clean-out adaptor on the bottom of
this<00:03:33.950> watering<00:03:34.950> system<00:03:35.489> because<00:03:35.849> whenever

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
this watering system because whenever

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.319 
this watering system because whenever
you<00:03:37.340> whenever<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:39.890> do<00:03:40.890> any<00:03:41.040> cup<00:03:41.190> PVC<00:03:41.459> glue<00:03:41.940> or

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
you whenever you do any cup PVC glue or

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.520 
you whenever you do any cup PVC glue or
anything<00:03:42.510> like<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:43.109> always<00:03:43.200> want<00:03:43.440> to

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
anything like that you always want to

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.960 
anything like that you always want to
flush<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.950> system<00:03:43.980> out<00:03:44.400> before<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:44.790> let<00:03:44.880> the

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
flush the system out before you let the

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.170 
flush the system out before you let the
chickens<00:03:45.389> drink<00:03:45.660> out<00:03:45.810> of<00:03:45.959> it<00:03:46.549> so<00:03:47.549> we<00:03:48.000> probably

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
chickens drink out of it so we probably

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.610 
chickens drink out of it so we probably
have<00:03:48.389> some<00:03:48.630> dirty<00:03:48.810> water<00:03:49.079> in<00:03:49.260> here

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
have some dirty water in here

00:03:49.620 --> 00:04:02.710 
have some dirty water in here
not<00:03:50.400> too<00:03:50.519> much<00:03:51.530> nope

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.790 

all<00:04:03.720> right<00:04:03.840> that's<00:04:04.080> pretty<00:04:04.140> much<00:04:04.380> it<00:04:04.590> real

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
all right that's pretty much it real

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.250 
all right that's pretty much it real
simple<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:05.460> straightforward<00:04:05.780> as<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:07.020> kind<00:04:07.170> of

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
simple and straightforward as I kind of

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.980 
simple and straightforward as I kind of
suspected<00:04:07.770> it<00:04:07.950> does<00:04:08.130> drip<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.880> little<00:04:09.510> bit<00:04:09.810> more

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
suspected it does drip a little bit more

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.150 
suspected it does drip a little bit more
with<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.200> water<00:04:10.470> pressure<00:04:10.710> behind<00:04:10.890> it<00:04:11.100> I

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
with the water pressure behind it I

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.680 
with the water pressure behind it I
turned<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.520> hose<00:04:11.670> almost<00:04:12.090> all<00:04:12.240> the<00:04:12.330> way<00:04:12.420> off<00:04:12.540> I

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
turned the hose almost all the way off I

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.450 
turned the hose almost all the way off I
just<00:04:12.720> have<00:04:12.960> it<00:04:13.050> on<00:04:13.140> just<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.410> little<00:04:13.440> bit<00:04:13.800> so

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
just have it on just a little bit so

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.740 
just have it on just a little bit so
they're<00:04:14.580> still<00:04:14.820> building<00:04:15.000> up<00:04:15.240> pressure<00:04:15.390> in

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
they're still building up pressure in

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.170 
they're still building up pressure in
there<00:04:15.870> but<00:04:16.080> it's<00:04:16.200> not<00:04:16.260> at<00:04:16.500> full<00:04:16.650> blast<00:04:17.150> what<00:04:18.150> I

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
there but it's not at full blast what I

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.340 
there but it's not at full blast what I
did<00:04:18.360> was<00:04:18.450> just<00:04:18.630> add<00:04:18.750> it<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:18.930> little<00:04:19.050> bit<00:04:19.200> over

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
did was just add it a little bit over

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.260 
did was just add it a little bit over
rock<00:04:19.590> got<00:04:20.250> lots<00:04:20.430> of<00:04:20.520> that<00:04:20.610> left<00:04:20.850> over<00:04:20.940> from<00:04:21.150> the

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
rock got lots of that left over from the

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.510 
rock got lots of that left over from the
aquaponic<00:04:21.750> system<00:04:22.020> last<00:04:22.200> year<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.650> I<00:04:23.400> just

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
aquaponic system last year and I just

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.460 
aquaponic system last year and I just
added<00:04:23.850> that<00:04:24.000> underneath<00:04:24.450> it<00:04:24.690> this<00:04:25.110> is<00:04:25.260> again

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
added that underneath it this is again

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.780 
added that underneath it this is again
it's<00:04:25.620> only<00:04:25.680> temporary<00:04:25.920> solution<00:04:26.520> while<00:04:26.670> we're

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
it's only temporary solution while we're

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.130 
it's only temporary solution while we're
gone<00:04:26.880> on<00:04:27.060> vacation<00:04:27.540> I<00:04:27.690> won't<00:04:27.840> keep<00:04:27.960> this

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
gone on vacation I won't keep this

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.240 
gone on vacation I won't keep this
hooked<00:04:28.320> up<00:04:28.410> all<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.680> time<00:04:28.860> because<00:04:29.040> it'll

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
hooked up all the time because it'll

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.290 
hooked up all the time because it'll
probably<00:04:29.400> make<00:04:29.520> a<00:04:29.610> muddy<00:04:29.820> mess<00:04:30.030> underneath

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
probably make a muddy mess underneath

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.230 
probably make a muddy mess underneath
there<00:04:30.540> so<00:04:30.750> I<00:04:30.960> also<00:04:31.770> use<00:04:31.980> sand<00:04:32.340> place<00:04:32.730> and<00:04:32.970> I<00:04:33.060> get

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
there so I also use sand place and I get

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.580 
there so I also use sand place and I get
a<00:04:33.270> bag<00:04:33.420> a<00:04:33.450> place<00:04:33.690> and<00:04:33.870> every<00:04:34.020> once<00:04:34.170> a<00:04:34.260> while<00:04:34.290> and

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
a bag a place and every once a while and

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.100 
a bag a place and every once a while and
throw<00:04:35.370> it<00:04:35.490> in<00:04:35.580> here<00:04:35.850> and<00:04:36.540> spread<00:04:36.750> it<00:04:36.840> out<00:04:36.960> in

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
throw it in here and spread it out in

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.290 
throw it in here and spread it out in
the<00:04:37.650> run<00:04:38.010> area<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.670> that<00:04:38.850> helps<00:04:39.120> with

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
the run area and that helps with

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.570 
the run area and that helps with
drainage<00:04:39.450> and<00:04:40.020> it<00:04:40.140> helps<00:04:40.350> kind<00:04:40.530> of<00:04:40.650> clean<00:04:41.460> up

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
drainage and it helps kind of clean up

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.160 
drainage and it helps kind of clean up
the<00:04:41.700> area<00:04:41.910> also<00:04:42.090> scoop<00:04:42.480> some<00:04:42.690> of<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.870> masses

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
the area also scoop some of the masses

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.190 
the area also scoop some of the masses
out<00:04:43.260> too<00:04:43.500> so<00:04:43.770> but<00:04:44.460> it's<00:04:45.000> this<00:04:45.270> watering<00:04:45.930> system

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
out too so but it's this watering system

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.200 
out too so but it's this watering system
these<00:04:46.290> poultry<00:04:46.680> nipples<00:04:47.010> have<00:04:47.160> been<00:04:47.190> kind<00:04:48.180> of

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
these poultry nipples have been kind of

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.600 
these poultry nipples have been kind of
the<00:04:48.300> best<00:04:48.480> thing<00:04:48.690> about<00:04:48.720> this<00:04:49.020> coop<00:04:49.520> you<00:04:50.520> know

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
the best thing about this coop you know

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.890 
the best thing about this coop you know
not<00:04:50.760> having<00:04:51.030> to<00:04:51.090> clean<00:04:51.270> out<00:04:51.390> the<00:04:51.540> watering

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
not having to clean out the watering

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.090 
not having to clean out the watering
dish<00:04:52.050> every<00:04:52.320> day<00:04:52.440> just<00:04:52.590> come<00:04:52.770> out<00:04:52.860> here<00:04:53.010> and

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
dish every day just come out here and

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.100 
dish every day just come out here and
fill<00:04:53.280> it<00:04:53.430> up<00:04:53.520> you<00:04:53.820> know<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.390> with<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.780> larger

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
fill it up you know the with the larger

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.570 
fill it up you know the with the larger
watering<00:04:55.500> system<00:04:55.830> filling<00:04:56.070> it<00:04:56.190> up<00:04:56.280> over<00:04:56.370> a<00:04:56.460> few

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
watering system filling it up over a few

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.670 
watering system filling it up over a few
days<00:04:56.760> and<00:04:57.060> with<00:04:57.660> this<00:04:57.810> one<00:04:58.020> you<00:04:58.410> could<00:04:58.560> leave

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
days and with this one you could leave

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.710 
days and with this one you could leave
it<00:04:58.710> set<00:04:59.010> up<00:04:59.100> all<00:04:59.250> the<00:04:59.370> time<00:04:59.550> one<00:05:00.510> of<00:05:00.540> the<00:05:00.660> things

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
it set up all the time one of the things

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.480 
it set up all the time one of the things
I<00:05:01.020> probably<00:05:01.170> will<00:05:01.440> do<00:05:01.650> when<00:05:01.830> I<00:05:01.890> redo<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:02.340> main

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
I probably will do when I redo the main

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.180 
I probably will do when I redo the main
design<00:05:02.850> is<00:05:03.060> I'll<00:05:03.210> put<00:05:03.420> a<00:05:03.560> redo<00:05:04.560> this<00:05:04.740> system

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
design is I'll put a redo this system

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.160 
design is I'll put a redo this system
here<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.520> put<00:05:05.700> a<00:05:05.730> float<00:05:06.120> in<00:05:06.330> there<00:05:06.570> so<00:05:06.960> that<00:05:06.990> we

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
here and put a float in there so that we

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.840 
here and put a float in there so that we
don't<00:05:07.320> have<00:05:07.530> the<00:05:07.680> water<00:05:07.830> pressure<00:05:08.310> behind<00:05:08.610> it

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
don't have the water pressure behind it

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.400 
don't have the water pressure behind it
but<00:05:09.000> we<00:05:09.090> just<00:05:09.120> keep<00:05:09.420> this<00:05:09.660> reservoir<00:05:10.200> this

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
but we just keep this reservoir this

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.990 
but we just keep this reservoir this
pipe<00:05:10.650> full<00:05:10.920> of<00:05:11.070> water<00:05:11.310> so<00:05:11.430> it<00:05:11.580> is<00:05:11.730> a<00:05:11.760> little

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
pipe full of water so it is a little

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.060 
pipe full of water so it is a little
float<00:05:12.180> valve<00:05:12.390> in<00:05:12.570> there<00:05:12.690> that<00:05:13.680> would<00:05:13.800> be<00:05:13.890> one

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
float valve in there that would be one

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.550 
float valve in there that would be one
way<00:05:14.220> to<00:05:14.280> resolve<00:05:15.060> the<00:05:15.420> leaking<00:05:15.960> issue<00:05:16.140> as<00:05:16.410> well

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
way to resolve the leaking issue as well

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.620 
way to resolve the leaking issue as well
so<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:17.520> potion<00:05:17.880> equals<00:05:18.090> really<00:05:18.270> don't<00:05:18.390> leak<00:05:18.510> a

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
so the potion equals really don't leak a

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.800 
so the potion equals really don't leak a
lot<00:05:19.220> you<00:05:20.220> know<00:05:20.340> during<00:05:20.610> regular<00:05:21.240> use<00:05:21.510> for<00:05:21.720> the

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
lot you know during regular use for the

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.420 
lot you know during regular use for the
chickens<00:05:22.110> drink<00:05:22.380> from<00:05:22.590> them<00:05:22.800> they<00:05:22.950> do<00:05:23.010> splash

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
chickens drink from them they do splash

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.730 
chickens drink from them they do splash
a<00:05:23.460> little<00:05:23.730> bit<00:05:24.000> but<00:05:24.570> it's<00:05:24.990> really<00:05:25.260> not<00:05:25.350> too<00:05:25.530> bad

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
a little bit but it's really not too bad

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.650 
a little bit but it's really not too bad
I<00:05:25.920> mean<00:05:26.190> over<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.490> whole<00:05:26.580> summer<00:05:27.090> I've<00:05:27.360> had<00:05:27.540> to

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
I mean over the whole summer I've had to

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.630 
I mean over the whole summer I've had to
clean<00:05:27.780> it<00:05:27.870> up<00:05:27.990> one<00:05:28.200> time<00:05:28.350> so<00:05:28.740> not<00:05:29.280> that<00:05:29.460> big<00:05:29.610> a

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
clean it up one time so not that big a

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.250 
clean it up one time so not that big a
video<00:05:29.880> but<00:05:30.090> anyway<00:05:30.660> hopefully<00:05:30.780> this<00:05:31.020> gave<00:05:31.200> you

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
video but anyway hopefully this gave you
