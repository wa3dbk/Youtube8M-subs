00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.770
 d 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.309
 the wii catalog you have had very 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.080
 little movement these last months and it's going 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.270
 it's about time that nintendo left 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.610
 drop some of its jewels I have thrown a 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.410
 look at pikmin 3 with us and go 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.710
 charging while the battery of your 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.710
 I send 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.000
 We did not know anything about the small picking 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.770
 since gamecube and wii times and 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.480
 received the first two titles as 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.670
 adapted classics but the franchise 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.370
 most modern of nintendo has not had a 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.900
 new chapter until today if you played a 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.790
 the first ones already know what this is 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.590
 you are part of the crew of a 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.530
 scout ship that has suffered a 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.050
 accident two of your alpha crew and 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.670
 brittany meet easily 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.640
 but the third the captain olimar 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.769
 remains unaccounted for 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.570
 only mission of alfie brittany will be 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.980
 get to your captain and for that 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.830
 they will have to use the skills 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.960
 of the pikmin there are different types each 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.180
 one has its color and its functions 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.399
 the reds attack strongly and are immune to 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.289
 fire for example the blacks are 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.140
 made of stone and can break walls 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.970
 of glass or ice and the yellow ones 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.710
 they nourish electricity and they can be 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.710
 thrown much farther than the rest 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.810
 up to 100 peppers you can have low 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.850
 our control no more and all of them 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.430
 will respond to the sound of your whistle 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.860
 with a point movement system 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.950
 and click you mark the objective and you command 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.080
 one by one the bugs that you elijÃ¡is in 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.210
 your platoon of course there may be 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.190
 another officer with whistle what you 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.630
 allows to collaborate and greatly expand the 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.229
 possibilities when solving 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.229
 puzzles 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.930
 the ping should always be in some 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.880
 squad or near your ship if it reaches the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.310
 sunset and have forsaken pins 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.530
 forgotten about there you will lose them though 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.450
 they are replaceable there is a kind of 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.250
 chips that come from some plants that 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.679
 You can take your ship to generate 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.030
 more pigments or you can use the bodies 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.800
 of the bugs that jce defeats 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.240
 when they get to the ship they 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.270
 will transform into new pigments that 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.670
 you can unearth the crew by 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.850
 their part needs food and they are the most 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.200
 healthy of the world they only eat fruit so 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.670
 you will have to locate the pieces of 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.920
 fruit that there are in the environments and 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.990
 take them to the ship at the end of each 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.420
 day when it gets dark you will make a 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.730
 balance of everything the fruit has achieved 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.980
 it is transformed into juice and stored and 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.410
 always after a long day it 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.940
 consumes one of those bottles of juice for 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.490
 what the pantry should always be 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.450
 full 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.450
 louis 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.240
 in your hands as always is the 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.490
 super command with wifi screen that 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.320
 will act as a map in any 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.420
 moment of the game you can touch the 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.430
 screen and move your finger across the 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.010
 map the game will be automatically passed 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.720
 and you will have an aerial view of all the 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.090
 field to know where to direct you 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.620
 it will also mark the points of interest 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.510
 like the pieces of fruit that you have 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.480
 seen or the pigments that you have lost 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.400
 out there the rest as we said before is 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.600
 point and order works exactly 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.600
 same as in gamecube 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.540
 you are already seeing what pikmin 3 is a 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.760
 tremendously attractive game is not a 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.590
 graphic revolution but overflowing charm 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.140
 which is the usual for nintendo when 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.790
 the game leaves the mind of miyamoto 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.189
 the textures the lighting have improved 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.510
 a lot with the jump to high definition 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:44.909
 getting close to that realism in plan 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.280
 Honey has shrunk the children that so much 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.500
 we like to timming the rest continues as 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.930
 I was fine, we do not need more 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.489
 In summary I will tell you that they are pieces like 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.409
 These are the ones that the catalog of 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.989
 wii to endure the type with which 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.519
 is about to fall games like this to 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.590
 big will you a console 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.359
 essential for the simple reason 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.879
 which are products that we are not going to obtain 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:09.090
 of any other company we choose to 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:11.909
 giant that we choose mario zelda mario 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.680
 kart donkey kong all that is great and 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.329
 we do not want it to end but nintendo 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.190
 you need to create new games and 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.099
 different as it happened with pikmin in 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.289
 2001 if you have a wii u at home you 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:25.820
 I would say that pikmin 3 is your first purchase 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.820
 forced you will not regret
