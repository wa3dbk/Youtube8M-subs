we're experts our GM foods are safe this
is<00:00:21.589> the<00:00:21.740> same<00:00:21.980> company<00:00:22.490> that<00:00:22.640> told<00:00:23.210> us<00:00:23.330> PCBs

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
is the same company that told us PCBs

were<00:00:24.109> safe<00:00:24.349> Agent<00:00:24.800> Orange<00:00:24.949> was<00:00:25.220> safely<00:00:25.580> to<00:00:25.939> you

were safe Agent Orange was safely to you
safe<00:00:26.300> and<00:00:26.869> now<00:00:27.080> they're<00:00:27.259> telling<00:00:27.560> us<00:00:27.710> that<00:00:27.919> our

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
safe and now they're telling us that our

safe and now they're telling us that our
genetically<00:00:28.699> modified<00:00:29.119> foods<00:00:29.509> are<00:00:29.900> safe<00:00:30.140> and

genetically modified foods are safe and

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:31.870 
genetically modified foods are safe and
how<00:00:30.650> they<00:00:30.800> do<00:00:30.859> it<00:00:31.009> is<00:00:31.220> amazing

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
how they do it is amazing

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.720 
how they do it is amazing
for<00:00:32.180> example<00:00:32.570> what<00:00:32.810> they<00:00:32.900> wanted<00:00:33.140> to<00:00:33.230> say<00:00:33.410> that

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730

when Monsanto wanted to say that their

when Monsanto wanted to say that their
genetically<00:00:45.379> modified<00:00:45.890> soy<00:00:46.219> was

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
genetically modified soy was

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.360 
genetically modified soy was
substantially<00:00:48.079> equivalent<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:48.559> non-gm<00:00:49.129> soy

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
substantially equivalent to non-gm soy

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.000 
substantially equivalent to non-gm soy
they<00:00:50.210> left<00:00:50.449> key<00:00:50.750> data<00:00:51.050> out<00:00:51.320> of<00:00:51.379> their<00:00:51.710> study

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
they left key data out of their study

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.919 
they left key data out of their study
which<00:00:52.280> showed<00:00:52.519> that<00:00:52.550> their<00:00:52.820> GM<00:00:53.059> soy<00:00:53.329> had<00:00:53.809> as

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
which showed that their GM soy had as

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.840 
which showed that their GM soy had as
much<00:00:54.050> as<00:00:54.109> seven<00:00:54.590> times<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:55.129> amount<00:00:55.160> of<00:00:55.609> a

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
much as seven times the amount of a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.389 
much as seven times the amount of a
known<00:00:56.090> allergen<00:00:56.719> here's<00:00:57.289> my<00:00:57.440> favorite<00:00:57.710> when

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
known allergen here's my favorite when

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.310 
known allergen here's my favorite when
Monsanto<00:00:58.879> was<00:00:59.239> trying<00:00:59.600> to<00:00:59.719> introduce<00:01:00.079> their

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
Monsanto was trying to introduce their

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.099 
Monsanto was trying to introduce their
genetically<00:01:00.769> modified<00:01:01.309> high<00:01:02.000> lysine<00:01:02.719> ham

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
genetically modified high lysine ham

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.439 
genetically modified high lysine ham
they<00:01:03.649> said<00:01:03.859> that<00:01:03.980> this<00:01:04.070> new<00:01:04.129> protein<00:01:04.850> has<00:01:05.420> a

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
they said that this new protein has a

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.480 
they said that this new protein has a
history<00:01:05.960> of<00:01:06.050> safe<00:01:06.410> use<00:01:06.710> in<00:01:06.980> the<00:01:07.100> food<00:01:07.310> supply

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
history of safe use in the food supply

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.420 
history of safe use in the food supply
so<00:01:08.270> it's<00:01:08.450> safe<00:01:08.720> because<00:01:09.500> this<00:01:09.830> protein<00:01:10.250> is

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
so it's safe because this protein is

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.090 
so it's safe because this protein is
naturally<00:01:11.000> found<00:01:11.210> in<00:01:11.420> soil<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:12.050> we<00:01:12.560> obviously

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
naturally found in soil and we obviously

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.070 
naturally found in soil and we obviously
eat<00:01:13.310> soil<00:01:13.700> in<00:01:13.910> the<00:01:14.030> residues<00:01:14.450> on<00:01:14.630> fruits<00:01:14.660> and

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
eat soil in the residues on fruits and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.530 
eat soil in the residues on fruits and
vegetables<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:15.890> a<00:01:16.190> scientist<00:01:17.060> called<00:01:17.270> their

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
vegetables so a scientist called their

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.750 
vegetables so a scientist called their
bluff<00:01:17.570> and<00:01:17.960> figured<00:01:18.260> out<00:01:18.350> how<00:01:18.590> much<00:01:18.830> corn<00:01:19.310> an

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
bluff and figured out how much corn an

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.030 
bluff and figured out how much corn an
average<00:01:20.210> male<00:01:20.480> American<00:01:21.020> would<00:01:21.170> eat<00:01:21.350> and<00:01:21.590> how

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
average male American would eat and how

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.160 
average male American would eat and how
much<00:01:22.220> of<00:01:22.250> that<00:01:22.370> protein<00:01:22.910> he<00:01:23.120> repeated<00:01:23.540> and

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
much of that protein he repeated and

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.410 
much of that protein he repeated and
then<00:01:24.320> calculated<00:01:24.950> how<00:01:25.070> much<00:01:25.250> soil<00:01:25.700> he'd<00:01:26.180> have

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
then calculated how much soil he'd have

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.840 
then calculated how much soil he'd have
to<00:01:26.570> eat<00:01:26.600> someone<00:01:27.260> would<00:01:27.380> have<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.680> eat<00:01:27.890> 22

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
to eat someone would have to eat 22

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.920 
to eat someone would have to eat 22
thousand<00:01:29.630> pounds<00:01:30.140> of<00:01:30.290> soil<00:01:30.640> every<00:01:31.640> second<00:01:32.090> 24

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
thousand pounds of soil every second 24

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.980 
thousand pounds of soil every second 24
hours<00:01:33.440> a<00:01:33.470> day<00:01:33.590> these<00:01:34.580> guys<00:01:34.910> have<00:01:35.240> bad<00:01:35.420> science

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
hours a day these guys have bad science

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.200 
hours a day these guys have bad science
down<00:01:36.230> to<00:01:36.470> a<00:01:36.500> science<00:01:36.800> it's<00:01:37.370> ridiculous

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
down to a science it's ridiculous

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.210 
down to a science it's ridiculous
ridiculous<00:01:38.840> they<00:01:39.140> used<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:39.440> wrong<00:01:39.650> control

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
ridiculous they used the wrong control

safe that Agent Orange was safe we need

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.220 
safe that Agent Orange was safe we need
to<00:01:52.100> look<00:01:52.250> at<00:01:52.430> independent<00:01:53.300> studies<00:01:53.660> by
