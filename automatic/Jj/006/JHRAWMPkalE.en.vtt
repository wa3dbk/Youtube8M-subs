00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.840
 hello to all so after you have 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.700
 introduced the high-end and middle 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.770
 home sony with the xperia of 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.209
 luxury by s &amp; p today we're going 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.830
 tackle the low end that is 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.020
 represented by the experience I have here 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.600
 we will see immediately what's 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.740
 you on video yes as usual we're going 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.050
 start with a small unpacking 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.119
 so of course it's the box that 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.539
 is given to hens and therefore 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.000
 it has happened which is putting into mise en 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.950
 for sale as a little hardcover 1 like 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.350
 a nanar once and that this dictionary is 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:42.329
 so the phone that is there in 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.329
 a little 20 little arrangements like that 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.809
 then we have monster headphones 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.829
 a little better than that but I judge 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.020
 show you what's in the box 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.449
 then the headphones just like for the 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.050
 xperia sp they sacrificed a little luxury 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.329
 and low end 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.559
 they will not put any of the intra 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.769
 auricular one let earphones are 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.359
 still good quality a word I I 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.550
 have no complaints about it and hop 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:09.310
 then the charger as usual so it's 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:13.240
 first usb micro usb cable then the 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.150
 small port the small the small block with 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.860
 adoc then 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.030
 ok so then we can do a tour of 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.710
 the camera after making a tour of 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.660
 the box 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.320
 so what you need to know already is 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.860
 that the device 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.970
 it's 4.3 inches next it's not it 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.340
 is not she is not very tall but 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.140
 good it remains that remains low-end 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.720
 so he could not they could not 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.040
 to have fun on the specifications the spinnaker 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.950
 situation in the city and we give them to you 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.630
 right now there in the corner of the 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.350
 video i'm not going all this game not 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.660
 come back on everything 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.070
 so first here at the volume buttons 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:50.800
 sorry pen - the on / off button name that 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.230
 go out a little bit here is the button 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.630
 camera we will come back from elsewhere 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.900
 so here it's the microphone with then the 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.020
 loud speaker 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.820
 so here the micro usb port a key so 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.580
 we have a camera so life 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.819
 megapixels with the led flash a second 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.230
 microphone to cover the noise 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.600
 the jack on the top 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.370
 and not before there's not much 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.500
 more if not a front camera 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.790
 so we will still go there 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.270
 our little criticism at the level of 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.790
 design 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.700
 we will find a pretty enough plastic 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.510
 brilliant that is pretty cheap in the front 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.800
 with imitation edges to him as 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.930
 we could have found for example on 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.200
 the bow is salty at the time my era 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.510
 it's in 2011 17 and imitations to lula on 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.850
 the can give a nice enough side 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.220
 the crate designer liked it but 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.130
 must know that it will be done quickly 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.860
 crumble and saturday but then it reinforces 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.320
 really the cheap side 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.160
 after behind we cogit so we have a 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.550
 plastic a good softouch plastic that 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.690
 is still much less rigid than the 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.720
 than him that one could 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.920
 find on the on the xperia is so 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.630
 at the level of the overcoat there is no 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.330
 really of reason linger carmon has 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.880
 already seen up and down across with 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.390
 lux psp or the zen experience 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.780
 so it ships version 4.2 jelly 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.130
 bean with always the same management with 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.340
 the same the same launcher 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.130
 this is the theme management etc no 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.740
 applied news appeared with them 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.060
 with them this terminal maybe this is where 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.860
 that I discovered the other day 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.110
 maybe she's already landed on 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.960
 the other rider by sony good I do not know 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.680
 not at all this drawing just go 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.000
 a rider just want but I do not 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.300
 did not find them on but on my 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.190
 other terminals sony but 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.750
 I have not I do not have the utility so I have 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.900
 not searched to download by pc 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.920
 companion here is writing then we have 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.500
 the impression that it's pretty big 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.210
 suddenly we are on a terminal at its 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.470
 little ones you will see a crack at 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:06.070
 the booting animation you are so 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.290
 you acquire the logo 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.970
 sony is really getting really big 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.600
 and we notice race always by 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.440
 example on the lock screen 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:17.440
 also the time is really impressive 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.510
 impressed that a small detail alone 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.459
 something that changes compared to others 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.500
 sony terminals that we could test is 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.620
 the management of multitasking have frozen 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.530
 really a multitasking management that 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.940
 could say to the old so here is ya 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.900
 not two there is no word 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.510
 the appellant sees that there is no 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.980
 small bar of small ap 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.450
 but there is none he does not really 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.240
 useful because so we are 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.280
 on a 2.4-inch screen is not the 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.620
 place of or not quite the place of 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.390
 posters and month after you will tell me the 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.720
 update jelly bean brings 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.060
 experience with small ap 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.820
 is on such a similar screen 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.440
 that's it then then at the level 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.700
 of the overlay I think we can 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.930
 has nothing else to add 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.510
 I think we went around 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.750
 it's fair to say that this terminal there and 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.640
 he is he embeds a processor so of 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.470
 at qualcomm but it's a double heart 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.540
 1 gigahertz so on a processor 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.010
 really dead could qualify as low 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.350
 of range 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:20.050
 otherwise of medium range but it offers 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.640
 very interesting performances for 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.770
 a low end terminal but I did not 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.900
 no I did not have the particular lake the 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.960
 only there I have it when I go I 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.910
 move quickly here pretty quickly 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.260
 in the drom yeah but there you 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.010
 see it's still it's still 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.960
 super fluid in play is because I have 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.790
 today 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.260
 good we forget but we must 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.440
 notice that he is very very proud of this 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.520
 terminal we will be able to conclude 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.160
 by the way now right now on 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.340
 this on this phone 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:54.250
 talk about it saying that he's supposed 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.050
 be oriented photos - after that it's 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.090
 normal that sony puts forward his 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.770
 arguments there because we have to sell a good 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.940
 terminal of which they were told 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.410
 that they were oriented for the photo there 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:06.520
 embeds exactly the same sensor as 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:08.140
 the xperia the cosplay asp by 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.580
 example is to be the same 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.740
 remarks for the country experience the 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.710
 pictures are good but we had noticed 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.140
 of three worries of two hues with 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.440
 problems again in the ranks 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.970
 low light conditions 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.400
 Yet with existing flash but that's 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.860
 sure many terminal many 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.230
 time terminals for me who are 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.420
 equipped with flash but which does not offer 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:37.210
 to decline photos of very very 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:38.310
 good qualities here are in conditions 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.690
 low light 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.460
 so to conclude we could say that 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.440
 it's a terminal that is really very 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.420
 interesting for in to register as 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.010
 that we learned at 300 euros now we 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.230
 can find old terminals like 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.670
 I do not know me galaxy s2 who does not 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:55.660
 could still that could be 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:58.270
 widely placed in one in the range 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:01.090
 wood in the mid-range for the for 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.680
 the same for the same price to you closely 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.600
 it's up to you to see me I like 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.190
 this terminal the only concern but heard 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.680
 it's his design but he could not 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.900
 really suggest us better points for 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.070
 such a price you will see that prices 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.990
 will quickly fall we are already made 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.050
 almost 250 euros as I said everything 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.050
 on time 

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:21.010
 so notice to lovers of low terminals 

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.010
 range but who they are 

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:27.030
 do very well I propose you 

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.030
 the xperia she
