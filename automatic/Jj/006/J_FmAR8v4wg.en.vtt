00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.220 
attempt for a major our murse world but
the<00:02:00.260> requirements<00:02:00.860> are<00:02:00.980> pretty<00:02:01.460> high<00:02:02.230> five

the requirements are pretty high five
thousand<00:02:04.040> seafaring<00:02:04.670> which<00:02:05.330> I<00:02:05.600> probably

thousand seafaring which I probably

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.840 
thousand seafaring which I probably
can't<00:02:06.290> get<00:02:06.440> anywhere<00:02:06.800> near<00:02:07.100> that<00:02:07.160> amount<00:02:07.520> and

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
can't get anywhere near that amount and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.990 
can't get anywhere near that amount and
it<00:02:08.300> takes<00:02:08.569> two<00:02:08.810> and<00:02:08.840> a<00:02:09.110> half<00:02:09.319> hours<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:09.619> return

seafaring as high as possible which
isn't<00:02:28.099> that<00:02:28.250> high<00:02:28.459> since<00:02:28.760> i<00:02:28.909> don't<00:02:29.150> actually

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
isn't that high since i don't actually

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.420 
isn't that high since i don't actually
have<00:02:29.659> access<00:02:29.989> to<00:02:30.140> that<00:02:30.170> good<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.769> characters

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
have access to that good of characters

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.850 
have access to that good of characters
yet<00:02:31.700> which<00:02:32.060> i<00:02:32.390> was<00:02:33.049> only<00:02:33.200> able<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.530> get<00:02:33.739> about

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
yet which i was only able to get about

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.339 
yet which i was only able to get about
thirty<00:02:34.430> percent<00:02:34.579> that's<00:02:35.480> about<00:02:35.840> as<00:02:35.989> high<00:02:36.140> as<00:02:36.260> I

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
thirty percent that's about as high as I

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.220 
thirty percent that's about as high as I
could<00:02:36.409> get<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:38.420> at<00:02:38.510> this<00:02:38.629> point<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:39.019> have<00:02:39.049> no

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
could get it so at this point I have no

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.830 
could get it so at this point I have no
idea<00:02:39.560> if<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.129> voyage<00:02:40.459> will<00:02:40.940> like<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.540> voyage

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
idea if the voyage will like the voyage

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.509 
idea if the voyage will like the voyage
forward<00:02:42.200> or<00:02:42.319> scroll<00:02:42.620> will<00:02:42.890> disappear<00:02:43.400> the

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
forward or scroll will disappear the

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.339 
forward or scroll will disappear the
next<00:02:43.549> day<00:02:43.940> i'm<00:02:44.120> not<00:02:44.269> sure<00:02:44.420> if<00:02:44.629> it<00:02:44.780> carries<00:02:45.170> over

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
next day i'm not sure if it carries over

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.349 
next day i'm not sure if it carries over
but<00:02:45.859> i<00:02:45.890> want<00:02:46.159> to<00:02:46.220> try<00:02:46.459> it<00:02:46.489> out<00:02:46.640> today<00:02:46.849> just

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
but i want to try it out today just

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.720 
but i want to try it out today just
because<00:02:47.930> if<00:02:48.319> it<00:02:48.470> doesn't<00:02:48.680> at<00:02:49.010> least<00:02:49.069> i<00:02:49.400> tried

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
because if it doesn't at least i tried

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.080 
because if it doesn't at least i tried
for<00:02:49.970> it<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.599> thirty<00:02:51.170> percent<00:02:51.530> is<00:02:51.709> as<00:02:52.310> good<00:02:52.909> as

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
for it and thirty percent is as good as

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.270 
for it and thirty percent is as good as
I<00:02:53.209> could<00:02:53.269> get<00:02:53.569> so<00:02:53.989> I'll<00:02:54.349> find<00:02:54.650> out<00:02:54.799> in<00:02:54.950> two<00:02:55.099> and

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
I could get so I'll find out in two and

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.210 
I could get so I'll find out in two and
a<00:02:55.310> half<00:02:55.489> hours<00:02:55.760> if<00:02:55.909> it<00:02:56.030> succeeds<00:02:57.010> now<00:02:58.010> here's

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
a half hours if it succeeds now here's

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.890 
a half hours if it succeeds now here's
something<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:58.579> don't<00:02:58.760> understand<00:02:59.269> too<00:02:59.540> much<00:02:59.750> at

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
something I don't understand too much at

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.720 
something I don't understand too much at
the<00:02:59.989> moment<00:03:00.079> this<00:03:00.409> is<00:03:00.620> done<00:03:01.280> on<00:03:01.430> my<00:03:01.549> noob

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
the moment this is done on my noob

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.119 
the moment this is done on my noob
account<00:03:02.030> so<00:03:02.239> it<00:03:02.389> doesn't<00:03:02.659> have<00:03:02.840> all<00:03:03.049> 99<00:03:03.709> cents

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
account so it doesn't have all 99 cents

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.309 
account so it doesn't have all 99 cents
but<00:03:04.430> when<00:03:04.849> I<00:03:04.879> sent<00:03:05.269> out<00:03:05.389> my<00:03:05.480> first<00:03:05.900> special

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
but when I sent out my first special

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.250 
but when I sent out my first special
voyage<00:03:06.709> for<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.250> major<00:03:07.459> 01<00:03:08.030> it<00:03:08.840> took<00:03:09.049> away<00:03:09.230> all

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
voyage for the major 01 it took away all

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.059 
voyage for the major 01 it took away all
the<00:03:09.440> others<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.430> special<00:03:10.940> voyages<00:03:11.269> on<00:03:11.450> my<00:03:11.569> list

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
the others to special voyages on my list

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.649 
the others to special voyages on my list
this<00:03:13.069> happened<00:03:13.459> yesterday<00:03:13.489> as<00:03:13.970> well<00:03:14.000> so<00:03:14.569> I'm

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
this happened yesterday as well so I'm

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:16.000 
this happened yesterday as well so I'm
thinking<00:03:15.019> it<00:03:15.109> might<00:03:15.230> have<00:03:15.409> something<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:15.769> do

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
thinking it might have something to do

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.460 
thinking it might have something to do
with<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.400> skill<00:03:16.670> level<00:03:16.700> of<00:03:17.049> course<00:03:18.049> this<00:03:18.290> is

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
with the skill level of course this is

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.439 
with the skill level of course this is
just<00:03:18.500> speculation<00:03:18.829> until<00:03:19.459> we<00:03:20.090> get<00:03:20.269> more

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:20.449 
just speculation until we get more

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:22.449 
just speculation until we get more
information<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:21.680> after<00:03:21.769> sending<00:03:22.129> out<00:03:22.310> my

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
information so after sending out my

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.280 
information so after sending out my
first<00:03:22.669> special<00:03:23.180> void<00:03:23.359> I<00:03:23.599> had<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:23.810> standard

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
first special void I had a standard

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.129 
first special void I had a standard
voice<00:03:24.560> that<00:03:25.190> would<00:03:25.639> unlock<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.329> siren<00:03:26.780> shell

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
voice that would unlock the siren shell

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
the way if you have sounds on which is

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.759 
the way if you have sounds on which is
the<00:03:44.030> second<00:03:44.419> one<00:03:44.540> from<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.750> top<00:03:45.019> you'll<00:03:45.410> hear

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
the second one from the top you'll hear

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.470 
the second one from the top you'll hear
a<00:03:45.799> bell<00:03:46.220> when<00:03:46.609> the<00:03:46.760> ships<00:03:46.970> have<00:03:47.150> returned

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
a bell when the ships have returned

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.289 
a bell when the ships have returned
which<00:03:47.690> is<00:03:47.870> useful<00:03:48.109> if<00:03:48.620> you're<00:03:48.949> AFK<00:03:49.489> and<00:03:50.030> you

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
which is useful if you're AFK and you

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.970 
which is useful if you're AFK and you
have<00:03:50.419> sounds<00:03:50.720> on<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:52.480> i<00:03:53.680> didn't<00:03:54.680> manage<00:03:54.949> to

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
have sounds on and i didn't manage to

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.869 
have sounds on and i didn't manage to
get<00:03:55.970> a<00:03:56.180> Maitre<00:03:56.780> piece<00:03:57.019> it<00:03:57.290> failed<00:03:57.799> ah<00:03:58.190> let's

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
get a Maitre piece it failed ah let's

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.379 
get a Maitre piece it failed ah let's
see<00:03:59.000> I<00:03:59.449> lost<00:03:59.900> 150<00:04:00.829> bamboo<00:04:01.400> just<00:04:01.849> to<00:04:02.000> fix<00:04:02.209> the

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
see I lost 150 bamboo just to fix the

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.990 
see I lost 150 bamboo just to fix the
ship<00:04:02.449> from<00:04:03.199> the<00:04:03.500> damages<00:04:03.949> but<00:04:04.250> I<00:04:04.609> guess<00:04:04.879> the

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
ship from the damages but I guess the

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000 
ship from the damages but I guess the
upside<00:04:05.060> is<00:04:05.269> i<00:04:05.480> didn't<00:04:05.840> lose<00:04:06.079> any<00:04:06.319> sailors<00:04:06.799> so<00:04:06.980> i

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
upside is i didn't lose any sailors so i

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.970 
upside is i didn't lose any sailors so i
guess<00:04:07.250> that's<00:04:07.459> good<00:04:07.959> but<00:04:08.959> i<00:04:09.019> mean<00:04:09.409> like<00:04:09.590> thirty

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
guess that's good but i mean like thirty

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.580 
guess that's good but i mean like thirty
percent<00:04:10.370> that<00:04:10.940> probably<00:04:11.810> wasn't<00:04:12.109> going<00:04:12.379> to<00:04:12.470> go

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
percent that probably wasn't going to go

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.680 
percent that probably wasn't going to go
well<00:04:13.150> would<00:04:14.150> have<00:04:14.239> been<00:04:14.269> nice<00:04:14.449> to<00:04:14.659> have

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
well would have been nice to have

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.779 
well would have been nice to have
actually<00:04:15.079> got<00:04:15.199> something<00:04:15.530> but<00:04:15.739> oh<00:04:15.949> well<00:04:16.190> so

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
actually got something but oh well so

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.120 
actually got something but oh well so
four<00:04:17.209> minutes<00:04:17.449> later<00:04:17.630> i<00:04:17.959> get<00:04:18.349> my<00:04:18.590> second<00:04:18.979> ship

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
four minutes later i get my second ship

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.879 
four minutes later i get my second ship
back<00:04:19.310> and<00:04:19.579> i<00:04:20.570> was<00:04:20.690> able<00:04:20.780> to<00:04:20.959> get<00:04:21.139> the<00:04:21.199> captain

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
back and i was able to get the captain

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.120 
back and i was able to get the captain
trade<00:04:22.159> eager<00:04:22.430> which<00:04:22.880> i<00:04:23.150> guess<00:04:23.539> is<00:04:23.800> for<00:04:24.800> morale

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
trade eager which i guess is for morale

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.100 
trade eager which i guess is for morale
i<00:04:25.580> think<00:04:26.180> it<00:04:26.300> boosts<00:04:26.479> morale<00:04:26.690> i'm<00:04:26.960> not

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
i think it boosts morale i'm not

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.360 
i think it boosts morale i'm not
entirely<00:04:27.289> sure<00:04:27.500> on<00:04:27.680> that

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
entirely sure on that

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.159 
entirely sure on that
and<00:04:28.490> each<00:04:28.729> captain<00:04:29.150> can<00:04:29.389> have<00:04:29.600> up<00:04:29.780> to<00:04:29.810> four

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
and each captain can have up to four

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.020 
and each captain can have up to four
traits<00:04:30.470> on<00:04:30.710> them<00:04:30.830> from<00:04:31.310> what<00:04:31.460> I<00:04:31.490> know<00:04:31.610> although

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
traits on them from what I know although

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.020 
traits on them from what I know although
I<00:04:32.240> will<00:04:32.419> only<00:04:32.660> know<00:04:33.260> of<00:04:33.290> a<00:04:33.620> few<00:04:33.860> traits<00:04:34.250> so<00:04:34.820> this

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
I will only know of a few traits so this

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.790 
I will only know of a few traits so this
pretty<00:04:35.180> much<00:04:35.300> covers<00:04:35.810> the<00:04:36.020> good<00:04:36.470> things<00:04:36.680> that

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
pretty much covers the good things that

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.800 
pretty much covers the good things that
happen<00:04:37.190> since<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.880> first<00:04:38.360> day<00:04:38.540> there<00:04:38.750> are

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
happen since the first day there are

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.110 
happen since the first day there are
random<00:04:39.500> events<00:04:40.100> that<00:04:40.430> can<00:04:40.610> happen<00:04:40.729> in<00:04:41.030> the

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
random events that can happen in the

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.629 
map from completing random events you
get<00:05:15.020> these<00:05:15.199> kind<00:05:15.620> of<00:05:15.680> effects<00:05:16.099> these<00:05:16.340> could<00:05:16.550> be

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
get these kind of effects these could be

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.330 
get these kind of effects these could be
added<00:05:16.970> to<00:05:17.120> your<00:05:17.150> boat<00:05:17.539> and<00:05:17.900> crew<00:05:18.530> it<00:05:18.830> boosts

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
added to your boat and crew it boosts

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.279 
added to your boat and crew it boosts
the<00:05:19.460> sense<00:05:19.729> of<00:05:20.000> like<00:05:20.270> seafaring<00:05:20.960> morale

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
the sense of like seafaring morale

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.439 
the sense of like seafaring morale
combat<00:05:21.979> depends<00:05:22.610> which<00:05:22.759> one<00:05:22.910> yet<00:05:23.180> but

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449 
combat depends which one yet but

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.510 
combat depends which one yet but
basically<00:05:23.780> just<00:05:24.110> boosts<00:05:24.590> the<00:05:24.830> different

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
basically just boosts the different

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.850 
basically just boosts the different
variables<00:05:26.030> I<00:05:26.240> think<00:05:26.660> one<00:05:27.050> of<00:05:27.080> them<00:05:27.259> has<00:05:27.470> speed

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
variables I think one of them has speed

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.309 
variables I think one of them has speed
since<00:05:28.310> these<00:05:28.880> don't<00:05:29.300> take<00:05:29.479> too<00:05:29.630> long<00:05:29.750> to<00:05:29.810> do<00:05:30.080> i

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.319 
since these don't take too long to do i

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:32.170 
since these don't take too long to do i
would<00:05:30.560> highly<00:05:30.770> suggest<00:05:31.039> doing<00:05:31.639> these<00:05:31.849> if<00:05:32.060> you

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
would highly suggest doing these if you

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.990 
would highly suggest doing these if you
ever<00:05:32.300> get<00:05:32.539> them<00:05:33.190> it<00:05:34.190> will<00:05:34.340> really<00:05:34.580> help<00:05:34.789> when

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
ever get them it will really help when

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.300 
ever get them it will really help when
you're<00:05:35.120> going<00:05:35.240> for<00:05:35.479> that<00:05:35.569> one<00:05:35.840> scroll<00:05:36.199> p<00:05:36.440> so

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
you're going for that one scroll p so

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.309 
you're going for that one scroll p so
that<00:05:37.819> pretty<00:05:37.940> much<00:05:38.060> covers<00:05:38.300> it<00:05:38.509> for<00:05:38.659> this

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:39.319 
that pretty much covers it for this

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:41.499 
that pretty much covers it for this
video<00:05:39.789> remember<00:05:40.789> that<00:05:41.090> there's<00:05:41.389> no

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:41.509 
video remember that there's no

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:43.360 
video remember that there's no
requirements<00:05:42.139> for<00:05:42.289> Meg<00:05:42.470> so<00:05:42.740> no<00:05:42.949> matter<00:05:43.159> what

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
requirements for Meg so no matter what

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.909 
requirements for Meg so no matter what
your<00:05:43.849> level<00:05:44.210> is<00:05:44.360> you<00:05:44.900> could<00:05:45.259> get<00:05:45.560> the<00:05:45.710> weekly

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
your level is you could get the weekly

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.240 
your level is you could get the weekly
XP<00:05:46.729> lamp<00:05:46.970> at<00:05:47.150> coins<00:05:47.509> from<00:05:47.810> megs<00:05:48.110> now<00:05:48.560> it<00:05:48.800> resets

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
XP lamp at coins from megs now it resets

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.510 
XP lamp at coins from megs now it resets
all<00:05:49.400> wednesday<00:05:50.530> then<00:05:51.530> I<00:05:51.590> tried<00:05:52.009> for<00:05:52.220> damaged

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
all wednesday then I tried for damaged

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.350 
all wednesday then I tried for damaged
scroll<00:05:52.940> but<00:05:53.449> I<00:05:53.900> mean<00:05:54.710> thirty<00:05:54.979> percent<00:05:55.430> I<00:05:55.699> guess

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
scroll but I mean thirty percent I guess

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.820 
scroll but I mean thirty percent I guess
that's<00:05:56.539> kind<00:05:56.870> of<00:05:56.900> wishful<00:05:57.080> thinking<00:05:57.620> if<00:05:57.740> I

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
that's kind of wishful thinking if I

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.439 
that's kind of wishful thinking if I
could<00:05:58.009> achieve<00:05:58.280> that<00:05:58.430> but<00:05:58.699> I<00:05:58.729> didn't<00:05:59.090> get<00:05:59.180> it<00:05:59.300> I

00:05:59.439 --> 00:05:59.449 
could achieve that but I didn't get it I

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:01.960 
could achieve that but I didn't get it I
did<00:06:00.110> get<00:06:00.349> the<00:06:00.500> eager<00:06:00.830> trade<00:06:01.190> on<00:06:01.400> my<00:06:01.550> captain

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
did get the eager trade on my captain

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.969 
did get the eager trade on my captain
and<00:06:02.120> if<00:06:02.690> you<00:06:02.780> get<00:06:02.930> any<00:06:03.110> random<00:06:03.470> events<00:06:03.800> it's

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979 
and if you get any random events it's

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.339 
and if you get any random events it's
actually<00:06:04.819> pretty<00:06:05.210> good<00:06:05.479> to<00:06:05.930> use<00:06:06.050> it<00:06:06.229> because

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:06.349 
actually pretty good to use it because

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:08.320 
actually pretty good to use it because
you<00:06:06.590> get<00:06:06.740> these<00:06:06.889> bonuses<00:06:07.520> bonus<00:06:08.000> effects

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
you get these bonuses bonus effects

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.390 
you get these bonuses bonus effects
which<00:06:08.659> could<00:06:09.169> really<00:06:09.409> help<00:06:09.590> if<00:06:09.919> you<00:06:10.130> maybe

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
which could really help if you maybe

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.089 
which could really help if you maybe
need<00:06:10.699> that<00:06:10.880> little<00:06:11.210> more<00:06:11.570> boost<00:06:11.840> so<00:06:12.710> that

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:13.099 
need that little more boost so that

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:14.529 
need that little more boost so that
pretty<00:06:13.190> much<00:06:13.310> sums<00:06:13.580> it<00:06:13.729> up<00:06:13.789> for<00:06:14.000> this<00:06:14.060> video<00:06:14.389> as

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
pretty much sums it up for this video as

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.390 
pretty much sums it up for this video as
always<00:06:15.139> thank<00:06:15.710> you<00:06:15.860> very<00:06:16.070> much<00:06:16.190> for<00:06:16.219> watching
