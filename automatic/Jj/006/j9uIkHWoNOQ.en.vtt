00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
ahead and talk a little bit about the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.550 
ahead and talk a little bit about the
case<00:01:08.549> there's<00:01:08.820> not<00:01:08.970> too<00:01:09.210> much<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.600> say<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.350> as

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
case there's not too much to say but as

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.560 
case there's not too much to say but as
you<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.920> see<00:01:10.979> here<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.670> extremely

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
you can see here it is extremely

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.600 
you can see here it is extremely
minimalistic<00:01:13.140> it's<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.770> snap<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.250> clear

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
minimalistic it's just a snap on clear

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.190 
minimalistic it's just a snap on clear
case<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.119> has<00:01:15.270> cutouts<00:01:15.659> for<00:01:15.810> all<00:01:16.049> your

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
case that has cutouts for all your

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.350 
case that has cutouts for all your
different<00:01:16.320> ports<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.299> see

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
different ports and as you can see

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.630 
different ports and as you can see
installation<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.380> very<00:01:19.409> easy<00:01:19.799> -<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.369> just<00:01:20.490> a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
installation is very easy - it's just a

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.210 
installation is very easy - it's just a
snap<00:01:20.880> on<00:01:21.030> case<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.990> my<00:01:22.170> tests<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.770> think<00:01:23.070> it's

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
snap on case in my tests I think it's

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.890 
snap on case in my tests I think it's
easier<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.520> put<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> left<00:01:24.210> side<00:01:24.420> first<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
easier to put in the left side first and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.109 
easier to put in the left side first and
then<00:01:25.170> snap<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.400> that's<00:01:26.640> just<00:01:26.939> my

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
then snap it in but that's just my

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.760 
then snap it in but that's just my
