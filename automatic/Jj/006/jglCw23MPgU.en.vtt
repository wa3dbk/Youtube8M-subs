00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.150 
year uh these are the same size speakers
the<00:04:49.790> lowriders<00:04:50.180> 40<00:04:50.540> millimeters<00:04:50.990> I<00:04:51.710> was<00:04:52.040> just

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
the lowriders 40 millimeters I was just

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.590 
the lowriders 40 millimeters I was just
in<00:04:52.280> your<00:04:52.370> four<00:04:52.580> centimeters<00:04:53.000> and<00:04:53.210> that's

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
in your four centimeters and that's

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.820 
in your four centimeters and that's
pretty<00:04:53.870> good<00:04:54.020> size<00:04:54.230> for<00:04:54.440> a<00:04:54.500> little<00:04:54.710> headphone

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
pretty good size for a little headphone

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.600 
pretty good size for a little headphone
they<00:04:55.460> adjust<00:04:55.940> using<00:04:56.780> these<00:04:56.900> brackets<00:04:57.860> here<00:04:58.160> on

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
they adjust using these brackets here on

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.980 
they adjust using these brackets here on
both<00:04:58.910> sides<00:04:59.210> uh<00:05:00.400> and<00:05:01.400> yeah<00:05:02.210> I<00:05:02.420> think<00:05:02.840> it's

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
both sides uh and yeah I think it's

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.330 
both sides uh and yeah I think it's
either<00:05:03.140> made<00:05:03.410> out<00:05:03.560> of<00:05:03.680> like<00:05:03.800> a<00:05:03.830> high<00:05:04.280> quality

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
either made out of like a high quality

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.700 
either made out of like a high quality
plastic<00:05:05.180> or<00:05:05.390> like<00:05:05.570> a<00:05:05.600> hardened<00:05:06.350> leather

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
plastic or like a hardened leather

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.340 
plastic or like a hardened leather
something<00:05:07.310> like<00:05:07.430> that<00:05:07.610> I<00:05:07.790> don't<00:05:07.970> know<00:05:08.060> um<00:05:08.350> but

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
something like that I don't know um but

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.660 
something like that I don't know um but
it<00:05:11.530> stretches<00:05:12.530> out<00:05:12.860> very<00:05:13.190> well<00:05:13.370> so<00:05:13.490> you<00:05:13.550> can

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
it stretches out very well so you can

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.510 
it stretches out very well so you can
put<00:05:13.760> them<00:05:13.880> on<00:05:13.940> your<00:05:14.030> head<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.810> cable<00:05:15.350> is<00:05:15.520> like

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
put them on your head the cable is like

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.130 
put them on your head the cable is like
this<00:05:17.860> wound<00:05:18.860> it's<00:05:19.310> braided<00:05:20.090> a<00:05:20.210> braided<00:05:20.750> cable

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
this wound it's braided a braided cable

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.320 
this wound it's braided a braided cable
cover<00:05:21.530> instead<00:05:22.280> of<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:22.490> plasticky<00:05:23.090> rubber

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
cover instead of the plasticky rubber

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.710 
cover instead of the plasticky rubber
that's<00:05:23.570> on<00:05:23.690> most<00:05:23.930> headphones<00:05:25.480> yeah<00:05:26.480> I'm

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
that's on most headphones yeah I'm

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.450 
that's on most headphones yeah I'm
loving<00:05:27.080> these<00:05:27.170> the<00:05:27.440> base<00:05:27.710> is<00:05:27.980> good<00:05:28.220> in<00:05:28.340> these

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
loving these the base is good in these

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.970 
loving these the base is good in these
especially<00:05:29.090> for<00:05:29.510> what<00:05:29.630> they<00:05:29.780> are<00:05:29.830> and<00:05:30.830> the

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
especially for what they are and the

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.010 
especially for what they are and the
sound<00:05:31.220> quality<00:05:31.310> is<00:05:31.550> great<00:05:31.730> also<00:05:32.360> my<00:05:32.810> only

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
sound quality is great also my only

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.300 
sound quality is great also my only
problem<00:05:33.410> would<00:05:34.280> be<00:05:34.600> you<00:05:35.600> can<00:05:35.750> see<00:05:35.930> cable<00:05:36.500> stick

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
problem would be you can see cable stick

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.790 
problem would be you can see cable stick
it<00:05:37.430> out<00:05:37.550> right<00:05:37.790> there<00:05:38.090> and<00:05:38.560> that<00:05:39.560> is<00:05:39.590> because

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
it out right there and that is because

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.940 
it out right there and that is because
it<00:05:40.400> only<00:05:40.760> goes<00:05:41.030> in<00:05:41.330> one<00:05:41.390> ear<00:05:42.080> cup<00:05:42.350> the<00:05:42.680> cable

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
it only goes in one ear cup the cable

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:43.780 
it only goes in one ear cup the cable
does<00:05:43.070> and<00:05:43.250> then<00:05:43.340> it<00:05:43.430> goes<00:05:43.490> through<00:05:43.700> the

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
does and then it goes through the

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.580 
does and then it goes through the
headband<00:05:44.090> and<00:05:44.450> because<00:05:44.810> of<00:05:44.840> this<00:05:44.990> bracket

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
headband and because of this bracket

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.490 
headband and because of this bracket
they<00:05:46.430> had<00:05:46.669> to<00:05:46.820> whiten<00:05:47.450> it<00:05:47.570> out<00:05:47.750> so<00:05:48.140> you<00:05:48.169> can<00:05:48.350> see

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
they had to whiten it out so you can see

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.760 
they had to whiten it out so you can see
it<00:05:48.590> goes<00:05:48.710> in<00:05:48.919> the<00:05:49.040> air<00:05:49.190> cup<00:05:49.430> and<00:05:49.669> then<00:05:50.300> goes

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
it goes in the air cup and then goes

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.340 
it goes in the air cup and then goes
right<00:05:51.770> in<00:05:52.070> there<00:05:52.930> pops<00:05:53.930> out<00:05:54.230> at<00:05:54.380> the<00:05:54.440> top<00:05:54.650> here

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
right in there pops out at the top here

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.270 
right in there pops out at the top here
pops<00:05:57.350> out<00:05:57.440> at<00:05:57.530> the<00:05:57.590> top<00:05:57.710> goes<00:05:57.950> through<00:05:58.190> your
