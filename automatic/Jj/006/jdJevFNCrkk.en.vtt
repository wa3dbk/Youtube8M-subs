be<00:05:49.470> a<00:05:49.500> bit<00:05:49.680> off<00:05:49.860> since<00:05:50.300> yeah<00:05:51.300> but<00:05:51.990> like<00:05:52.140> their

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
be a bit off since yeah but like their

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.560 
be a bit off since yeah but like their
angle<00:05:53.190> to<00:05:53.310> the<00:05:53.400> outside<00:05:53.700> of<00:05:53.730> it<00:05:53.970> so<00:05:54.420> which<00:05:54.540> is

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
angle to the outside of it so which is

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.320 
angle to the outside of it so which is
like<00:05:55.050> that's<00:05:55.560> fine<00:05:55.770> cuz<00:05:56.400> when<00:05:57.060> you're<00:05:57.240> in<00:05:57.300> your

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
like that's fine cuz when you're in your

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.790 
like that's fine cuz when you're in your
stance<00:05:57.660> no<00:05:57.930> one<00:05:58.050> holds<00:05:58.290> their<00:05:58.410> block<00:05:58.620> or

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
stance no one holds their block or

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.740 
stance no one holds their block or
facing<00:05:59.130> forward<00:05:59.520> but<00:06:00.330> I<00:06:00.360> think<00:06:00.600> it<00:06:00.660> actually

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
facing forward but I think it actually

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.480 
facing forward but I think it actually
helps<00:06:01.200> it<00:06:01.410> helps<00:06:01.500> deflect<00:06:01.980> the<00:06:02.100> buck<00:06:02.280> to<00:06:02.400> the

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
helps it helps deflect the buck to the

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.360 
helps it helps deflect the buck to the
corner<00:06:02.790> and<00:06:02.940> also<00:06:03.510> it<00:06:03.990> has<00:06:04.110> a<00:06:04.140> really<00:06:04.440> nice<00:06:05.090> um
