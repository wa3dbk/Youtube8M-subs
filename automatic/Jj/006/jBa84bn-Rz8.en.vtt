 channel and today I have a 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:21.560
 Therefore, it is very interesting to 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.900
 people if the the skin airlines 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.390
 they sent these products so that I 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.869
 I did a review and well these 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.860
 products are for skin problems 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.780
 for the extreme for acne to 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.379
 follicles for infections and they 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.140
 they sent two they sent me and the 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.750
 15 facial cleanser the cleaner for 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.750
 the face that is for eczema for the 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.119
 rosacea and for acne and also I 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.900
 they sent the same or the soap 

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:52.900
 for the body 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.050
 I'm just going to talk about body wash 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.090
 or the body pump because then 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.299
 well at home honestly we do not have 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.299
 no visible problem as well as for 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.490
 use a product of this type then 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.290
 we second 2 the same about 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.390
 all day that you know you have 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.920
 flag is cap or extreme problem or 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.720
 dandruff as you want to call it 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.060
 it is also already good 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.050
 some little circles that are like 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.270
 Circulitos as very as very dry and 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.800
 me too because my skin is dry but 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.929
 basically, I'm getting a lot out 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.929
 good on the forearms 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.929
 two 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:56.570
 this mind is super amazing in those 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:59.450
 small rail spa and dry areas 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.580
 dry circuits that I had to day 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.890
 with one or two months to use the product 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.050
 It was much more than enough 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.090
 I started using it on leather 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.459
 scalp of the day and that's amazing 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.050
 from the first bet then the 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.060
 results were visibly seen as 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.160
 at 50 percent what I did was 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.290
 first you wash your head well 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.510
 a day so good this to ensure 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.060
 because first that the product 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.489
 last longer and second then so that it is 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.290
 cleaner and apart also because I 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.350
 therefore, it is good that these 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.050
 products are like the last thing you use 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.450
 what do you wear and what do you wear? 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.239
 then I put it on his skull in 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.230
 the scalp gave him a massage 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.050
 approximately for five minutes 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:46.700
 until foam is in gel but it is 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:49.080
 amazing how easy it he goes he 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.090
 it comes out and to 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.100
 and what it does also then render 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.670
 a lot because not to be so liquid then 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:00.090
 one does not waste ago and I have 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.670
 used like four times and almost and no longer 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.620
 I plan to use it again for a while 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.870
 unless it comes out and well I'm 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.540
 crossing your fingers that does not return to 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.340
 leave the dandruff also notice that from the 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.300
 first time so good the smell and the 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:19.860
 sweat was also greatly reduced and that therefore 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.840
 well I liked it a lot and well yo yo 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.480
 almost mind what worries me most in the 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.400
 case of d elÃ­a and dandruff is that 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.650
 they are spending and they already know you well what 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.360
 cruel that can be children 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.240
 so I do not want you to have changes 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.720
 that they are going to think something else from the 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.570
 first use as she stopped scratching 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.510
 the head which super but super 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.490
 but super excellent and nothing that's all

 Skin infections from odors 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.590
 all those ugly things that we do not want 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.720
 see and in our case here in the house 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.659
 well, every time they change the 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.700
 stations for some reason then 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.549
 she returns then nothing I 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.459
 will keep you informed to see when we dry 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:18.519
 when the change of season happens to see 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:21.370

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.680
