page mark a grid with the ruler

page mark a grid with the ruler
vertically<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:06.740> then<00:02:06.830> horizontally<00:02:08.440> like<00:02:09.440> so

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.140 

then<00:02:20.440> make<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:20.830> cross<00:02:21.280> in<00:02:21.670> each<00:02:23.280> grid<00:02:24.280> lightly

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
then make a cross in each grid lightly

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.449 
then make a cross in each grid lightly
scoring

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.459 

with<00:02:31.000> your<00:02:31.180> pencil<00:02:31.420> because<00:02:31.750> you're<00:02:32.079> going<00:02:32.319> to

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:32.469 
with your pencil because you're going to

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:36.569 
with your pencil because you're going to
erase<00:02:32.890> your<00:02:33.129> pencil<00:02:34.290> afterwards<00:02:35.290> if<00:02:35.579> you

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
erase your pencil afterwards if you

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:41.760 
erase your pencil afterwards if you
don't<00:02:36.879> trace<00:02:37.209> over<00:02:37.629> this

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.750 

the<00:02:42.730> reason<00:02:43.030> why<00:02:43.120> you're<00:02:43.240> drawing<00:02:43.450> across<00:02:44.760> or

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
the reason why you're drawing across or

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.870 
the reason why you're drawing across or
an<00:02:46.180> X<00:02:46.330> pattern<00:02:46.570> like<00:02:46.960> this<00:02:46.990> is<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:51.250> will<00:02:51.670> keep

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
an X pattern like this is it will keep

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:59.220 
an X pattern like this is it will keep
your<00:02:52.240> proportions<00:02:54.240> even<00:02:56.640> throughout<00:02:58.230> your

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
your proportions even throughout your

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.400 
your proportions even throughout your
illustration

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.550 

so<00:03:06.010> usually<00:03:06.190> in<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.820> Celtic<00:03:07.290> Bible<00:03:08.290> or

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
so usually in the Celtic Bible or

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.270 
so usually in the Celtic Bible or
illuminated<00:03:09.490> gospel<00:03:13.230> all<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.650> text<00:03:14.980> would<00:03:15.100> go

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
illuminated gospel all the text would go

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.060 
illuminated gospel all the text would go
in<00:03:15.460> here<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:16.230> then<00:03:17.230> in<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.410> corners<00:03:17.860> of<00:03:18.010> the

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
in here and then in the corners of the

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.480 
in here and then in the corners of the
book<00:03:18.450> like<00:03:19.450> really<00:03:19.840> nice<00:03:20.020> not<00:03:20.260> work<00:03:20.440> like<00:03:20.650> this

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:29.760 

so<00:03:24.490> the<00:03:24.700> way<00:03:24.820> to<00:03:24.880> start<00:03:25.300> is<00:03:26.080> by<00:03:26.140> marking<00:03:28.770> marks

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
so the way to start is by marking marks

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:53.860 
so the way to start is by marking marks
halfway<00:03:30.550> from<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.240> centers<00:03:31.600> to<00:03:32.140> each<00:03:32.290> corner

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:01.660 

and<00:03:54.440> that<00:03:54.590> style<00:03:55.010> of<00:03:55.250> knot<00:03:55.550> is<00:03:56.120> basically<00:04:00.670> draw

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
and that style of knot is basically draw

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:08.320 
and that style of knot is basically draw
curve<00:04:02.180> a<00:04:03.790> nice<00:04:04.790> arc<00:04:06.760> it's<00:04:07.760> about<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.150> same

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
curve a nice arc it's about the same

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.380 
curve a nice arc it's about the same
size<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:11.060> curve<00:04:11.660> on<00:04:12.019> each<00:04:12.230> of<00:04:12.379> your<00:04:12.500> lines<00:04:13.390> you

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
size and curve on each of your lines you

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.610 
size and curve on each of your lines you
just<00:04:14.450> went<00:04:14.810> up<00:04:14.900> a<00:04:14.989> bit<00:04:15.140> like<00:04:15.290> that<00:04:15.820> next<00:04:18.130> draw<00:04:19.130> a

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
just went up a bit like that next draw a

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.000 
just went up a bit like that next draw a
straight<00:04:21.620> line<00:04:22.720> from<00:04:23.720> here<00:04:24.050> to<00:04:24.110> here

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:35.310 

someone's<00:04:28.010> got<00:04:28.130> a<00:04:28.160> crescent<00:04:31.660> and<00:04:32.660> this<00:04:32.960> one

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:43.560 

like<00:04:36.320> so

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.070 

next<00:04:44.440> you<00:04:44.590> draw<00:04:44.830> a<00:04:44.860> line<00:04:45.570> through<00:04:46.570> this<00:04:46.810> one

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
next you draw a line through this one

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:56.060 
next you draw a line through this one
that<00:04:47.590> stops<00:04:48.010> here

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.100 

imagine<00:04:56.970> these<00:04:57.150> two<00:04:57.210> here<00:04:57.720> are<00:04:57.750> going<00:04:58.050> to

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
imagine these two here are going to

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.960 
imagine these two here are going to
connect<00:04:58.970> and<00:05:00.710> then<00:05:01.710> this<00:05:02.010> one<00:05:02.220> here<00:05:02.610> is<00:05:02.760> going

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
connect and then this one here is going

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:28.379 
connect and then this one here is going
to<00:05:03.120> connect<00:05:03.450> here

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.050 

when<00:05:29.229> you're<00:05:29.349> drawing<00:05:29.530> up<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:29.979> page<00:05:30.219> you<00:05:30.909> can

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
when you're drawing up the page you can

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.869 
when you're drawing up the page you can
have<00:05:31.210> it<00:05:31.330> goal<00:05:31.539> in<00:05:31.840> the<00:05:32.319> same<00:05:32.530> direction<00:05:32.759> but<00:05:33.759> I

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:33.879 
have it goal in the same direction but I

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:35.580 
have it goal in the same direction but I
like<00:05:34.090> to<00:05:34.210> have<00:05:34.330> it<00:05:34.449> going<00:05:34.719> in<00:05:34.990> an<00:05:35.110> opposite

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
like to have it going in an opposite

00:05:35.590 --> 00:06:12.100 
like to have it going in an opposite
direction

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.950 

a<00:06:12.170> note<00:06:12.920> that<00:06:13.160> you've<00:06:13.280> got<00:06:13.520> these<00:06:14.390> two<00:06:14.690> lines

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
a note that you've got these two lines

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.430 
a note that you've got these two lines
that<00:06:15.290> need<00:06:15.800> to<00:06:15.950> meet<00:06:16.100> up<00:06:16.130> somehow<00:06:17.290> keeping<00:06:18.290> it

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
that need to meet up somehow keeping it

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.880 
that need to meet up somehow keeping it
as<00:06:18.590> simple<00:06:18.950> as<00:06:19.040> possible<00:06:20.380> will<00:06:21.380> make<00:06:21.590> it<00:06:21.770> the

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890 
as simple as possible will make it the

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:34.420 
as simple as possible will make it the
most<00:06:22.100> elegant<00:06:28.750> next<00:06:31.360> use<00:06:32.360> your<00:06:32.390> marker<00:06:33.430> to

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
most elegant next use your marker to

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.840 
most elegant next use your marker to
draw<00:06:34.610> the<00:06:34.670> spine<00:06:35.740> now<00:06:36.740> you<00:06:37.100> want<00:06:37.280> to<00:06:37.340> alternate

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:37.850 
draw the spine now you want to alternate

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.540 
draw the spine now you want to alternate
over<00:06:38.270> and<00:06:38.390> under<00:06:38.630> so<00:06:39.050> you<00:06:39.140> can<00:06:39.350> pick<00:06:39.530> anywhere

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
over and under so you can pick anywhere

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.730 
over and under so you can pick anywhere
where<00:06:41.120> it<00:06:41.210> crosses<00:06:43.120> and<00:06:44.170> what<00:06:45.170> that<00:06:45.380> point<00:06:45.620> is

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
where it crosses and what that point is

00:06:45.740 --> 00:07:49.410 
where it crosses and what that point is
over<00:06:46.870> then<00:06:48.340> under<00:06:49.340> and<00:06:49.700> over

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:49.420 

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.980 

so<00:07:50.420> you<00:07:50.480> start<00:07:50.810> to<00:07:50.840> see<00:07:50.960> your<00:07:51.170> pattern<00:07:51.230> emerge
