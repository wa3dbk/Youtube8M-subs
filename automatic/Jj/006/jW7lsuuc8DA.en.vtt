00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
when I got on to TED talks but then a

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.420 
when I got on to TED talks but then a
second<00:03:28.560> later<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.830> thought<00:03:29.100> they<00:03:29.220> made<00:03:29.400> a

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
second later I thought they made a

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.830 
second later I thought they made a
mistake<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:29.880> then<00:03:30.209> I<00:03:30.360> would<00:03:30.570> completely

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
mistake and then I would completely

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.330 
mistake and then I would completely
screw<00:03:31.320> up<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.680> then<00:03:31.769> I'd<00:03:31.890> be<00:03:32.070> caught<00:03:32.310> for

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
screw up and then I'd be caught for

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.940 
screw up and then I'd be caught for
being<00:03:32.790> an<00:03:32.940> idiot<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.450> think<00:03:34.380> it's<00:03:34.500> healthy<00:03:34.709> that

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
being an idiot I think it's healthy that

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.430 
being an idiot I think it's healthy that
I<00:03:35.130> don't<00:03:35.459> think<00:03:35.730> too<00:03:35.880> much<00:03:36.290> when<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.320> do

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
I don't think too much when I do

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.870 
I don't think too much when I do
something<00:03:37.860> that<00:03:38.519> makes<00:03:38.790> me<00:03:40.310> narcissistic<00:03:41.310> or

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
something that makes me narcissistic or

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.090 
something that makes me narcissistic or

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
over excited because two minutes later
