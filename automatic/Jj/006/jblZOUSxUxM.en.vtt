00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.059
 Hello dear audience 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.550
 you have wished me that 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.730
 again against bots games and i hear 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.560
 on your wishes and zack it starts 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.590
 This deathmatch team time someone 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.310
 wanted from me that I have so yes 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.529
 I'll do more, for better or worse 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.970
 maybe I will meet one or the other 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:33.510
 I can do it for other opponents 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.969
 not really good but I never have 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.660
 claims to be a project because of that 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.660
 You can not blame it 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.120
 currently it's all but reasonably 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.120
 well i am surprised 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.870
 Incidentally, I made a list where 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.740
 I wrote down which ones 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.270
 things you still want from me 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.850
 I have the feeling all the time 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.020
 that I forgot something so I did 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.380
 I've been writing down and then 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.380
 someone else wanted me to turn that on 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.940
 Meltdown with anything game I have 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.180
 but I also noted that will after 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.440
 these follow here but recorded and 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.720
 that was also different what i was 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.010
 currently on the list has if 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.450
 I forgot something or if 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.100
 you still Munich have just write 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.040
 in the comments or by message 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.390
 me or something that will be done if 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.530
 right now I have the time because they are so 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.920
 a little bit here a wish concert too 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.479
 do 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.160
 here you want something from me 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.229
 play that and that in the and the 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.590
 map with the game mode and me 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.590
 do that then 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.630
 Oh yes, exactly the bots I have on 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.759
 Rarely does that mean I believe exactly 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.410
 seldom have I asked the one that is 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.170
 not the highest level of difficulty 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.209
 but I wanted to snipe with him 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.209
 hire nor any chance have 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.540
 so much for the god of war not so great anymore 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.070
 we are always behind me 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.910
 back there 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.910
 past 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.750
 but it is not up from the hip 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:52.380
 It does not seem to me deadly 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.700
 there are still those who are always behind me 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.220
 speak necessarily such a portable 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.310
 Radar or something is there really 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.310
 still 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.650
 maybe I should stop as well 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.849
 Sniper standing in the middle of the street 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.560
 stay that is maybe tactical 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.489
 not so smart 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.700
 you probably think so 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:24.480
 good for half an hour I give 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.480
 to be effortless better me 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:42.000
 behind me I could do that here 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.049
 sticking knife then I notice 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.049
 at least more comes from that 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.849
 H 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.629
 But I would like to finally come here 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:07.310
 some graduation series reward 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:10.629
 Now I have a what was that 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.629
 Do not you make a lock? 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.040
 I do not have my colleague 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.950
 already behind me that is not allowed 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.720
 so now I have here also it fair 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.020
 No one can come from there anymore 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.020
 Not 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:54.240
 so that looks pretty good now 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.140
 I sure that here is small yes there 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.140
 There was no sign on the map 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:08.510
 I prefer to keep that quiet 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.820
 I hate it when I'm somewhere 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.820
 get stuck that's so annoying 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.080
 his 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.090
 now be back here somewhere a 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.070
 my knife sticks there that means me 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.070
 I am 12 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:45.110
 and the rocket 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:58.020
 second , it was important to me 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.020
 fall is again the melee 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.030
 graphic 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:16.990
 Well, hardly a reliable one 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:19.250
 position i am gone that sounds like that 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.490
 like the description of the life of one 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.490
 campers 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.730
 Yes 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.730
 yeah 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.759
 I want also a recent kick 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:07:06.250
 I even have it over at the aua 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:07:09.520
 or he was over, after all 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.800
 there I went so I am reasonably 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.790
 well beaten 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.290
 Maybe I can someday 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.330
 a botnet on the highest 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.860
 make difficulty 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.090
 that will show it so thanks for that 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.750
 watch and see you soon 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.750
 bye
