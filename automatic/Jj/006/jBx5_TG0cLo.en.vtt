the e in the g string so you go to get

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.520 
the e in the g string so you go to get
index<00:00:33.520> on<00:00:33.910> the<00:00:34.030> 15th<00:00:34.450> and<00:00:34.690> your<00:00:35.230> middle<00:00:35.440> finger

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
14th fret with each fingers this time on

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.010 
14th fret with each fingers this time on
the<00:01:50.420> E<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:50.900> the<00:01:51.020> g-string<00:01:51.560> in<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:53.660> middle

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
the E and the g-string in the middle

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:08.500 
the E and the g-string in the middle
you've<00:01:54.890> got<00:01:55.070> these<00:01:55.160> 16<00:02:06.940> so<00:02:07.940> you<00:02:08.000> go<00:02:08.270> from<00:02:08.479> the

the 14th fret to the 19th fret 19th to
the<00:02:52.569> 21st<00:02:52.959> fret<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:53.830> say<00:02:54.160> again<00:02:54.940> so<00:03:12.299> then<00:03:13.299> you

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420

go<00:03:13.569> on<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.970> final<00:03:15.970> chord<00:03:16.239> which<00:03:17.170> is<00:03:17.280> same

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
go on to the final chord which is same

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.720 
go on to the final chord which is same
pattern<00:03:18.580> once<00:03:18.760> again<00:03:20.100> left<00:03:21.100> index<00:03:21.489> on<00:03:21.640> the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
pattern once again left index on the

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.449 
pattern once again left index on the
12th<00:03:22.060> fret<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:25.269> index<00:03:25.930> in<00:03:26.080> middle<00:03:26.459> the

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
12th fret to the index in middle the

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.860 
12th fret to the index in middle the
14th<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.140> your<00:03:29.140> right<00:03:29.530> middle<00:03:30.190> finger<00:03:30.870> goes

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
14th and your right middle finger goes

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:39.970 
14th and your right middle finger goes
on<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:33.400> 13th<00:03:33.940> fret<00:03:34.209> on<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.690> g<00:03:34.900> string

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.740 

so<00:03:40.980> full<00:03:41.700> speed<00:03:42.000> all<00:03:42.270> the<00:03:42.360> way<00:03:42.480> through

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
so full speed all the way through

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:58.490 
so full speed all the way through
starting<00:03:43.230> on<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:44.090> 17th<00:03:45.090> fret

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.840 

and<00:03:59.500> that's<00:03:59.830> basically<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.250> tapping<00:04:00.580> pattern

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
and that's basically the tapping pattern

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.120 
and that's basically the tapping pattern
you<00:04:01.120> there<00:04:01.360> is<00:04:01.480> a<00:04:01.690> little<00:04:02.080> sort<00:04:02.470> of<00:04:02.500> arty<00:04:03.010> bit

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
you there is a little sort of arty bit

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.010 
you there is a little sort of arty bit
that<00:04:03.280> I<00:04:03.310> made<00:04:03.520> up<00:04:03.700> but<00:04:03.850> it<00:04:03.940> doesn't<00:04:04.180> work<00:04:04.690> -

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
that I made up but it doesn't work -

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:17.460 
that I made up but it doesn't work -
it's<00:04:05.380> where<00:04:05.530> you<00:04:05.620> go<00:04:16.080> but<00:04:17.080> there's<00:04:17.230> no<00:04:17.290> way

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
it's where you go but there's no way

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.050 
it's where you go but there's no way
it's<00:04:17.560> really<00:04:17.739> ended<00:04:18.220> so<00:04:18.340> you<00:04:18.430> just<00:04:18.610> you<00:04:18.940> can

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
it's really ended so you just you can

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.630 
it's really ended so you just you can
just<00:04:19.090> expand<00:04:19.690> on<00:04:19.989> that<00:04:20.830> using<00:04:21.190> that<00:04:21.220> sort<00:04:21.580> of

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
just expand on that using that sort of

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.570 
just expand on that using that sort of
type<00:04:22.450> of<00:04:22.600> chord<00:04:22.870> sequence<00:04:23.410> and<00:04:23.680> see<00:04:24.370> how<00:04:24.430> it

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
type of chord sequence and see how it

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.150 
type of chord sequence and see how it
goes<00:04:24.760> really
