00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the differential world iw6 3 I've raised

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.620 
the differential world iw6 3 I've raised
the<00:00:51.780> vehicle<00:00:52.070> on<00:00:53.070> two<00:00:53.520> ramps<00:00:53.880> front<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.450> rear

the vehicle on two ramps front and rear
just<00:00:54.900> to<00:00:54.989> get<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.230> off<00:00:55.290> the<00:00:55.350> ground

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
just to get it off the ground

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.299 
just to get it off the ground
give<00:00:56.970> me<00:00:57.150> room<00:00:57.330> to<00:00:57.390> get<00:00:57.660> under<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.950> service

drain<00:01:21.060> plug<00:01:21.240> which<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:21.810> one<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.050> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
drain plug which is the one on the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.080 
drain plug which is the one on the
bottom<00:01:22.229> there<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.119> 14<00:01:24.119> millimeter<00:01:24.630> hex<00:01:25.619> key

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
bottom there so 14 millimeter hex key

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.460 
bottom there so 14 millimeter hex key
and<00:01:27.500> I've<00:01:28.500> also<00:01:29.540> taken<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.750> filler<00:01:30.990> plug<00:01:31.229> out

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
and I've also taken the filler plug out

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.780 
and I've also taken the filler plug out
top<00:01:32.160> there<00:01:32.399> which<00:01:32.550> is<00:01:32.670> also<00:01:33.030> 14<00:01:33.509> millimetres

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
top there which is also 14 millimetres

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.430 
top there which is also 14 millimetres
the<00:01:35.790> oil<00:01:36.149> that<00:01:36.270> came<00:01:36.450> out<00:01:36.690> and<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:36.930> vehicles

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
the oil that came out and this vehicles

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.650 
the oil that came out and this vehicles
done<00:01:37.649> about<00:01:37.940> 78,000<00:01:38.940> kilometres<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.540> was

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
done about 78,000 kilometres it was

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.639 
done about 78,000 kilometres it was
really<00:01:39.930> brown<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:41.000> smelt<00:01:42.000> quite<00:01:42.649> Burnet

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
really brown and smelt quite Burnet

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.669 
really brown and smelt quite Burnet
actually<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.789> it's<00:01:45.660> definitely<00:01:46.350> time<00:01:46.530> to

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
actually so it's definitely time to

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.639 
actually so it's definitely time to
change<00:01:47.149> I've<00:01:48.149> done<00:01:48.360> here<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.899> I've<00:01:49.080> I<00:01:49.350> just

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
change I've done here is I've I just

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.999 
change I've done here is I've I just
pumped<00:01:49.920> about<00:01:50.009> 200<00:01:50.610> mils<00:01:50.819> of<00:01:51.170> new<00:01:52.170> default

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
pumped about 200 mils of new default

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.340 
pumped about 200 mils of new default
Lynn<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.459> to<00:01:53.640> flush<00:01:53.940> some<00:01:54.300> of<00:01:55.050> the<00:01:55.110> rubbish

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
Lynn just to flush some of the rubbish

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.059 
Lynn just to flush some of the rubbish
out<00:01:55.470> at<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.679> bottom<00:01:55.830> and<00:01:57.440> I've<00:01:58.440> done<00:01:58.800> the<00:01:58.920> old

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
out at the bottom and I've done the old

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.740 
out at the bottom and I've done the old
trick<00:01:59.340> with<00:01:59.520> the<00:02:00.200> drink<00:02:01.200> bottle<00:02:02.660> but<00:02:03.660> I'll

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
trick with the drink bottle but I'll

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.529 
trick with the drink bottle but I'll
stick<00:02:03.959> the<00:02:04.080> compressed<00:02:04.440> air<00:02:04.619> hose<00:02:04.860> in<00:02:05.539> set

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
stick the compressed air hose in set

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:07.999 
stick the compressed air hose in set
about<00:02:06.750> five<00:02:07.020> here<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.470> it<00:02:07.560> works<00:02:07.740> really<00:02:07.830> well

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
about five here so it works really well

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.350 
about five here so it works really well
so<00:02:08.310> I'm<00:02:08.399> just<00:02:08.429> letting<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.910> right

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
so I'm just letting that right

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.449 
so I'm just letting that right
and<00:02:09.450> then<00:02:10.310> we'll<00:02:11.310> pump<00:02:11.550> some<00:02:11.700> new<00:02:11.819> fluid<00:02:12.090> in

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
and then we'll pump some new fluid in

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.370 
and then we'll pump some new fluid in
this<00:02:14.459> stuff<00:02:14.670> doesn't<00:02:14.880> go<00:02:15.450> hard<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:15.990> it's<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.140> lot

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
this stuff doesn't go hard so it's a lot

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.760 
this stuff doesn't go hard so it's a lot
locked<00:02:16.620> up<00:02:16.830> but<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.160> does<00:02:18.170> help<00:02:19.170> hold<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:19.620> as

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
locked up but it does help hold it in as

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.970 
locked up but it does help hold it in as
well

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
well

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.280 
well
okay<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:20.730> I'll<00:02:20.970> put<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.360> drain<00:02:21.660> plug<00:02:21.840> back<00:02:22.080> in

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
okay so I'll put the drain plug back in

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.350 
okay so I'll put the drain plug back in
time<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.160> up

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.520 

in<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.020> fill<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.320> all<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:27.250> comes<00:02:27.550> down<00:02:28.530> to

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
in the fill of all that comes down to

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.730 
in the fill of all that comes down to
here<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.970> there's<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:31.930> bit<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:32.110> later<00:02:32.380> in<00:02:32.560> there

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
here and there's a bit of later in there

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
at the moment is spear hose on the hole

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.390 
at the moment is spear hose on the hole
here<00:02:38.970> yeah<00:02:39.970> how's<00:02:40.270> there<00:02:41.010> start<00:02:42.010> pumping<00:02:42.340> it

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
here yeah how's there start pumping it

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:51.180 
here yeah how's there start pumping it
in<00:02:46.530> level<00:02:47.790> going<00:02:48.790> down<00:02:48.910> as<00:02:49.300> a<00:02:49.330> pump<00:02:49.830> or<00:02:50.830> as<00:02:51.040> the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
in level going down as a pump or as the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:59.420 
in level going down as a pump or as the
air<00:02:51.480> pushes<00:02:52.480> in<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.780> oil<00:02:52.990> into<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.290> different
