00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.910
 Tips on how to decorate your office 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.770
 I have an office that I do with her as 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.250
 the chorus good to see depends 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.910
 much of your profession because it can be a 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.010
 dentist or a lawyer have an optics 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.690
 but good whatever the objective 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.149
 It has to be very clear, your goal is 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.100
 sell your product sell what you offer 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.040
 but not only that but there is also 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.540
 another one is that the people who work there 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.940
 you have to feel comfortable you have to 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.190
 be comfortable has to be productive 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.430
 for that office to work as it is 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.430
 due 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.710
 good because in this chapter we talk 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.020
 of offices I will take advantage for 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.700
 show you mine and explain a little 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.850
 the criteria that I chose at the time of 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.070
 design what I wanted from my office 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.960
 Well, to begin with, my office is my 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.289
 business card my business card 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.470
 visit when a client enters me what 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.880
 I want you to know in 23 seconds 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.950
 what here they touch you or with what 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.409
 interior designer will treat him when he sees 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.539
 Well, since this space is already 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.310
 imagine what I like and what 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.259
 can offer you 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.780
 criteria when choosing materials 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.220
 well we we like to be 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.039
 innovators experiment with materials 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.950
 new but for it is complicated sometimes 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.470
 convince a client to dare with 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.549
 something new or something you have not seen 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.189
 something that is a bit of singular 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.259
 then we chose for our office 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.170
 a resin floor is a little soil 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.030
 habitual is a material that is a 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.770
 more industrial material is more for the 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.929
 industry and we here what 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.119
 we apply to a more more domestic issue 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.670
 we wanted because we wanted a floor 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.950
 totally continuous that it would also look 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.660
 that's why we gave him a color a black color 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.250
 and apart from the properties that we 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.400
 I could offer then that outside 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.209
 resistant easy to clean and above all 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.580
 the continuity that gave us that 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.110
 we get with it well because many 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.030
 times when we see a client we are 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.290
 explaining something as hear and here 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.810
 what have you put then look then we have 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.430
 put a resin this does not mean that 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.709
 we want him to sell a 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.420
 resin but we do give that degree of 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.489
 confidence that if we have 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.350
 daring with this and it has been fine what 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.280
 that we can offer him so he can 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.280
 interest or you can get 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.530
 good while we were already moving in 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.989
 the project we had even started the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.300
 work we realized that we had 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.300
 that control a subject of 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.060
 security because then the area had 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.790
 there have been several thefts lately 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.319
 we had to improvise a barrier to 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.880
 The first option is to think of a 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.010
 drawer with a roller we can 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.260
 come down but we did not like that then 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.540
 We decided to make a barrier not to hide it 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.510
 but it was seen that it is here 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.540
 that is to say this is our closure of 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.850
 safety is a metallic barrier of 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.890
 pretty heavy iron what happens that 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.410
 what we did is that when 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.019
 open therefore be part of the 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.060
 office decoration ie 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.769
 look like a panel is to say that it makes us 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.470
 the double function that is something decorative 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.470
 and at the same time have a utility 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.780
 good always in our case these 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.150
 local your local in two heights we have 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.460
 ground floor and first floor and the 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.930
 Stair placement is always a 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.390
 headache is a headache 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.520
 that you have to turn it into something that 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.320
 is in your favor in this case the 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.300
 we decided to place in a corner in 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.320
 oblique direction to the entrance of such 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.300
 way that when someone enters 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.650
 directly see it because 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.680
 we think we wanted it to be a 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.180
 elegant part of the office also in 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.040
 the intermediate landing we took advantage of 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.340
 to give access to the bathroom that is 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.950
 placed in a place where it does not bother and 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.680
 it is quite discreet enough then to 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.020
 When choosing the materials to the 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.690
 steps we opted for a silestone 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.550
 because we got a white tone that 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.250
 it contrasted totally with the color 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.770
 dark soil and then we decided that 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.390
 the railing outside outside of glass 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.250
 that contrary to what can 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.919
 it seems that it may seem insecure 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.380
 it can break, it is not enough 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.780
 resistant 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.940
 It is a one centimeter tempered glass 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.870
 and medium thickness and to demonstrate 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.850
 resistance 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.700
 We decided to hang the handrail ie 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.070
 the handrail is directly supported by 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.780
 good glass and all this boast for 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.310
 Well, well, a little what I was saying 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.710
 the start of the video when someone enters 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.900
 we have our offices be our 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.600
 business card when you 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.010
 we teach how is the crystal of our 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.320
 ladder and how the handrail is held 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.900
 we give you that point of confidence in 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.940
 as to the structure that is to say to the 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.750
 time to design your house if we propose 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.010
 an eave or overhang as 34 meters 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.780
 that you can have that confidence in 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.680
 us that we know how to do it and 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.680
 we know how to execute it 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.080
 another important issue is to think how 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.690
 We will distribute the positions of 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.160
 work we had very clear that what 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.600
 important is when a client enters 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.310
 through that door what do you see then 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.560
 has to see a friendly face a face 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.200
 friendly that you receive does not have to 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.100
 find people with their backs too 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.380
 for the comfort of people who 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:50.010
 work here is important to be is 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.960
 better to face the outside with a 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.840
 paddle to the back that will not be 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:58.710
 placed in the middle of the room in a way 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.570
 more volatile and then we also distribute 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.070
 a little bit the spaces of passage is to say 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.410
 we have all the tables placed in the 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.330
 same side a space of travel that 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.280
 takes us to the staircase the plant 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.630
 up and then yes that's the only thing 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.530
 is separated from the rest is the room 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:16.470
 meetings we also had clear that what 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.720
 good that we wanted to be all 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.940
 mixed that is we do not want a room 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.010
 separated with the chief's office by 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.420
 say one way and then the room 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.760
 large where are the operations that 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.030
 what we wanted is to be all 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.010
 together since we are all the same 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.980
 I hope these tips have been 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.780
 tools 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.180
 and if you want to continue learning from 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.730
