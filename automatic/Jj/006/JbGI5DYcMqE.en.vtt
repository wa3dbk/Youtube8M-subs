teeth of the zipper should be facing out
for<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.690> moment<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.200> it's<00:01:57.470> going<00:01:57.710> to<00:01:57.860> look

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
for the moment and it's going to look

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
it looks like when it's done in the

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.759 
it looks like when it's done in the
inside<00:03:34.519> and<00:03:34.880> on<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.299> outside<00:03:35.420> and<00:03:36.380> as<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.620> can

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
inside and on the outside and as you can

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.640 
inside and on the outside and as you can
see<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:38.120> zipper<00:03:38.420> is<00:03:38.510> slightly<00:03:38.780> visible<00:03:39.140> and

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
see the zipper is slightly visible and

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.610 
see the zipper is slightly visible and
that's<00:03:39.799> because<00:03:40.190> it's<00:03:40.370> been<00:03:40.519> done<00:03:40.790> with<00:03:41.060> a

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
that's because it's been done with a

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.500 
that's because it's been done with a
regular<00:03:42.620> zipper<00:03:43.190> foot<00:03:43.400> so<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:43.790> can<00:03:44.090> really

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
regular zipper foot so you can really

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.980 
regular zipper foot so you can really
have<00:03:44.690> it<00:03:45.129> truly<00:03:46.129> invisible<00:03:46.670> only<00:03:47.270> with<00:03:47.480> Nimbus

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
have it truly invisible only with Nimbus

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.470 
have it truly invisible only with Nimbus
zipper<00:03:48.470> foot<00:03:48.650> and<00:03:48.980> now<00:03:49.760> you<00:03:49.820> can<00:03:50.120> cut<00:03:50.360> the

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
zipper foot and now you can cut the

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.740 
zipper foot and now you can cut the
excess<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:51.230> zipper<00:03:51.770> if<00:03:51.950> you<00:03:52.130> have<00:03:52.340> any<00:03:52.520> and<00:03:52.850> I

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
excess a zipper if you have any and I

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.300 
excess a zipper if you have any and I
would<00:03:53.900> advise<00:03:54.170> you<00:03:54.200> to<00:03:54.410> run<00:03:54.680> a<00:03:54.710> few<00:03:54.800> stitches

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
would advise you to run a few stitches

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.910 
would advise you to run a few stitches
across<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.910> teeth<00:03:56.180> at<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.570> base<00:03:56.960> of<00:03:56.990> it<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:57.620> if

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
across the teeth at the base of it so if

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.940 
across the teeth at the base of it so if
the<00:03:58.520> feeder<00:03:59.120> goes<00:03:59.900> underneath<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.440> fabric

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
the feeder goes underneath the fabric

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.210 
the feeder goes underneath the fabric
you<00:04:01.100> won't<00:04:01.310> lose<00:04:01.490> it<00:04:01.550> and<00:04:01.880> you<00:04:02.120> won't<00:04:02.360> have<00:04:02.450> to

you won't lose it and you won't have to

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.940
