00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
is revenue generation let's take a scrap

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.979 
is revenue generation let's take a scrap
yard<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.320> has<00:00:58.500> 2000<00:00:59.160> cars<00:00:59.370> okay<00:01:00.329> mm-hmm

yard that has 2000 cars okay mm-hmm

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.869 
yard that has 2000 cars okay mm-hmm
let's<00:01:01.379> say<00:01:01.469> they<00:01:01.590> do<00:01:01.739> 2,000<00:01:02.340> cars<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.730> year

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
let's say they do 2,000 cars in the year

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.359 
let's say they do 2,000 cars in the year
which<00:01:03.030> gives<00:01:03.059> us<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.510> total<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.809> 8,000<00:01:04.470> rims<00:01:04.680> all

dollars a ton we're gonna go with that

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.240 
dollars a ton we're gonna go with that
higher<00:01:12.240> number<00:01:12.350> 145<00:01:13.350> dollars<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> ton<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.130> our

higher number 145 dollars a ton in our

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.370 
higher number 145 dollars a ton in our
example<00:01:14.820> because<00:01:15.240> we're<00:01:15.600> yielding<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.080> fairly

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
example because we're yielding a fairly

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.010 
example because we're yielding a fairly
good<00:01:16.590> rate<00:01:16.770> for<00:01:16.979> steel<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.340> our<00:01:17.460> area<00:01:17.810> so<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:18.900> we

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
good rate for steel in our area so if we

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.280 
good rate for steel in our area so if we
take<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.229> rim<00:01:19.530> at<00:01:19.799> 20<00:01:20.159> pounds<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:22.170> have

take a rim at 20 pounds and we have

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.640 
take a rim at 20 pounds and we have
8,000<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.040> them<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.580> gives<00:01:23.790> us<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.119> total<00:01:24.299> of

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
8,000 of them that gives us a total of
