color<00:01:52.869> crystals<00:01:53.440> that<00:01:53.500> are<00:01:53.619> in<00:01:53.770> here<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.069> I

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
color crystals that are in here and I

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.180 
color crystals that are in here and I
can't<00:01:54.369> even<00:01:54.459> see<00:01:54.729> them<00:01:55.590> but<00:01:56.590> there<00:01:56.770> is<00:01:56.799> a<00:01:56.890> blue

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
can't even see them but there is a blue

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.460 
can't even see them but there is a blue
a<00:01:57.490> green<00:01:57.850> and<00:01:58.119> a<00:01:58.330> red<00:01:58.360> color<00:01:58.959> crystal<00:01:59.289> now<00:01:59.409> I

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
a green and a red color crystal now I

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.930 
a green and a red color crystal now I
have<00:01:59.679> all<00:01:59.830> free<00:02:00.100> in<00:02:00.220> there<00:02:00.399> and<00:02:00.520> I<00:02:00.549> did<00:02:00.700> that<00:02:00.819> on

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
have all free in there and I did that on

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.190 
have all free in there and I did that on
purpose<00:02:00.970> so<00:02:01.360> I'd<00:02:01.450> kind<00:02:01.690> of<00:02:01.750> show<00:02:01.929> you<00:02:01.990> how<00:02:02.110> it

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
purpose so I'd kind of show you how it

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.859 
purpose so I'd kind of show you how it
works<00:02:02.319> but<00:02:02.979> you<00:02:03.100> can<00:02:03.250> put<00:02:03.520> one<00:02:03.729> or<00:02:04.149> two<00:02:04.390> or<00:02:04.810> all

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
works but you can put one or two or all

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.139 
works but you can put one or two or all
three<00:02:05.049> in<00:02:05.469> and<00:02:06.280> depending<00:02:06.609> on<00:02:06.700> what<00:02:06.850> you<00:02:06.969> put

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
three in and depending on what you put

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.330 
three in and depending on what you put
in<00:02:07.479> will<00:02:07.750> give<00:02:08.079> you<00:02:08.229> different<00:02:08.500> colors<00:02:08.920> on<00:02:09.190> the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
in will give you different colors on the

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.210 
in will give you different colors on the
blade<00:02:09.489> obviously<00:02:10.119> if<00:02:10.239> you<00:02:10.390> have<00:02:10.890> just<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.040> red

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
blade obviously if you have just the red

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.660 
blade obviously if you have just the red
crystal<00:02:12.489> in<00:02:12.959> or<00:02:13.959> just<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.709> red<00:02:14.859> light<00:02:17.670> mmm

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
crystal in or just the red light mmm

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.620 
crystal in or just the red light mmm
just<00:02:19.359> the<00:02:20.160> green<00:02:21.160> one<00:02:21.340> if<00:02:21.940> I<00:02:22.120> can<00:02:22.269> get<00:02:22.359> it<00:02:22.420> in

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
just the green one if I can get it in

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.069 
just the green one if I can get it in
there<00:02:23.820> your<00:02:24.820> little<00:02:25.030> tricky<00:02:25.239> you<00:02:25.510> got<00:02:25.660> to<00:02:25.810> put

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
there your little tricky you got to put

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.380 
there your little tricky you got to put
them<00:02:26.170> in<00:02:26.260> just<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.950> right<00:02:26.980> way<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.390> sometimes

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
them in just the right way and sometimes

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.700 
them in just the right way and sometimes
they<00:02:28.660> can<00:02:28.720> be<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.900> little<00:02:28.930> stubborn

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.000 

hey<00:02:32.550> okay<00:02:33.300> now<00:02:34.170> we<00:02:34.230> have<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.470> green<00:02:34.650> light<00:02:34.710> in

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
hey okay now we have a green light in

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.760 
hey okay now we have a green light in
get<00:02:35.700> me<00:02:35.820> okay<00:02:36.330> okay<00:02:37.200> that's<00:02:37.350> how<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.590> works

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
get me okay okay that's how that works

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.170 
get me okay okay that's how that works
now<00:02:39.470> if<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.650> want<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.920> just<00:02:41.040> put<00:02:41.250> in<00:02:41.460> just<00:02:41.940> one

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
now if you want to just put in just one

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.580 
now if you want to just put in just one
crystal<00:02:42.600> if<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.720> wanted<00:02:42.990> to<00:02:43.050> just<00:02:43.200> keep<00:02:43.380> one

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
crystal if you wanted to just keep one

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.440 
crystal if you wanted to just keep one
crystal<00:02:44.010> in<00:02:44.100> there<00:02:44.220> it's<00:02:44.850> got<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.000> little<00:02:45.120> end

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
crystal in there it's got a little end

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.900 
crystal in there it's got a little end
cap<00:02:45.720> here<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.800> put<00:02:47.040> your<00:02:47.130> other<00:02:47.280> crystals<00:02:47.760> in

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
cap here to put your other crystals in

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.700 
cap here to put your other crystals in
so<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.210> could<00:02:48.420> store<00:02:48.660> them<00:02:48.900> in<00:02:49.080> there<00:02:49.350> if<00:02:49.530> you

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
so you could store them in there if you

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.280 
so you could store them in there if you
wanted<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.100> do<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.430> way<00:02:50.840> but<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:51.900> is<00:02:52.170> it

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
wanted to do it that way but that is it

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.410 
wanted to do it that way but that is it
looks<00:02:52.500> like<00:02:52.760> that's<00:02:53.760> how<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.030> works<00:02:54.210> that's

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
looks like that's how it works that's

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.620 
looks like that's how it works that's
what<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:54.720> sounds<00:02:54.960> like<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:56.760> give<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.450> an<00:02:57.510> idea

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
what it sounds like and give you an idea

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.080 
what it sounds like and give you an idea
that<00:02:57.990> it's<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.170> fun<00:02:58.380> toy<00:02:58.710> it's<00:02:59.430> worth<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.910> price

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
that it's a fun toy it's worth the price

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.740 
that it's a fun toy it's worth the price
I<00:03:00.330> think<00:03:00.360> on<00:03:00.990> it<00:03:01.490> just<00:03:02.490> for<00:03:02.760> fun<00:03:03.000> play<00:03:03.300> aspects

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
I think on it just for fun play aspects

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.950 
I think on it just for fun play aspects
it's<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:03.990> neat<00:03:04.200> little<00:03:04.760> lightsaber<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:06.510> have<00:03:06.720> as

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
it's a neat little lightsaber to have as

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.780 
it's a neat little lightsaber to have as
opposed<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.470> just<00:03:07.500> those<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:08.280> know<00:03:08.370> basic

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
opposed to just those you know basic

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.640 
opposed to just those you know basic
plastic<00:03:08.940> ones<00:03:09.330> that<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:09.960> can<00:03:10.050> get<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.410> don't

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
plastic ones that you can get that don't

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.960 
plastic ones that you can get that don't
come<00:03:10.830> apart<00:03:10.920> or<00:03:11.250> anything<00:03:11.520> like<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:11.730> this

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970
