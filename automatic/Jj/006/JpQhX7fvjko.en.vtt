00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
doing we're going to be soldering

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.640 
doing we're going to be soldering
together<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:36.010> couple<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.220> little<00:02:37.580> pins<00:02:37.790> on<00:02:38.060> here

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
together a couple of little pins on here

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.680 
together a couple of little pins on here
now<00:02:39.650> sew<00:02:39.920> together<00:02:40.160> this<00:02:40.489> pin<00:02:40.790> here<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.390> this

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
now sew together this pin here and this

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.320 
now sew together this pin here and this
pin<00:02:41.959> here<00:02:42.340> it's<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.550> other<00:02:43.790> one<00:02:43.970> there<00:02:44.150> and

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
pin here it's the other one there and

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.670 
pin here it's the other one there and
there<00:02:44.450> well<00:02:44.570> me<00:02:44.720> not<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.200> one<00:02:45.350> at<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.530> back

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
there well me not the one at the back

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.820 
there well me not the one at the back
it's<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.040> middle<00:02:46.280> one<00:02:46.400> on<00:02:46.430> that<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:46.880> then

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
it's the middle one on that and then

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.250 
it's the middle one on that and then
furthermost<00:02:48.830> one<00:02:49.570> so<00:02:50.570> let<00:02:50.780> me<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:50.900> get<00:02:51.110> my

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
furthermost one so let me I get my

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.280 
furthermost one so let me I get my
soldering<00:02:51.650> iron<00:02:51.739> file<00:02:52.280> up<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:53.140> see<00:02:54.140> what<00:02:54.230> we

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
soldering iron file up and see what we

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.610 
soldering iron file up and see what we
can<00:02:54.380> do<00:02:54.760> okay<00:02:55.760> so<00:02:55.940> what<00:02:56.209> I've<00:02:56.330> got<00:02:56.540> for<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.810> for

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
can do okay so what I've got for the for

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.080 
can do okay so what I've got for the for
the<00:02:57.709> piece<00:02:57.860> of<00:02:58.010> wire<00:02:58.190> I'm<00:02:58.430> going<00:02:58.580> to<00:02:58.640> use<00:02:58.850> I

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
the piece of wire I'm going to use I

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.850 
the piece of wire I'm going to use I
just<00:02:59.120> took<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.420> little<00:02:59.690> piece<00:02:59.840> of<00:02:59.870> one<00:03:00.560> strand

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
just took a little piece of one strand

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.360 
just took a little piece of one strand
of<00:03:01.070> wire<00:03:01.280> out<00:03:01.489> of<00:03:01.519> some<00:03:01.730> cat5<00:03:02.180> cable<00:03:03.160> cut<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.250> to

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
of wire out of some cat5 cable cut it to

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.759 
of wire out of some cat5 cable cut it to
about<00:03:04.750> maybe<00:03:05.750> quarter<00:03:06.170> inch<00:03:06.320> long<00:03:08.620> let's<00:03:09.620> get

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
about maybe quarter inch long let's get

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.680 
about maybe quarter inch long let's get
a<00:03:09.799> focus<00:03:10.190> Thea<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.880> actually<00:03:11.209> that's<00:03:11.299> hanging

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
a focus Thea and actually that's hanging

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.090 
a focus Thea and actually that's hanging
out<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:11.840> little<00:03:12.080> bit<00:03:12.260> more<00:03:12.440> than<00:03:12.590> I<00:03:12.650> need<00:03:12.830> it<00:03:12.950> to

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
out a little bit more than I need it to

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.250 
out a little bit more than I need it to
but<00:03:13.280> basically<00:03:14.269> lay<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.660> on<00:03:14.750> top<00:03:14.959> of<00:03:15.110> those<00:03:15.200> two

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
but basically lay it on top of those two

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.930 
but basically lay it on top of those two
pins<00:03:15.709> there<00:03:16.510> so<00:03:17.510> that<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:17.900> can<00:03:18.880> when<00:03:19.880> you

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
pins there so that you can when you

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.490 
pins there so that you can when you
solder<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.360> it's<00:03:20.480> only<00:03:20.810> touching<00:03:21.140> those<00:03:21.230> two

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
solder it it's only touching those two

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.979 
solder it it's only touching those two
and<00:03:21.620> not<00:03:21.739> touching<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.160> other<00:03:22.190> one<00:03:22.540> so<00:03:23.540> I've

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
and not touching the other one so I've

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.449 
and not touching the other one so I've
got<00:03:24.170> my<00:03:24.290> soldering<00:03:24.620> iron<00:03:24.680> plugged<00:03:25.040> in<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.370> I'm

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
got my soldering iron plugged in and I'm

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.729 
got my soldering iron plugged in and I'm
going<00:03:25.610> to<00:03:25.930> touch<00:03:26.930> a<00:03:26.959> little<00:03:27.170> bit<00:03:27.350> of<00:03:27.440> solder<00:03:27.590> on

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
going to touch a little bit of solder on

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.160 
going to touch a little bit of solder on
there<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.660> see<00:03:29.660> if<00:03:29.720> we<00:03:29.780> can<00:03:29.870> get<00:03:29.959> that<00:03:30.049> to

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
there and see if we can get that to

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.460 
there and see if we can get that to
stick<00:03:31.810> okay<00:03:32.810> I've<00:03:32.930> made<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.230> solder

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
stick okay I've made the solder

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.199 
stick okay I've made the solder
connections<00:03:33.980> there<00:03:34.220> as<00:03:34.459> you<00:03:34.820> can<00:03:34.850> see<00:03:34.940> it's

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
connections there as you can see it's

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.560 
connections there as you can see it's
the<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:36.530> two<00:03:36.920> pins<00:03:37.160> they<00:03:37.400> are<00:03:37.579> connected<00:03:38.390> by<00:03:38.420> a

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
the the two pins they are connected by a

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.759 
the the two pins they are connected by a
little<00:03:38.780> piece<00:03:38.900> of<00:03:39.019> wire<00:03:39.170> a<00:03:39.320> little<00:03:39.590> bit<00:03:39.680> of

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
little piece of wire a little bit of

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:40.930 
little piece of wire a little bit of
extra<00:03:39.950> solder<00:03:40.250> there<00:03:40.430> just<00:03:40.610> to<00:03:40.700> make<00:03:40.820> sure

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
extra solder there just to make sure

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.390 
extra solder there just to make sure
they're<00:03:41.090> a<00:03:41.120> good<00:03:41.269> good<00:03:41.540> strong<00:03:41.840> contact<00:03:42.400> then

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
they're a good good strong contact then

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.819 
they're a good good strong contact then
we<00:03:43.489> go<00:03:43.670> ahead<00:03:43.730> and<00:03:43.970> plug<00:03:44.150> it<00:03:44.299> in<00:03:44.590> we<00:03:45.590> still

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
we go ahead and plug it in we still

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.430 
we go ahead and plug it in we still
don't<00:03:45.980> have<00:03:46.299> any<00:03:47.299> we<00:03:48.019> still<00:03:48.230> don't<00:03:48.410> have

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
don't have any we still don't have

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.490 
don't have any we still don't have
auxilary<00:03:49.400> input<00:03:49.549> yet<00:03:50.180> so<00:03:50.510> let's<00:03:51.140> plug<00:03:51.320> this

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
auxilary input yet so let's plug this

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.910 
auxilary input yet so let's plug this
Jack<00:03:51.769> and<00:03:51.799> down<00:03:52.070> here<00:03:52.459> and<00:03:53.590> give<00:03:54.590> it<00:03:54.620> a<00:03:54.739> quick

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
Jack and down here and give it a quick

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.260 
Jack and down here and give it a quick
test<00:03:55.099> before<00:03:55.520> you<00:03:55.610> reassemble<00:03:55.819> it

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
test before you reassemble it

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.430 
test before you reassemble it
so<00:03:59.270> now<00:03:59.390> I<00:03:59.450> should<00:03:59.660> better<00:03:59.810> hit<00:03:59.960> auxilary

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
so now I should better hit auxilary

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.910
