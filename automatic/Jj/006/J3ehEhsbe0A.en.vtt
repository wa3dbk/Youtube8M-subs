00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.170
 a tutorial video to show you a pc 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.269

 a little Christmas gift so good 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.320
 I plan to buy a laptop for 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.670
 for Christmas so a pc bond mainly 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.140
 for video games so I wanted 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.480
 something powerful enough for 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.650
 replace my current fixed pc that I 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.990
 will have to give back then I fell 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.020
 on this computer that typically 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.600
 crack on it good after I'm not no 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.809
 more the IT professional 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.160
 but me, I would advise you if 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.750
 you have 1 949 to buy this computer 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.180
 knowing that I'm going there is looking for a 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.059
 Few feet is really a 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.980
 excellent computer I remember that 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.920
 it's a trick n 316 vz does two three 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.550
 Matches a little long these three chicks 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.579
 full hd 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.979
 maybe important it's a detail to no 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.869
 not neglect especially for gamers and 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.490
 yade and bonus and questions from 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.920
 external bass for dogs if you 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.550
 do not play with headphones will do I do not 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.700
 I was not stumbling 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.240
 I have my helmet it has a 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.030
 i7 processor 36 30 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.080
 so you like the difference is that good 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.480
 most pc 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.640
 17 it's often a 36 10 when you 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.150
 can take a small pc i7 to banks 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.190
 taker 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.110
 but kind to 2000 euros but otherwise it's 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.610
 often 36 May 10 quiet cassin 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.660
 when he is much more powerful in 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.020
 big him he can the most powerful 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.730
 wigan drama 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.530
 I think it's enough for me 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.690
 did not want 6 I did not want 12 because 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.570
 after 12 had to change outright 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.170
 operating system did not want a 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.870
 tea in Senegal during this failure at 1t 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.230
 world 5 theo me it does not bother me and 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.560
 at important a nvidia geforce gt 650 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.180
 m 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.420
 but with two gigas to say well 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.880
 obviously I was 650m basically this is the 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.209
 61st best graphics cards from 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:11.239
 moment in august on pc laptop 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.170
 it's pretty good to windows 8 which 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.860
 windows 8 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.239
 good it's true that I patrol windows 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.610
 8 but hey it is better still 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:28.430
 to have something new about 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:30.440
 antennas of the flaps description the pc 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.180
 really beautiful because like everything but 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.190
 good the picture is weird compared to the 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.830
 split wooden rocker the limit a mac 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.390
 and there had to enter a ppp so by 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.420
 those preferring a little thick for better 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.640
 beware especially if we play so series 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.180
 7 third generation so that's 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.319
 up to 3.4 giguere are rarely 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.700
 30/06/10 that goes with him only up to 3,3 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.560
 giguÃ¨re we good it's not important 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.599
 but it's important to know who 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.879
 the most powerful still he associated 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.099
 a 550m gt with two dedicated gigas and 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.200
 it's important the sig has dedicated his big 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.280
 sweeping hippies their own league 1 they 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.530
 do not need to use other 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.140
 gigabyte so basically always a fluidity 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.510
 perfect for your games so it's very 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.489
 important for gamers 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.250
 so it's a fact it's super power 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.750
 of an office pc to gamer 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.340
 ultimate performance finally short it's 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.569
 really for video montages the 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.180
 photo editing video games 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.769
 demanding and computing power 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.620
 curly really exactly the target 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.810
 we just have a 4 and 17.3 inches 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.069
 with a full hd screen that's really 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.780
 important that my young find 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.280
 other computers all but well there the cold 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.579
 was not full hd which is a little 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.519
 pity world and its super good quality 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.380
 apparently usb 3.0 ports good this is 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.109
 normal but to note that this is 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.329
 much faster than the 2.0 the gt 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:50.419
 650 for better autonomy of 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:53.150
 stunning horse graphics during the ag 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:55.489
 658 it's going to be enough for you 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.010
 knowing that I there on my current pc 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.810
 girl I have a 450 a 405 sorry 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.470
 so it's really the graphics card 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.540
 good for it 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.160
 and yet for games I'm 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.440
 in France I do not play no 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.450
 more to games too big but I'm fine 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.060
 I manage the world 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.220
 I prefer to see 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.140
 cluster of more powerful so that's 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.299
 really the computer I advise you 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.959
 for christmas if you have a 2000 budget 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.380
 euros approximately 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.090
 do you really take this pc that I find 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.220
 that I recommend forgiveness strongly 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.660
 especially for gamers statis it's not 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.550
 good if you just want to go on 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.600
 Internet do not take it is useless to 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.520
 will be much too powerful 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.840
 but if you are like me you want 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.940
 play the game you really have it a 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.850
 very very powerful doing lots of tasks 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.070
 at the same time open skyrim download 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.840
 a game and skin of a video and all in 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.310
 same time without buggy without problem 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.590
 take it there is no problem that is 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.540
 a sure thing do not worry I 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.760
 will buy me 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.440
 normally after if you have 2 pc at 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.910
 same price for the same quality 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.690
 better 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.580
 please not inform you what 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.900
 which is good for now I'm on 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.639
 this pc there so if you propose me 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.380
 nothing true that I will take the pc for 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.380
 what they are and 8 years I will make you 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.530
 videos on this pc test videos 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.919
 of performance the design adding a 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.600
 rather nice thing and it's good to 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.280
 specify a blu-ray player good that serve 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.060
 not much but it's still 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.060
 better to have one 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.810
 really nice there is a video if 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:27.569
 you can watch it if you want 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:29.710
 the good connection a little disgusting 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:31.960
 Finally, I would advise you 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.990
 really take this pc so if you 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.430
 are interested and then he was not me 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.430
 give your opinion in the comments
