you<00:01:02.430> got<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.640> use<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.780> gotta<00:01:03.960> use

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
you got to use it and you gotta use

fungal and you can you know die with

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.410 
fungal and you can you know die with
your<00:01:08.280> investors<00:01:08.729> before<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.060> get<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.210> phone<00:01:09.330> go

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
your investors before you get a phone go

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.120 
your investors before you get a phone go
off<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.750> all<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.930> kind<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.110> stuff<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.979> there

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
off and all that kind of stuff so there

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.560 
off and all that kind of stuff so there
has<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> much<00:01:11.580> harder<00:01:11.760> time<00:01:11.850> dealing<00:01:12.360> with

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
has a much harder time dealing with

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.280 
has a much harder time dealing with
things<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.990> require<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:13.740> then<00:01:14.010> then

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
things that require a we then then

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.450 
things that require a we then then
Protoss<00:01:16.290> or<00:01:16.470> tearing<00:01:16.920> um<00:01:17.630> so<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.720> idea<00:01:18.840> here

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
Protoss or tearing um so the idea here

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.210 
Protoss or tearing um so the idea here
I'm<00:01:21.200> hopefully<00:01:22.200> not<00:01:22.409> going<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.710> give<00:01:22.979> everyone

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
I'm hopefully not going to give everyone

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.130 
I'm hopefully not going to give everyone
motion<00:01:23.670> sickness<00:01:23.909> by<00:01:24.240> being<00:01:24.479> locked<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.900> first

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
motion sickness by being locked in first

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.760 
motion sickness by being locked in first
person<00:01:25.320> mode<00:01:25.680> but<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> idea<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.770> not

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
person mode but the idea here is to not

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.880 
person mode but the idea here is to not
get<00:01:29.729> or<00:01:30.030> spend<00:01:30.390> gas<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.290> we're<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.860> to

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
get or spend gas so we're just going to

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.020 
get or spend gas so we're just going to
try<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.159> maximize<00:01:32.460> our<00:01:33.180> mineral<00:01:33.869> income<00:01:34.590> and

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
try to maximize our mineral income and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.640 
try to maximize our mineral income and
then<00:01:36.030> build<00:01:36.689> 10<00:01:37.020> racks<00:01:37.290> right<00:01:37.740> off<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:39.030> uh

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
then build 10 racks right off and uh

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.920 
then build 10 racks right off and uh
keep<00:01:40.650> up<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:41.070> supply<00:01:41.579> depots<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.000> SUVs<00:01:42.689> so

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
keep up on supply depots and SUVs so

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.210 
keep up on supply depots and SUVs so
that<00:01:43.079> we<00:01:43.170> never<00:01:43.350> miss<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:44.600> an<00:01:45.600> SCV<00:01:46.220> production

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
that we never miss a an SCV production

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.910 
that we never miss a an SCV production
cycle<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.970> we<00:01:48.000> never<00:01:48.240> miss<00:01:48.689> we<00:01:49.409> never<00:01:49.560> supply

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920

cycle and we never miss we never supply
block<00:01:50.130> ourselves<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.790> then<00:01:51.420> just<00:01:51.780> try<00:01:51.960> to

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
block ourselves and then just try to

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.139 
block ourselves and then just try to
never<00:01:52.259> miss<00:01:52.530> any<00:01:52.770> any<00:01:53.100> marine<00:01:53.520> production

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
never miss any any marine production

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.200 
never miss any any marine production
cycles<00:01:54.509> either

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.529 

so<00:01:58.320> soft<00:01:59.320> cap<00:01:59.619> saturation<00:02:00.490> on<00:02:00.579> one<00:02:00.759> basis<00:02:01.149> 16

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
so soft cap saturation on one basis 16

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.020 
so soft cap saturation on one basis 16
workers<00:02:01.899> so<00:02:02.079> our<00:02:02.229> goal<00:02:02.469> is<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.890> get<00:02:03.039> 16<00:02:03.609> workers

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
workers so our goal is to get 16 workers

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.300 
workers so our goal is to get 16 workers
on<00:02:04.439> our<00:02:05.439> main<00:02:05.679> and<00:02:05.979> then<00:02:06.880> start<00:02:07.780> our<00:02:08.310> natural

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.520 
on our main and then start our natural
immediately<00:02:09.849> afterwards<00:02:10.360> so<00:02:10.780> that<00:02:11.080> we<00:02:11.349> never

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
immediately afterwards so that we never

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.390 
immediately afterwards so that we never
have<00:02:11.800> to<00:02:12.269> go<00:02:13.269> over<00:02:13.660> max<00:02:13.930> saturation<00:02:14.590> if<00:02:15.250> you

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
have to go over max saturation if you

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.670 
have to go over max saturation if you
want<00:02:15.640> our<00:02:15.819> natural<00:02:16.299> to<00:02:16.420> be<00:02:16.450> up<00:02:16.690> before<00:02:17.049> we<00:02:17.470> get

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
want our natural to be up before we get

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.970 
want our natural to be up before we get
our<00:02:17.890> 23rd<00:02:18.879> worker<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:20.470> that<00:02:20.680> we<00:02:20.769> can<00:02:20.950> just

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
our 23rd worker so that we can just

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.350 
our 23rd worker so that we can just
transfer<00:02:21.370> workers<00:02:21.700> down<00:02:21.849> to<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.090> low<00:02:22.180> ground

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
transfer workers down to the low ground

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.150 
transfer workers down to the low ground
and<00:02:22.569> then<00:02:22.660> still<00:02:23.049> be<00:02:23.230> mining<00:02:23.860> at<00:02:23.980> full

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
and then still be mining at full

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.190 
and then still be mining at full
capacity<00:02:24.450> with<00:02:25.450> only<00:02:25.660> minerals<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.989> do<00:02:29.079> this

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
capacity with only minerals to do this

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.960 
capacity with only minerals to do this
you<00:02:29.349> obviously<00:02:29.500> have<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.220> build<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.579> second

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
you obviously have to build the second

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.819 
you obviously have to build the second
command<00:02:31.569> center<00:02:31.840> quite<00:02:32.170> early<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.560> you'll

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
command center quite early and you'll

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.009 
command center quite early and you'll
also<00:02:33.220> have<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.790> build<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.090> in<00:02:34.239> place<00:02:34.540> you<00:02:34.810> can't

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
also have to build it in place you can't

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.330 
also have to build it in place you can't
be<00:02:35.170> floating<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.650> anywhere<00:02:35.980> because<00:02:36.099> that

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
be floating it anywhere because that

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.789 
be floating it anywhere because that
adds<00:02:36.519> like<00:02:36.819> a<00:02:37.030> minute<00:02:37.420> or<00:02:37.510> more<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.349> amount

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
adds like a minute or more to the amount

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.569 
adds like a minute or more to the amount
of<00:02:38.860> time<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.069> takes<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.370> get<00:02:39.519> any<00:02:39.730> place<00:02:39.970> um<00:02:41.579> so

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
of time it takes to get any place um so

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.729 
of time it takes to get any place um so
yeah<00:02:42.760> simple<00:02:43.540> simple<00:02:43.959> yo<00:02:44.170> different<00:02:44.620> the

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
yeah simple simple yo different the

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.039 
yeah simple simple yo different the
reason<00:02:44.980> I<00:02:45.040> call<00:02:45.220> this<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.549> mineral<00:02:46.390> drill<00:02:46.780> the

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
reason I call this a mineral drill the

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.449 
reason I call this a mineral drill the
reason<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.349> call<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.680> drill<00:02:47.890> is<00:02:48.010> because<00:02:48.190> it

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
reason I call it a drill is because it

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.789 
reason I call it a drill is because it
it<00:02:48.730> helps<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.269> work<00:02:49.420> on<00:02:49.540> your<00:02:49.599> macro<00:02:50.140> to

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
it helps you to work on your macro to

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.650 
it helps you to work on your macro to
work<00:02:50.950> on<00:02:51.099> never<00:02:51.370> supply<00:02:51.730> blocking<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.450> never

work on never supply blocking and never

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.319 
work on never supply blocking and never
missing<00:02:53.110> SCV<00:02:53.980> cues<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.640> all<00:02:55.000> that<00:02:55.120> kind<00:02:55.299> of

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
missing SCV cues and all that kind of

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.240 
missing SCV cues and all that kind of
stuff<00:02:55.390> without<00:02:56.230> having<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.739> think<00:02:56.980> too<00:02:57.220> deeply

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
stuff without having to think too deeply

stuff without having to think too deeply
about<00:02:57.730> which<00:02:58.060> units<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.599> make<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.079> what

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
about which units to make and what

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.620 
about which units to make and what
percentage<00:02:59.950> of<00:03:00.160> your<00:03:00.220> gas<00:03:00.880> should<00:03:01.209> go<00:03:01.420> into

percentage of your gas should go into

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
don't want to go latter instead you just

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.569 
don't want to go latter instead you just

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
macro with your brain half turned on

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.710 
macro with your brain half turned on
this<00:03:21.670> is<00:03:21.819> a<00:03:21.849> good<00:03:22.030> way<00:03:22.180> to<00:03:22.239> practice<00:03:22.389> your

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
this is a good way to practice your

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.129 
this is a good way to practice your
macro<00:03:23.910> but<00:03:24.910> don't<00:03:25.090> try<00:03:25.239> to<00:03:25.299> win<00:03:25.720> games<00:03:25.989> with

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
macro but don't try to win games with

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.670 
macro but don't try to win games with
this<00:03:26.319> guy's

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
this guy's

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.619 
this guy's
we<00:03:28.159> use<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.459> letter<00:03:28.840> to<00:03:29.840> drill<00:03:30.170> to<00:03:30.769> drill<00:03:31.629> so

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
we use the letter to drill to drill so

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.970 
we use the letter to drill to drill so
basically<00:03:34.719> first<00:03:35.719> priorities<00:03:36.230> depot<00:03:36.590> second

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
basically first priorities depot second

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.729 
basically first priorities depot second
priorities<00:03:37.430> SUVs<00:03:38.299> and<00:03:38.629> third<00:03:39.230> priority<00:03:39.500> is

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
priorities SUVs and third priority is

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.770 
priorities SUVs and third priority is
spending<00:03:40.250> money<00:03:40.519> on<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:41.120> racks<00:03:41.510> that<00:03:41.689> you

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
spending money on the racks that you

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.740 
spending money on the racks that you
already<00:03:41.900> have<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:43.180> after<00:03:44.180> that<00:03:44.299> is<00:03:44.540> new

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
already have and after that is new

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.379 
already have and after that is new
buildings<00:03:45.139> so<00:03:45.650> new<00:03:46.579> buildings<00:03:46.909> can<00:03:47.090> be<00:03:47.120> more

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
buildings so new buildings can be more

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.720 
buildings so new buildings can be more
racks<00:03:47.629> usually<00:03:48.170> is<00:03:48.319> it<00:03:48.650> can<00:03:48.829> be<00:03:48.950> more<00:03:49.400> command

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
racks usually is it can be more command

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.300 
racks usually is it can be more command
centers<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:50.209> can<00:03:50.329> be<00:03:50.420> gas<00:03:50.840> geysers<00:03:51.319> techlabs

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
centers it can be gas geysers techlabs

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.849 
centers it can be gas geysers techlabs
all<00:03:53.150> that<00:03:53.359> kind<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:53.569> stuff<00:03:53.629> so<00:03:53.959> that<00:03:54.530> means

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
all that kind of stuff so that means

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.470 
all that kind of stuff so that means
that<00:03:55.040> until<00:03:55.459> you've<00:03:55.639> done<00:03:55.819> the<00:03:55.969> first<00:03:56.150> three

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
that until you've done the first three

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.670 
that until you've done the first three
you're<00:03:56.780> never<00:03:56.989> going<00:03:57.170> to<00:03:57.200> build<00:03:57.409> any<00:03:57.560> new

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
you're never going to build any new

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.640 
you're never going to build any new
buildings<00:04:01.450> so<00:04:02.450> I'm<00:04:02.540> up<00:04:02.689> to<00:04:02.810> nine<00:04:03.019> racks<00:04:03.349> one

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
buildings so I'm up to nine racks one

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.179 
buildings so I'm up to nine racks one
more<00:04:03.859> and<00:04:04.040> I'm<00:04:04.129> a<00:04:04.250> ten<00:04:05.650> usually<00:04:06.650> shoot<00:04:06.829> for<00:04:07.040> 10

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:07.189 
more and I'm a ten usually shoot for 10

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.449 
more and I'm a ten usually shoot for 10
or<00:04:07.220> 11<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:09.290> benchmarks<00:04:09.799> you<00:04:09.889> want<00:04:10.040> you<00:04:10.310> want

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
or 11 the benchmarks you want you want

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.429 
or 11 the benchmarks you want you want
to<00:04:10.549> check<00:04:10.669> yourself<00:04:10.819> on<00:04:11.239> we're<00:04:11.930> coming<00:04:11.959> up<00:04:12.319> on

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:12.439 
to check yourself on we're coming up on

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:17.529 
to check yourself on we're coming up on
ten<00:04:12.680> minutes<00:04:12.980> here<00:04:13.219> to<00:04:14.150> do<00:04:14.989> ten<00:04:15.650> minutes<00:04:16.539> 44

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
ten minutes here to do ten minutes 44

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.629 
ten minutes here to do ten minutes 44
workers<00:04:17.870> so<00:04:18.109> 44<00:04:18.680> workers<00:04:18.949> at<00:04:19.070> ten<00:04:19.190> minutes<00:04:19.489> is

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
workers so 44 workers at ten minutes is

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.909 
workers so 44 workers at ten minutes is
is<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:20.239> benchmark<00:04:20.509> that<00:04:20.900> I've<00:04:21.620> said<00:04:21.889> a

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
is the benchmark that I've said a

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.950 
is the benchmark that I've said a
million<00:04:22.160> times<00:04:22.280> when<00:04:22.759> talking<00:04:22.970> about<00:04:23.120> dvz<00:04:23.570> but

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
million times when talking about dvz but

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.939 
million times when talking about dvz but
also<00:04:24.110> for<00:04:24.500> this<00:04:24.650> and<00:04:24.949> uh<00:04:26.410> army<00:04:27.410> spending<00:04:27.770> quite

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
also for this and uh army spending quite

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.129 
also for this and uh army spending quite
low<00:04:28.160> because<00:04:28.820> again<00:04:29.150> you<00:04:29.479> build<00:04:29.720> this<00:04:29.870> many

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
low because again you build this many

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.870 
low because again you build this many
racks<00:04:30.470> that's<00:04:30.979> a<00:04:31.099> whole<00:04:31.280> bunch<00:04:31.490> of<00:04:31.580> money<00:04:31.760> you

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
racks that's a whole bunch of money you

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.360 
racks that's a whole bunch of money you
didn't<00:04:32.240> spend<00:04:32.449> on<00:04:32.630> your<00:04:32.720> army<00:04:33.020> same<00:04:33.740> with<00:04:33.889> SUVs

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
didn't spend on your army same with SUVs

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.040 
didn't spend on your army same with SUVs
you<00:04:34.610> build<00:04:34.789> this<00:04:34.909> many<00:04:35.150> SUVs<00:04:35.570> in<00:04:35.599> an<00:04:35.840> extra

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
you build this many SUVs in an extra

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.120 
you build this many SUVs in an extra
command<00:04:36.320> center<00:04:36.530> it's<00:04:36.680> a<00:04:36.710> whole<00:04:36.860> bunch<00:04:37.039> of

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
command center it's a whole bunch of

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.680 
command center it's a whole bunch of
money<00:04:37.280> you<00:04:37.370> didn't<00:04:37.639> spend<00:04:37.820> an<00:04:37.940> army<00:04:38.270> so<00:04:38.449> i

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
money you didn't spend an army so i

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.379 
money you didn't spend an army so i
really<00:04:39.380> only<00:04:39.590> spent<00:04:39.889> 2500<00:04:40.280> benchmark<00:04:41.090> for<00:04:41.150> a

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
really only spent 2500 benchmark for a

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.200 
really only spent 2500 benchmark for a
really<00:04:41.840> heavy<00:04:42.020> army<00:04:42.470> plays<00:04:42.710> 3500<00:04:43.610> so<00:04:43.789> I'm<00:04:43.849> you

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
really heavy army plays 3500 so I'm you

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.570 
really heavy army plays 3500 so I'm you
know<00:04:44.300> pretty<00:04:44.539> smaller<00:04:45.139> made<00:04:45.380> ten<00:04:45.560> minutes<00:04:45.860> but

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
know pretty smaller made ten minutes but

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.250 
know pretty smaller made ten minutes but
you'll<00:04:46.760> notice<00:04:46.940> I'm<00:04:47.240> going<00:04:47.419> to<00:04:47.479> hit<00:04:47.599> 200<00:04:48.080> units

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
you'll notice I'm going to hit 200 units

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.350 
you'll notice I'm going to hit 200 units
pace<00:04:48.440> at<00:04:48.620> 14<00:04:49.010> minutes<00:04:49.340> so<00:04:49.610> that's<00:04:49.820> really<00:04:50.090> what

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
pace at 14 minutes so that's really what

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.360 
pace at 14 minutes so that's really what
you're<00:04:50.479> shooting<00:04:50.630> for<00:04:50.960> get<00:04:51.650> to<00:04:51.800> 200<00:04:51.919> units

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
you're shooting for get to 200 units

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.460 
you're shooting for get to 200 units
pace<00:04:52.610> look<00:04:52.970> at<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.150> clock<00:04:53.419> if<00:04:53.720> it<00:04:54.020> was<00:04:54.139> after

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
pace look at the clock if it was after

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.029 
pace look at the clock if it was after
14<00:04:54.830> minutes<00:04:55.130> start<00:04:55.849> over<00:04:56.120> try<00:04:56.300> again<00:04:56.539> so<00:04:57.259> this

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
14 minutes start over try again so this

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:59.350 
14 minutes start over try again so this
is<00:04:58.220> just<00:04:58.340> a<00:04:58.520> way<00:04:58.639> to<00:04:58.669> make<00:04:58.940> sure<00:04:58.970> that<00:04:59.330> you're

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
is just a way to make sure that you're

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.240 
is just a way to make sure that you're
capable<00:04:59.720> keeping<00:05:00.349> up<00:05:00.470> on<00:05:00.590> you<00:05:00.740> I'm<00:05:00.919> really

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
capable keeping up on you I'm really

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.610 
capable keeping up on you I'm really
simple<00:05:01.909> the<00:05:02.120> simplest<00:05:02.479> possible<00:05:02.720> macro<00:05:03.409> and

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
simple the simplest possible macro and

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.040 
simple the simplest possible macro and
just<00:05:04.190> getting<00:05:04.520> straight<00:05:04.940> to<00:05:05.060> 200<00:05:05.599> units<00:05:05.840> pace

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
just getting straight to 200 units pace

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.710 
just getting straight to 200 units pace
at<00:05:06.259> 14<00:05:06.590> minutes<00:05:06.889> you<00:05:07.310> know<00:05:07.460> by<00:05:07.880> like<00:05:08.389> buy<00:05:08.599> them

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
at 14 minutes you know by like buy them

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.990 
at 14 minutes you know by like buy them
on<00:05:08.810> the<00:05:08.870> face<00:05:09.050> I<00:05:09.380> am<00:05:10.070> setting<00:05:10.520> myself<00:05:10.639> up

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
on the face I am setting myself up

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.390 
on the face I am setting myself up
getting<00:05:11.780> quadruple<00:05:12.380> gas<00:05:12.560> setting<00:05:12.949> myself<00:05:13.070> up

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
getting quadruple gas setting myself up

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.730 
getting quadruple gas setting myself up
to<00:05:14.150> transition<00:05:15.110> into<00:05:15.229> something<00:05:15.620> more

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
to transition into something more

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.680 
to transition into something more
reasonable<00:05:15.919> like<00:05:16.370> factories<00:05:16.909> and<00:05:17.150> star<00:05:17.419> ports

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
reasonable like factories and star ports

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.159 
reasonable like factories and star ports
and<00:05:17.810> stuff<00:05:18.970> but<00:05:19.970> i'll<00:05:20.180> hit<00:05:20.389> 200<00:05:20.780> units<00:05:20.990> face

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
and stuff but i'll hit 200 units face

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:22.930 
and stuff but i'll hit 200 units face
before<00:05:21.380> any<00:05:21.680> of<00:05:21.740> that<00:05:21.830> stuff<00:05:22.070> comes<00:05:22.430> out<00:05:22.610> so

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
before any of that stuff comes out so

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.480 
before any of that stuff comes out so
really<00:05:23.330> if<00:05:23.539> you<00:05:24.259> just<00:05:24.289> want<00:05:24.860> to<00:05:24.949> try<00:05:25.099> the<00:05:25.190> drill

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
really if you just want to try the drill

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.010 
really if you just want to try the drill
see<00:05:25.669> if<00:05:25.759> you<00:05:25.849> can<00:05:25.970> hit<00:05:26.030> 200<00:05:26.539> and<00:05:26.659> then<00:05:26.750> stop

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
see if you can hit 200 and then stop

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.420 
see if you can hit 200 and then stop
don't<00:05:27.380> make<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.680> engineering<00:05:28.039> bays<00:05:28.190> don't
