00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
guys points here on the public tester

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.320 
guys points here on the public tester
i'm<00:00:02.159> here<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.399> talk<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.639> you<00:00:02.760> guys<00:00:02.790> about<00:00:03.090> the

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
i'm here to talk to you guys about the

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.300 
i'm here to talk to you guys about the
potential<00:00:03.659> of<00:00:03.870> kali<00:00:04.080> changes<00:00:04.589> now<00:00:05.069> this<00:00:05.190> is<00:00:05.279> a

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
potential of kali changes now this is a

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.559 
potential of kali changes now this is a
bit<00:00:05.490> late<00:00:05.670> because<00:00:05.879> this<00:00:06.299> is<00:00:06.420> probably

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
bit late because this is probably

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:07.909 
bit late because this is probably
actually<00:00:06.960> going<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.259> be<00:00:07.290> in<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.440> patch<00:00:07.620> that

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
actually going to be in the patch that

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.410 
actually going to be in the patch that
happens<00:00:08.250> tomorrow<00:00:08.460> so<00:00:08.910> you<00:00:09.000> don't<00:00:09.150> get<00:00:09.240> too

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
happens tomorrow so you don't get too

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.910 
happens tomorrow so you don't get too
much<00:00:09.599> heads<00:00:09.900> up<00:00:10.080> for<00:00:10.260> me<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.440> time<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.679> was

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
much heads up for me this time I was

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.980 
much heads up for me this time I was
kind<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.160> negligent<00:00:11.639> on<00:00:11.759> doing<00:00:11.969> this<00:00:12.059> one<00:00:12.269> but

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
kind of negligent on doing this one but

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.570 
kind of negligent on doing this one but
nonetheless<00:00:13.469> as<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.860> can<00:00:13.980> see<00:00:14.099> above<00:00:14.130> my<00:00:14.549> head

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
nonetheless as you can see above my head

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.760 
nonetheless as you can see above my head
in<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.089> text<00:00:15.480> file<00:00:15.839> thing<00:00:16.289> that's<00:00:16.500> on<00:00:16.619> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
in the text file thing that's on the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.220 
in the text file thing that's on the
screen<00:00:17.449> twilight<00:00:18.449> rod<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.779> being<00:00:18.960> changed

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
screen twilight rod is being changed

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
screen twilight rod is being changed
that's<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> only<00:00:19.890> thing<00:00:19.980> that's<00:00:20.130> been

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
that's the only thing that's been

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.330 
that's the only thing that's been
changed<00:00:20.580> on<00:00:20.730> her<00:00:20.880> on<00:00:21.480> here<00:00:21.930> right<00:00:22.109> now<00:00:22.340> but

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
changed on her on here right now but

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.460 
changed on her on here right now but
this<00:00:24.180> more<00:00:24.510> or<00:00:24.630> less<00:00:24.750> looks<00:00:24.930> like<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.080> nerve<00:00:25.350> to

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
this more or less looks like a nerve to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.529 
this more or less looks like a nerve to
me<00:00:25.590> I'd<00:00:26.070> probably<00:00:26.400> say<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.640> collie<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.090> one<00:00:27.420> of

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
me I'd probably say a collie is one of

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.390 
me I'd probably say a collie is one of
the<00:00:27.630> few<00:00:28.170> champions<00:00:28.439> I'm<00:00:28.859> absolutely<00:00:29.189> not

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
the few champions I'm absolutely not

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.859 
the few champions I'm absolutely not
qualified<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.939> talk<00:00:30.090> about<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.449> all<00:00:30.570> because<00:00:30.840> i

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
qualified to talk about it all because i

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.479 
qualified to talk about it all because i
don't<00:00:31.230> think<00:00:31.380> i've<00:00:31.500> ever<00:00:31.619> played<00:00:32.070> her<00:00:32.279> she's

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
don't think i've ever played her she's

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.040 
don't think i've ever played her she's
one<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> few<00:00:32.969> champions<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.630> I've<00:00:33.840> never

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
one of the few champions that I've never

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.860 
one of the few champions that I've never
touched<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.530> all<00:00:34.710> because<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.969> kind<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.270> what

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
touched it all because just kind of what

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.569 
touched it all because just kind of what
I<00:00:36.899> know<00:00:36.989> replaced<00:00:37.469> out<00:00:37.680> doesn't<00:00:38.100> suit<00:00:38.340> what<00:00:38.550> I

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
I know replaced out doesn't suit what I

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.639 
I know replaced out doesn't suit what I
like<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.940> do<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.180> all<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.629> don't<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.410> sort

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
like to do it all I don't like this sort

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.280 
like to do it all I don't like this sort
of<00:00:40.820> snowballing<00:00:41.820> clean<00:00:42.270> up<00:00:42.450> assassin<00:00:42.989> kind<00:00:43.200> of

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
of snowballing clean up assassin kind of

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.350 
of snowballing clean up assassin kind of
thing<00:00:44.329> but<00:00:45.329> narrate<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:47.850> Twilight

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
thing but narrate the the Twilight

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.600 
thing but narrate the the Twilight
shroud<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.809> w<00:00:49.200> no<00:00:49.410> longer<00:00:49.770> gives<00:00:49.950> armor<00:00:50.430> and

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
shroud the w no longer gives armor and

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.150 
shroud the w no longer gives armor and
magic<00:00:50.640> resistance<00:00:51.710> instead<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.829> gives<00:00:53.039> a

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
magic resistance instead it gives a

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.670 
magic resistance instead it gives a
burst<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.670> movement<00:00:54.059> speed<00:00:54.300> which<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.230> decays

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
burst of movement speed which it decays

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.319 
burst of movement speed which it decays
so<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:56.039> not<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.340> even<00:00:56.760> your<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.210> know

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
so it's not like even your you know

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.270 
so it's not like even your you know
moving<00:00:57.539> at<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> crazy<00:00:58.170> speed<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> entire<00:00:59.010> time

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
moving at a crazy speed the entire time

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.590 
moving at a crazy speed the entire time
so<00:00:59.309> i'll<00:00:59.520> show<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.699> what<00:00:59.760> i<00:00:59.820> mean<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.359> drop

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
so i'll show you what i mean you drop

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.049 
so i'll show you what i mean you drop
this<00:01:00.780> normal<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.260> get<00:01:01.379> armor<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.770> stuff<00:01:02.059> so

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
this normal you get armor and stuff so

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.960 
this normal you get armor and stuff so
you<00:01:03.120> leave<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.780> get<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.710> back<00:01:04.920> over<00:01:05.250> about

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
you leave it you get it back over about

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.640 
you leave it you get it back over about
one<00:01:06.180> second<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.689> get<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> big<00:01:07.110> burst<00:01:07.439> of

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
one second you get the big burst of

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.960 
one second you get the big burst of
speed<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:08.310> leave<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.640> again<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.510> so

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
speed you leave it again and so

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.520 
speed you leave it again and so
basically<00:01:11.970> every<00:01:12.390> time<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.689> briefly<00:01:13.049> unced

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
basically every time you briefly unced

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.929 
basically every time you briefly unced
else<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.920> then<00:01:14.010> restart<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.549> get<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.790> burst

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
else and then restart you get the burst

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.310 
else and then restart you get the burst
speed<00:01:15.240> again<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.689> can<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:15.960> attack

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
speed again so you can like attack

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.620 
speed again so you can like attack
things<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.920> then<00:01:17.250> your<00:01:17.369> reese<00:01:17.610> tell<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.150> then

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
things and then your reese tell and then

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.390 
things and then your reese tell and then
we<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.320> then<00:01:19.650> your<00:01:19.770> reached<00:01:20.009> out<00:01:20.220> and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
we do that and then your reached out and

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.120 
we do that and then your reached out and
you<00:01:20.490> get<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> burst<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.000> speed<00:01:21.090> again<00:01:21.479> um<00:01:22.130> that

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
you get the burst of speed again um that

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.210 
you get the burst of speed again um that
I<00:01:23.400> mean<00:01:24.170> thematically<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.439> seems<00:01:25.710> like<00:01:25.950> that

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
I mean thematically it seems like that

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.399 
I mean thematically it seems like that
works<00:01:26.670> better<00:01:27.030> with<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.240> collie<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.630> suppose<00:01:28.020> but

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
works better with a collie I suppose but

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.429 
works better with a collie I suppose but
that's<00:01:29.210> most<00:01:30.210> likely<00:01:30.390> above<00:01:30.960> there<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.200> mean

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
that's most likely above there I mean

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.440 
that's most likely above there I mean
I'd<00:01:31.560> nerfed<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.979> like<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.250> don't<00:01:32.400> see<00:01:32.579> how<00:01:32.759> this

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
I'd nerfed I like I don't see how this

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.600 
I'd nerfed I like I don't see how this
could<00:01:33.509> actually<00:01:33.840> be<00:01:34.020> better<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.439> mean<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.369> move

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
could actually be better I mean you move

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.569 
could actually be better I mean you move
around<00:01:35.759> faster<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.390> can<00:01:36.450> avoid<00:01:36.720> things<00:01:37.110> but

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
around faster and can avoid things but

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:43.130 
around faster and can avoid things but
fifty<00:01:38.579> are<00:01:38.729> more<00:01:38.939> mr<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> lot<00:01:42.020> you<00:01:43.020> know

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
fifty are more mr is a lot you know

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.499 
fifty are more mr is a lot you know
maybe<00:01:43.470> if<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.130> bursts<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.790> speed<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.180> entire

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
maybe if this bursts of speed the entire

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.120 
maybe if this bursts of speed the entire
time<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.140> know<00:01:46.229> continuously<00:01:46.829> gave<00:01:47.040> it

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
time just you know continuously gave it

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.889 
time just you know continuously gave it
to<00:01:47.220> me<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.579> left<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.970> thing<00:01:48.149> indicate<00:01:48.540> over<00:01:48.720> one

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
to me you left a thing indicate over one

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.109 
to me you left a thing indicate over one
second<00:01:49.350> let<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.560> run<00:01:49.740> out<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.100> fast<00:01:50.340> it

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
second let you run out of it fast it

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.730 
second let you run out of it fast it
would<00:01:51.360> be<00:01:51.630> nice<00:01:51.780> but<00:01:51.810> as<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.290> can<00:01:52.409> see<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
would be nice but as you can see the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.580 
would be nice but as you can see the
instant<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.189> leave<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.790> shroud<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
instant you leave the shroud this is the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.649 
instant you leave the shroud this is the
buff<00:01:55.920> goes<00:01:56.159> away<00:01:56.310> immediately<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:57.360> not<00:01:57.540> like

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
buff goes away immediately it's not like

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.030 
buff goes away immediately it's not like
a<00:01:57.750> decays<00:01:58.079> over<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.350> next<00:01:58.560> second<00:01:58.829> once<00:01:58.950> you

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
a decays over the next second once you

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.330 
a decays over the next second once you
leave<00:01:59.189> it<00:02:00.530> now<00:02:01.530> as<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.740> why<00:02:02.040> they're<00:02:02.310> doing

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
leave it now as to why they're doing

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.090 
leave it now as to why they're doing
this<00:02:02.610> um<00:02:03.420> well<00:02:04.020> i<00:02:04.049> guess<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.439> seems<00:02:04.680> like<00:02:04.920> why

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
this um well i guess it seems like why

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.280 
this um well i guess it seems like why
it<00:02:05.159> doesn't<00:02:05.610> like<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.060> top<00:02:06.600> lane<00:02:06.810> snowball

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
it doesn't like the top lane snowball

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.109 
it doesn't like the top lane snowball
akali<00:02:07.649> i<00:02:07.799> never<00:02:08.160> considered<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.700> much<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:09.030> an

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
akali i never considered it much of an

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.940 
akali i never considered it much of an
issue<00:02:09.239> i<00:02:09.420> mean<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.810> call<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.170> fairly<00:02:10.440> easy<00:02:10.590> to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
issue i mean the call is fairly easy to

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
issue i mean the call is fairly easy to
deal<00:02:11.099> with<00:02:11.129> in<00:02:11.340> lane<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.760> you

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
deal with in lane and you

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.480 
deal with in lane and you
maybe<00:02:12.270> let<00:02:12.540> her<00:02:12.570> snowball<00:02:13.110> it's<00:02:13.320> really<00:02:14.280> your

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
maybe let her snowball it's really your

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.020 
maybe let her snowball it's really your
own<00:02:14.670> fault<00:02:15.980> but<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.340> don't<00:02:17.730> know<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:17.940> guess

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
own fault but I don't know I guess

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.420 
own fault but I don't know I guess
bottom<00:02:18.720> line<00:02:18.900> is<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.530> only<00:02:19.650> lane<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.190> slowed

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
bottom line is the only lane that slowed

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.310 
bottom line is the only lane that slowed
to<00:02:20.550> snowball<00:02:20.940> out<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.180> control<00:02:21.480> i<00:02:21.510> suppose<00:02:21.840> top

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
to snowball out of control i suppose top

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.690 
to snowball out of control i suppose top
laners<00:02:22.680> have<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.920> content<00:02:23.250> ourselves<00:02:23.370> with

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
laners have to content ourselves with

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.180 
laners have to content ourselves with
being<00:02:23.940> tanks<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.420> whatnot<00:02:24.720> but<00:02:25.410> in<00:02:25.950> any<00:02:26.100> case

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
being tanks and whatnot but in any case

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.280 
being tanks and whatnot but in any case
see<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.120> guys<00:02:27.240> around<00:02:27.300> thanks<00:02:27.840> for<00:02:27.930> watching

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
and they like I said most likely this

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.750 
and they like I said most likely this

will be available in tomorrow's patch so
it's<00:02:33.570> coming<00:02:33.840> up<00:02:33.930> soon<00:02:34.140> I'll<00:02:34.350> see<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.500> guys
