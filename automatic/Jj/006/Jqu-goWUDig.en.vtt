00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
subscribers sent this to me and it

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.899 
subscribers sent this to me and it
actually<00:00:40.860> looked<00:00:41.190> pretty<00:00:41.250> cool<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.790> we're

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:41.909 
actually looked pretty cool so we're

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:44.390 
actually looked pretty cool so we're
gonna<00:00:42.000> give<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.420> try<00:00:42.979> so<00:00:43.979> let's<00:00:44.159> go<00:00:44.280> ahead

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
gonna give this a try so let's go ahead

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.520 
gonna give this a try so let's go ahead
and<00:00:44.519> select<00:00:44.790> some<00:00:45.120> options<00:00:45.150> here<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.260> for

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
and select some options here so for

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.170 
and select some options here so for
resolution<00:00:47.159> let's<00:00:47.309> go<00:00:47.460> ahead<00:00:47.729> oh<00:00:47.909> it<00:00:48.059> doesn't

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
resolution let's go ahead oh it doesn't

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.660 
resolution let's go ahead oh it doesn't
let<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.390> select<00:00:48.540> 1080p<00:00:48.839> that<00:00:49.350> sucks<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.519> let's

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
let you select 1080p that sucks so let's

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.369 
let you select 1080p that sucks so let's
do<00:00:50.790> 720p<00:00:52.190> and<00:00:53.690> well<00:00:54.690> actually<00:00:54.900> I<00:00:55.110> don't<00:00:55.199> want

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
do 720p and well actually I don't want

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.229 
do 720p and well actually I don't want
to<00:00:55.589> just<00:00:55.769> enable<00:00:56.040> everything<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.850> kind<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.059> want

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
to just enable everything I kind of want

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.579 
to just enable everything I kind of want
to<00:00:57.269> go<00:00:57.360> back<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.629> get<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> baseline<00:00:58.110> so<00:00:58.409> let's

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
to go back and get a baseline so let's

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.439 
to go back and get a baseline so let's
just<00:00:58.710> do<00:00:58.799> one<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.040> the<00:00:59.100> pre<00:00:59.400> the<00:00:59.909> pre<00:01:00.150> canned

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
just do one of the pre the pre canned

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.030 
just do one of the pre the pre canned
ones<00:01:00.659> so<00:01:00.900> anybody<00:01:01.110> else<00:01:01.290> can<00:01:01.589> just<00:01:01.769> run<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
ones so anybody else can just run the

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.500 
ones so anybody else can just run the
benchmark<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.549> post<00:01:02.729> the<00:01:02.909> results<00:01:03.059> too<00:01:03.390> so

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
benchmark and post the results too so

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.450 
benchmark and post the results too so
we're<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.659> gonna<00:01:03.809> do<00:01:04.019> cat<00:01:04.229> 1280<00:01:04.710> 720<00:01:05.070> and

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
we're just gonna do cat 1280 720 and

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.789 
we're just gonna do cat 1280 720 and
here<00:01:06.180> we<00:01:06.270> go<00:01:08.720> see<00:01:09.720> if<00:01:09.810> they<00:01:09.990> all<00:01:10.049> got<00:01:10.320> two<00:01:10.500> likes

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
here we go see if they all got two likes

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.360 
here we go see if they all got two likes
this<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.100> little<00:01:11.340> bit<00:01:11.520> better<00:01:13.370> alright

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
this a little bit better alright

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.190 
this a little bit better alright
catzilla<00:01:15.090> all<00:01:15.450> benchmarking<00:01:18.080> hopefully<00:01:19.080> this

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
catzilla all benchmarking hopefully this

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.820 
catzilla all benchmarking hopefully this
one<00:01:19.320> has<00:01:19.440> some<00:01:19.560> decent<00:01:20.450> there<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.660> go<00:01:21.810> alright

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
one has some decent there we go alright

00:01:22.830 --> 00:04:53.460 
one has some decent there we go alright

as<00:04:53.980> far<00:04:54.220> as<00:04:54.250> benchmarks<00:04:54.970> go<00:04:55.120> that<00:04:55.660> kicked<00:04:55.900> ass

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
as far as benchmarks go that kicked ass

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.860 
as far as benchmarks go that kicked ass
good<00:04:57.250> music<00:04:57.580> good<00:04:57.700> graphics<00:04:58.180> all<00:04:58.330> around<00:04:58.630> so

based on the low-end 720p benchmark
later<00:05:08.680> on<00:05:08.890> I'll<00:05:09.070> download<00:05:09.300> newer<00:05:10.300> versions<00:05:10.780> as

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
later on I'll download newer versions as

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.770 
later on I'll download newer versions as
they<00:05:11.110> come<00:05:11.290> out<00:05:11.440> and<00:05:11.680> try<00:05:12.400> to<00:05:12.460> get<00:05:12.610> a<00:05:12.640> 1080p<00:05:13.120> run

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
they come out and try to get a 1080p run

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.320 
they come out and try to get a 1080p run
