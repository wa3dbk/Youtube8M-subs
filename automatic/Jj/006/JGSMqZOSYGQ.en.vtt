00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.630 
phone and you can then check your kernel
in<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.790> go<00:03:32.569> to<00:03:32.629> about<00:03:33.290> phone<00:03:33.349> and<00:03:33.829> then<00:03:34.040> kernel

in to go to about phone and then kernel

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.770 
in to go to about phone and then kernel
again<00:03:34.819> in<00:03:35.030> in<00:03:35.299> the<00:03:35.390> sayings<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:36.609> so<00:03:37.609> you<00:03:38.450> would

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
again in in the sayings and so you would

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.349 
again in in the sayings and so you would
then<00:03:38.959> have<00:03:39.019> this<00:03:39.980> kernel<00:03:40.370> which<00:03:40.519> as<00:03:41.000> I<00:03:41.209> said

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
then have this kernel which as I said

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.940 
then have this kernel which as I said
before<00:03:41.480> gives<00:03:42.349> you<00:03:42.530> busybox<00:03:42.950> root<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:44.950> to

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
before gives you busybox root and to

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.910 
before gives you busybox root and to
your<00:03:46.129> recovery<00:03:46.370> now<00:03:47.299> to<00:03:47.750> e<00:03:47.859> recovery<00:03:48.859> is

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920
