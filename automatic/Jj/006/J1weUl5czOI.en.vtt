00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.950 
into LeMond and 24-hour racing what's
been<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.490> biggest<00:01:41.640> challenge<00:01:42.090> physically

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
been the biggest challenge physically

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.639 
been the biggest challenge physically
and<00:01:43.229> mentally<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.950> making<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.399> switch

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
and mentally to making that switch

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.990 
and mentally to making that switch
physically<00:01:46.649> very<00:01:46.829> similar<00:01:47.189> because<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.790> grip

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
physically very similar because the grip

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.520 
physically very similar because the grip
is<00:01:48.119> very<00:01:48.299> similar<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.869> sports<00:01:49.110> car<00:01:49.380> to

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
is very similar in the sports car to

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.830 
is very similar in the sports car to
what<00:01:49.649> we<00:01:49.740> have<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.040> Formula<00:01:50.369> One

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
what we have in the Formula One

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.870 
what we have in the Formula One
so<00:01:51.520> that's<00:01:52.520> not<00:01:53.000> a<00:01:53.060> huge<00:01:53.450> change<00:01:53.479> I<00:01:54.049> think<00:01:54.229> that

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
so that's not a huge change I think that

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.289 
so that's not a huge change I think that
mentally<00:01:57.009> probably<00:01:58.009> down<00:01:58.159> down<00:01:58.759> a<00:01:58.789> slight

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
mentally probably down down a slight

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.179 
mentally probably down down a slight
notch<00:01:59.569> in<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.869> WEC<00:02:00.319> but<00:02:00.649> also<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:00.979> have<00:02:01.100> to

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
notch in the WEC but also you have to

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.069 
notch in the WEC but also you have to
drive<00:02:01.520> for<00:02:01.670> longer<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:02.359> that's<00:02:02.659> that's

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
drive for longer so that's that's

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.480 
drive for longer so that's that's
another<00:02:03.229> component<00:02:03.590> which<00:02:03.979> I've<00:02:04.130> got<00:02:04.250> to<00:02:04.340> deal

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
another component which I've got to deal

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.830 
another component which I've got to deal
with<00:02:04.640> you're<00:02:04.729> going<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:04.909> drive<00:02:05.210> at<00:02:05.359> night<00:02:05.539> I've

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
with you're going to drive at night I've

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.029 
with you're going to drive at night I've
got<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.079> deal<00:02:06.200> with<00:02:06.289> a<00:02:06.319> lot<00:02:06.439> of<00:02:06.530> back<00:02:06.649> markers

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
got to deal with a lot of back markers

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.320 
got to deal with a lot of back markers
as<00:02:07.189> well<00:02:07.539> which<00:02:08.539> is<00:02:09.470> challenging<00:02:10.399> for<00:02:10.789> us<00:02:10.940> guys

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
as well which is challenging for us guys

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.940 
as well which is challenging for us guys
that<00:02:11.720> obviously<00:02:12.019> in<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.200> fastest<00:02:12.620> cars<00:02:12.799> and

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
that obviously in the fastest cars and

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.289 
that obviously in the fastest cars and
we're<00:02:13.040> constantly<00:02:13.250> trying<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.670> pass<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:13.940> lot<00:02:14.180> of

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
we're constantly trying to pass a lot of

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.860 
we're constantly trying to pass a lot of
guys<00:02:14.420> per<00:02:15.260> lap<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:16.370> yeah<00:02:16.879> there<00:02:17.150> has<00:02:17.269> been<00:02:17.480> some

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
guys per lap so yeah there has been some

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.170 
guys per lap so yeah there has been some
changes<00:02:18.620> but<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:18.890> would<00:02:19.099> say<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.489> biggest<00:02:19.700> is

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
changes but I would say the biggest is

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.330 
changes but I would say the biggest is
the<00:02:20.840> night<00:02:21.049> driving<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:21.709> then<00:02:21.830> dealing<00:02:22.190> with

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
the night driving and then dealing with

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.400 
the night driving and then dealing with
the<00:02:22.880> different<00:02:23.209> categories<00:02:23.510> within<00:02:23.930> one<00:02:24.200> race

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
the different categories within one race

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.150 
the different categories within one race
be<00:02:24.650> like<00:02:24.829> in<00:02:25.040> in<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.180> Lamar<00:02:26.480> racing<00:02:27.040> mark<00:02:28.040> if

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
be like in in the Lamar racing mark if

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.949 
be like in in the Lamar racing mark if
there<00:02:28.340> was<00:02:28.459> one<00:02:28.819> tip<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.150> could<00:02:29.360> offer<00:02:29.540> us<00:02:29.780> of

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
there was one tip you could offer us of

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.630 
there was one tip you could offer us of
amateur<00:02:30.319> racer<00:02:30.530> like<00:02:30.920> myself<00:02:31.130> or<00:02:31.489> an

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
amateur racer like myself or an

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.970 
amateur racer like myself or an
enthusiast<00:02:32.480> out<00:02:32.840> there<00:02:33.079> what<00:02:33.440> would<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.680> be<00:02:33.709> in

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
enthusiast out there what would it be in

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.089 
enthusiast out there what would it be in
terms<00:02:34.010> of<00:02:34.370> physical<00:02:35.180> preparation<00:02:36.099> the

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
terms of physical preparation the

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.589 
terms of physical preparation the
physical<00:02:37.489> preparation<00:02:37.670> I<00:02:38.090> think<00:02:38.120> if<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:38.480> can

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
physical preparation I think if you can

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.500 
physical preparation I think if you can
just<00:02:38.810> be<00:02:41.140> try<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.290> get<00:02:42.670> leaner<00:02:43.670> if<00:02:43.970> you<00:02:44.060> can<00:02:44.269> so

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
just be try and get leaner if you can so

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.110 
just be try and get leaner if you can so
it's<00:02:44.690> always<00:02:44.870> nice<00:02:45.140> if<00:02:45.379> you<00:02:45.470> can<00:02:45.590> take<00:02:46.549> the

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
it's always nice if you can take the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.490 
it's always nice if you can take the
minimum<00:02:47.450> out<00:02:47.599> of<00:02:47.690> weight<00:02:47.810> into<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.110> cockpit

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
minimum out of weight into the cockpit

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.559 
minimum out of weight into the cockpit
this<00:02:48.709> is<00:02:48.860> quite<00:02:49.099> nice<00:02:49.250> there's<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.120> lot<00:02:50.299> of<00:02:50.420> big

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
this is quite nice there's a lot of big

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:51.970 
this is quite nice there's a lot of big
benefits<00:02:50.989> for<00:02:51.200> being<00:02:51.379> for<00:02:51.650> being<00:02:51.829> lean

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
benefits for being for being lean

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.910 
benefits for being for being lean
obviously<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:52.579> heat<00:02:52.790> up<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.090> lot<00:02:53.269> a<00:02:53.420> lot<00:02:53.569> less

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
obviously you heat up a lot a lot less

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.900 
obviously you heat up a lot a lot less
obviously<00:02:54.920> your<00:02:55.069> life<00:02:55.250> in<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.549> car<00:02:55.760> which

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
obviously your life in the car which

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.160 
obviously your life in the car which
will<00:02:56.000> give<00:02:56.150> you<00:02:56.239> definitely<00:02:56.630> lap<00:02:56.780> time<00:02:56.989> if

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
will give you definitely lap time if

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.840 
will give you definitely lap time if
you're<00:02:57.290> not<00:02:57.440> carrying<00:02:57.920> as<00:02:58.040> much<00:02:58.190> mass<00:02:58.549> around

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
you're not carrying as much mass around

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.270 
you're not carrying as much mass around
so<00:02:59.780> that's<00:02:59.989> from<00:03:00.109> a<00:03:00.230> physical<00:03:00.620> side<00:03:00.889> I<00:03:01.160> think

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
so that's from a physical side I think

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.270 
so that's from a physical side I think
there<00:03:01.670> if<00:03:02.569> you<00:03:02.720> can<00:03:02.870> certainly<00:03:03.139> do<00:03:04.100> some

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
there if you can certainly do some

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.949 
there if you can certainly do some
damage<00:03:04.549> in<00:03:04.670> that<00:03:04.700> area<00:03:05.090> that's<00:03:05.209> a<00:03:05.420> that's<00:03:05.690> a

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
damage in that area that's a that's a

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.400 
damage in that area that's a that's a
very<00:03:06.170> strong<00:03:07.000> tool<00:03:08.000> but<00:03:08.299> you<00:03:08.480> haven't<00:03:09.260> got

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
very strong tool but you haven't got

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.539 
very strong tool but you haven't got
much<00:03:09.530> room<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.829> move<00:03:09.920> mate<00:03:10.160> you're<00:03:10.280> going<00:03:10.459> to

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
much room to move mate you're going to

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.250 
much room to move mate you're going to
ride<00:03:10.639> that<00:03:10.790> department<00:03:11.269> so<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.690> think<00:03:11.900> if<00:03:12.170> you

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
ride that department so I think if you

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.539 
ride that department so I think if you
can<00:03:12.970> there's<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.030> pretty<00:03:14.209> bag<00:03:14.389> ESOP<00:03:14.780> just<00:03:15.650> yeah

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
can there's a pretty bag ESOP just yeah

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.839 
can there's a pretty bag ESOP just yeah
I<00:03:16.579> think<00:03:17.000> as<00:03:17.540> he<00:03:17.720> pedals<00:03:18.019> faster<00:03:18.519> yeah<00:03:19.519> now<00:03:19.819> I

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
I think as he pedals faster yeah now I

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.270 
I think as he pedals faster yeah now I
think<00:03:19.940> um<00:03:20.299> yeah<00:03:20.870> mainly<00:03:21.560> you<00:03:21.919> know<00:03:22.040> weight

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
think um yeah mainly you know weight

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.530 
think um yeah mainly you know weight
control<00:03:22.549> for<00:03:22.910> people<00:03:23.359> that<00:03:23.419> are<00:03:23.510> really

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
control for people that are really

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.949 
control for people that are really
getting<00:03:23.959> into<00:03:23.989> it<00:03:24.200> he's<00:03:24.440> a<00:03:24.470> he's<00:03:25.280> a<00:03:25.310> dark<00:03:25.609> horse

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
getting into it he's a he's a dark horse

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.000 
getting into it he's a he's a dark horse
do<00:03:26.959> you<00:03:27.019> ever<00:03:27.109> get<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.410> that<00:03:27.530> point<00:03:27.709> in<00:03:27.859> life

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
do you ever get to that point in life

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.050 
do you ever get to that point in life
where<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.220> think<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:28.459> know<00:03:28.609> what<00:03:28.760> I<00:03:28.790> really

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
where you think you know what I really

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.780 
where you think you know what I really
need<00:03:29.209> is<00:03:29.239> a<00:03:29.389> Chinese<00:03:29.750> curry<00:03:30.459> you<00:03:31.459> don't<00:03:31.730> know
