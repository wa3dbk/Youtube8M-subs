the guy possible but there's also a

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.510 
the guy possible but there's also a
drawback<00:03:56.370> is<00:03:57.080> his<00:03:58.080> bolt<00:03:58.380> is<00:03:58.650> pretty<00:03:58.980> powerful

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
drawback is his bolt is pretty powerful

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.250 
drawback is his bolt is pretty powerful
and<00:03:59.640> pretty<00:03:59.820> devastating<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:00.660> it's<00:04:00.840> a<00:04:00.930> bit

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
and pretty devastating and it's a bit

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.770 
and pretty devastating and it's a bit
easier<00:04:01.710> to<00:04:01.770> do<00:04:02.460> but<00:04:02.700> have<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.210> little<00:04:03.330> minigame

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
easier to do but have a little minigame

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.550 
easier to do but have a little minigame
or<00:04:04.170> a<00:04:04.230> time<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.860> wait<00:04:05.040> to<00:04:05.070> reload<00:04:05.640> so<00:04:06.630> that

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
or a time to wait to reload so that

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.050 
or a time to wait to reload so that
could<00:04:07.770> actually<00:04:07.980> slow<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:08.430> down<00:04:08.610> it's<00:04:08.820> not<00:04:08.940> as

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
could actually slow you down it's not as

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.170 
could actually slow you down it's not as
quick<00:04:09.270> as<00:04:09.450> an<00:04:09.600> archer<00:04:09.990> but<00:04:10.920> it's<00:04:11.180> pretty

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
quick as an archer but it's pretty

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.270 
quick as an archer but it's pretty
devastating<00:04:12.960> so<00:04:13.470> we'll<00:04:13.650> wait<00:04:13.770> for<00:04:14.070> mr.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
devastating so we'll wait for mr.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.039

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.600 

now<00:04:28.840> we<00:04:28.900> have<00:04:29.200> a<00:04:29.230> super<00:04:29.830> accurate<00:04:29.980> detection

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
now we have a super accurate detection

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.580 
now we have a super accurate detection
system<00:04:31.150> so<00:04:31.300> I<00:04:31.330> actually<00:04:31.630> shot<00:04:32.050> it<00:04:32.170> between<00:04:32.350> his

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
system so I actually shot it between his

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.480 
system so I actually shot it between his
arms<00:04:33.130> which<00:04:33.370> only<00:04:33.700> I<00:04:33.730> can<00:04:34.060> seem<00:04:34.480> to<00:04:34.630> do<00:04:34.780> I<00:04:35.490> would

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
arms which only I can seem to do I would

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.280 
arms which only I can seem to do I would
call<00:04:36.700> it<00:04:36.850> a<00:04:36.910> skill<00:04:37.270> but<00:04:37.540> it's<00:04:37.690> not<00:04:38.020> really

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
call it a skill but it's not really

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.810 
call it a skill but it's not really
helping<00:04:38.590> me<00:04:38.740> in<00:04:38.830> this<00:04:38.980> situation<00:04:39.640> with

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.890 

maybe<00:05:00.130> I'll<00:05:00.280> have<00:05:00.370> an<00:05:00.490> easier<00:05:00.820> time<00:05:00.900> killing

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
maybe I'll have an easier time killing

maybe I'll have an easier time killing

range<00:05:05.270> weapons<00:05:05.720> definitely<00:05:06.199> take<00:05:06.349> a<00:05:06.379> lot<00:05:06.680> of

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
range weapons definitely take a lot of

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.200 
range weapons definitely take a lot of
skills<00:05:07.069> I<00:05:07.220> know<00:05:07.280> a<00:05:07.370> lot<00:05:07.520> of<00:05:07.550> people<00:05:07.819> typically

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
skills I know a lot of people typically

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.089 
skills I know a lot of people typically
are<00:05:08.330> worried<00:05:08.720> about<00:05:08.810> ranged<00:05:09.470> weapons<00:05:09.889> when

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
are worried about ranged weapons when

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:11.770 
are worried about ranged weapons when
you're<00:05:10.280> in<00:05:10.370> a<00:05:10.460> game<00:05:10.639> where<00:05:10.879> you<00:05:11.090> can<00:05:11.270> have<00:05:11.509> no

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
you're in a game where you can have no

ranged weapon to defend yourself so so

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.119 
ranged weapon to defend yourself so so
what<00:05:18.169> we've<00:05:18.349> done<00:05:18.590> is<00:05:18.919> we've<00:05:19.280> actually<00:05:21.129> it

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:22.129 
what we've done is we've actually it

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:23.439 
what we've done is we've actually it
this<00:05:22.310> takes<00:05:22.610> a<00:05:22.699> lot<00:05:22.849> of<00:05:22.879> skill<00:05:23.030> in<00:05:23.210> this<00:05:23.300> game

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449 
this takes a lot of skill in this game

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.770 
this takes a lot of skill in this game
so<00:05:23.659> somebody<00:05:24.469> being<00:05:24.770> extremely<00:05:25.780> damaging

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
so somebody being extremely damaging

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.270 
so somebody being extremely damaging
with<00:05:26.930> that<00:05:27.080> right<00:05:27.349> away<00:05:27.500> is<00:05:27.889> not<00:05:28.069> going<00:05:28.219> to

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
with that right away is not going to

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.219 
with that right away is not going to
happen<00:05:28.400> if<00:05:28.669> you're<00:05:28.789> dying<00:05:29.060> from<00:05:29.330> an<00:05:29.479> archer<00:05:29.810> it

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
happen if you're dying from an archer it

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.779 
happen if you're dying from an archer it
means<00:05:30.409> that<00:05:30.590> they<00:05:30.770> played<00:05:31.219> the<00:05:31.340> game<00:05:31.490> a<00:05:31.520> lot

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
means that they played the game a lot

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.149 
means that they played the game a lot
and<00:05:31.819> they<00:05:32.090> practiced<00:05:32.689> a<00:05:32.810> lot<00:05:32.960> so<00:05:33.590> now<00:05:33.889> you're

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:34.159 
and they practiced a lot so now you're

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:36.249 
and they practiced a lot so now you're
gonna<00:05:34.250> have<00:05:34.400> to<00:05:34.490> be<00:05:34.699> you<00:05:35.000> know<00:05:35.110> strategic<00:05:36.110> with

gonna have to be you know strategic with

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:43.820 
gonna have to be you know strategic with
how<00:05:36.379> you<00:05:36.439> approach<00:05:36.860> them

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.270 

now<00:05:44.370> we<00:05:44.430> have<00:05:44.580> this<00:05:44.729> execution<00:05:45.710> system<00:05:46.710> where

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
now we have this execution system where

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.520 
now we have this execution system where
when<00:05:47.970> somebody's<00:05:48.360> falling<00:05:48.629> you<00:05:49.259> get<00:05:49.409> to

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
when somebody's falling you get to

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.189 
when somebody's falling you get to
execute<00:05:50.069> them<00:05:50.250> and<00:05:51.060> what<00:05:51.360> it<00:05:51.479> is<00:05:51.599> is<00:05:51.810> this<00:05:51.960> just

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
execute them and what it is is this just

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.559 
execute them and what it is is this just
kind<00:05:52.379> of<00:05:52.409> a<00:05:52.530> glorified<00:05:53.099> way<00:05:53.340> of<00:05:53.759> finishing

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:54.569 
kind of a glorified way of finishing
