apart<00:00:35.690> from<00:00:35.989> the<00:00:36.170> rest<00:00:36.320> let's<00:00:37.070> take<00:00:37.250> a<00:00:37.280> closer

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
apart from the rest let's take a closer

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.670 
apart from the rest let's take a closer
look<00:00:37.850> to<00:00:38.300> begin<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:38.870> size<00:00:39.080> of<00:00:39.229> this<00:00:39.320> camera<00:00:39.589> is

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
look to begin the size of this camera is

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.289 
look to begin the size of this camera is
fairly<00:00:39.890> small<00:00:40.040> especially<00:00:40.549> when<00:00:40.909> compared<00:00:41.269> to

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:41.299 
fairly small especially when compared to

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:43.149 
fairly small especially when compared to
cameras<00:00:41.629> of<00:00:41.750> similar<00:00:42.049> design<00:00:42.350> as<00:00:42.530> you<00:00:42.860> can<00:00:43.010> see

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:43.159 
cameras of similar design as you can see

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:44.890 
cameras of similar design as you can see
here<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:43.790> unit<00:00:44.089> fits<00:00:44.269> comfortably<00:00:44.479> within

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
here the unit fits comfortably within

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.600 
here the unit fits comfortably within
the<00:00:45.049> palm<00:00:45.199> of<00:00:45.350> my<00:00:45.470> hand<00:00:45.680> it's<00:00:46.190> also<00:00:46.370> pretty

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
the palm of my hand it's also pretty

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.399 
the palm of my hand it's also pretty
lightweight<00:00:46.879> so<00:00:47.360> mounting<00:00:47.720> it<00:00:47.839> in<00:00:47.989> and<00:00:48.350> around

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:48.409 
lightweight so mounting it in and around

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:49.930 
lightweight so mounting it in and around
your<00:00:48.650> property<00:00:48.860> with<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:49.460> included<00:00:49.820> hardware

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
should be pretty easy this camera has

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:53.350 
should be pretty easy this camera has
many<00:00:52.040> features<00:00:52.220> so<00:00:52.699> let's<00:00:52.879> begin<00:00:53.000> with<00:00:53.239> the
