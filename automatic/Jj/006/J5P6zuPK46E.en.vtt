00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
for some portraits for me and it became

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.010 
for some portraits for me and it became
a<00:02:02.069> very<00:02:02.130> performative<00:02:03.060> thing<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.689> was<00:02:03.840> not

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
a very performative thing so it was not

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.260 
a very performative thing so it was not
only<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.829> end<00:02:05.100> product<00:02:05.429> which<00:02:05.759> was<00:02:05.969> the

only the end product which was the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.469 
only the end product which was the
portrait<00:02:06.659> but<00:02:07.319> it<00:02:07.499> was<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.280> action<00:02:08.880> of<00:02:09.060> being

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
portrait but it was the action of being

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:20.729 
portrait but it was the action of being
able<00:02:09.600> to<00:02:09.780> sit<00:02:10.080> with<00:02:10.229> them<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.740> talk<00:02:11.100> with<00:02:11.130> them

as<00:02:30.470> I<00:02:30.709> was<00:02:30.860> trying<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.250> have<00:02:31.910> my<00:02:32.060> students<00:02:32.450> love

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
as I was trying to have my students love

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.720 
as I was trying to have my students love
it<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.380> fell<00:02:33.830> in<00:02:33.950> love<00:02:33.980> with<00:02:34.250> it<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.580> so<00:02:34.700> I

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
it I fell in love with it and so I

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.449 
it I fell in love with it and so I
thought<00:02:34.970> you<00:02:35.030> know<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.270> want<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.989> deal<00:02:36.860> with<00:02:36.890> the

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
thought you know I want to deal with the

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.080 
thought you know I want to deal with the
sculpture<00:02:37.940> somehow<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:39.800> project<00:02:40.790> started

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
sculpture somehow and a project started

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.430 
sculpture somehow and a project started
coming<00:02:41.330> into<00:02:41.480> my<00:02:41.569> mind<00:02:41.780> where<00:02:41.959> I<00:02:41.989> would<00:02:42.260> use

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
coming into my mind where I would use

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.199 
coming into my mind where I would use
models<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.160> take<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.519> poses<00:02:43.940> of<00:02:43.970> the

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
models to take the poses of the

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.509 
models to take the poses of the
sculptures<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:44.959> then<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.830> would<00:02:46.069> have<00:02:46.100> a<00:02:46.190> full

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
sculptures and then I would have a full

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.960 
sculptures and then I would have a full
nude<00:02:46.850> underneath<00:02:47.690> these<00:02:48.230> draped<00:02:49.100> white

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
nude underneath these draped white

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:57.490 
nude underneath these draped white
marble<00:02:50.690> sculptures<00:02:55.810> part<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:56.989> process<00:02:57.170> of

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
marble sculptures part of the process of

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.750 
marble sculptures part of the process of
these<00:02:57.680> paintings<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:58.340> some<00:02:58.459> of<00:02:58.549> my<00:02:58.610> other

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
these paintings and some of my other

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.880 
these paintings and some of my other
paintings<00:02:59.209> is<00:02:59.390> painting<00:02:59.959> on<00:03:00.110> them<00:03:00.319> upside

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
paintings is painting on them upside

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.630 
paintings is painting on them upside
down<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.430> sideways<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:03.010> this<00:03:04.010> is<00:03:04.190> where<00:03:04.370> some

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
down and sideways and this is where some

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.670 
down and sideways and this is where some
of<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.760> dripping<00:03:05.180> comes<00:03:05.450> in<00:03:05.720> because<00:03:06.019> I<00:03:06.470> was

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
of the dripping comes in because I was

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.470 
of the dripping comes in because I was
interested<00:03:07.100> in<00:03:07.190> leaving<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.610> trace<00:03:07.880> that<00:03:08.209> I<00:03:08.269> had

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
interested in leaving a trace that I had

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.960 
interested in leaving a trace that I had
painted<00:03:08.900> these<00:03:09.049> things<00:03:09.459> upside<00:03:10.459> down<00:03:10.640> or

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
painted these things upside down or

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.120 
painted these things upside down or
sideways<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.750> so<00:03:12.410> there's<00:03:12.650> this<00:03:12.769> grid

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
sideways and so there's this grid

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.520 
sideways and so there's this grid
structure<00:03:13.459> that<00:03:13.819> builds<00:03:14.209> up<00:03:14.360> it<00:03:14.930> almost<00:03:15.260> adds

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
structure that builds up it almost adds

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.099 
structure that builds up it almost adds
a<00:03:15.830> sort<00:03:16.549> of<00:03:16.579> a<00:03:16.670> modernist<00:03:17.150> screen<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:20.209> messy

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
a sort of a modernist screen the messy

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.920 
a sort of a modernist screen the messy
bedroom<00:03:21.350> paintings<00:03:22.070> are<00:03:22.670> done<00:03:22.930> from

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
bedroom paintings are done from

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.710 
bedroom paintings are done from
photographic<00:03:24.590> collages<00:03:25.070> which<00:03:25.100> I<00:03:25.459> shoot<00:03:25.820> or

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
photographic collages which I shoot or

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.170 
photographic collages which I shoot or
sometimes<00:03:27.410> people<00:03:27.950> actually<00:03:28.400> shoot<00:03:29.000> the

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
sometimes people actually shoot the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.170 
sometimes people actually shoot the
pictures<00:03:29.540> for<00:03:30.230> me<00:03:30.410> because<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.340> this<00:03:31.579> there

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
pictures for me because of this there

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.569 
pictures for me because of this there
are<00:03:32.239> cameras<00:03:32.840> in<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.200> paintings<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:33.829> this

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
are cameras in the paintings and this

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.180 
are cameras in the paintings and this
gives<00:03:34.760> it<00:03:34.940> a<00:03:35.030> feeling<00:03:35.390> of<00:03:35.510> voyeurism

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
gives it a feeling of voyeurism

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.890 
gives it a feeling of voyeurism
sometimes<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.370> people<00:03:37.519> are<00:03:37.940> dressed

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
sometimes the people are dressed

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.870 
sometimes the people are dressed
sometimes<00:03:39.500> they're<00:03:39.709> semi<00:03:39.980> dressed<00:03:40.340> sometimes

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
having kids having a messy bedroom that

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.250 
having kids having a messy bedroom that
is<00:04:03.530> you<00:04:04.130> know<00:04:04.250> you<00:04:04.310> can't<00:04:04.609> get<00:04:05.000> clean<00:04:05.299> or<00:04:05.569> the

is you know you can't get clean or the

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.099 
is you know you can't get clean or the
idea<00:04:06.530> of<00:04:06.739> being<00:04:07.400> alone<00:04:07.700> in<00:04:07.910> your<00:04:07.940> bedroom<00:04:08.269> okay

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
idea of being alone in your bedroom okay

idea of being alone in your bedroom okay
that's<00:04:09.709> reality<00:04:10.130> for<00:04:10.760> most<00:04:10.880> people

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.390 

cropping<00:04:14.900> is<00:04:15.200> something<00:04:15.530> that<00:04:15.650> I<00:04:15.710> use<00:04:16.010> often

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
cropping is something that I use often

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.420 
cropping is something that I use often
in<00:04:16.850> my<00:04:17.060> paintings<00:04:17.450> I<00:04:17.630> think<00:04:17.930> that<00:04:18.430> cropping

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
in my paintings I think that cropping

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.560 
in my paintings I think that cropping
helps<00:04:20.210> the<00:04:21.170> body<00:04:21.710> feel<00:04:22.370> more<00:04:22.850> dynamic<00:04:23.390> in

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
helps the body feel more dynamic in

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.680 
helps the body feel more dynamic in
space<00:04:24.130> almost<00:04:25.130> like<00:04:25.310> they're<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:26.480> body

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
space almost like they're the the body

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.620 
space almost like they're the the body
is<00:04:26.930> reaching<00:04:27.680> off<00:04:27.830> of<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.520> picture<00:04:29.510> plane

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
is reaching off of the picture plane

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.560 
is reaching off of the picture plane
also<00:04:30.560> with<00:04:31.010> the<00:04:31.130> society<00:04:31.640> paintings<00:04:32.090> because

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
also with the society paintings because

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.870 
also with the society paintings because
the<00:04:33.200> paintings<00:04:33.890> were<00:04:33.950> taken<00:04:34.310> from<00:04:34.400> society

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
the paintings were taken from society

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
pages I didn't intend those to be

pages I didn't intend those to be
portraits<00:04:37.610> I<00:04:37.790> was<00:04:38.270> really<00:04:38.540> interested<00:04:38.810> in<00:04:39.200> how

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
portraits I was really interested in how

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.140 
portraits I was really interested in how
the<00:04:39.530> people<00:04:39.920> were<00:04:40.190> interacting<00:04:40.700> with<00:04:41.120> each

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
the people were interacting with each
