00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.440
 What did you think? 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.180
 The world is not your navel 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.040
 You are an endless pain 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.060
 A porcupine 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.020
 That thorns nails me 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.300
 It's being time 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.240
 I no longer accept delay 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.960
 The concert is over 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.040
 Yes, no 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.280
 Three cries: You're going 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.580
 This is your farewell 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.900
 And do not cry your life 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.280
 Good evening and bye 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.120
 The sun has gone out 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.760
 In spite of your evil, despite your good 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.700
 In spite of your love, I have my feet on the ground 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.760
 And without you I will continue 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.780
 Despite living twenty months of horror 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.760
 I am going to survive 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.280
 Despite your love ... 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.440
 How many lies do you think I've swallowed? 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.100
 For mercy I smiled at you 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.020
 And I "pretended" to eat the snack 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.100
 Ha! But I'm sorry 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.920
 It's that you lived cheated ... 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.040
 It had no color, no light, no flower 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.060
 An unreal garden ... 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.240
 That's why, "my life" 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.980
 That this is your farewell 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.540

 In spite of your love, I have my feet on the ground 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.780
 And without you I will continue
