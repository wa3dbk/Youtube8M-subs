00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:09.389
 we have the electrical part in the glove compartment 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:13.410
 controller unit remote 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.840
 Controls fuck the box also have 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.020
 dad does not understand 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.330
 arrow gauge shot KAMAZ which we 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.660
 shows directly pressure in 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.660
 contours 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.180
 also means there is a remote 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.390
 remote control which we 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:39.660
 four buttons rise forward forward 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:41.750
 descent-rise ass butt descent also have 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:47.760
 direct action which directly 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:50.790
 wire connected to the valves and sura 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:56.070
 the rise is taken by the compressor 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:59.960
 tasty for the rise to fill convenient 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:06.540
 remote control with automatic regulation 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:09.810
 these remote and do not need that automatic 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.950
 management is organized in the form of 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:18.060
 buttons and 4 glowing diodes which 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.590
 indicate the state of the suspension ie 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.509
 four preset levels 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.209
 show at what level do we have 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.959
 In this case , the suspension is tuned to it. 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:33.649
 what is happening with him video in 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.649
 private car 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.490
 4 Do voltage now turn on 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:45.190
 the controller will turn on our light bulb and we 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.750
 see that we now have a controller 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:54.880
 to maintain the position of two o'clock in the room 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:57.070
 us with a certain delay if if 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.620
 the position does not match is necessary 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:06.070
 cut out the clock 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:11.770
 a flash occurs set 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:14.130
 our position is set permissible but 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.130
 now 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.860
 adding ahead 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.510
 that is, we see control from the provisions 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.510
 which he is prone to in a healthy 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.280
 back on turn let 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:48.960
 Now we have the pressure ahead 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.960
 we have 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.890
 must swap now
