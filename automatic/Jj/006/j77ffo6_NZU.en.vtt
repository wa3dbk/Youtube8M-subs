effects that you've been learning in my
road<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.710> be<00:00:52.829> an<00:00:52.949> editor<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.489> everything<00:00:53.760> like

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
road to be an editor and everything like

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.250 
road to be an editor and everything like
that<00:00:54.410> series<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:56.449> this<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.480> what<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.750> did<00:00:58.020> and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
that series so this is what I did and

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.680 
that series so this is what I did and
it's<00:00:58.949> pretty<00:00:59.250> straightforward<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.329> didn't

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
it's pretty straightforward I didn't

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.360 
it's pretty straightforward I didn't
spend<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.140> much<00:01:01.320> time<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.800> but<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.070> just

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
spend that much time on it but it's just

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.369 
spend that much time on it but it's just
an<00:01:02.489> idea<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.420> can<00:01:03.539> see<00:01:03.719> here<00:01:04.019> right<00:01:04.199> now

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
an idea so you can see here right now

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.590 
an idea so you can see here right now
the<00:01:04.439> music<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.010> quiet<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.610> builds<00:01:05.880> up<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.390> then

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
the music is quiet it builds up and then

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.870 
the music is quiet it builds up and then
it<00:01:06.750> goes<00:01:06.900> shoots<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.220> then<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.700> can<00:01:08.790> see

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
it goes shoots and then you can see

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.359 
it goes shoots and then you can see
every<00:01:09.060> time<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.390> screen<00:01:09.720> pumps<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:11.220> goes

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
every time the screen pumps like it goes

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.660 
every time the screen pumps like it goes
boom<00:01:11.990> boom<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.100> did<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.369> there

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
boom boom like that it just did it there

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.990 
boom boom like that it just did it there
that's<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.840> bass<00:01:16.290> drum<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.830> then<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> snare

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.850 
that's a bass drum and then the snare
will<00:01:18.450> be<00:01:18.600> where<00:01:18.810> there's<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.049> flash<00:01:19.290> or<00:01:19.680> right

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
will be where there's a flash or right

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.770 
will be where there's a flash or right
there<00:01:20.070> there's<00:01:20.340> obviously<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.880> snare<00:01:21.270> hit<00:01:21.600> or
