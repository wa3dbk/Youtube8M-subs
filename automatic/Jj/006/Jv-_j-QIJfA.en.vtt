00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.899
 The first is a Japanese child with a sense of feeling 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.490
 Bring the old language dictionary of that season to this class 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.769
 It was said that I had put it on my desk and took an on-site class 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.359
 It started from the place 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.909
 It is beyond the company of the country of the year not only various 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:23.670
 It is in the applause of empathy 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.179
 Seems really fun 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:26.590
 Because I was listening to the case 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.300
 Well, that's why everyone is going to try Ishiyama Temple 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.040
 It is assumed that it was used continuously in January, 1996 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.900
 It should be a festival of learning method but the point is 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.200
 If you can find out yourself with power 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.330
 You're a male, I'm in a position where you can do that 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.370
 That is why I noticed 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.540
 I wondered what I was thinking about it 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.300
 I will 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.790
 My life is a life surrounded by words 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.020
 That's why it's also true that family 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.480
 An environment where you can agree on various circle situations 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.470
 I think it would be appreciated if you could make it 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.290
 It's too much of a life like this to act at the center of the home 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.960
 By living 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.750
 Children go ahead and examine words 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.570
 I learn from LOL's, I think that I have a motivation 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.039
 There is an event of that green rich here- 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.709
 It is a power of 12 yen, and the processing that can be enjoyed by that little child 

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:26.219
 is 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.180
 So this is the time of introduction. 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.560
 Yeah 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.280
 I think that if you can use the dictionary is alive 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.689
 I want to touch that many more words 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.359
 It's harmful to you, and this is one kilometer at the time of the open call for understanding 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:44.159
 Because there is a bicycle, this one is also a dictionary 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.609
 If you look up, you will find out about the various words you and Yuko 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:48.100
 Or 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.450
 And can you learn from the previous children? 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.990
 I would like you to expand the world of words 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.740
 I think if you can create a culture of home 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.029
 I am
