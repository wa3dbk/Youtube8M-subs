to begin with because okay to fluff it
up<00:00:07.980> run<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.400> grandbaby<00:00:09.620> down<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.800> center<00:00:11.070> it's

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
up run a grandbaby down the center it's

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.740 
up run a grandbaby down the center it's
quite<00:00:11.490> compact<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:12.269> usually<00:00:12.389> been<00:00:12.630> on

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
quite compact and it's usually been on

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.299 
quite compact and it's usually been on
the<00:00:12.960> whole<00:00:13.049> bunch<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.440> other<00:00:13.559> great<00:00:13.710> that's<00:00:14.040> it

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
the whole bunch of other great that's it

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.919 
the whole bunch of other great that's it
so<00:00:14.580> we<00:00:14.759> sought<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.030> grow<00:00:15.299> bag<00:00:15.480> out<00:00:15.719> which

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
so we sought the grow bag out which

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.960 
so we sought the grow bag out which
spaced<00:00:16.139> out<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.500> pots<00:00:16.740> on<00:00:17.100> top<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.640> we<00:00:17.820> go

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
spaced out the pots on top of the we go

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.269 
spaced out the pots on top of the we go
back<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.420> always<00:00:18.990> tend<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.380> put<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.710> first

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
back I always tend to put the first

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.730 
back I always tend to put the first
chink<00:00:20.550> either<00:00:21.029> side<00:00:21.390> away<00:00:21.539> then<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.380> take<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
chink either side away then I take the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.410 
chink either side away then I take the
grow<00:00:22.890> pot<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.340> center<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.300> to

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
grow pot in the center this is to

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.910 
grow pot in the center this is to
establish<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.230> center<00:00:25.529> point<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
establish that the center point of the

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.490 
establish that the center point of the
grow<00:00:26.099> bag<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.970> we<00:00:27.090> just<00:00:27.300> literally<00:00:27.630> cut<00:00:28.289> down

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
grow bag and we just literally cut down

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.590 
grow bag and we just literally cut down
into<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> dry<00:00:28.980> bag<00:00:31.520> and<00:00:32.520> that's<00:00:32.700> pattern

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
into the dry bag and that's pattern

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.430 
into the dry bag and that's pattern
already

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
already

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.830 
already
that's<00:00:34.620> your<00:00:34.829> grow<00:00:35.100> back<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.670> yes<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.600> already

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
that's your grow back in yes and already

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.299 
that's your grow back in yes and already
if<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.079> look<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.380> there<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.649> can<00:00:37.800> see<00:00:37.950> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
if you look in there you can see the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.889 
if you look in there you can see the
compost<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.879> already<00:00:39.149> going<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.480> rise

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
compost is already going to rise

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.380 
compost is already going to rise
round<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.530> up<00:00:40.620> yeah<00:00:40.920> alright<00:00:41.579> k<00:00:41.760> then<00:00:42.120> what<00:00:42.270> we

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
compost type grow bag you are using yes

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.700 
compost type grow bag you are using yes
try<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.300> use<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.690> same<00:00:51.930> compost<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
try and use the same compost in the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.040 
try and use the same compost in the
center<00:00:53.010> pot<00:00:53.190> okay<00:00:53.910> technically<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:54.750> found

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
center pot okay technically we found

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.810 
center pot okay technically we found
that<00:00:55.320> if<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.739> use<00:00:55.860> something<00:00:56.340> different<00:00:56.699> in

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
that if you use something different in

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.279 
that if you use something different in
the<00:00:56.910> center<00:00:57.210> pot<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.570> what's<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> grow<00:00:58.079> bag

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
the center pot to what's in the grow bag

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.380 
the center pot to what's in the grow bag
the<00:00:58.890> plant<00:00:59.190> believe<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.609> or<00:00:59.699> not<00:00:59.879> will<00:01:00.120> stop

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the plant believe it or not will stop

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.290 
the plant believe it or not will stop
growing<00:01:00.660> for<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> few<00:01:01.079> weeks

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
growing for a few weeks

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.399 
growing for a few weeks
contrasting<00:01:03.300> yeah<00:01:03.600> because<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.080> new<00:01:04.229> roots

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
contrasting yeah because the new roots

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.539 
contrasting yeah because the new roots
hit<00:01:04.650> something<00:01:05.040> different

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
hit something different

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.910 
hit something different
either<00:01:06.060> like<00:01:06.180> attorney<00:01:06.990> they<00:01:07.350> are<00:01:07.470> sensitive

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
either like attorney they are sensitive

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.010 
either like attorney they are sensitive
to<00:01:08.189> all<00:01:08.520> sorts<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.909> conditions<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.840> was

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
to all sorts of conditions and that was

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.510 
to all sorts of conditions and that was
one<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.470> established<00:01:10.920> over<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.250> season

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
one that we established over the season

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.550 
one that we established over the season
so<00:01:11.640> try<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.000> match<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.390> type<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:12.990> get<00:01:13.140> to

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
so try and match the type and I get to

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.219 
so try and match the type and I get to
can<00:01:13.770> prospect<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:15.000> whatever<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.960> take<00:01:16.170> a

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
can prospect to whatever it is we take a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.800 
can prospect to whatever it is we take a
scoop<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:17.009> just<00:01:17.220> nicely<00:01:17.430> fill<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.570> center

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
scoop and we just nicely fill the center

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.560 
scoop and we just nicely fill the center
pot<00:01:19.140> right<00:01:19.619> enough<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.580> raise<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.030> plant<00:01:21.299> up

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
pot right enough to raise the plant up

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.749 
pot right enough to raise the plant up

and for the compost to be level and this

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.820 
and for the compost to be level and this
is<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.939> next<00:01:24.270> part<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.810> function<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
is the next part of the function of the

in<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.159> pot<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.119> then<00:01:30.360> we<00:01:30.450> take<00:01:30.630> our<00:01:30.869> plants

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
in the pot and then we take our plants

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.580 
in the pot and then we take our plants
what<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.030> selected<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.600> tomato<00:01:33.900> blood<00:01:34.259> we
