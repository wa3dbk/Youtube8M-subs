00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.279

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.080
 small party place 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.240
 yes, I go every now and then something 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.730
 Unfortunately, I can not do all of you 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.829
 invite and that's why I want 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.390
 you at one of the administered there 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.689
 Croatia 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.800
 It is this delicious stuffed flatbread 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.020
 I have the recipe of one 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.719
 Italian holiday brought it tastes 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.489
 hearty mediterranean and has as well 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.890
 still the big advantage that it is 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.420
 easy three to four days keeps to 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.980
 Original recipe I had the one or the other 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.710
 make other adjustments but it 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:51.710
 tastes almost identical and we need 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:54.050
 for this, salt a ham 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.510
 baking mix for ciabatta bread in oil 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.910
 pickled is dried tomatoes olives 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.870
 Oil cut cheese and I have here 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.140
 taken emmentaler 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.939
 rosemary and oregano fear 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.939
 Of course, getting better and better is not 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.990
 also dried and substitute could 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.180
 not quite as intense either 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.530
 to use tasting marjoram 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.439
 oregano is only the 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.329
 Uncultivated form of the Meiler in one 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.789
 bowl we give 500 grams of 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:22.009
 ciabatta bread mix and prepare 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.479
 this according to the package instructions in the 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.689
 generally means that lukewarm water 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.670
 Add some oil with your knee 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.829
 carry the device on everything 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.119
 lower and then at the highest level 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.759
 knead with each other 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.159
 so long until the dough from the key 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.350
 purely completely dissolves the dough then with 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.270
 Cover a cloth and put on a warm cloth 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.549
 stand for at least half an hour 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.619
 be let go in the meantime 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.060
 the other ingredients prepared the 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.569
 oregano and leaflets from the stems 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.069
 plucked and then finely chopped 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.740
 knife or cradle is yours 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:56.209
 decision 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.740
 the dried tomatoes we in 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:59.599
 a bowl will drain something 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.429
 Let's strip now 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:03.819
 cut that tomatoes oil paintings 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:06.109
 We still need to keep that 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:09.080
 the rosemary is the same 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.270
 fate oregano offer the needles of 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.390
 stalk the stems and then 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.000
 also finely chop 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.690
 now a work space generous 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.540
 rated 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.680
 give the dough to halve this 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.870
 the first half briefly again 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.660
 knead and then in 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.340
 baking sheet size roll out file leaves 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.420
 work easily and roll it out 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.510
 should not be a problem 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.340
 represent 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.280
 this first dough half of the flatbread 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:46.160
 Let's put on baking paper 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:48.800
 laid baking tray and start now 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.920
 we already distribute with the coverings 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.510
 followed by cheese for the first half 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.019
 from donating the close to it 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.019
 is placed 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.360
 then we distribute the stripes of the 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.870
 dried tomatoes sprinkle oregano 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.870
 about that 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.220
 and concludes with the second half of 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.680
 Cheese slices off just like fast 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.350
 roll out the second dough half 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.970
 and this as a cover to the date 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.450
 give prepared flatbread 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.160
 Press a little and come now 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.330
 to use the tomato oil with 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.260
 We will now delete this one 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.360
 surface 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.150
 When this is done we scatter 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.830
 the chopped rosemary on it and 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.120
 The procedure finally also with the 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.160
 salt would rather be a bit 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.230
 You can still use sparingly after-salting 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.390
 yes, and now comes the flatbread too 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.520
 already in the oven and that at 200 degrees 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.510
 circulating air 180 degrees 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.860
 for 35 to 40 minutes and that's how it looks 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.230
 then finished baked off 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.850
 I think that makes appetite for 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.310
 At least I recommend you to serve 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.140
 a part of the shop in smaller pieces 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.060
 to cut 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.860
 a quark or cream cheese tip but also 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.330
 Tomato or ketchup are great 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.820
 to 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.930
 Well then yes, the party can rise 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.120
 I wish you much fun in the 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.560
 preparation and then quite good appetite 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.540
 but if he was like a medial 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.970
 cheese pita bread with tomato butter 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.830
 would like to prepare or something completely 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.680
 another example is a black forest 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.840
 pumpkin then he just looks in 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.220
 put these videos in 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.900
 I still have to say until the 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.900
 Next time bye
