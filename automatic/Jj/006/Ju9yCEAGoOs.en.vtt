00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
war a realistic subject I think what you

war a realistic subject I think what you
have<00:00:56.399> now<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> very<00:00:57.090> dangerous<00:00:57.270> situation

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
have now is a very dangerous situation

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.470 
have now is a very dangerous situation
in<00:00:58.410> which<00:00:58.710> all<00:00:59.010> sides<00:00:59.430> have<00:00:59.760> very<00:01:00.059> little<00:01:00.300> room

for<00:01:00.539> manoeuvre<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.469> think<00:01:02.100> talking<00:01:02.430> about<00:01:02.640> war

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
for manoeuvre I think talking about war

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.719

from Ukraine and Putin does have
significant<00:02:59.569> support<00:02:59.959> within<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.290> Russian

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
population the main reason really is

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.910 
population the main reason really is
Russia's<00:03:04.220> perception<00:03:04.880> of<00:03:04.910> a<00:03:05.360> threat<00:03:05.660> to<00:03:05.920> its

strategic interests in Crimea and that's
really<00:03:10.220> why<00:03:10.400> we're<00:03:10.670> seeing<00:03:10.910> this<00:03:11.150> action

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
really why we're seeing this action

really why we're seeing this action
being<00:03:11.750> taken<00:03:12.010> Russia<00:03:13.010> likely<00:03:13.850> suspect<00:03:14.330> that

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
being taken Russia likely suspect that

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.920 
being taken Russia likely suspect that

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
way it is is that fair criticism because

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.280
