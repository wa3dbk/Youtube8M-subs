00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.770

 lightness of hair and ease curls 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.529
 which together gives a wonderful combination 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.420

 since the basis of this hairstyle 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.949
 is strong bouffant then hair should 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.110
 be very clean otherwise they just long 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.449
 will not stretch and will not stand this bouffant 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.820
 hair before styling I washed shampoo 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.340
 clean line firming and used 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.409
 Balsam from the same series together they gave 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.630
 my hair has a great charge of vivacity and 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.939
 freshness and it sat perfectly works 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.310

 stay very long 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.770
