most engine and engines these days are
all<00:04:25.660> feeling<00:04:26.080> ejected<00:04:26.710> that's<00:04:27.310> why<00:04:27.460> they<00:04:27.580> have

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
all feeling ejected that's why they have

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.550 
all feeling ejected that's why they have
the<00:04:27.940> connectors<00:04:28.570> and<00:04:28.600> so<00:04:28.990> they<00:04:29.139> can<00:04:29.290> handle

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
the connectors and so they can handle

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.810 
the connectors and so they can handle
the<00:04:29.680> pressure

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.830

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
back to the side of the frame rail and

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.490 
back to the side of the frame rail and
then<00:06:39.700> run<00:06:39.970> the<00:06:40.120> brake<00:06:40.420> line<00:06:40.690> back<00:06:40.960> in<00:06:41.170> front<00:06:41.410> of

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
then run the brake line back in front of

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.900 
then run the brake line back in front of
it

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:41.910 
it

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.430 
it
and<00:06:42.910> then<00:06:43.060> snap<00:06:43.420> everything<00:06:43.900> back<00:06:44.080> into<00:06:44.290> the

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 
and then snap everything back into the

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:55.770 
and then snap everything back into the
plastic<00:06:44.860> connectors

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:55.780 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:18.290 

you

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.659 

so<00:07:19.300> the<00:07:19.449> fuel<00:07:19.780> up<00:07:19.990> the<00:07:20.169> brake<00:07:20.919> line<00:07:21.220> is<00:07:21.460> back

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:21.669 
so the fuel up the brake line is back

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:24.839 
so the fuel up the brake line is back
into<00:07:21.970> place<00:07:22.270> and<00:07:22.900> just<00:07:23.069> pop<00:07:24.069> everything<00:07:24.610> back

into the connectors or back into the
clips<00:07:28.240> to<00:07:28.389> hold<00:07:28.629> it<00:07:28.810> in<00:07:28.930> place<00:07:29.280> and<00:07:30.280> you're

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:30.610
