00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.969 

the<00:00:00.690> whole<00:00:00.810> experience<00:00:01.439> has<00:00:01.560> been<00:00:01.740> pretty

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
the whole experience has been pretty

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.249 
the whole experience has been pretty
good<00:00:02.159> I've<00:00:03.030> had<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.210> bit<00:00:03.419> of<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.720> dabble<00:00:04.140> into

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
good I've had a bit of a dabble into

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.519 
good I've had a bit of a dabble into
into<00:00:04.710> 3d<00:00:05.069> before<00:00:05.370> both<00:00:05.609> passive<00:00:06.270> for<00:00:06.529> cinemas

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
into 3d before both passive for cinemas

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.520 
into 3d before both passive for cinemas
are<00:00:07.649> now<00:00:07.740> calling<00:00:08.010> it<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.340> an<00:00:08.670> active<00:00:09.000> shutter

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
are now calling it and an active shutter

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.290 
are now calling it and an active shutter
and<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:11.219> think<00:00:11.460> that<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.700> TVs<00:00:12.000> have<00:00:12.120> come<00:00:12.269> a

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
and I think that the TVs have come a

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.230 
and I think that the TVs have come a
long<00:00:12.750> way<00:00:12.960> so<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.860> last<00:00:14.070> 6<00:00:14.820> or<00:00:14.940> 12<00:00:15.179> months

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
long way so in the last 6 or 12 months

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.210 
long way so in the last 6 or 12 months
compared<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.680> what<00:00:16.770> they<00:00:16.859> were<00:00:16.980> when<00:00:17.130> they

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
compared to what they were when they

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.380 
compared to what they were when they
first<00:00:17.400> released<00:00:17.609> there's<00:00:18.029> been<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> lot<00:00:18.359> of

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
first released there's been a lot of

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.080 
first released there's been a lot of
hype<00:00:18.960> about<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:20.550> just<00:00:20.580> looking<00:00:20.910> at<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
hype about it and just looking at the

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.269 
hype about it and just looking at the
technology<00:00:21.570> today<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:22.199> what<00:00:22.859> LG<00:00:23.189> are

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
technology today in what LG are

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.000 
technology today in what LG are
launching<00:00:23.720> it's<00:00:24.720> clear<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.050> they're<00:00:25.890> going

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
launching it's clear that they're going

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.939 
launching it's clear that they're going
to<00:00:26.130> be<00:00:26.250> probably<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.939> market<00:00:27.240> leaders

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
to be probably one of the market leaders

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.420 
to be probably one of the market leaders
certainly<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.039> this<00:00:29.160> passive<00:00:29.939> active<00:00:30.240> cinema

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
certainly in this passive active cinema

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.889 
certainly in this passive active cinema
capacity<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.700> think<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.059> key<00:00:33.210> thing<00:00:33.239> there's

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
capacity I think the key thing there's

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.020 
capacity I think the key thing there's
been<00:00:34.460> brilliant<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:35.579> just<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:35.940> all

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
been brilliant it's just it's all

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.270 
been brilliant it's just it's all
passive<00:00:36.469> there's<00:00:37.469> none<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> active

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
passive there's none of the active

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.000 
passive there's none of the active
shutter<00:00:38.960> which<00:00:39.960> has<00:00:40.079> always<00:00:40.230> put<00:00:40.469> me<00:00:40.559> off<00:00:40.649> 3d

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
shutter which has always put me off 3d

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.310 
shutter which has always put me off 3d
TV<00:00:41.399> yeah<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.180> mean<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.600> be<00:00:42.719> honest<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.140> was<00:00:43.290> really

TV yeah I mean to be honest I was really

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.260 
TV yeah I mean to be honest I was really
skeptical<00:00:43.860> about<00:00:44.129> 3d<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.640> hadn't<00:00:45.090> really<00:00:45.239> seen

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
skeptical about 3d I hadn't really seen

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.299 
skeptical about 3d I hadn't really seen
I've<00:00:45.510> only<00:00:45.629> seen<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:45.989> shops<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.500> was<00:00:46.620> done

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
I've only seen in shops and it was done

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.180 
I've only seen in shops and it was done
I<00:00:47.340> was<00:00:47.610> active<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.260> passive<00:00:49.649> real

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
I was active and but this passive real

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.350 
I was active and but this passive real
real<00:00:50.520> scene<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.850> why<00:00:50.910> they're<00:00:51.059> calling<00:00:51.300> in

our<00:00:51.480> LG<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.809> fantastic<00:00:52.559> really<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:53.010> really

our LG is fantastic really it really
works

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
works

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.729 
works
passive<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.750> way<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.930> go<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.260> know<00:00:55.530> it

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
passive is the way to go you know it

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.910 
passive is the way to go you know it
doesn't<00:00:56.610> really<00:00:56.730> sacrifice<00:00:57.360> quality<00:00:57.920> unless

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
doesn't really sacrifice quality unless

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.729 
doesn't really sacrifice quality unless
you<00:00:59.039> go<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.699> screens<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.449> huge<00:01:00.719> size<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.050> you

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
you go on screens a huge size and you

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.709 
you go on screens a huge size and you
know<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.850> viewing<00:01:03.390> angles

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
know and and just the the viewing angles

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.810 
know and and just the the viewing angles
like<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.930> said<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.500> things<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.430> really

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
like I said and things like that really

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.969 
like I said and things like that really
really<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.270> bring<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.020> consumers<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.740> lot

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
really just bring it to consumers a lot

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.310 
really just bring it to consumers a lot
more<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.729> know<00:01:08.880> I'm<00:01:09.119> definitely<00:01:09.510> sold<00:01:10.110> on

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
more and you know I'm definitely sold on

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.980 
more and you know I'm definitely sold on
if<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:11.100> had<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.369> buy<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> 3d<00:01:11.909> set<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.330> would<00:01:12.510> buy

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
if I had to buy a 3d set I would buy

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.740 
if I had to buy a 3d set I would buy
passive<00:01:13.470> as<00:01:13.890> opposed<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.280> active<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:15.600> just

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
passive as opposed to active it's just

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.690 
passive as opposed to active it's just
so<00:01:15.869> clear<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.920> viewing<00:01:17.159> angle<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.520> thought

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
so clear and the viewing angle I thought

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.340 
so clear and the viewing angle I thought
was<00:01:17.850> really<00:01:18.509> good<00:01:18.600> obvious<00:01:18.900> if<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.170> next

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
was really good obvious if you like next

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.600 
was really good obvious if you like next
to<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.740> size<00:01:19.920> you're<00:01:20.250> not<00:01:20.340> gonna<00:01:20.430> see

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
to it of the size you're not gonna see

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.910 
to it of the size you're not gonna see
it<00:01:20.670> but<00:01:20.850> everyone<00:01:21.810> was<00:01:21.930> sort<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.619> front<00:01:22.710> of

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
it but everyone was sort of in front of

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.190 
it but everyone was sort of in front of
it<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.130> really<00:01:23.310> clear<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.729> lot<00:01:24.450> brighter<00:01:24.689> as<00:01:25.049> I

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
it it's really clear a lot brighter as I

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.499 
it it's really clear a lot brighter as I
said<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.790> did<00:01:26.939> feel<00:01:27.090> like<00:01:27.150> he<00:01:27.330> was

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
said and it did feel like he was

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.690 
said and it did feel like he was
watching<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.200> movie<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:28.829> also<00:01:28.979> he<00:01:29.189> was<00:01:29.490> sort<00:01:29.670> of

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
watching a movie but also he was sort of

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.819 
watching a movie but also he was sort of
immersed<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> game<00:01:30.540> more<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.740> very

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
immersed in the game more so it's very

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.080 
immersed in the game more so it's very
own<00:01:32.100> capturing<00:01:32.909> that's<00:01:33.570> what<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.750> think<00:01:33.960> I'm

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
own capturing that's what I think I'm

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.160 
own capturing that's what I think I'm
blown<00:01:36.090> away<00:01:36.299> actually<00:01:36.420> about<00:01:36.750> how<00:01:36.930> well

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
blown away actually about how well

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.780 
blown away actually about how well
passive<00:01:37.619> 3d<00:01:37.920> works<00:01:38.130> because<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.610> same

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
passive 3d works because it's the same

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.310 
passive 3d works because it's the same

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
seeing that at home

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.740 
seeing that at home
last<00:01:44.579> year<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.790> notice<00:01:45.090> all<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.390> all<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.870 
last year I notice all the all the
screens<00:01:46.020> seem<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.320> be<00:01:46.409> really<00:01:46.619> dim<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.520> year

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
screens seem to be really dim this year

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.120 
screens seem to be really dim this year
seems<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.899> be<00:01:48.990> really<00:01:49.320> bright<00:01:49.500> there's<00:01:49.979> no

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
seems to be really bright there's no

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.620 
seems to be really bright there's no
even<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.729> cinema<00:01:51.030> sometimes<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.479> see

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
even in the cinema sometimes you see

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.270 
even in the cinema sometimes you see
that<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.990> little<00:01:52.140> bit<00:01:52.259> dim<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:53.070> I've<00:01:53.130> not

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
that it's a little bit dim but I've not

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.530 
that it's a little bit dim but I've not
noticed<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.640> at<00:01:53.790> all<00:01:53.970> with<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.210> stuff<00:01:54.420> that

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
noticed that at all with the stuff that

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.330 
noticed that at all with the stuff that
we've<00:01:54.659> seen<00:01:54.810> today<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.110> that's<00:01:55.649> what<00:01:56.219> it's

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
we've seen today so that's what it's

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.950 
we've seen today so that's what it's
going<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.549> be<00:01:56.670> like<00:01:56.850> at<00:01:57.000> home<00:01:57.180> which<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.840> would

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
going to be like at home which I would

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.319 
going to be like at home which I would
say<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.590> think<00:01:59.219> it's<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.820> way<00:01:59.939> forward

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
say it is I think it's the way forward

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.990 
say it is I think it's the way forward
in<00:02:00.420> terms<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.810> 3d<00:02:01.409> view<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:02.430> wider<00:02:02.670> viewing

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
in terms of 3d view the wider viewing

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.819 
in terms of 3d view the wider viewing
angle<00:02:03.210> means<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:04.049> can<00:02:04.200> have<00:02:04.259> more<00:02:04.439> people<00:02:04.649> in

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
angle means you can have more people in

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.429 
angle means you can have more people in
a<00:02:04.920> smaller<00:02:05.219> space<00:02:05.869> being<00:02:06.869> able<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.170> view

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
a smaller space being able to view

football<00:03:18.090> like<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.300> depth<00:03:18.540> being<00:03:19.260> able<00:03:19.380> to

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
football like the depth being able to

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.400 
football like the depth being able to
see<00:03:19.680> how<00:03:20.459> wide<00:03:20.730> shots<00:03:21.000> have<00:03:21.209> gone<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:22.230> if

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
see how wide shots have gone and if

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.510 
see how wide shots have gone and if
they're<00:03:22.590> going<00:03:22.739> over<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:22.980> bar<00:03:23.130> because

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
they're going over the bar because

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.310 
they're going over the bar because
sometimes<00:03:23.820> in<00:03:23.970> 2d<00:03:24.300> even<00:03:24.630> though<00:03:24.750> it's<00:03:24.870> in<00:03:24.900> HD

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
sometimes in 2d even though it's in HD

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.790 
sometimes in 2d even though it's in HD
you<00:03:25.830> sometimes<00:03:26.220> notice<00:03:26.580> that<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:28.260> looks<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.709> lot

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
you sometimes notice that it looks a lot

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.080 
you sometimes notice that it looks a lot
closer<00:03:29.070> than<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.430> actually<00:03:29.550> is<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:29.850> when<00:03:30.000> you

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
closer than it actually is and when you

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.340 
closer than it actually is and when you
see<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.300> replay<00:03:30.540> from<00:03:30.750> behind<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.140> goal<00:03:31.290> and

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
see the replay from behind the goal and

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.100 
see the replay from behind the goal and
stuff<00:03:31.560> it's<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.830> lot<00:03:31.980> wider<00:03:32.160> that<00:03:32.600> turns<00:03:33.600> good

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
stuff it's a lot wider that turns good

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.340 
stuff it's a lot wider that turns good
in<00:03:34.380> golf<00:03:35.100> that<00:03:35.250> I've<00:03:35.550> seen<00:03:35.930> being<00:03:36.930> able<00:03:37.050> to<00:03:37.170> see

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
in golf that I've seen being able to see

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.260 
in golf that I've seen being able to see
the<00:03:37.680> ball<00:03:37.890> in<00:03:38.100> flight<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.550> lot<00:03:38.700> easier<00:03:39.030> and

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
the ball in flight a lot easier and

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.960 
the ball in flight a lot easier and
picking<00:03:39.570> it<00:03:39.660> out<00:03:39.750> it's<00:03:40.080> just<00:03:40.260> straight<00:03:40.500> there

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
picking it out it's just straight there

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.600 
picking it out it's just straight there

as close to the cinema you're going to

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.600 
as close to the cinema you're going to
get<00:03:46.500> if<00:03:46.590> not<00:03:46.770> better<00:03:46.920> because<00:03:47.370> of<00:03:47.520> the

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
get if not better because of the

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.640 
get if not better because of the
brightness<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.239> picture<00:03:48.380> my<00:03:49.380> favorite

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
brightness of the picture my favorite

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.930 
brightness of the picture my favorite
was<00:03:49.770> the<00:03:49.800> obviously<00:03:50.400> with<00:03:50.550> the<00:03:50.610> gaming<00:03:50.820> real

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
was the obviously with the gaming real

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.670 
was the obviously with the gaming real
finesse<00:03:51.180> where<00:03:51.360> 3d<00:03:51.570> should<00:03:51.900> be<00:03:52.050> sort<00:03:52.620> of

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
finesse where 3d should be sort of

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.280 
finesse where 3d should be sort of
gaming<00:03:53.520> and<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.239> passive<00:03:54.600> so<00:03:54.959> much<00:03:55.080> better

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
gaming and the passive so much better

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.699 
gaming and the passive so much better
than<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.500> active<00:03:55.770> shutter<00:03:56.400> I<00:03:57.440> know<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:58.500> can't

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
than the active shutter I know you can't

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.740 
than the active shutter I know you can't
really<00:03:58.830> notice<00:03:58.980> a<00:03:59.130> difference<00:03:59.489> too<00:03:59.760> much<00:04:00.000> but

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
really notice a difference too much but

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.420 
really notice a difference too much but
it's<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.930> lot<00:04:01.050> clearer<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.320> lot<00:04:01.560> brighter<00:04:01.770> and<00:04:02.340> I

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
it's a lot clearer a lot brighter and I

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.920 
it's a lot clearer a lot brighter and I
definitely<00:04:02.610> compromise<00:04:03.180> more<00:04:03.480> space<00:04:03.720> when

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
definitely compromise more space when

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.920 
definitely compromise more space when
I'm<00:04:04.050> huge<00:04:04.260> TVs<00:04:04.620> just<00:04:04.920> to<00:04:05.610> just<00:04:06.300> play<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.600> Xbox

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
lot brighter than the shutter the gaming

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.590 
lot brighter than the shutter the gaming

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.800 
I have to say I was expecting to be
exactly<00:04:58.340> the<00:04:58.460> same<00:04:58.490> for<00:04:58.669> one<00:04:58.970> but<00:04:59.570> they're<00:04:59.690> not

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
exactly the same for one but they're not

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.080 
exactly the same for one but they're not
a<00:05:00.080> lot<00:05:00.680> more<00:05:00.830> comfortable<00:05:01.010> than<00:05:01.340> that<00:05:01.490> because

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
a lot more comfortable than that because

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.940 
a lot more comfortable than that because
they<00:05:02.270> are<00:05:02.419> so<00:05:02.630> simple<00:05:02.870> to<00:05:03.080> produce<00:05:03.200> it<00:05:03.710> means

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
they are so simple to produce it means

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.490 
they are so simple to produce it means
they<00:05:04.100> can<00:05:04.250> fit<00:05:04.550> many<00:05:04.940> age<00:05:05.180> groups<00:05:05.510> I<00:05:05.840> think

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
they can fit many age groups I think

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.379 
they can fit many age groups I think
that's<00:05:06.620> the<00:05:06.710> key<00:05:06.860> thing<00:05:07.130> you<00:05:07.400> know<00:05:08.060> on<00:05:08.240> the

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
that's the key thing you know on the

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:09.370 
that's the key thing you know on the
active<00:05:08.690> shuttle<00:05:08.960> ones<00:05:09.110> they<00:05:09.350> are

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
active shuttle ones they are

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.940 
active shuttle ones they are
specifically<00:05:10.220> designed<00:05:10.400> for<00:05:10.760> I<00:05:11.270> don't<00:05:11.690> wear

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
specifically designed for I don't wear

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.890 
specifically designed for I don't wear
and<00:05:12.950> I've<00:05:13.250> known<00:05:13.460> a<00:05:13.729> few<00:05:13.880> friends<00:05:14.300> who've<00:05:14.389> had

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
and I've known a few friends who've had

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.810 
and I've known a few friends who've had
them<00:05:15.050> and<00:05:15.139> they<00:05:15.200> said<00:05:15.410> they<00:05:16.280> don't<00:05:16.550> fit<00:05:16.790> the

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
them and they said they don't fit the

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.940 
them and they said they don't fit the
kids<00:05:17.090> they're<00:05:17.270> too<00:05:17.419> heavy<00:05:17.750> they<00:05:18.410> fall<00:05:18.680> off<00:05:18.830> the

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
kids they're too heavy they fall off the

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.080 
kids they're too heavy they fall off the
note<00:05:19.100> because<00:05:19.220> their<00:05:19.430> child's<00:05:19.729> notice

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
note because their child's notice

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.930 
note because their child's notice
smaller<00:05:20.330> they<00:05:21.050> just<00:05:21.229> fall<00:05:21.410> off<00:05:21.639> and<00:05:22.639> whereas

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
smaller they just fall off and whereas

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.600 
smaller they just fall off and whereas
these<00:05:23.139> you<00:05:24.139> know<00:05:24.229> you<00:05:24.979> can<00:05:25.130> throw<00:05:25.280> them<00:05:25.400> around

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
these you know you can throw them around

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.670 
these you know you can throw them around
to<00:05:26.479> pick<00:05:26.660> them<00:05:26.810> up<00:05:26.900> throw<00:05:27.169> them<00:05:27.200> down<00:05:27.350> if<00:05:27.590> you

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
to pick them up throw them down if you

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.290 
to pick them up throw them down if you
scratch<00:05:27.890> the<00:05:28.039> lens<00:05:28.250> it's<00:05:28.700> not<00:05:28.820> a<00:05:28.850> problem<00:05:29.060> and

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
scratch the lens it's not a problem and

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.150 
scratch the lens it's not a problem and
just<00:05:29.450> replace<00:05:29.690> them<00:05:29.900> if<00:05:30.620> they<00:05:30.770> break<00:05:30.979> you<00:05:31.130> just

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
just replace them if they break you just

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.400 
just replace them if they break you just
replace<00:05:31.520> them<00:05:31.669> to<00:05:31.789> only<00:05:31.970> pound<00:05:32.150> of<00:05:32.270> time<00:05:32.450> so

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
replace them to only pound of time so

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.870 
replace them to only pound of time so
but<00:05:33.860> putting<00:05:34.100> them<00:05:34.220> on<00:05:34.400> you<00:05:35.300> I<00:05:35.660> mean<00:05:36.470> I've<00:05:36.590> got

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
but putting them on you I mean I've got

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.820 
but putting them on you I mean I've got
you<00:05:37.880> know<00:05:37.970> I<00:05:38.240> think<00:05:38.990> that<00:05:39.169> is<00:05:39.350> slightly<00:05:39.590> lower

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
you know I think that is slightly lower

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.420 
you know I think that is slightly lower
or<00:05:40.039> whatever<00:05:40.310> but<00:05:40.660> they<00:05:41.660> they<00:05:41.810> fit<00:05:42.050> nicely

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
or whatever but they they fit nicely

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.700 
or whatever but they they fit nicely
they<00:05:43.430> feel<00:05:43.700> really<00:05:44.030> comfortably<00:05:44.450> and<00:05:44.750> you

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
they feel really comfortably and you

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.080 
they feel really comfortably and you
could<00:05:45.860> wear<00:05:46.070> them<00:05:46.280> for<00:05:46.460> an<00:05:46.520> entire<00:05:46.789> film

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
could wear them for an entire film

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.600 
could wear them for an entire film
without<00:05:47.860> feeling<00:05:48.860> that<00:05:48.919> getting<00:05:49.160> away<00:05:49.340> I

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
without feeling that getting away I

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.810 
without feeling that getting away I
think<00:05:50.210> that's<00:05:50.360> really<00:05:50.539> key
