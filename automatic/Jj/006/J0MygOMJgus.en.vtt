00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 or dress returns in the double feature 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.620
 jarvis i am a huge batman fans 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.210
 and the brother of lars gave me this 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.950
 recommended movies and I was one too 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.109
 for all time too stingy for this fell 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.550
 but then finally brought to the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.350
 I'll come soon and well what shall 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.390
 I say to that 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:28.680
 first to the content batman the dark 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.410
 Knight returns plays a bit in 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.969
 the future because I batman now 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.140
 is already aged and actually has 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:43.469
 here thrown the towel thrown 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:47.160
 Thrown and then it will be again 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.910
 but it has to be tanya and me again 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.949
 do not want too much style on 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.850
 he will get new robin again 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.940
 and so on and so to say so without 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.010
 the building land account quickly to his 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.610
 border 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.170
 and then superman appears as well 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.850
 in the second part under as well as the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.830
 I think that is how it is presented 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.140
 many a superman do not fall 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.100
 please let the new ones are curious 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.960
 what he says because I do not know if 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.210
 there was lars saline pretzel neck 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.830
 get stuck and that's what I want 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.439
 Also recommend that you can eat to it 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.829
 heinz petzinka snacks nachos that is 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.630
 no movie for big I would now 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.350
 claim with the coke the film 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.090
 definitely only with people or with people 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.229
 know the comics or these on this 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.850
 movies are available on the general 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.799
 superheroes stand up and in particular 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.899
 batman probably less on 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.040
 people who also superman stands with the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.810
 you should not look that is better 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.970
 made it very beautiful so lovingly 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.770
 animated would claim now 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.270
 It took me a few minutes 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.670
 get in but I just would 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.190
 very good I liked have just been 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.990
 mentioned that I for a full time to 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.360
 Stingy was the price entertainment 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.130
 Ratio was pretty high in the beginning 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.479
 and then I had a very short time 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.850
 luck and there I think both of you 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.980
 I believe that in the second one 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.660
 first even for seven euros and the 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.730
 here then somehow still for nine have 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.930
 I struck because they are too 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.020
 not really long the movie and me 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.480
 believe then one of the two days is 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.420
 76 minutes and the first 76 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.130
 for minutes and there we were more than 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.110
 ten euros already too much for the two 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.090
 So films have seven and nine euros there 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.700
 I then struck 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.290
 this is my one price recommendation for 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.780
 you guys in the video will find the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.860
 also left to these two films but 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.360
 if you can have luck so times a 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.370
 you can track that too 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.490
 to shoot for a few euros 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.990
 recommended for the fans yes it is 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.150
 the continuation of a series yes that is 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.950
 has the two films here 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.090
 this is actually a movie and can be like that 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.170
 split because they probably one 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.440
 Not wanting to do a little more coal 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.519
 know it's very nice to look at words 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.430
 if you stand out from what 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.140
 comic-screenings then i can do this 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.910
 both blu rays are missing now and that is 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.220
 my blu-ray tip for the weekend 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.470
 Now I would like to have a feedback 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.209
 if you like the movie of or the 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.100
 both films have already been written writes 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.170
 me still in the comments what you good 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.730
 found and above all things like that would 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.830
 I am most interested in how it is 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.080
 her like superman in this movie 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.549
 is pictured 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.540
 I 'm curious what lars tells us 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:30.290
 had not seen it yet 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.290
 looking forward to your feedback
