00:00:00.000 --> 00:02:25.960 

Panasonic<00:00:00.840> ideas<00:00:01.140> for<00:00:01.500> life

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.480 

I<00:02:28.360> feel<00:02:29.360> we<00:02:30.110> have<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.290> good<00:02:30.590> start<00:02:30.980> today<00:02:31.130> so

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
I feel we have a good start today so

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.220 
I feel we have a good start today so
like<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:31.700> think<00:02:32.090> we<00:02:32.420> actually<00:02:32.540> put<00:02:32.900> up<00:02:32.990> a<00:02:33.020> really

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
like I think we actually put up a really

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.050 
like I think we actually put up a really
good<00:02:33.440> fight<00:02:33.500> against<00:02:33.890> them<00:02:34.100> like<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.610> skyline

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
good fight against them like the skyline

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.970 
good fight against them like the skyline
was<00:02:35.240> really<00:02:35.630> close<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:35.870> out<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.350> hog<00:02:36.500> podium

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
was really close to out the hog podium

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.750 
was really close to out the hog podium
so<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.190> think<00:02:37.340> a<00:02:38.080> bit<00:02:39.080> wish<00:02:39.890> that<00:02:40.340> we<00:02:40.490> didn't

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
so I think a bit wish that we didn't

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.850 
so I think a bit wish that we didn't
manage<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.360> overcome<00:02:41.450> them<00:02:41.930> but<00:02:42.170> I<00:02:42.410> was

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
manage to overcome them but I was

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.480 
manage to overcome them but I was
grateful

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
grateful

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.580 
grateful
yeah<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:44.300> this<00:02:44.450> is<00:02:44.600> very<00:02:44.810> happy<00:02:45.230> that<00:02:45.440> we've

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
yeah and this is very happy that we've

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.920 
yeah and this is very happy that we've
won<00:02:45.830> in<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:46.070> second<00:02:46.640> time<00:02:46.730> in<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:47.000> row<00:02:47.030> I<00:02:47.480> think

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
won in a second time in a row I think

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.570 
won in a second time in a row I think
that<00:02:48.050> we<00:02:48.170> were<00:02:48.290> bit<00:02:48.530> nervous<00:02:48.770> coming<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.460> me

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
that we were bit nervous coming to me

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.280 
that we were bit nervous coming to me
until<00:02:49.820> unify<00:02:50.180> notes<00:02:50.420> but<00:02:50.600> I<00:02:50.630> think<00:02:50.900> we<00:02:50.990> managed

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
until unify notes but I think we managed

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.440 
until unify notes but I think we managed
to<00:02:51.320> prove<00:02:51.710> ourselves<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.310> put<00:02:52.490> you<00:02:52.670> in<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:53.030> a

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
to prove ourselves and put you in and a

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.880 
to prove ourselves and put you in and a
really<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.840> team<00:02:54.170> really<00:02:54.380> fought<00:02:54.560> hard<00:02:54.590> in

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
really the team really fought hard in

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.040 
really the team really fought hard in
the<00:02:55.040> finals<00:02:55.400> happy<00:02:56.000> we<00:02:56.120> didn't<00:02:56.420> play<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:56.840> well

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
the finals happy we didn't play so well

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.960 
the finals happy we didn't play so well
in<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.290> last<00:02:57.320> quarter<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:58.610> they<00:02:58.730> caught<00:02:58.940> that

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
in the last quarter and they caught that

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.550 
in the last quarter and they caught that
and<00:02:59.360> like<00:02:59.600> a<00:02:59.720> lot<00:02:59.810> injuries<00:03:00.170> here<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.440> there

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
and like a lot injuries here and there

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.470 
and like a lot injuries here and there
but<00:03:00.680> yeah<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:00.920> think<00:03:01.070> you<00:03:01.490> did<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.060> really<00:03:02.270> good

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
but yeah I think you did a really good

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.970 
but yeah I think you did a really good
performance<00:03:02.930> but<00:03:03.080> I<00:03:03.140> think<00:03:03.410> we<00:03:03.530> managed<00:03:03.890> to

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
performance but I think we managed to

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.280 
performance but I think we managed to
prove<00:03:04.730> that<00:03:04.790> we<00:03:05.150> were<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.660> better<00:03:05.810> team<00:03:05.930> by

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
prove that we were the better team by

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.500 
prove that we were the better team by
like<00:03:06.530> composing<00:03:07.160> ourselves<00:03:07.790> despite<00:03:08.120> um<00:03:08.270> they

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
like composing ourselves despite um they

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.480 
like composing ourselves despite um they
are<00:03:08.570> very<00:03:08.780> strongly<00:03:09.080> fans<00:03:09.380> yeah<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.160> we

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
are very strongly fans yeah and we

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.970 
are very strongly fans yeah and we
managed<00:03:10.820> to<00:03:11.170> do<00:03:12.170> can't<00:03:12.380> tell<00:03:12.530> what<00:03:12.830> you're
