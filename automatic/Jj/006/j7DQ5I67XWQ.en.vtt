rebuilt<00:00:10.329> I'm<00:00:11.329> going<00:00:11.480> to<00:00:11.570> just<00:00:11.660> go<00:00:12.699> go<00:00:13.699> through

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:13.879 
rebuilt I'm going to just go go through

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.290 
rebuilt I'm going to just go go through
and<00:00:14.030> fire<00:00:14.179> up<00:00:14.360> the<00:00:14.480> truck<00:00:14.690> and<00:00:14.869> show<00:00:15.049> you<00:00:16.300> what

and fire up the truck and show you what

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.150 
and fire up the truck and show you what
all<00:00:17.480> it<00:00:17.929> looks<00:00:18.170> like<00:00:18.349> and<00:00:18.560> how<00:00:18.590> it<00:00:18.679> runs<00:00:18.890> and

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
all it looks like and how it runs and

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:30.009 
all it looks like and how it runs and
everything<00:00:19.250> else<00:00:22.689> here<00:00:23.689> real<00:00:23.869> quick<00:00:28.960> again<00:00:29.960> I

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
everything else here real quick again I

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.940 
everything else here real quick again I
probably<00:00:30.529> cut<00:00:30.769> a<00:00:30.800> lot<00:00:31.009> of<00:00:31.039> stuff<00:00:31.220> out<00:00:31.490> I<00:00:32.950> just

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
probably cut a lot of stuff out I just

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.850 
probably cut a lot of stuff out I just
wanted<00:00:34.220> to<00:00:34.340> get<00:00:34.430> this<00:00:34.670> rebuild<00:00:35.420> done<00:00:35.660> here<00:00:35.960> and

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
wanted to get this rebuild done here and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.080 
wanted to get this rebuild done here and
I<00:00:36.950> probably<00:00:37.190> cut<00:00:37.490> a<00:00:37.840> lot<00:00:38.840> of<00:00:38.960> things<00:00:39.170> out<00:00:39.410> that

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
I probably cut a lot of things out that

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.640 
I probably cut a lot of things out that
would<00:00:41.090> have<00:00:41.210> probably<00:00:41.330> helped<00:00:41.630> some<00:00:42.350> people

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
would have probably helped some people

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.070 
would have probably helped some people
as<00:00:42.980> far<00:00:43.160> as<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:43.400> install<00:00:43.700> and<00:00:43.940> and<00:00:44.180> now<00:00:45.020> the

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
as far as the install and and now the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.800 
as far as the install and and now the
removal<00:00:45.680> of<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:46.940> engine<00:00:47.270> and<00:00:47.480> stuff<00:00:47.660> like

removal of the engine and stuff like

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.890 
removal of the engine and stuff like
that<00:00:48.050> but<00:00:48.290> I<00:00:48.530> try<00:00:49.370> to<00:00:49.430> just<00:00:49.670> give<00:00:50.480> like<00:00:50.690> key

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
that but I try to just give like key

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.050 
that but I try to just give like key
points<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:51.500> and<00:00:52.160> different<00:00:52.430> things<00:00:52.820> on

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
points and and different things on

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.760 
points and and different things on
things<00:00:53.780> that<00:00:53.900> I<00:00:53.990> felt<00:00:54.320> that<00:00:54.470> were<00:00:54.620> a<00:00:54.650> little

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
things that I felt that were a little

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.380 
things that I felt that were a little
more<00:00:56.320> important<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:57.940> key<00:00:58.940> elements

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
more important and key elements

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.420 
more important and key elements
basically<00:00:59.920> matter<00:01:00.920> is<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.160> engine

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
basically matter is the engine

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.179 
basically matter is the engine
compartment<00:01:01.810> I'm<00:01:02.810> going<00:01:02.990> to<00:01:03.110> take<00:01:03.830> this<00:01:03.980> over

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
then power wash them give it nice and

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.040 
then power wash them give it nice and
detailed<00:01:15.770> under<00:01:16.190> there<00:01:16.570> and<00:01:17.570> a<00:01:17.600> fries<00:01:17.840> nice

thought I thought mileage but he got the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.280 
thought I thought mileage but he got the
wait<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.520> start<00:02:30.730> like

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290

well<00:02:32.950> plugs<00:02:33.220> are<00:02:33.430> basically<00:02:34.090> firing<00:02:34.540> up<00:02:34.659> at

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
well plugs are basically firing up at

well plugs are basically firing up at
this<00:02:34.959> point<00:02:36.840> there<00:02:37.840> we<00:02:37.930> go

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.770 

no<00:02:47.200> no<00:02:47.830> engine<00:02:48.190> lights<00:02:48.400> I've<00:02:49.300> put<00:02:49.540> about<00:02:49.720> a

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
no no engine lights I've put about a

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.310 
no no engine lights I've put about a
hundred<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:54.030> put<00:02:55.030> up<00:02:55.120> basically<00:02:56.080> to<00:02:56.290> the

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
hundred and put up basically to the

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.300 
hundred and put up basically to the
rebuild<00:02:56.740> that<00:02:56.950> one<00:02:57.580> sixty<00:02:58.060> eight<00:02:58.330> thirty<00:02:58.840> I

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
rebuild that one sixty eight thirty I

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.410 
rebuild that one sixty eight thirty I
think<00:03:00.310> is<00:03:00.400> where<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:00.640> speedometer<00:03:01.090> was<00:03:01.240> I've

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
think is where the speedometer was I've

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.920 
think is where the speedometer was I've
put<00:03:01.630> about<00:03:01.750> 110<00:03:02.650> 111<00:03:03.070> miles<00:03:03.490> on<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.540> truck<00:03:04.780> so

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
put about 110 111 miles on the truck so

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.820 
put about 110 111 miles on the truck so
far<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:06.600> from<00:03:07.600> what<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:07.810> read<00:03:08.080> you<00:03:08.560> want<00:03:08.680> to

far and from what I read you want to

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.500 
far and from what I read you want to
break<00:03:09.010> these<00:03:09.160> engines<00:03:09.580> in<00:03:09.760> for<00:03:09.940> about<00:03:10.060> fifteen

like that on a normal basis uh probably

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.250 
like that on a normal basis uh probably
