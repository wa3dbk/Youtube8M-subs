00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 Once there's a risk of rapid expansion. 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.410
 There is no country or title that is welcomed by the title. 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.349
 Even in the US, I think it's the world's largest producer of gm 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:19.080
 Parking in the US Consumers are bubbling 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:24.750
 With ROK fta into force date is also a hot debate on the GM food 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:29.670
 Is the evil that threatens our dining table f unwarranted causal ghost of twelve threats 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.929
 Focusing on genetically engineered foods and Act 2 in the context of the Hanmi fta era 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.929
 I checked the relationship. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.490
 Rumors about genetically engineered food become sns as the US FTA becomes effective 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.580
 Spread through 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:53.750
 App j will cause omnipresent sign 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:58.640
 Trade Center is around what display scheme is not applicable to the key violations on the stern 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:02.620
 I left a reply, but I do not feel anxiety. 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.790
 I 'm going to mark the loan personality as Mr. Muntuto . My gm is coming 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.830
 It is an exception from 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.810
 If you do not have 5 principles to use , 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.890
 Sausage 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.950
 The gmo is in the 6th 7th ingredient and I'm not marking it. 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:24.200
 It's not a violation of the current law. 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:31.729
 Because the force is a hole in the target mouse in the current mouse, 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:36.680
 Although not stipulated in the back does not go away easily situation also Agreement 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:42.590
 There was a consensus about the operation of the law. 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:45.530
 If there is no clear evidence that food is harmful to health, 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:50.600
 Once to avoid risk assessment 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:54.259
 What are you talking about upside risks to rats appeared around until something caused by food 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:59.420
 It is possible to regulate food 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:05.330
 Let the languages allow us to do a lot of inquiries when importing something after that. 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:11.030
 In summary, when he wants to sell the native Ly carriage dm 5 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:16.130
 Then, our country is prohibited by law, 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:21.590
 It may not be lucky that it infringes the rights annya these concerns yet also the actual 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:24.220
 And if that's the case , should I guarantee gmo commercial cultivation ? 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:29.350
 There might be 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:33.850
 5 Now maybe you are preparing for a complaint 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:38.740
 What's behind is that the food can be grown using conventional techniques of genetic engineering 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:43.420
 Foods that have been developed to have no traits or genetic inheritance 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:48.640
 It is called the second Green Revolution and is an alternative to solve the food problem. 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:52.060
 But the safety of Bing is controversial. 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.810
 Because people have artificially claimed dna, people do not 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:00.160
 It's possible that you may have an allergic reaction while eating protein that was not 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:05.709
 Another one is called Mako , and that's it now. 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:09.400
 Bar gene Luca who has returned antibiotics, it will continue to find resistance in the body 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:14.380
 Be concerned about these parts, which will continue in the coming'm going to 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.700
 Things like their own after they anmeokneun in countries such as the United States moth m just one of us 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.990
 There's a possibility of nine. 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:23.230
 We are forced to eat because there epilation make something non-bruising If you do not want to starve to eat 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:28.660
 I do not know if there's any pak cluckers. 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:34.870
 The United States, the world's largest exporter of journalists gmo production unit of the Year USA 2006 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:39.070
 The traditional area of rats is 5400 to 600,000 hectares of global GM crops 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:43.570
 It accounts for 53.5% of the cultivated area 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:47.920
 In the recent situation in international grain prices increased up to its international rather 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:52.870
 I'm growing more Ji Ho ratio after 2008 because the international 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:57.910
 As the price of grains grows higher, we are now importing better ones . 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:02.709
 In Korea, rice is usually 2 17 million tons 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:07.180
 What a lot 7,000,000 in Taoyuan'm just watching me do this, 4,000,000 tons 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:09.310
 Gene coming, including the country of forage crops give this medicine 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:14.920
 It will be 8 million tons 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:17.680
 So, if the total people eat rice that is important in the table, that much 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:22.900
 I'm coming to that amount gm 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:28.240
 Monsanto, a US company, is a leading producer of genetically modified foods 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:34.510
 And export of genetically modified foods than 170 countries of the world 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:39.430
 The company's previous products in mice include chemical weapons such as nerve gas 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:44.490
 It 's a drug made in Monsanto by the Nazis in the Vietnam War . 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:46.960
 Monsanto, which changed its industry in agriculture, 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:53.620
 I made a herbicide. 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:58.810
 And now , using genetic engineering technology, I have developed a noncommercial comb. 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.590
 Uh Ji Ho has come into use in our country gotta sell it for display 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.240
 There is 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.080
 At that time, the genetically engineered gene Jeju Do is selling genetically modified 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.280
 I do it. 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:13.389
 Oil is going to be squeezed as the sale to consumers without any display 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:17.199
 I mean, coming to Destin for a feed and display flocking same 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:18.520
 Oil extractors or something that consumers buy these things silently 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:24.580
 That's it. 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:28.600
 Without hereditary and manipulative food, it will be hungry with cows and pigs. 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:34.270
 When they are starving, they can not eat meat anymore. 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:40.510
 For this reason, the import of genetically engineered food is steeply increasing every year 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:43.090
 Of the 703 bred corn imported for animal food in 2008, 6.8 million tonnes 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:49.720
 It was American corn. 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:54.220
 Rice barley wheat and other food crops produced by Korea in the same total of 5.45 million tons 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:56.350
 Pore ​​water was imported into larger quantities of mice 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:00.099
 Now the food can 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:03.880
 Eoneuge share media can not see I'm about to admit that time 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:07.990
 So what about during the two went over the May gmo example 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.880
 This can determine whether the cross-country in accordance with the five displays Act 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:14.289
 I do not have a PC. 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:19.090
 It 's still a municipality in areas where it's safe for people to eat . 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:24.580
 India dominates the cotton market developed by Monsanto, USA 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:27.099
 bt cotton water to secrete their own toxins to prevent insects from occurring 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:32.620
 An entirely transformed thing 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:36.400
 But the sheep and goats eating this cotton are dying in half. 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:41.770
 If so , how about the love of that sheep ? 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:45.669
 State and its regions and its culture that any changes in the ecosystem or the 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:49.689
 How long does it take to be toxic when taken? 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:51.189
 I do not want to be able to check these things out 

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:54.240
 In this way, 

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:59.860
 I do not have a budget to invest in my name . 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:02.020
 In August 1998, Dr. Agathi Pusai of the USA presented a genetically engineered potato 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:06.729
 Feed experiments can take place 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:12.999
 The results were amazing. Almost all organs weighed 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:18.310
 Rats fed 20 days of genetically modified potatoes have lowered liver function and deduction function 

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:20.560
 After this followed media reports dwaetdaneun after the experiment goes wrong, but enemies to write a nutcracker 

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:26.020
 The controversy continues. 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:29.620
 But the US government and the genetic engineering and the road to mold combat have yet to point to the r 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:34.300
 There is no scientific basis . 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:38.979
 In addition to the push-guaranteed dont able to see out the end of the option price 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:42.999
 The option is not safe but not a problem later, but I know I can eat 

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:45.189
 Ask them to introduce a labeling that of'm itneungeo and in the US House 

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:48.580
 Anja is the most basic thing. 

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:53.759
 Our survival culture is something like this. 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:53.759
 We have to worry about even the next generation of John.
