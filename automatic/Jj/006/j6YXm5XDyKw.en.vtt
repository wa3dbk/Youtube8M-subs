00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
this paint I've thinned out a little bit

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.910 
this paint I've thinned out a little bit
with<00:01:12.750> some<00:01:12.780> water<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.380> can<00:01:13.530> see<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.799> quite

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
with some water you can see it's quite

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.760 
with some water you can see it's quite
thin<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:15.240> don't<00:01:15.450> want<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.930> opaque<00:01:16.380> at<00:01:16.619> this

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
thin you don't want to be opaque at this

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.710 
thin you don't want to be opaque at this
point<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.850> reason<00:01:18.030> why<00:01:18.299> we're<00:01:18.450> using<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
point and the reason why we're using the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.859 
point and the reason why we're using the
white<00:01:19.009> initially<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.189> because<00:01:20.580> if<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.570> didn't

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
white initially is because if we didn't

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.899 
white initially is because if we didn't
then<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.380> other<00:01:22.560> colors<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> Polish<00:01:23.610> when

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
then the other colors of the Polish when

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.940 
then the other colors of the Polish when
we<00:01:24.030> die<00:01:24.360> using<00:01:24.659> polish<00:01:24.930> wouldn't<00:01:25.530> stand<00:01:25.740> out

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
we die using polish wouldn't stand out

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.340 
we die using polish wouldn't stand out
and<00:01:26.640> what's<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> acrylic<00:01:27.630> paint<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.049> dry

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
and what's the acrylic paint is dry

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.960 
and what's the acrylic paint is dry
which<00:01:28.619> doesn't<00:01:29.009> take<00:01:29.159> very<00:01:29.310> long<00:01:29.430> at<00:01:29.579> all<00:01:29.759> I'm

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
which doesn't take very long at all I'm

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.520 
which doesn't take very long at all I'm
getting<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.390> sponge<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.840> cutting<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> corner

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
getting a sponge and cutting the corner

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.609 
getting a sponge and cutting the corner
of<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.799> off<00:01:32.240> probably<00:01:33.240> didn't<00:01:34.110> really<00:01:34.320> need<00:01:34.470> to

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
of it off probably didn't really need to

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.219 
of it off probably didn't really need to
do<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.770> but<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.310> know<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.390> my<00:01:36.420> brain<00:01:36.780> other<00:01:36.990> was

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
do that but I know in my brain other was

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.499 
do that but I know in my brain other was
a<00:01:37.290> really<00:01:37.500> good<00:01:37.619> idea<00:01:37.909> and<00:01:38.909> we're<00:01:39.329> going<00:01:39.360> to

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
a really good idea and we're going to

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.630 
a really good idea and we're going to
use<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> sponge<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.409> add<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.950> color<00:01:41.189> from<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
use the sponge to add the color from the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.160 
use the sponge to add the color from the
polish<00:01:42.030> because<00:01:42.210> we<00:01:42.390> don't<00:01:42.570> want<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> polish

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
polish because we don't want the polish

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.700 
polish because we don't want the polish
to<00:01:43.290> be<00:01:43.409> feet<00:01:44.509> now<00:01:45.509> firstly<00:01:45.840> coming<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.409> with

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
it I came back in with the sponge and

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.979 
it I came back in with the sponge and
did<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.850> little<00:03:26.910> bit<00:03:27.180> of<00:03:27.209> more<00:03:27.420> sponging<00:03:27.870> with

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
did a little bit of more sponging with

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.990 
did a little bit of more sponging with
the<00:03:28.080> pink<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.620> nebula<00:03:29.310> just<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.820> add<00:03:29.970> some

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
the pink and the nebula just to add some

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.870 
the pink and the nebula just to add some
more<00:03:30.600> stuff<00:03:31.050> I<00:03:31.290> think<00:03:31.770> I<00:03:31.860> put<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.370> little<00:03:32.640> bit

now with the other three nails it's

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.890 
now with the other three nails it's
something<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.240> little<00:03:51.330> bit<00:03:51.480> different<00:03:51.810> I

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
something a little bit different I

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.930 
something a little bit different I
actually<00:03:52.020> firstly<00:03:52.740> painted<00:03:53.250> all<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.580> them<00:03:53.790> now

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
actually firstly painted all of them now

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.120 
actually firstly painted all of them now
all<00:03:54.180> of<00:03:54.330> those<00:03:54.450> three<00:03:54.930> nails<00:03:55.140> with<00:03:55.620> nebula

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
all of those three nails with nebula

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.190 
all of those three nails with nebula
first<00:03:56.400> then<00:03:57.030> with<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.570> white<00:03:57.750> acrylic<00:03:57.990> paint

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
first then with the white acrylic paint

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.890 
first then with the white acrylic paint
made<00:03:58.680> this<00:03:58.830> sort<00:03:59.070> of<00:03:59.100> like<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.340> tail<00:03:59.730> I<00:04:00.120> suppose

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
made this sort of like a tail I suppose

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.690 
made this sort of like a tail I suppose
you<00:04:01.020> could<00:04:01.140> call<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.530> tail<00:04:01.740> anyway<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:02.460> then

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
you could call it a tail anyway and then

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.970 
you could call it a tail anyway and then
went<00:04:02.940> over<00:04:03.210> that<00:04:03.330> with<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.750> nebula<00:04:04.740> again

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
went over that with the nebula again

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.760 
went over that with the nebula again
with<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.250> sponge<00:04:05.520> and<00:04:05.760> then<00:04:06.380> came<00:04:07.380> through

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
with the sponge and then came through

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.490 
with the sponge and then came through
with<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.430> pink<00:04:08.850> on<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.120> either<00:04:09.390> side<00:04:09.570> on<00:04:10.140> the

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
with the pink on the either side on the

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.550 
with the pink on the either side on the
top<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:10.920> bottom<00:04:10.950> of<00:04:11.280> those<00:04:12.320> blue<00:04:13.320> bits

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
top and the bottom of those blue bits

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.200 
top and the bottom of those blue bits
and<00:04:13.920> then<00:04:14.130> came<00:04:14.370> back<00:04:14.550> in<00:04:14.730> with<00:04:14.880> some<00:04:15.060> more
