00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
sections of the song instead of going

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.310 
sections of the song instead of going
through<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.310> detailed<00:02:51.760> analysis<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:53.049> you<00:02:53.230> know

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
through a detailed analysis of you know

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.949 
through a detailed analysis of you know
intro<00:02:53.739> pre-chorus<00:02:54.400> chorus<00:02:54.549> all<00:02:55.390> that<00:02:55.570> stuff<00:02:55.750> I

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
intro pre-chorus chorus all that stuff I

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.569 
intro pre-chorus chorus all that stuff I
thought<00:02:56.380> if<00:02:56.500> you<00:02:56.530> just<00:02:56.799> listen<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.370> track

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
thought if you just listen to the track

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:58.920 
thought if you just listen to the track
you'll<00:02:57.760> find<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.150> guys<00:02:58.269> there's<00:02:58.660> only<00:02:58.690> two

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
you'll find it guys there's only two

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.349 
you'll find it guys there's only two
parts<00:02:59.290> it's<00:02:59.769> either<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.190> go<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.609> minor

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
parts it's either to go a minor

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.360 
parts it's either to go a minor
constantly<00:03:02.320> or<00:03:02.440> I<00:03:02.470> should<00:03:02.739> say<00:03:02.890> consistently

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
constantly or I should say consistently

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.819 
constantly or I should say consistently
for<00:03:03.910> like<00:03:04.030> eight<00:03:04.269> measures<00:03:04.750> or<00:03:05.019> it's<00:03:05.620> going<00:03:05.739> to

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
for like eight measures or it's going to

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.860 
for like eight measures or it's going to
be<00:03:05.920> these<00:03:06.220> four<00:03:06.579> chords<00:03:06.880> in<00:03:07.000> a<00:03:07.090> sequence<00:03:07.510> like

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
be these four chords in a sequence like

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.030 
be these four chords in a sequence like
eight<00:03:08.109> measures<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:08.590> it's<00:03:08.709> either<00:03:08.799> gonna<00:03:08.950> be

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
eight measures so it's either gonna be

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.350 
eight measures so it's either gonna be
something<00:03:09.370> like

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.000 

for<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.960> vs.<00:03:16.320> it<00:03:16.470> just<00:03:16.620> does<00:03:16.770> that

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
for the vs. it just does that

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.710 
for the vs. it just does that
repetitively<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:18.030> choruses<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.570> the

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
repetitively the choruses and the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.940 
repetitively the choruses and the
pre-chorus

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.869 

so<00:03:24.950> I<00:03:24.980> thought<00:03:25.159> it'd<00:03:25.250> be<00:03:25.310> easy<00:03:25.459> enough<00:03:25.640> for<00:03:25.700> me

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
so I thought it'd be easy enough for me

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.429 
so I thought it'd be easy enough for me
to<00:03:25.970> just<00:03:26.209> show<00:03:26.329> you<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.599> two<00:03:26.780> parts<00:03:27.170> and<00:03:27.349> then

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:27.439 
to just show you the two parts and then

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.890 
to just show you the two parts and then
you're<00:03:27.769> good<00:03:27.920> to<00:03:28.010> go<00:03:28.569> let<00:03:29.569> me<00:03:29.659> give<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:29.870> a

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
you're good to go let me give you a

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.330 
you're good to go let me give you a
rhythm<00:03:30.260> pattern<00:03:30.290> for<00:03:30.769> your<00:03:30.829> right<00:03:31.040> hand

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
rhythm pattern for your right hand

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.550 
rhythm pattern for your right hand
trying<00:03:32.299> to<00:03:32.390> follow<00:03:32.599> the<00:03:32.930> sound<00:03:33.079> of<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.319> track

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
trying to follow the sound of the track

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.229 
trying to follow the sound of the track
I<00:03:33.709> found<00:03:33.980> that<00:03:34.400> this<00:03:34.519> rhythm<00:03:34.819> would<00:03:34.909> work<00:03:35.060> for

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
I found that this rhythm would work for

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.619 
I found that this rhythm would work for
you<00:03:35.420> give<00:03:36.409> me<00:03:36.620> two<00:03:37.370> downs<00:03:37.670> followed<00:03:38.540> by

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
you give me two downs followed by

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.539 
you give me two downs followed by
another<00:03:38.900> down<00:03:39.230> and<00:03:39.530> up<00:03:39.739> so<00:03:40.159> you're<00:03:40.250> gonna<00:03:40.340> go
