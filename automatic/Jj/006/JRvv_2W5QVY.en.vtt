playing music jumping singing this kind
of<00:03:26.340> thing<00:03:27.530> well<00:03:28.530> they<00:03:28.890> chose<00:03:29.100> filling<00:03:29.490> up<00:03:29.640> the

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.390 
of thing well they chose filling up the
grudgingly<00:03:30.810> filling<00:03:31.260> up<00:03:31.380> water<00:03:31.530> glasses<00:03:31.890> so<00:03:32.370> I

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
grudgingly filling up water glasses so I

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.310 
grudgingly filling up water glasses so I
think<00:03:32.550> it's<00:03:32.820> a<00:03:32.910> good<00:03:33.030> story<00:03:33.330> took<00:03:33.960> sort<00:03:34.200> of<00:03:34.260> a

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
think it's a good story took sort of a

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.580 
think it's a good story took sort of a
classic<00:03:34.440> big<00:03:34.980> heavy<00:03:35.750> outside<00:03:36.750> force<00:03:37.140> come

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
classic big heavy outside force come

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.820 
classic big heavy outside force come
into<00:03:38.300> the<00:03:39.300> mundane<00:03:39.740> mean<00:03:40.740> every<00:03:41.010> most

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
into the mundane mean every most

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.320 
into the mundane mean every most
circuses<00:03:43.830> are<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:44.100> sort<00:03:44.340> of<00:03:44.370> run<00:03:44.850> that<00:03:45.060> on

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
circuses are the sort of run that on

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.240 
circuses are the sort of run that on
that<00:03:45.870> frame<00:03:46.170> I<00:03:46.410> think<00:03:46.740> that<00:03:46.890> there's<00:03:47.040> going<00:03:47.190> to

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
that frame I think that there's going to

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.870 
that frame I think that there's going to
be<00:03:47.310> some<00:03:47.550> interesting<00:03:48.060> stuff<00:03:48.360> with<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:50.730> way

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
be some interesting stuff with the way

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.910 
be some interesting stuff with the way
that<00:03:51.150> our<00:03:51.360> dynamic<00:03:52.170> is<00:03:52.290> going<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.530> bounce<00:03:52.680> off

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
that our dynamic is going to bounce off

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.530 
that our dynamic is going to bounce off
the<00:03:53.160> rest<00:03:53.340> of<00:03:53.460> the<00:03:53.520> cast<00:03:53.730> members<00:03:53.910> of<00:03:54.300> course
