00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
quite as complex as the one that comes

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.910 
quite as complex as the one that comes

much more precision based barrel part

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.969 
much more precision based barrel part
here<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.090> lot<00:02:06.299> longer<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.899> lot<00:02:07.200> more<00:02:07.590> heavy

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
here it's a lot longer a lot more heavy

at<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.890> frontier<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:12.030> have<00:02:12.180> three

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
at the frontier you have three

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.700 
at the frontier you have three
protrusions<00:02:13.110> up

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
protrusions up

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.010 
protrusions up
up<00:02:13.770> for<00:02:14.130> aiming<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:15.060> little<00:02:15.270> handles<00:02:15.690> on<00:02:15.840> the

up for aiming the little handles on the
side<00:02:16.230> can<00:02:16.500> fold<00:02:16.740> all<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.010> way<00:02:17.310> forward<00:02:17.430> so

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
side can fold all the way forward so

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.730 
side can fold all the way forward so
it's<00:02:18.150> pretty<00:02:18.360> easy<00:02:18.570> to<00:02:18.810> attach<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.620> the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
it's pretty easy to attach it to the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.890 
it's pretty easy to attach it to the
core<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.430> b-daman<00:02:20.610> speaking<00:02:21.600> of<00:02:21.720> which

his<00:02:22.140> little<00:02:22.380> pegs<00:02:22.710> back<00:02:23.040> here<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.580> give<00:02:23.850> him

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
his little pegs back here that give him

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.660 
his little pegs back here that give him
power<00:02:24.450> are<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:25.530> little<00:02:25.920> bit<00:02:26.130> thinner<00:02:26.430> than

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
power are a little bit thinner than

Magnum Ifrit s-- and quite a bit thinner
than<00:02:31.320> blitz<00:02:31.740> garuda<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:32.820> one<00:02:33.090> can<00:02:33.270> assume<00:02:33.390> that

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
than blitz garuda so one can assume that

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.270 
than blitz garuda so one can assume that
he's<00:02:34.410> not<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.620> very<00:02:35.040> powerful<00:02:35.550> beatab<00:02:36.390> on

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
he's not a very powerful beatab on

he's not a very powerful beatab on
assembling<00:02:38.280> bow<00:02:38.490> tauros<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.180> as<00:02:39.330> easy<00:02:39.480> as

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
assembling bow tauros is as easy as

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.230 
assembling bow tauros is as easy as
slotting<00:02:40.620> this<00:02:40.860> onto<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.550> back<00:02:41.850> you<00:02:42.120> can

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
slotting this onto the back you can

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.020 
slotting this onto the back you can
either<00:02:42.420> do<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.570> that<00:02:42.870> way<00:02:43.310> or<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.970> way

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
either do it that way or that way

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.020 
either do it that way or that way
depending<00:02:45.990> on<00:02:46.140> your<00:02:46.500> preference<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.550> then

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
depending on your preference and then

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.710 
depending on your preference and then
locking<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.720> into<00:02:49.020> place<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:51.090> front<00:02:51.330> section

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
locking it into place the front section

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.130 
locking it into place the front section
attaches<00:02:52.590> just<00:02:53.010> like<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.540> handles

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
attaches just like that and the handles

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:02.510 
attaches just like that and the handles
go<00:02:55.470> over<00:02:56.010> his<00:02:56.280> arms<00:02:58.490> and<00:02:59.490> there<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.210> go<00:03:01.520> being

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
go over his arms and there you go being

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.050 
go over his arms and there you go being
a<00:03:02.790> much<00:03:03.060> longer<00:03:03.780> beat<00:03:04.050> him<00:03:04.200> on<00:03:04.580> baltoro<00:03:05.580> seems

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
a much longer beat him on baltoro seems

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.450 
a much longer beat him on baltoro seems
just<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.480> bit<00:03:06.510> more<00:03:06.870> impressive<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.650> think<00:03:07.680> than

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
just a bit more impressive I think than

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.140 
just a bit more impressive I think than
either<00:03:08.960> blitz<00:03:09.960> Garuda<00:03:10.460> or<00:03:11.480> Magnum<00:03:12.510> ifferent

which<00:03:49.230> is<00:03:49.440> great<00:03:50.570> and<00:03:51.570> it<00:03:52.020> goes<00:03:52.200> without

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
saying he can hit a target pretty well

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.650 
saying he can hit a target pretty well
also

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
also

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.270

by now bal tauros is my favorite of the
three<00:04:07.590> crash<00:04:08.100> b-daman<00:04:08.370> that<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:08.820> own<00:04:09.120> by<00:04:09.630> far

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
three crash b-daman that I own by far

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.340 
three crash b-daman that I own by far
he's<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:11.700> most<00:04:11.850> unique<00:04:12.270> in<00:04:12.480> my<00:04:12.660> opinion<00:04:13.170> and

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
he's the most unique in my opinion and

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.350 
he's the most unique in my opinion and
works<00:04:13.890> really<00:04:14.520> well

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
works really well

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.289 
works really well
now<00:04:15.870> I<00:04:15.900> also<00:04:16.380> really<00:04:16.890> like<00:04:17.040> control<00:04:17.520> types<00:04:17.790> but

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
now I also really like control types but

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.450 
now I also really like control types but
even<00:04:18.570> if<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.810> don't<00:04:19.200> there<00:04:19.680> is<00:04:19.830> no<00:04:20.100> denying

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:20.460 
even if you don't there is no denying

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.190 
even if you don't there is no denying
that<00:04:20.640> this<00:04:20.790> is<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.090> only<00:04:21.270> one<00:04:21.630> of<00:04:21.690> these<00:04:21.930> three

type as opposed to blitz garuda which is

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.790 
type as opposed to blitz garuda which is
way<00:04:29.550> too<00:04:29.610> powerful<00:04:30.180> for<00:04:30.540> a<00:04:30.840> rush<00:04:31.229> type<00:04:31.530> b-daman

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
way too powerful for a rush type b-daman

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.120 
way too powerful for a rush type b-daman
and<00:04:32.340> magnum<00:04:33.270> efferent<00:04:33.630> which<00:04:33.840> isn't<00:04:34.680> powerful

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
and magnum efferent which isn't powerful

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.170 
and magnum efferent which isn't powerful
enough<00:04:35.310> for<00:04:36.120> a<00:04:36.360> power<00:04:36.690> type<00:04:37.080> I<00:04:38.180> highly

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
enough for a power type I highly
