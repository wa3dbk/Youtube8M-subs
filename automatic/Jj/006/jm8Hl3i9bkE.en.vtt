start and again I invite you if you have

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.160

a<00:03:37.980> particular<00:03:38.220> topic<00:03:38.819> I<00:03:39.299> can<00:03:39.989> definitely

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
a particular topic I can definitely

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.979 
a particular topic I can definitely
recommend<00:03:40.890> three<00:03:41.730> or<00:03:41.970> maybe<00:03:42.090> four<00:03:42.239> or<00:03:42.450> five<00:03:42.750> at

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
recommend three or maybe four or five at

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.240 
recommend three or maybe four or five at
the<00:03:43.019> top<00:03:43.230> books<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.799> might<00:03:43.980> want<00:03:44.160> to

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
the top books that you might want to

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.759 
the top books that you might want to
read<00:03:44.430> on<00:03:44.579> any<00:03:44.730> given<00:03:45.000> topic<00:03:45.840> but<00:03:46.290> if<00:03:46.680> you

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
read on any given topic but if you

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.559 
read on any given topic but if you
haven't<00:03:46.980> read<00:03:47.100> those<00:03:47.250> three<00:03:47.579> I<00:03:47.760> guess<00:03:48.420> that

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
haven't read those three I guess that

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.829 
haven't read those three I guess that
would<00:03:48.660> be<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.870> good<00:03:49.049> place<00:03:49.319> to<00:03:49.560> start
