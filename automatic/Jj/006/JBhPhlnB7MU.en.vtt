a<00:00:07.629> design<00:00:08.629> philosophy<00:00:09.019> of<00:00:09.080> the<00:00:09.200> f-type<00:00:09.530> coupe

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
a design philosophy of the f-type coupe

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.070 
a design philosophy of the f-type coupe
II<00:00:10.070> was<00:00:10.549> one<00:00:10.790> that<00:00:11.030> we<00:00:11.360> use<00:00:11.570> for<00:00:11.599> all<00:00:11.900> of<00:00:12.019> our

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
II was one that we use for all of our

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.470 
II was one that we use for all of our
cars<00:00:12.349> that's<00:00:12.740> great<00:00:13.190> proportions<00:00:13.789> especially

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
cars that's great proportions especially

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.810 
cars that's great proportions especially
it<00:00:14.570> could<00:00:14.749> be<00:00:14.929> like<00:00:15.079> this<00:00:15.309> very<00:00:16.309> very<00:00:16.520> pure

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
it could be like this very very pure

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.270 
it could be like this very very pure
surfacing<00:00:17.480> and<00:00:17.690> very<00:00:18.200> beautiful<00:00:18.410> lines<00:00:18.890> the

surfacing and very beautiful lines the
car<00:00:19.490> is<00:00:19.640> very<00:00:19.850> similar<00:00:20.210> to<00:00:20.300> 616<00:00:21.080> because<00:00:21.500> that

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
car is very similar to 616 because that

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.520
