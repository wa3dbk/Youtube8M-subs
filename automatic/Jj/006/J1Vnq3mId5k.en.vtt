00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
and what was the other one they made

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.830 
and what was the other one they made
them<00:01:37.439> time<00:01:38.159> crisis<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.820> was<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.119> oh<00:01:39.270> yes<00:01:39.630> I'm

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
them time crisis that was it oh yes I'm

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.690 
them time crisis that was it oh yes I'm
sure<00:01:39.869> yeah<00:01:40.229> house<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.860> dead<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.100> time<00:01:41.280> precious

sure yeah house is dead in time precious

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.539 
sure yeah house is dead in time precious
right<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.360> then<00:01:42.659> I'd<00:01:43.409> say<00:01:43.619> time<00:01:43.860> crisis<00:01:44.340> was

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
right and then I'd say time crisis was

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.760 
right and then I'd say time crisis was
probably<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.270> follow-up<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.500> because

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
probably the follow-up to this because

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.069 
probably the follow-up to this because
it<00:01:47.159> was<00:01:47.280> done<00:01:47.490> by<00:01:47.640> Konami<00:01:48.030> there<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.479> go<00:01:48.630> so

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
using the Nintendo zapper configuration

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.670 
using the Nintendo zapper configuration
which<00:04:14.670> isn't<00:04:15.510> really<00:04:15.540> an<00:04:15.840> extra<00:04:16.170> peripheral

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680
