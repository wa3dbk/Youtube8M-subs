00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hi everyone amazed 100 case I hope that 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.950
 you're fine anyway I'm fine 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.549
 nickel 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.990
 today in this video we are 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.269
 find for information really 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.420
 very interesting so modders have 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.250
 managed to find garage images of 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.800
 luxury in the update files 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.050
 so we could see in part one of 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.850
 luxury vehicles luxury weapons 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.859
 finally luxury engravings for the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.630
 weapons and we all wondered what he 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.510
 could be in the in the tlc 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.340
 part 2 we all thought of villas of 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.800
 luxury and we were not so far from the account 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.200
 if we believe these images so watch 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.510
 here we can see a garage of the udc so 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.890
 I'll put the image in the eyes 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.960
 big building in the middle that would be 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.820
 the elevator to get there and 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.120
 then on the left and the side 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.219
 law 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.920
 we could put five vehicles of which 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.120
 kkr h 10 place next on this 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.070
 second image was watching the little 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.480
 building that can be seen in the background is 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.949
 the elevator that the middle years so 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.890
 we are going to say that we are on the right side of the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.510
 garage where we will have five vehicles and 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.809
 in this picture we are on the left side 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.030
 same with the elevator in the middle of 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.769
 middle of the garage the little posts there 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.750
 for how to say for 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.729
 differentiate the locations of 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.640
 cars what makes it think 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.650
 also that it will be a garage moves 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.180
 then here the same one so an image that 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.360
 therefore tells us that the garage will be in 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.130
 length with the elevator in the middle and 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.290
 the five places so they are defined 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.820
 by the small the small bars slides 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.740
 that we can see on the roof if ever 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.140
 it's the roof there are four firedamp bars 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.729
 put a vehicle on each side and that 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.650
 gives us altogether ten locations of 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.880
 car frankly that's how to say 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.049
 it looks really really concrete air 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.060
 lens 8 on this image we can see 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.920
 the elevator so the elevator two 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.869
 luxury garages pity that it is not 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.079
 an elevator as we can see in the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.579
 luxury hotels for example a 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.439
 marble elevator with bars 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.600
 in gold I think it would be really 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.149
 interesting to have a luxury elevator 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.070
 in a bath in a luxury house 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.600
 then here for me that's the 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.820
 building that I showed you in full 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.009
 middle of the garage so the building of 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.049
 the elevator if you look at the 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.640
 white door that in the middle it will be the 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.710
 elevator door that will be in the middle 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.210
 and then behind each side to 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.850
 left and right 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.520
 another door that frankly I know 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.930
 really not what it could be 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.300
 then here we have two more pictures of 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.820
 look at one inside the garage a 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.200
 little more modeled in color and 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.500
 frankly he looks really very 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.630
 very big so after posting these 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.370
 images so on the forum the password 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.690
 said he was going to try to actually 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.150
 put them in the story game first 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.460
 an idea of these garages of power 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.570
 really see them and he did it so 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.820
 look i'm going to put you three 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.380
 images so these are images where we can 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.160
 to see him with franklin so is he 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.200
 is your story 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.700
 or is it online mode game 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.890
 frankly I could not tell you 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.320
 but we can see that he is well in this 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.880
 garage so it looks really real and 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.510
 frankly if it's confirmed in the 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.970
 part 2 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.220
 it would be really beautiful after 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.450
 to have the price at which we will buy so 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.490
 these villas or so that is it will be 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.260
 just garages we do not know more 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.130
 for now but frankly I 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.780
 find that it is really very 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.530
 interesting that he managed to find 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.880
 these images and who is shared with them 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.840
 and so we come to the end of 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.370
 this video you say no to 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.350
 comments what do you think all this 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.240
 if that would interest you to have 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.640
 luxury homes or garages in 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.350
 part 2 and will also tell us so to 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.360
 how much do you think they 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.710
 could therefore be bought in millions to 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.960
 my opinion it will be I hope it will be 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:28.410
 not too expensive so we could see the apartment 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.480
 at 400,000 the apartment at 400 miles which cost 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.070
 400 thousand dollars 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.620
 so imagine luxury villas can 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.120
 to be 1 1 million or more say us 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.950
 in comments what do you think all 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.450
 that and feel free to let go 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.610
 blue thumbs if the video has you more a 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.990
 will really please 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.000
 and so that's me I stole it's on 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.780
 these pictures I tell you all good game 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.780
 and cats everyone
