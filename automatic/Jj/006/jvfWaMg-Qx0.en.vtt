into<00:02:31.720> some<00:02:31.930> sort<00:02:32.170> of<00:02:32.260> business<00:02:32.470> management

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
into some sort of business management

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.040 
into some sort of business management
because<00:02:33.760> there's<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.030> lot<00:02:34.330> of<00:02:34.540> different

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
because there's a lot of different

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.730 
because there's a lot of different
things<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.530> can<00:02:35.650> go<00:02:35.950> into<00:02:36.160> after<00:02:36.700> that

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
things you can go into after that

00:02:37.740 --> 00:03:00.589 
things you can go into after that
I'm<00:02:38.100> really<00:02:38.370> smart<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:38.850> math<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.420> guess

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.470 

we

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
we

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.470 
we
do<00:03:02.780> mostly<00:03:03.319> barrel<00:03:04.280> racing<00:03:04.700> across<00:03:05.000> with<00:03:05.270> like

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
do mostly barrel racing across with like

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.690 
do mostly barrel racing across with like
a<00:03:05.510> cutting<00:03:05.900> breeze<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:06.980> they'll<00:03:07.160> be<00:03:07.340> really

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
a cutting breeze so they'll be really

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.729 
a cutting breeze so they'll be really
tourney<00:03:08.060> with<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.480> lot<00:03:08.750> of<00:03:08.780> running<00:03:09.170> hopefully

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
tourney with a lot of running hopefully

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.790 
tourney with a lot of running hopefully
and<00:03:10.340> we<00:03:10.700> just<00:03:10.910> got<00:03:11.060> a<00:03:11.090> new<00:03:11.300> stood<00:03:11.629> about<00:03:12.080> it<00:03:12.290> not

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
and we just got a new stood about it not

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.130 
and we just got a new stood about it not
even<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.129> year<00:03:13.340> ago<00:03:13.550> and<00:03:13.910> he's<00:03:14.450> a<00:03:14.480> running<00:03:14.900> stood

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
even a year ago and he's a running stood

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.170 
even a year ago and he's a running stood
so<00:03:15.410> I<00:03:15.470> guess<00:03:15.650> we're<00:03:15.800> gonna<00:03:15.860> start<00:03:16.280> doing<00:03:16.760> just

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
so I guess we're gonna start doing just

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.720 
so I guess we're gonna start doing just
all<00:03:17.300> running<00:03:17.780> and<00:03:17.959> hopefully<00:03:18.500> he'll<00:03:19.250> work<00:03:19.459> out

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730
