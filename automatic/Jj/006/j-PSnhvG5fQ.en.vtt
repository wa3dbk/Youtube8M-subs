LINGUISTIC PROBLEMS

00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:09.137
Today on "Linguistic Problems"
I'll talk to Marcos.

00:00:09.138 --> 00:00:12.221
Marcos has a problem
with connectives, right?

00:00:12.222 --> 00:00:14.290
However yes.

00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:15.664
When did it start?

00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:17.352
From here I was a child.

00:00:17.353 --> 00:00:20.572
Because lately got worse
while because of drugs

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.646
of which I took a lot
because of early morning.

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.353
I got it. So you took
a lot of drugs, right?

00:00:26.354 --> 00:00:27.636
In spite of this, yes.

00:00:27.637 --> 00:00:30.582
Because they were a few,
without which they were light.

00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:33.159
I got it.
Are you under any treatment?

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.282
I am.

00:00:34.283 --> 00:00:36.623
Moreover I am absent a lot
to the sessions,

00:00:36.624 --> 00:00:39.920
however they are in Copacabana
I take a lot of bus,

00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:44.971
whereas on Barata Ribeiro St.
Furthermore I take Tonelero St.

00:00:44.972 --> 00:00:49.955
That's why I get in 30 min since
Barra in terms of Copacabana.

00:00:49.956 --> 00:00:51.015
Okay.

00:00:51.058 --> 00:00:53.048
Marcos, also with us,
it's Lucia.

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:55.387
Lucia has another problem,
right, Lucia?

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:56.400
It's true?

00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:58.268
-I think so.
-I know it's true?

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.036
Lucia's problem
is inflections.

00:01:01.037 --> 00:01:02.509
-That?
-She confuses

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:04.702
the intonation
of questions and answers.

00:01:04.703 --> 00:01:07.407
-Right, Lucia?
-Now you got it right?

00:01:07.408 --> 00:01:10.445
Now I got it right.
Affirmative. Yes, I got it right.

00:01:10.446 --> 00:01:12.232
You think it's serious.

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:14.617
No, I ask you.
Do you think it's serious?

00:01:14.618 --> 00:01:15.666
I don't?

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:18.588
Now I'm not sure
if you are asking or answering.

00:01:18.589 --> 00:01:20.501
Sometimes it's confusing.

00:01:20.502 --> 00:01:24.628
-You can help us.
-I want to though I can.

00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:29.388
We will have a short break
to solve this mistery.

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:32.414
After the break,
Joel Santana and plural.

00:01:32.415 --> 00:01:33.473
Don't go away!

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:40.268
Thank you for watching!

00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:41.595
Tomorrow,

00:01:41.596 --> 00:01:46.567
President Lula will explain
how he changes the S for F.

00:01:47.243 --> 00:01:49.270
The singer Vanusa
will be here

00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:52.860
to explain the effects of
labyrinthitis drugs when singing.

00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:55.988
The nutritionist
Ruth Sandwich-ich Lemos

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:59.722
and the weird phenomenon
of echoing words.

00:01:59.723 --> 00:02:02.950
Also, from Minas Gerais,
live, Jota Quest band

00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:07.721
to explain the song lyrics
"easy, extremely easy,

00:02:07.722 --> 00:02:10.386
for you and me and everyone
to sing together."

00:02:10.387 --> 00:02:13.693
And to finish it,
Dilma Rousseff and coherence.

00:02:13.848 --> 00:02:14.895
See you tomorrow!
