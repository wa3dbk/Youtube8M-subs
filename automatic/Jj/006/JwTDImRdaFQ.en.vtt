very<00:02:02.240> classy<00:02:02.600> fragrance<00:02:03.140> in<00:02:03.260> my<00:02:03.290> opinion<00:02:03.860> it's

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
very classy fragrance in my opinion it's

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.270 
very classy fragrance in my opinion it's
not<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:05.000> most<00:02:05.210> Buber<00:02:05.750> masculine<00:02:06.380> it<00:02:06.590> is<00:02:06.890> a<00:02:06.920> bit

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
not the most Buber masculine it is a bit

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.449 
not the most Buber masculine it is a bit
of<00:02:07.400> a<00:02:07.520> metrosexual<00:02:08.440> fragrance<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.619> me<00:02:09.649> that<00:02:10.429> I

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
of a metrosexual fragrance to me that I

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.099 
of a metrosexual fragrance to me that I
don't<00:02:10.639> think<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.209> this<00:02:11.359> would<00:02:11.540> be<00:02:11.569> unisex

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:12.109 
don't think that this would be unisex

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:13.690 
don't think that this would be unisex
and<00:02:12.290> I<00:02:12.349> don't<00:02:12.409> think<00:02:12.769> it<00:02:12.859> is<00:02:12.980> considered<00:02:13.549> a

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
and I don't think it is considered a

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.330 
and I don't think it is considered a
unisex<00:02:14.180> fragrance<00:02:14.499> but

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
unisex fragrance but

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.229 
unisex fragrance but
it<00:02:16.430> does<00:02:16.670> have<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.270> bit<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:17.630> a<00:02:17.750> touch<00:02:18.470> of

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
it does have a bit of a touch of

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.790 
it does have a bit of a touch of
femininity<00:02:20.239> if<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:20.930> will<00:02:21.140> just<00:02:21.500> because

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
femininity if you will just because

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.670 
femininity if you will just because
there<00:02:22.580> are<00:02:22.610> a<00:02:23.239> lot<00:02:23.270> of<00:02:23.870> florals<00:02:24.319> in<00:02:24.500> this

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
there are a lot of florals in this

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.220 
there are a lot of florals in this
fragrance<00:02:25.069> and<00:02:25.280> even<00:02:25.550> just<00:02:25.670> smelling<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:26.230> from

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
fragrance and even just smelling it from

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.650 
fragrance and even just smelling it from
the<00:02:27.349> atomizer<00:02:27.709> I<00:02:27.980> do<00:02:28.040> smell<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.880> lot<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.330> florals

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
the atomizer I do smell a lot of florals

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.550 
the atomizer I do smell a lot of florals
including<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.319> fig<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:31.459> I<00:02:32.140> think<00:02:33.140> that<00:02:33.440> this

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
including the fig so I think that this

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.470 
including the fig so I think that this
would<00:02:33.709> be<00:02:33.769> a<00:02:33.890> great<00:02:34.310> daytime<00:02:34.940> fragrance<00:02:35.209> that

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
would be a great daytime fragrance that

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.750 
would be a great daytime fragrance that
you<00:02:35.540> can<00:02:35.660> wear<00:02:35.870> that<00:02:36.080> night<00:02:36.410> but<00:02:36.890> I<00:02:37.069> do<00:02:37.190> think

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
you can wear that night but I do think

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.280 
you can wear that night but I do think
that<00:02:37.819> this<00:02:38.030> fragrance<00:02:38.450> does<00:02:38.599> require<00:02:38.959> you<00:02:39.260> to

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
that this fragrance does require you to

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.559 
that this fragrance does require you to
dress<00:02:40.099> up<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.519> little<00:02:40.970> bit<00:02:41.209> like<00:02:41.769> it<00:02:42.769> doesn't

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
dress up a little bit like it doesn't

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.940 
dress up a little bit like it doesn't
you<00:02:44.569> can<00:02:44.720> dress<00:02:44.930> however<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.440> hell<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:45.620> want

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
you can dress however the hell you want

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.470 
you can dress however the hell you want
but<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:46.250> think<00:02:46.519> to<00:02:46.819> pull<00:02:47.030> this<00:02:47.090> one<00:02:47.239> off<00:02:47.300> a

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
but I think to pull this one off a

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.520 
but I think to pull this one off a
little<00:02:47.750> bit<00:02:47.900> more<00:02:48.170> I<00:02:48.440> think<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:50.350> wardrobe<00:02:51.350> with

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
little bit more I think a wardrobe with

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.340 
little bit more I think a wardrobe with
just<00:02:51.920> like<00:02:52.010> a<00:02:52.130> business<00:02:52.670> kind<00:02:52.970> of<00:02:53.150> casual<00:02:53.930> in<00:02:54.200> a

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
just like a business kind of casual in a

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.570 
just like a business kind of casual in a
sense<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:54.739> know<00:02:54.769> that's<00:02:55.130> what<00:02:55.280> about

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
sense you know that's what about

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.610 
sense you know that's what about
wardrobe<00:02:56.030> I<00:02:56.090> think<00:02:56.269> would<00:02:56.420> go<00:02:56.630> very<00:02:57.319> nicely

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
wardrobe I think would go very nicely

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.860 
wardrobe I think would go very nicely
with<00:02:57.830> its<00:02:58.130> fragrance<00:02:58.519> I<00:02:58.670> also<00:02:59.239> think<00:02:59.540> it<00:02:59.630> can

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
with its fragrance I also think it can

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.809 
with its fragrance I also think it can
be<00:03:01.030> semi-formal<00:03:02.030> as<00:03:02.120> well<00:03:02.299> so<00:03:02.860> occasions<00:03:03.860> work

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
be semi-formal as well so occasions work

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.520 
be semi-formal as well so occasions work
definitely<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.840> this<00:03:05.930> would<00:03:06.049> be<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.200> great

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
definitely and this would be a great

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.860 
definitely and this would be a great
office<00:03:06.799> fragrance<00:03:07.840> semi-formal<00:03:08.840> date<00:03:09.410> and

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
office fragrance semi-formal date and

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.089 
office fragrance semi-formal date and
perhaps<00:03:11.870> well<00:03:12.380> I<00:03:12.410> think<00:03:12.530> like<00:03:12.830> the

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
perhaps well I think like the

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.850 
perhaps well I think like the
metrosexuals<00:03:13.880> who<00:03:14.090> are<00:03:14.410> who<00:03:15.410> like<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.590> dress

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
metrosexuals who are who like to dress

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.559 
metrosexuals who are who like to dress
up<00:03:16.099> and<00:03:16.280> smell<00:03:16.489> nice<00:03:16.670> I<00:03:16.849> think<00:03:17.180> that<00:03:17.420> this

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
up and smell nice I think that this

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.900 
up and smell nice I think that this
would<00:03:17.720> be<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:17.840> good<00:03:17.989> fragrance<00:03:18.290> for<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:19.670> is

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
would be a good fragrance for you it is

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.930 
would be a good fragrance for you it is
from<00:03:20.359> the<00:03:20.450> nineteen<00:03:20.810> nineties<00:03:21.380> from<00:03:21.530> 99<00:03:21.950> so<00:03:22.910> I

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
from the nineteen nineties from 99 so I

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.789 
from the nineteen nineties from 99 so I
don't<00:03:23.299> see<00:03:23.510> a<00:03:23.540> lot<00:03:23.750> of<00:03:23.780> people<00:03:24.380> wearing<00:03:24.620> this

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
don't see a lot of people wearing this

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.800 
don't see a lot of people wearing this
one<00:03:25.010> really<00:03:25.370> I<00:03:25.400> don't<00:03:25.609> think<00:03:25.760> a<00:03:26.150> lot<00:03:26.420> of<00:03:26.570> people

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
one really I don't think a lot of people

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.630 
one really I don't think a lot of people
would<00:03:27.560> really<00:03:27.709> wear<00:03:27.980> a<00:03:28.010> lot<00:03:28.070> of<00:03:28.250> fragrances

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
would really wear a lot of fragrances

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.490 
would really wear a lot of fragrances
from<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:28.940> 90s<00:03:29.269> except<00:03:29.570> for<00:03:29.750> your<00:03:30.260> little

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
from the 90s except for your little

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.030 
from the 90s except for your little
malls<00:03:30.709> your<00:03:31.040> aquata<00:03:31.579> Geo's<00:03:32.440> that<00:03:33.440> sort<00:03:33.709> of<00:03:33.769> bit

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
malls your aquata Geo's that sort of bit

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.559 
malls your aquata Geo's that sort of bit
right<00:03:34.220> so<00:03:34.489> I<00:03:34.519> think<00:03:34.730> that<00:03:35.000> this<00:03:35.150> would<00:03:35.299> be<00:03:35.329> a

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
right so I think that this would be a

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.910 
right so I think that this would be a
great<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:37.480> bit<00:03:38.480> of<00:03:38.569> a<00:03:38.660> different<00:03:39.140> fragrance<00:03:39.590> for

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
great a bit of a different fragrance for

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.640 
great a bit of a different fragrance for
a<00:03:39.980> lot<00:03:40.130> of<00:03:40.250> guys<00:03:40.400> too<00:03:40.970> you<00:03:41.000> would<00:03:41.180> just<00:03:41.329> try

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
a lot of guys too you would just try

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.000 
a lot of guys too you would just try
ages<00:03:42.650> any<00:03:42.950> age<00:03:43.250> could<00:03:43.430> pull<00:03:44.030> this<00:03:44.150> one<00:03:44.299> off

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
ages any age could pull this one off

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.259 
ages any age could pull this one off
seasons<00:03:46.010> definitely<00:03:46.459> spring<00:03:46.700> and<00:03:46.850> summer<00:03:47.060> but

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
seasons definitely spring and summer but

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.410 
seasons definitely spring and summer but
probably<00:03:47.959> more<00:03:48.139> so<00:03:48.380> for<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.650> springtime<00:03:49.420> the

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
probably more so for the springtime the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.470 
probably more so for the springtime the
hot<00:03:50.600> humid<00:03:50.900> days<00:03:51.459> just<00:03:52.459> I<00:03:52.670> think<00:03:52.819> maybe<00:03:53.239> a

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
hot humid days just I think maybe a

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.379 
hot humid days just I think maybe a
little<00:03:53.870> bit<00:03:54.170> too<00:03:54.350> close<00:03:54.680> I<00:03:55.120> might<00:03:56.120> bring<00:03:56.269> out

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
little bit too close I might bring out
