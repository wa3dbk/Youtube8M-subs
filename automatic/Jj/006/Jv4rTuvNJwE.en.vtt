hydrating lip or it's very very

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.610 
hydrating lip or it's very very
hydrating<00:05:16.640> and<00:05:16.990> when<00:05:17.990> I<00:05:18.020> put<00:05:18.290> this<00:05:18.440> on

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
immediately this is what I started to

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.510 
immediately this is what I started to
think<00:05:20.630> of<00:05:20.990> because<00:05:21.200> that's<00:05:21.530> how<00:05:21.710> it<00:05:21.770> felt<00:05:22.280> to

can<00:05:25.490> have<00:05:25.730> a<00:05:27.550> better<00:05:28.550> understanding<00:05:28.640> of<00:05:29.360> how

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420
