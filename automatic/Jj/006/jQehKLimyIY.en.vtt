00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.630
 2 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.330
 so to continue in the secrets the 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.540
 bodybuilding 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.410
 especially when we are natural 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.130
 next secret no it's the 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.739
 progressivity 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.000
 so that may seem odd that I 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.280
 tell them like the previous council 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.980
 but it's since read lately on 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.899
 my facebook besides my facebook page 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.310
 that this game was quibbling because it has 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.579
 actually created a little pack with two 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:48.520
 partners comprising two plates of 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.010
 weight in makes 1.25 kg to be able to 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.100
 mount only 2.5 kg during 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.190
 progressions so I remember that I 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.560
 several gpu coach side thousands 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.940
 of students in fact since my debut and 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.400
 so often but I see that the halls 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.199
 are poorly equipped by kim yan we can 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.720
 to climb that of 5 in 5 kg even the voices 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.670
 small 110 so necessarily when 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.030
 trains by cycle what we will see 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.790
 after as being another secret is going 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.840
 we have not progressed well 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.060
 good good that when we do 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.579
 sleeping god bed per month 60 kg 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.509
 and suddenly the next load its 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.679
 65 kg we will be able to pass like that 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.479
 and it's a big increase 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.389
 an increase that is not really 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.499
 possible and who will screw up the whole 

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:33.819
 progression that we wanted to 

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:35.619
 place what they want to have 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.719
 progressed we stagnated or even regressed 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.460
 to see to be disgusted was completely the 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:40.299
 bodybuilding 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.590
 so that's why that's why the 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.639
 progressivity ie the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.829
 progressivity as well to 

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:46.869
 training so go up little by little 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.429
 so for example it can be ne 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.209
 add only one more repetition 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.700
 on a fiscal year 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.979
 but what is already a progression that 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.389
 is already a step forward or what can 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.880
 also be progressivity in 

00:01:55.389 --> 00:02:00.130
 food so for example I eat 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.109
 promised calories and I do not get fat 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.579
 I want to get fat take muscle and to 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:05.560
 little eh ben I may be adding 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.209
 only 200 calories so that's what 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.890
 I explain in my ebooks on the mass 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.230
 for those who are interested so jean 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.819
 luc just a little bit to be able to 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.990
 see if it unblocks the situation 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.060
 so if that from ofppt to the association 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.890
 Well, I'm going to increase it again 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.860
 but every change you make 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.150
 whether in training or even 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.100
 in our diet must be 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.410
 never progressive his new stand 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.850
 the same when I do my program 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.800
 drive and then that this one 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.090
 comes to an end actually we feel 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.740
 that they walk more than we have 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.950
 too many sensations we are not too 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.850
 motivated to go so smart we go 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.170
 introduce changes in his 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.200
 training but we're not going 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.340
 upset suddenly so the example 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.290
 even so that's what I give in 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.140
 my second ebooks repeats that it serves 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.560
 take muscle volume 2 for example I 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.150
 do an arm session that can be 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.040
 that they tilted carlo desk and pick 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.990
 up with hammer and then I get to the end 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.220
 his heart of a physio is not for that 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.840
 that I will change the whole session 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.400
 biceps charge the three exercises 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.680
 because in this case I lose all 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.360
 the progression that I also made on 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.530
 the other exercises 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.790
 so that would be a mistake of everything 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.459
 change from kickoff to change 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.500
 a single exercise 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.450
 after there are several possibilities as to 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.530
 to their dedications etc. 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.570
 but we will always introduce this 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.850
 notion of progressivity to go small 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.940
 to small and not change everything a 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.320
 blow which would put your efforts 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.040
 last months to oblivion 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.120
 so that's what you really need 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.890
 not do have really introduce 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.170
 every change little by little 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.489
 really a secret unfortunately but 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.840
 it's true that I'm here to help you 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.700
 progress so speak as to ride 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.080
 very gently on your repetitions or 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.280
 on your if the water on the bar or 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.630
 same for the changes of throws 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.980
 add a few things little by little 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.989
 talk to you when we are if we do a 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.019
 diet and that is taught will decrease 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.670
 gradually what we eat can not 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.690
 not at once cut that half of 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.670
 frames and that we eat and then hand 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.010
 in this case we will quickly lose some 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.250
 muscle will soon be punctured 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.230
 these guarantees therefore progressivity 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.879
 this is the third secret that comes from 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.590
 see together I tell you very soon 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.590
 for the 4th secret
