looked at the macro universe let's work
at<00:00:28.640> Mosport<00:00:28.970> at<00:00:29.300> the<00:00:29.390> microbes<00:00:30.020> you<00:00:30.710> can<00:00:30.890> do<00:00:30.980> it

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
at Mosport at the microbes you can do it

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.190 
at Mosport at the microbes you can do it
in<00:00:31.160> two<00:00:31.340> years<00:00:31.369> and<00:00:31.820> it's<00:00:32.270> a<00:00:32.450> good<00:00:32.780> stiff<00:00:33.020> dick

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
in two years and it's a good stiff dick

in two years and it's a good stiff dick
we<00:00:33.770> will<00:00:33.920> be<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:34.250> first<00:00:34.280> school<00:00:35.270> to<00:00:35.300> have<00:00:35.600> the

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
we will be the first school to have the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.520 
we will be the first school to have the
certificate<00:00:36.410> I<00:00:36.739> expect<00:00:37.520> to<00:00:37.610> have<00:00:37.790> a<00:00:38.600> general

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
certificate I expect to have a general

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.080 
certificate I expect to have a general
knowledge<00:00:39.769> of<00:00:40.100> nanotechnology<00:00:40.850> that<00:00:40.879> would

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
knowledge of nanotechnology that would

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.520 
knowledge of nanotechnology that would
be<00:00:41.420> make<00:00:41.690> me<00:00:41.840> able<00:00:42.350> if<00:00:42.679> I<00:00:43.160> got<00:00:43.429> a<00:00:43.519> problem<00:00:44.530> just

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
be make me able if I got a problem just

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.680 
be make me able if I got a problem just
think<00:00:45.800> of<00:00:45.980> it<00:00:46.010> as<00:00:46.670> over<00:00:46.879> solution<00:00:47.510> from

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
think of it as over solution from

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.750 
think of it as over solution from
nanotechnology<00:00:48.050> side<00:00:48.710> now<00:00:48.980> I<00:00:49.010> found<00:00:49.489> out<00:00:49.640> that

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
nanotechnology side now I found out that

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.459 
nanotechnology side now I found out that
they<00:00:49.879> actually<00:00:49.910> gave<00:00:50.300> a<00:00:50.329> certificate<00:00:50.989> for<00:00:51.230> it

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
they actually gave a certificate for it

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:52.630 
they actually gave a certificate for it
and<00:00:51.559> that's<00:00:51.859> one<00:00:52.010> of<00:00:52.039> the<00:00:52.160> things<00:00:52.309> that<00:00:52.489> made

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
and that's one of the things that made

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.520 
and that's one of the things that made
me<00:00:52.760> kind<00:00:52.879> of<00:00:52.999> jump<00:00:53.269> into<00:00:53.600> this<00:00:53.719> is<00:00:53.929> you<00:00:54.440> know

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
me kind of jump into this is you know

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.860 
me kind of jump into this is you know
being<00:00:54.800> on<00:00:54.890> that<00:00:55.129> that<00:00:55.460> leading<00:00:56.149> front<00:00:56.539> it's<00:00:56.780> a

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
being on that that leading front it's a

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.250 
being on that that leading front it's a
good<00:00:57.050> job<00:00:57.920> booster<00:00:58.429> it<00:00:58.809> actually<00:00:59.809> makes<00:01:00.140> your

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
good job booster it actually makes your

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.619 
good job booster it actually makes your
applications<00:01:00.829> look<00:01:01.010> really<00:01:01.429> appealing<00:01:01.820> once

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
applications look really appealing once

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.380 
applications look really appealing once
you<00:01:02.780> just<00:01:03.260> get<00:01:03.829> a<00:01:03.859> small<00:01:04.129> piece<00:01:04.400> of<00:01:04.430> it<00:01:04.670> one<00:01:05.239> day

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
you just get a small piece of it one day

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.760 
you just get a small piece of it one day

in lengths of probably a centimeter long

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.609 
in lengths of probably a centimeter long
it<00:01:51.100> will<00:01:51.399> be<00:01:51.520> normal<00:01:52.210> application<00:01:52.329> and<00:01:52.899> after

it will be normal application and after
that<00:01:54.100> length<00:01:54.369> is<00:01:54.700> then<00:01:55.179> frayed<00:01:55.600> at<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.780> end<00:01:55.990> it

that length is then frayed at the end it

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.709 
that length is then frayed at the end it
allowed<00:01:56.829> for<00:01:57.069> a<00:01:57.429> lot<00:01:57.610> of<00:01:57.759> friction<00:01:57.939> one<00:01:58.479> place

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
allowed for a lot of friction one place

since<00:02:09.759> we're<00:02:09.970> one<00:02:10.179> of<00:02:10.269> the<00:02:10.360> frontrunners<00:02:10.660> in

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.079 
since we're one of the frontrunners in

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.979 
since we're one of the frontrunners in
nanotechnology<00:02:11.769> right<00:02:11.920> now<00:02:12.069> we<00:02:12.760> can<00:02:13.000> we<00:02:13.870> can

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
nanotechnology right now we can we can

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.509 
nanotechnology right now we can we can
actually<00:02:14.019> manufacture<00:02:14.440> it<00:02:14.829> here<00:02:15.069> it's<00:02:15.370> not

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
actually manufacture it here it's not

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.330 
actually manufacture it here it's not
sticky<00:02:15.880> it's<00:02:16.209> purely<00:02:16.890> friction<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:17.920> he<00:02:18.130> said

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
sticky it's purely friction that he said

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.559 
sticky it's purely friction that he said
so<00:02:18.549> it<00:02:19.090> doesn't<00:02:19.360> actually<00:02:20.010> invited<00:02:21.010> a

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
so it doesn't actually invited a

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.580 
so it doesn't actually invited a
construction<00:02:22.569> workers<00:02:22.870> could<00:02:23.110> use<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.410> all

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
construction workers could use it all

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.770 
construction workers could use it all
the<00:02:23.650> time<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.370> hundreds<00:02:25.180> of<00:02:25.269> construction

whatever you want it to do this is
really<00:02:54.340> cool<00:02:54.790> applications<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.690> it's<00:02:56.560> almost

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
really cool applications and it's almost

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.860 
really cool applications and it's almost
virtually<00:02:57.220> limitless<00:02:57.700> you<00:02:58.120> can<00:02:58.269> do<00:02:58.480> almost<00:02:58.630> in

a little bit the classwork is actually

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.720 
a little bit the classwork is actually
interesting<00:03:04.510> it's<00:03:04.840> not<00:03:05.380> that<00:03:06.010> time-consuming

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
interesting it's not that time-consuming

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.539 
interesting it's not that time-consuming
it<00:03:07.000> only<00:03:07.239> takes<00:03:07.630> two<00:03:07.930> full<00:03:08.170> years<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.769> work<00:03:09.040> it

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
it only takes two full years of work it
