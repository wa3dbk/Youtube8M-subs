those spots lay the H bar back down and
drill<00:00:41.250> your<00:00:41.280> mounts<00:00:41.700> out<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.660> mounting

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
drill your mounts out the mounting

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.840 
drill your mounts out the mounting
boards<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> pro<00:00:43.620> anglers<00:00:44.040> are<00:00:44.280> angled

boards on the pro anglers are angled

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.600 
boards on the pro anglers are angled
outwards<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:45.960> when<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.320> mount<00:00:46.620> your<00:00:46.770> mounting

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
outwards so when you mount your mounting

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.850 
outwards so when you mount your mounting
plate<00:00:47.850> make<00:00:48.480> sure<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.079> tab<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.559> top

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
plate make sure that the tab on the top

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.340 
plate make sure that the tab on the top
is<00:00:50.100> facing<00:00:50.640> inwards<00:00:51.090> or<00:00:51.329> angled<00:00:51.750> inwards<00:00:52.110> to

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
is facing inwards or angled inwards to

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.500 
is facing inwards or angled inwards to
compensate<00:00:52.949> for<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.250> difference<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:53.940> I've

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
compensate for that difference so I've

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.000 
compensate for that difference so I've
had<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> friend<00:00:54.899> help<00:00:55.230> me<00:00:55.350> measure<00:00:55.559> where<00:00:55.949> I

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
had a friend help me measure where I

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.799 
had a friend help me measure where I
want<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> front<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.730> h<00:00:56.850> bar<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.329> lay<00:00:57.539> on

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
doing is centering it on those spots and

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.250 
doing is centering it on those spots and
also<00:01:02.879> making<00:01:03.180> sure<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.539> gaps<00:01:03.899> right

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
here and the gaps between the two arms

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.330 
here and the gaps between the two arms
are<00:01:07.140> even<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.159> lays<00:01:08.340> nice<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.330> flush<00:01:10.340> I'm

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
are even so it lays nice and flush I'm

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.280 
are even so it lays nice and flush I'm
marking<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> spot<00:01:12.210> where<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.659> center<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.020> my

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
mounting plate is gonna go from that

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.420 
mounting plate is gonna go from that
santur<00:01:15.900> mark<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.320> made<00:01:16.590> I'm<00:01:16.770> extending<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
santur mark that I made I'm extending a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.070 
santur mark that I made I'm extending a
little<00:01:17.549> line<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:17.880> either<00:01:18.270> side<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.020> that

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
little line on either side and that

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.899 
little line on either side and that
simulates<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.040> pin<00:01:20.369> that'll<00:01:20.640> be<00:01:20.759> going

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
simulates the pin that'll be going

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.359 
simulates the pin that'll be going
through<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.509> mount<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.530> now<00:01:22.680> when<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.890> line<00:01:23.220> it

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
through this mount so now when I line it

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.580 
through this mount so now when I line it
up<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.759> can<00:01:24.450> lay<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.750> right<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:24.990> top<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.320> there

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
up I can lay it right on top of there

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.890 
up I can lay it right on top of there
now<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:26.909> my<00:01:27.060> spots<00:01:27.390> marked
