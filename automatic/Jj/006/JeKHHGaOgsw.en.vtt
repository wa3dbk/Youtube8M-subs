00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
of coded and what seems to be kind of

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.600 
of coded and what seems to be kind of
rubbery<00:01:03.100> waterproof<00:01:03.760> jazz<00:01:04.509> and<00:01:05.610> there's

rubbery waterproof jazz and there's
these<00:01:07.240> really<00:01:07.690> interesting<00:01:08.229> that<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.470> flaps

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
these really interesting that the flaps

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.990 
these really interesting that the flaps
down<00:01:09.250> here<00:01:09.640> it<00:01:10.600> seemed<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:11.020> like<00:01:11.280> magnetize<00:01:12.280> so

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
down here it seemed to like magnetize so

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.850 
down here it seemed to like magnetize so
that<00:01:13.180> you<00:01:13.270> can't<00:01:13.509> fully<00:01:13.810> open<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.439> zips<00:01:14.650> up

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
that you can't fully open the zips up

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.190 
that you can't fully open the zips up
without<00:01:15.640> actually<00:01:16.210> open<00:01:16.450> them<00:01:16.570> up<00:01:16.600> so<00:01:16.900> you

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
without actually open them up so you

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.630 
without actually open them up so you
know<00:01:17.229> even<00:01:17.500> after<00:01:17.619> the<00:01:17.860> bag<00:01:17.979> off<00:01:18.189> here<00:01:18.400> before

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
know even after the bag off here before

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.859 
know even after the bag off here before
you<00:01:18.729> can<00:01:18.880> actually<00:01:19.000> fully<00:01:19.420> open<00:01:19.780> with

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869
