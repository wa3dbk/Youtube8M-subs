00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.170
 hello our dear viewers you 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.179
 see the review of ipad mini second 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.519
 generations with retina display on the channel 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.130
 sockets will not be trivial and let's 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.660
 Immediately proceed to the design of mini 2 externally 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.449
 almost no different from the first 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.779
 generation except that the tablet has become thick 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.490
 0.3 millimeters and heavier per 20 grams 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.650
 the benefit is not felt 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.779
 another difference holes for 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.189
 noise-canceling microphone on top 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.769
 rear housing parts 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.750
 his predecessor was not to remind him 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.910
 that the first generation of mini was sold in 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.040
 two colors silver and black with 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.540
 the release of the new mini black color 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.670
 changed to space gray 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.070
 same as in new ipad air or 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.469
 iphone 5s with the price also happened 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.420
 Changes in sales remained mini first 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.140
 generations it now costs 300 dollars 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.420
 instead of 330a mini 2 starts at 400 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.120
 dollars that is 70 dollars more expensive 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.399
 what cost 1 ipad mini that year but 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.190
 here is what to add appeared and 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.530
 128 gigabyte version just like big 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.420
 ipad mini versions ipad mini back camera 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.390
 remained the same as it was in the past 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.369
 generations but the front fst hd got 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.710
 update it is now the same 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.229
 Qualitative as in iphone 5s and ipad air 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.150
 In general, the design of the mini has not changed 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.570
 it's all the same little tablet from 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.640
 apple 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.799
 whose face has now taken a big 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.049
 ipad yes and together they look like 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.840
 never better the most important change 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.369
 screen touches this is a full retina 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.380
 resolution like a big iped 2048 on 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.659
 1536 points 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.590
 324 pixels per inch density greater than 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.900
 ipad air 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.909
 it is the same as on the iphone so we 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.700
 get a super quality display in 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.530
 As a result, the picture is not very juicy. 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.259
 the screen itself as before with excellent 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.509
 viewing angles and normal brightness here 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.759
 you for comparison safari icon on ipad 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.700
 mini first generation ipad air 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.590
 iphone 5s and ipad mini two sizes 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.509
 icons are different because the diagonals 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.640
 the displays are different so don't be surprised 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.620
 but you can see the quality of the screen 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.870
 by the way pixel density is the same here 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.819
 like on the new nexus 7 it has full 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.220
 HD display but at the same time the screen is smaller 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.350
 diagonals so everything converges sound in 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.450
 ipad mini has not changed this all those 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.220
 same two stereo speakers which is installed 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.620
 and bottom there and lightning connector 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.930
 considering that mini 2 is cheaper by 100 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.560
 dollars than ipad air he has the same 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.350
 iron 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.120
 mini works very fast as-7 not 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.840
 brakes like on my mini first 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.610
 generation 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.069
 and all because it is installed here 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.209
 apple a7 d processor 1 gigabyte 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.120
 random access memory 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.780
 CPU clock 1 and 3 gigahertz in 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.450
 ipad air 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.730
 this figure is 1 and 4 therefore 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.430
 geekbench results in the next single 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.980
 test shows 1400 multi-core points 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.300
 two and a half thousand on ipad air this 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.790
 a little bit more 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.769
 but the result is not even doubled 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.400
 three times more than my first 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.550
 generations 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.830
 the difference is four times for the first time both 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.530
 tablet from apple what is big what is small 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.170
 have the same iron so mini 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.660
 immediately stepped poured again on apple a7 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.310
 interesting data on the battery account it 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.519
 increased by a third compared to 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:15.840
 a precursor to a beginner 6470 miles 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:18.329
 amp clock and grandfather have 4490 batteries 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.700
 for a need retina display but you can 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.680
 don't get upset mini 2 keeps battery 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.870
 as well as the first generation about 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.850
 ten hours of playing video but 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.390
 the most interesting thing that we were waiting for 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.790
 retina 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.190
 but we did not wait for him with such iron we 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.320
 waited for the apple a6 processor as in iphone 5 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.540
 less RAM and 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.010
 and so on to obtain and 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.530
 incredibly retina display 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.100
 and power comparable to a large ipad and even 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.420
 and the price is $ 100 less than the player 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.640
 definitely mini is now the most desired 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.070
 small tablet and the disadvantages of 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.980
 don't seem to be all 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.870
