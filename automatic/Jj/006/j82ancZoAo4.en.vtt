00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.290
 the 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.120
 why have i been for a twelve weeks 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.309
 from decided the advantages lie 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.989
 clear on the hand 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.960
 twelve weeks is about the time span 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.600
 to physiological processes externally 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.160
 that means eight weeks would be fixed 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.720
 would not work ten weeks 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.460
 even a bit too little and 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.860
 That's why I'm away for twelve weeks 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.110
 decided to medium term or pc 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.670
 stick to short-term goal 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.379
 why do not I have it for me 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.129
 decided on a full body plan 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.440
 to use 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.140
 full body plan has definitely the 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.860
 serious detriment of the muscle stimuli 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.080
 too monotonous and too one-sided 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.990
 I agreed here that 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.170
 she really in four astrid plan 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.170
 carry out 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.890
 we train shoulder chest we 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.369
 work out 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.979
 biceps triceps we train back and 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.070
 we train legs in isolation, that is 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.950
 this so-called four split plan gives 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.080
 the optimum one regulation where you four 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.170
 days the week trains the rest 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.549
 days good one hour workout and then 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.549
 are you your success 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.780
 We become a training intensity 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:48.880
 around 85 maximum 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.310
 your performance is about 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.530
 a maximum of 100 percent 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.840
 as we create a repetition and 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.939
 then you expect 85 percent down 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.490
 why am I exactly into this 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.819
 line of studies 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.229
 just that you have an overdue appeal 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.240
 must continue in the long run 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.039
 to achieve goals and I want 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.980
 just that in the twelve weeks 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.400
 Your goals achieved as possible in this 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.769
 at this point in time where 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.480
 he of course best 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.340
 efficiency if one likes 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.200
 would like to train in the morning he should 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.880
 In any case, if so maintained 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.110
 one is working and of course 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.599
 can only train as 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.700
 So he should go that way too 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.190
 nothing is going to change just the one 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.349
 training plan nutrition plan and rain 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.349
 action plan changed a lot we see 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.209
 which I can definitely recommend 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.250
 motivation in training brings with it 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.980
 means by a training partner 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.709
 write down your goals under the motto 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.440
 go setting that means long-term goals 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.610
 short-term goals medium-term goals 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.610
 should you also write yourself 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.750
 So people think of that the next two 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.819
 In any case, weeks will not be 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.440
 simply stay on the ball 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.440
 pain no gain
