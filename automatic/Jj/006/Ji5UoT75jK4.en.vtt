easy resonant heads on the bottom for me
you<00:01:41.190> know<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.550> it's<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.240> the

you know it's it's it's that the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.090 
you know it's it's it's that the
punchiness<00:01:43.289> of<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.710> g2<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.100> it's<00:01:44.369> very<00:01:44.490> open

punchiness of the g2 but it's very open

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.350 
punchiness of the g2 but it's very open
sometimes<00:01:47.100> I'll<00:01:47.280> use<00:01:47.310> g2<00:01:47.850> coded<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.330> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
sometimes I'll use g2 coded in the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.760 
sometimes I'll use g2 coded in the
studio<00:01:48.750> because<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.289> gives<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> little

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
studio because it gives you a little

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.560 
studio because it gives you a little
more<00:01:49.860> tone<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.160> want<00:01:50.310> more<00:01:50.640> tone<00:01:50.940> going<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.360> tape

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
more tone I want more tone going to tape

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.809 
more tone I want more tone going to tape
