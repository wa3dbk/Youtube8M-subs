00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 ah 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.750
 welcome to the best tapping of the 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.219
 2012/2013 season of the endesa league a 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.530
 garden that we could not have done 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.330
 without them or them professionals and 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.160
 infiltrators who have hidden behind 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.230
 the cameras during these nine months of 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.970
 competition some professionals that I lost 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.860
 in the north and as if it were a story 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.020
 of the national geographic were hunting 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.460
 of the most curious without thinking that leaving 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.410
 your site riding with your camera is 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.700
 could turn into cannon fodder for 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.700
 the zapping of the endesa league 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.960
 if we have learned something this season 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.790
 is that putting it is not so simple and 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.190
 even less when one is alone 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.620
 before the basket the easier it seems 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.440
 appear the ghosts of doubt and 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.520
 basket becomes small wobbles and 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.520
 world is unfair 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.210
 the fans who have gone to see some 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.970
 English league party know that they 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.220
 to have a good time the music the atmosphere 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.710
 the colorful characters the children 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.270
 possessed the dances in the stands make 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.460
 that the days of the match are a revelry 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.350
 absolute and that the fun is 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.360
 insured you just have to sit down and 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.430
 let you go because the league endesa 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.540
 leaves the body with the feeling of 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.550
 order is Friday porcinos and neat 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.380
 what you never imagined seeing in 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.380
 a basketball court first part 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.320
 before leaving the competition two 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.730
 players made a promise to perform 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.130
 the most unlikely move of the 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.470
 nico richotti and javi salgado season 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.060
 the first one thought that he had everything 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.010
 under control with a triplazo from his 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.020
 house like someone who does not want the thing but 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.850
 the second did not want to be less and decided 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.310
 put it 3 after end give almost 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.900
 believing chair a hand in the turn of the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.850
 Argentine who kept an ace in his sleeve 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.710
 with a shot Basque ball style 'the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.390
 position limit but exit the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.250
 usaid e replied no with other clubs 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.040
 but putting it from another site behind 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.560
 of basket 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.030
 love lives in the stands the effect 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.220
 aphrodisiac of basketball is 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.700
 indisputable whatever the couple of the 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.159
 kiss some candidate 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.100
 in the worst end rudy has accumulated 10 of 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.690
 19 13 and that could not be so in the 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.330
 fifth party decided to break the 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.420
 Florentine statistics and congratulate him for 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.420
 it 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.160
 in idle times you have to motivate 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.880
 the kids that's why we're going to study 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.880
 Various techniques 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.990

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.870
 a basketball court second part 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.430
 A good listener, few words are enough 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.050
 although with so many signals that are made 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.160
 during the game it is normal that sometimes 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.320
 be confirmed 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.330

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.910
