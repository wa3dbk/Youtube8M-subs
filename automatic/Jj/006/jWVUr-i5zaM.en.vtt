how we can draw text in game so to do

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.740 
how we can draw text in game so to do
this<00:00:08.490> we're<00:00:08.700> going<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.880> be<00:00:08.940> looking<00:00:09.179> at<00:00:09.330> HUD

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
this we're going to be looking at HUD

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.780 
this we're going to be looking at HUD
blueprints<00:00:10.320> adding<00:00:10.830> some<00:00:10.980> functionality<00:00:11.610> to

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
blueprints adding some functionality to

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.249 
blueprints adding some functionality to
them<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.120> also<00:00:12.450> looking<00:00:12.719> at<00:00:12.840> blueprint

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
them and also looking at blueprint

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.560 
them and also looking at blueprint
interfaces<00:00:13.860> so<00:00:14.250> let's<00:00:14.400> jump<00:00:14.549> right<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:14.910> okay

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
interfaces so let's jump right in okay

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.910 
interfaces so let's jump right in okay
so<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.960> first<00:00:16.109> thing<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.410> need<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.560> do<00:00:16.740> is

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
so the first thing you need to do is

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.950 
so the first thing you need to do is
make<00:00:17.100> sure<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.340> have<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.670> game<00:00:17.910> mode<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.840> you'd

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
make sure you have a game mode so you'd

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.599 
make sure you have a game mode so you'd
come<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.140> blueprints<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:20.160> can<00:00:20.310> create<00:00:20.490> a

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
come to blueprints and you can create a

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.800 
come to blueprints and you can create a
game<00:00:20.760> mode<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.060> I'm<00:00:21.119> using<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.420> realistic

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
game mode but I'm using the realistic

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.840 
game mode but I'm using the realistic
rendering<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.500> already<00:00:23.100> have<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.310> game<00:00:23.640> mode

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
rendering so I already have a game mode

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.640 
rendering so I already have a game mode
and<00:00:24.060> now<00:00:24.720> we<00:00:24.810> need<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.050> create<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.439> HUD

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
and now we need to create a HUD

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.900 
and now we need to create a HUD
blueprint<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.580> come<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.910> HUD<00:00:27.090> create<00:00:28.760> I'm<00:00:29.760> just

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
blueprint so come to HUD create I'm just

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.910 
blueprint so come to HUD create I'm just
going<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.060> name<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.420> my<00:00:31.050> HUD<00:00:33.079> now<00:00:34.079> simply

draw text in game will begin by

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.000 
draw text in game will begin by
right-clicking<00:00:37.920> add<00:00:38.489> event<00:00:39.890> event<00:00:40.890> to

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
going to choose 72 the reason being if

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.950 
going to choose 72 the reason being if
we<00:01:35.579> choose<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.909> lower<00:01:36.150> one<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.509> decide<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.900> want

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
we choose a lower one and decide we want

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.539 
we choose a lower one and decide we want
to<00:01:37.079> scale<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.320> up<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.650> game<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.310> just<00:01:38.460> going

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
to scale it up in game it's just going

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.039 
to scale it up in game it's just going
to<00:01:38.640> lose<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> quality<00:01:39.560> so<00:01:40.560> bigger<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:40.920> better

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
to lose the quality so bigger is better

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.600 
to lose the quality so bigger is better
I'm<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.200> going<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.380> name<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.680> my<00:01:44.040> font<00:01:44.990> and

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.560 
I'm just going to name this my font and
now<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.670> can<00:01:47.850> choose<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.360> font

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.920 

okay<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.590> we'll<00:01:53.520> click<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:53.729> pile<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.570> jumping

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
okay so we'll click on pile and jumping

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.380 
okay so we'll click on pile and jumping
game<00:01:55.310> however<00:01:56.310> there's<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> problem<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.000> text

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
game however there's a problem the text

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.520 
game however there's a problem the text
doesn't<00:01:57.600> draw<00:01:57.690> straight<00:01:57.990> away<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.440> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
doesn't draw straight away and the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.070 
doesn't draw straight away and the
reason<00:01:58.650> being<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.580> don't<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.910> any<00:02:00.330> idea

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
reason being is I don't have any idea

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.800 
reason being is I don't have any idea
that<00:02:01.290> will<00:02:01.770> change<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:02.250> text<00:02:02.430> color<00:02:02.850> I'll

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
that will change the text color I'll

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:11.720 
that will change the text color I'll
click<00:02:04.050> play<00:02:04.260> and<00:02:05.180> now<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.390> will<00:02:06.540> work<00:02:10.670> okay<00:02:11.670> so

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
click play and now it will work okay so

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.720 
click play and now it will work okay so
we<00:02:12.060> simply<00:02:12.480> have<00:02:12.510> some<00:02:12.780> text<00:02:13.080> in<00:02:13.290> game<00:02:13.740> but

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
we simply have some text in game but

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.880 
we simply have some text in game but
let's<00:02:14.880> make<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.450> we<00:02:16.140> come<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.620> close<00:02:16.709> to

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
let's make it so we come to the close to

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.770 
let's make it so we come to the close to
the<00:02:16.980> balcony<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.580> text<00:02:17.970> appears<00:02:18.390> but

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
the balcony and the text appears but

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.240 
the balcony and the text appears but
will<00:02:18.959> you<00:02:19.080> leave<00:02:19.410> away<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.950> text

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
will you leave away and the text

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.520 
will you leave away and the text
disappears<00:02:20.600> so<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.720> do<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:21.870> we<00:02:22.260> need<00:02:22.410> to

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
disappears so to do that we need to

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.620 
disappears so to do that we need to
create<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.980> blueprint<00:02:23.490> interface<00:02:23.910> or<00:02:24.360> right

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
create a blueprint interface or right

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.110 
create a blueprint interface or right
click<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.470> miscellaneous<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.310> select

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
click to miscellaneous and select

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.479 
click to miscellaneous and select
blueprint<00:02:27.540> interface<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.190> let's<00:02:29.190> just<00:02:29.340> name

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
blueprint interface and let's just name

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.960 
blueprint interface and let's just name
this<00:02:29.700> show<00:02:30.480> text<00:02:31.020> so<00:02:32.010> blueprint<00:02:32.370> interface<00:02:32.580> is

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
this show text so blueprint interface is

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.300 
this show text so blueprint interface is
basically<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.450> function<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:34.080> can<00:02:34.530> be<00:02:34.650> that

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
basically a function that can be that

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.560 
basically a function that can be that
can<00:02:35.370> communicate<00:02:35.640> between<00:02:36.060> all<00:02:36.450> these

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
can communicate between all these

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.740 
can communicate between all these
different<00:02:36.920> blueprints<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:39.120> we'll<00:02:39.330> come<00:02:39.570> into

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
different blueprints so we'll come into

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.000 
different blueprints so we'll come into
the<00:02:40.459> interface<00:02:41.459> add<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:41.910> function<00:02:42.830> let's<00:02:43.830> name

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
the interface add a function let's name

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.140 
the interface add a function let's name
this<00:02:44.220> show<00:02:44.489> text<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.560> add<00:02:46.560> an<00:02:46.739> input<00:02:47.150> we're

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
this show text and add an input we're

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.180 
this show text and add an input we're
going<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.300> leave<00:02:48.450> as<00:02:48.570> a<00:02:48.600> ball<00:02:48.930> so<00:02:49.530> we<00:02:49.650> can<00:02:49.800> take

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
going to leave as a ball so we can take

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:58.759 
going to leave as a ball so we can take
an<00:02:55.160> untested<00:02:56.160> mark<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:57.480> you'll<00:02:57.840> see<00:02:58.049> why<00:02:58.440> in

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
an untested mark and you'll see why in

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.030 
an untested mark and you'll see why in
just<00:02:58.799> a<00:02:59.160> second<00:03:00.560> open<00:03:01.560> up<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.769> level

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
just a second open up the level

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.280 
just a second open up the level
blueprint<00:03:04.280> right<00:03:05.280> click<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.989> can<00:03:07.019> see<00:03:07.230> we

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
blueprint right click and you can see we

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.310 
blueprint right click and you can see we
have<00:03:07.410> interface<00:03:07.829> messages<00:03:08.310> now<00:03:09.049> and<00:03:10.049> you<00:03:10.170> see

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
have interface messages now and you see

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.280 
have interface messages now and you see
we<00:03:10.410> have<00:03:10.530> our<00:03:10.560> show<00:03:10.920> text<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.780> you<00:03:12.780> see<00:03:12.959> we<00:03:13.079> can

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
we have our show text and you see we can

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.569 
we have our show text and you see we can
check<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.400> uncheck<00:03:14.579> our<00:03:15.090> ball<00:03:16.250> so<00:03:17.250> if<00:03:17.370> we

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
check and uncheck our ball so if we

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.780 
check and uncheck our ball so if we
create<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.480> box<00:03:18.720> trigger

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:33.330 

and<00:03:23.650> scale<00:03:24.650> it<00:03:24.799> up

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.190 

we<00:03:33.940> can<00:03:34.120> right<00:03:34.390> click<00:03:34.420> add<00:03:35.349> event<00:03:35.730> collision

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
we can right click add event collision

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.710 
we can right click add event collision
begin<00:03:38.200> overlap<00:03:38.530> and<00:03:39.130> connect<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:40.239> up<00:03:40.300> so<00:03:40.599> when

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
begin overlap and connect it up so when

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.140 
begin overlap and connect it up so when
we<00:03:40.810> enter<00:03:41.020> the<00:03:41.110> box<00:03:41.260> again<00:03:41.590> we<00:03:42.160> can<00:03:42.340> check<00:03:42.790> show

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
we enter the box again we can check show

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.130 
we enter the box again we can check show
text<00:03:43.510> so<00:03:44.400> this<00:03:45.400> is<00:03:45.580> true<00:03:45.819> so<00:03:46.780> let's<00:03:46.930> make<00:03:47.110> it

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
text so this is true so let's make it

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.260 
text so this is true so let's make it
false<00:03:47.560> when<00:03:47.860> we<00:03:47.950> exit<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.370> box<00:03:48.819> triggers<00:03:49.150> or

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
false when we exit the box triggers or

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.870 
false when we exit the box triggers or
add<00:03:49.450> event<00:03:49.720> collision<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:51.840> overlap<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:54.700> just

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
add event collision and overlap you just

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.790 
add event collision and overlap you just
copy<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.269> paste<00:03:55.540> us<00:03:56.130> and<00:03:57.130> check<00:03:57.489> it<00:03:58.800> connect

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
copy and paste us and check it connect

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.550 
copy and paste us and check it connect
it<00:03:59.920> up<00:04:00.040> and<00:04:00.810> then<00:04:01.810> we<00:04:01.900> can<00:04:02.019> click<00:04:02.170> compile

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
it up and then we can click compile

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.740 
it up and then we can click compile
however<00:04:03.430> we<00:04:03.610> get<00:04:03.730> an<00:04:03.849> error<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.300> the<00:04:04.450> reason

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
however we get an error and the reason

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.720 
however we get an error and the reason
being<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:05.080> we<00:04:05.410> don't<00:04:05.530> have<00:04:05.709> a<00:04:05.769> target<00:04:06.250> now<00:04:06.670> the

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
being is we don't have a target now the

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.759 
being is we don't have a target now the
target<00:04:07.180> is<00:04:07.299> going<00:04:07.360> to<00:04:07.569> be<00:04:07.630> our<00:04:07.870> hard<00:04:08.170> blueprint

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
target is going to be our hard blueprint

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.759 
target is going to be our hard blueprint
so<00:04:09.700> to<00:04:09.760> do<00:04:09.940> this<00:04:10.120> we'll<00:04:10.299> right<00:04:10.569> click<00:04:10.769> and

simple as that as one last thing we need
to<00:04:26.290> do<00:04:26.470> and<00:04:26.710> it's<00:04:26.860> just<00:04:26.919> adding<00:04:27.340> some<00:04:27.460> more

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
to do and it's just adding some more

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.230 
to do and it's just adding some more
functionalities<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.360> our<00:04:28.630> hard<00:04:28.900> blueprint<00:04:30.240> so

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
functionalities to our hard blueprint so

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.890 
functionalities to our hard blueprint so
drag<00:04:31.540> this<00:04:31.660> out<00:04:31.840> I'll<00:04:32.770> type<00:04:33.010> in<00:04:33.250> gate<00:04:33.900> and

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
drag this out I'll type in gate and

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.110 
drag this out I'll type in gate and
we've<00:04:35.080> got<00:04:35.320> a<00:04:35.350> gate<00:04:35.650> here<00:04:35.680> so<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.820> reason

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
we've got a gate here so the reason

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.730 
we've got a gate here so the reason
being<00:04:37.300> is<00:04:37.479> we<00:04:37.630> want<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.870> open<00:04:38.229> the<00:04:38.350> gate<00:04:38.560> and

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
being is we want to open the gate and

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.820 
being is we want to open the gate and
close<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.460> gate<00:04:39.720> with<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:40.870> condition<00:04:41.410> of<00:04:41.590> the

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
close the gate with the condition of the

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.940 
close the gate with the condition of the
box<00:04:42.010> trigger<00:04:43.200> so<00:04:44.200> I<00:04:44.229> with<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.500> condition<00:04:44.860> of

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
box trigger so I with the condition of

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.930 
box trigger so I with the condition of
the<00:04:45.039> show<00:04:45.250> text<00:04:45.640> interface<00:04:46.090> so<00:04:46.750> right<00:04:47.110> click

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
and we're going to grab a branch so true

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.170 
and we're going to grab a branch so true
be<00:04:53.050> connected<00:04:53.500> to<00:04:53.590> open<00:04:54.010> and<00:04:54.190> false<00:04:54.820> will<00:04:55.030> be

interface we need to add it in the

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:01.380 
interface we need to add it in the
blueprint<00:05:00.460> prop<00:05:00.789> so<00:05:01.060> we'll<00:05:01.150> come<00:05:01.270> up<00:05:01.300> here

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
you can see we have our interface and

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.360 
you can see we have our interface and
now<00:05:10.030> we<00:05:10.090> can<00:05:10.330> add<00:05:10.660> an<00:05:10.900> event<00:05:11.160> for<00:05:12.160> our

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
now we can add an event for our

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.969 
now we can add an event for our
interface<00:05:12.820> you<00:05:13.240> see<00:05:13.510> we<00:05:13.600> find<00:05:13.930> event<00:05:14.470> show

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
interface you see we find event show

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.330 
interface you see we find event show
text<00:05:15.840> and<00:05:16.840> we<00:05:17.050> can<00:05:17.080> connect<00:05:17.410> these<00:05:17.470> up<00:05:17.530> but<00:05:18.250> we

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
text and we can connect these up but we

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.379 
text and we can connect these up but we
didn't<00:05:18.610> also<00:05:18.820> connect<00:05:19.210> up<00:05:19.389> the<00:05:19.690> conditions

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
didn't also connect up the conditions

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:27.709 
didn't also connect up the conditions
and<00:05:23.430> that's<00:05:24.430> all<00:05:24.669> we<00:05:24.820> need<00:05:24.970> to<00:05:25.060> do

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:27.719

so<00:05:28.319> I'm<00:05:28.409> just<00:05:28.589> change<00:05:28.830> the<00:05:28.949> scale<00:05:29.219> of<00:05:29.249> this<00:05:29.779> we

00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:30.779 
so I'm just change the scale of this we

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:46.459 
so I'm just change the scale of this we
can<00:05:30.869> change<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.169> color<00:05:31.349> as<00:05:31.529> well<00:05:36.199> okay<00:05:45.469> so

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:46.469 
can change the color as well okay so

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:48.199 
can change the color as well okay so
it's<00:05:46.619> appearing<00:05:46.919> and<00:05:47.159> disappearing<00:05:47.249> when<00:05:48.089> we

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:48.209 
it's appearing and disappearing when we

it's appearing and disappearing when we
enter<00:05:48.479> the<00:05:48.569> box<00:05:48.719> trigger

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190
