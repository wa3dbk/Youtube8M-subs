00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.790
 vincent it's not at all a state 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.110
 collective mind all that no me that's me 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.179
 not surprising because it's true that 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.400
 that when you sleep in a good place 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.529
 accurate always the same in comfort 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.330
 you win and you win enormously rather 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.650
 to go to a hotel every time 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.300
 knows very well that hotels often 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.010
 in the cra now in the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.510
 Pyrenees in the Alps and all that you 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.949
 take the nearest hotel knew 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.289
 to do the road and where extends a 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.880
 economist in a comfort trick 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.090
 they want but give back their stars 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.890
 in a cocoon that I understand it after 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.180
 if it creates zany in the middle of 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.329
 group balance the others feel 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.920
 a little but felt a little bit like a 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.989
 lackeys like wolves girl to 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.629
 sleep and stable and the other would be 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.129
 in the castle if his crisis like this 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.840
 of conflict it is important not to do it 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.660
 now is what guys are not 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.550
 big enough to protect 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.989
 their stars their stars who go 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.219
 to work for him is what they want 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.140
 not put it is not it a 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.300
 common agreement that was that was taken 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.690
 with his girlfriends it would take 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.380
 know 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.430
 but why not in game by the way 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.280
 is not about george and that the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.590
 term the whole team and this system i in 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.960
 any case froome said me to the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.369
 door difference on the giro it's not 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.650
 not improbable that I share times 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.180
 the motorhome with an economic world 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.640
 here but what would be 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.070
 interesting to know it's all coming 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.380
 the approach is the reflection of 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.210
 froome who like that is spontaneously 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.030
 where does the town hall come from because of the group in 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.740
 saying to doba me I need this stuff a 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.400
 a little bit like one of 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.329
 someone extremely demanding or so 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.770
 that's just 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.970
 the extension of what we already see 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.950
 in the round, that is to say anyway 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.450
 teams that serve a star 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.250
 and this star at that moment you can 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.689
 alas change vincent you can more 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.409
 reasonably think it takes the 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.990
 put in the best conditions 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.240
 that we must bring him recovery 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.579
 ideal the most important comfort that 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.170
 it does not really shock me if the 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.590
 approach however it comes from the type 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.170
 which in the manner of some 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:11.510
 other athletes have like that desires 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:13.459
 a little reflection towards becomes of 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.349
 sky say say manager brailsford 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.550
 the one who made it win for the first 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.599
 British times on the turn the one 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.890
 who won for the first time 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.400
 British also games 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.030
 Olympic 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.160
 in fact they have a fad obsession 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.410
 it's the recovery do everything for the 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.269
 nation it's the only sky you 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.560
 see in the arrival era after a 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.140
 crossed the line went directly through 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.610
 their coach is to continue 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.519
 the preparation of the English is pro 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.019
 turn but put everything at the service of the 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.780
 performance and put you in the 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.640
 better conditions it's a recognition 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.959
 but I'm going to criticize the criticism 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.010
 come from other teams for not that 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.390
 the man can zizanie I think 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.160
 sincerely I do not believe that his 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.019
 teammates the critic who are all 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.310
 in the same thing and it protects when they 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.799
 protect their star me I find that 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.170
 it's only that I'm even more 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.120
 far I'm amazed that in cycling 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.280
 who has become hyper professional and 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.260
 experts it's not already done for 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.860
 the whole team because do I forgive 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.870
 we all lived it when you change often 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.310
 of particular bed that captures that happens to 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.290
 hardly my career but I can tell you 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:18.260
 that you do not sleep well you have back pain 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:20.870
 you are especially that you are looking for all 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.389
 the places of life of times when he is 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.880
 occupied see what care is to vote no 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:28.519
 and that's where I watch her fly us 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.000
 so I 'm surprised it's happening 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:34.220
 not already and why not the how to say 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.810
 the cost that it goes into the mores and 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.090
 that the whole team takes advantage of gold after 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.870
 dance dancing mobile homes there you can 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.310
 put a lot of guys 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.239
 but not that we're going to manna the 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.430
 finger to make sleep more 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.160
 so necs for a team he has not he does not 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.340
 do not need 12 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.870
 and there and re financially I 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.460
 I'm not sure it's much more 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.930
 expensive than going to the hotel but actually 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:04:00.310
 no because teams do not pay 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:02.050
 she acts of a team and is against 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.160
 did I do not know in rugby I do not 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.260
 I'm not sure that in rugby it's 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.880
 like that but but I played with 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.990
 guys who made you win the 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.490
 matches and who had one often 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.910
 spoke and who had the privileges 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.730
 wei ji ji guys who sometimes he 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.810
 did not train cape of me I was coming back 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.320
 only the guy who are hungry who does 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.390
 room apart 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.380
 we're still in the hand 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.640
 wins the matches but at 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.640
 slag it's not here you're there 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.420
 no but but but but I never 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.560
 seen rsa combined because the guy 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.300
 Saturday made you win the matches in 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.820
 Shock management shock lung you have 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.410
 had a significant improvement in rugby 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.940
 conditions of travel with 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.340
 teams that have cars for the one who 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.740
 bus trip always and go do it 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.120
 there a lot of berth gap with 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.470
 more comfortable seats 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.550
 a reduced number of seats so that 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.130
 players have several places 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.270
 to put the cases late that's it 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.130
 it's fridges all you 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.600
 want but down and that like it does 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.780
 part of everything again from this 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.510
 will to go to yes my preparation 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.400
 with the operation is targeting an element am 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.900
 so we come back to what we were saying 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.380
 earlier this is to say this report to 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.720
 team 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.790
 and can you like that get out a 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.050
 element on the pretext that he is 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.520
 better than others it is more 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.720
 important to him the problem 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.300
 specific 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.350
 the problem thomas knows that froome I 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.669
 can you tell he'll have to be there 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.370
 good if it is in these conditions there 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.050
 because his teammates accept or 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.419
 if he and huawei bank I believe that 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.470
 it all starts from a common agreement 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.540
 so far we have not spoken to his 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.280
 partners of course and kuzi like 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.960
 that in the contract is like that and that 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.640
 and that we do everything for the star 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.710
 so that she brings the team 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.630
 to bring the team into the water 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.520
 it was a collective job I think 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.890
 not that if wilkinson had said i do 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.620
 a room apart from someone would have him 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:45.400
 refused his hand draw between room apart 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.740
 and he said hey well I go to 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.350
 novotel but I go down 4 stars thanks 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.210
 next to that the debate is doing the same thing 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.340
 but who will sleep in small 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.780
 hotels in quotation marks and the other there 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.639
 will sleep in your teeth 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.960
 a very big luxury with the arrival everything 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.430
 what you want it is true for the 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.139
 comfort on the ride is that sometimes 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:07.950
 you land in waters where the guys the 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:09.870
 samuel alito rice bedding 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.310
 kind I know it's not because you're 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.250
 in a big hotel that you sleep well 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.980
 our bed yes the dream no more general 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.230
 to littry follows the standing lopez dad 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.850
 vincent captured and and love maths 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.850
 killing not but not always good
