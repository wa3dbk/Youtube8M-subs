here to talk about winter safety today
and<00:00:50.380> I<00:00:50.860> think<00:00:51.070> my<00:00:51.160> first<00:00:51.399> question<00:00:51.670> would<00:00:51.730> have

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
and I think my first question would have

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.490 
and I think my first question would have
to<00:00:51.969> be<00:00:52.090> winter<00:00:52.270> tires<00:00:52.660> what<00:00:52.989> is<00:00:53.110> the<00:00:53.290> biggest

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
to be winter tires what is the biggest

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.860 
to be winter tires what is the biggest
difference<00:00:54.010> between<00:00:54.100> winter<00:00:54.700> tires<00:00:54.969> and<00:00:55.329> all

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
difference between winter tires and all

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.630 
difference between winter tires and all
season<00:00:56.320> tires<00:00:56.530> well<00:00:57.160> there's<00:00:57.340> a<00:00:57.399> number<00:00:57.489> of

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
season tires well there's a number of

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.220 
season tires well there's a number of
differences<00:00:57.969> the<00:00:58.180> primary<00:00:58.629> one<00:00:58.840> is<00:00:58.870> the

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
differences the primary one is the

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.229 
differences the primary one is the
composite<00:00:59.620> the<00:01:00.340> rubber<00:01:00.670> if<00:01:00.910> you<00:01:01.030> will<00:01:01.210> that

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
composite the rubber if you will that

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.389 
composite the rubber if you will that
makes<00:01:01.600> up<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.840> tire<00:01:02.170> and<00:01:02.469> of<00:01:02.890> course<00:01:02.920> the

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
makes up the tire and of course the

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.510 
makes up the tire and of course the
groove<00:01:03.700> and<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.720> configuration<00:01:05.649> to<00:01:05.800> pull

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520

slush<00:01:06.940> ice<00:01:07.240> and<00:01:08.220> issues<00:01:09.220> away<00:01:09.580> from<00:01:09.789> the<00:01:09.910> tire

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
slush ice and issues away from the tire

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.359 
slush ice and issues away from the tire
at<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:10.869> end<00:01:10.990> of<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.200> day<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.890> best<00:01:12.100> thing<00:01:12.280> you

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
at the end of the day the best thing you

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.460 
at the end of the day the best thing you
do<00:01:12.490> for<00:01:12.520> winter<00:01:12.880> safety<00:01:13.300> for<00:01:13.869> winter<00:01:14.200> tires

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
do for winter safety for winter tires

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.889 
do for winter safety for winter tires
for<00:01:15.369> winter<00:01:15.700> driving<00:01:15.880> so<00:01:16.479> when<00:01:16.630> would<00:01:16.750> you

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
for winter driving so when would you

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:18.389 
for winter driving so when would you
recommend<00:01:17.350> that<00:01:17.410> people<00:01:17.619> actually<00:01:17.830> put<00:01:18.220> these

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
recommend that people actually put these

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.789 
recommend that people actually put these
winter<00:01:18.729> tires<00:01:18.939> on<00:01:19.150> as<00:01:19.930> soon<00:01:20.170> as<00:01:20.320> you<00:01:20.439> start<00:01:20.680> to

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
winter tires on as soon as you start to

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.080 
winter tires on as soon as you start to
see<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.159> temperature<00:01:21.689> starting<00:01:22.689> to<00:01:22.810> fall<00:01:23.049> to

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
see the temperature starting to fall to

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.990 
see the temperature starting to fall to
one<00:01:25.090> degree<00:01:25.360> two<00:01:25.960> degrees<00:01:26.290> their<00:01:26.979> optimum<00:01:27.790> at

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
one degree two degrees their optimum at

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.539 
one degree two degrees their optimum at
seven<00:01:28.600> degrees<00:01:28.810> below<00:01:29.290> or<00:01:29.530> better<00:01:29.740> but<00:01:30.340> once

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
seven degrees below or better but once

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:31.800 
seven degrees below or better but once
you<00:01:30.670> move<00:01:30.850> into<00:01:31.060> that<00:01:31.180> weather<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.630> course

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
you move into that weather and of course

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.050 
you move into that weather and of course
you<00:01:31.930> have<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.080> remember<00:01:32.430> every<00:01:33.430> car<00:01:33.700> dealer

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
you have to remember every car dealer

has hundreds of clients who want to come

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.760 
has hundreds of clients who want to come
in<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.180> get<00:01:37.240> those<00:01:37.420> tires<00:01:37.659> done<00:01:37.960> so<00:01:38.229> the

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
in and get those tires done so the

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.320 
in and get those tires done so the
sooner<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.220> better<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.880> longer<00:01:40.030> you<00:01:40.299> wait

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
sooner the better the longer you wait

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.630 
sooner the better the longer you wait
the<00:01:40.689> more<00:01:40.900> like<00:01:41.170> ER<00:01:41.409> to<00:01:41.590> have<00:01:41.710> to<00:01:41.890> wait<00:01:42.430> a<00:01:42.460> bit

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
the more like ER to have to wait a bit

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.730 
the more like ER to have to wait a bit
of<00:01:42.759> time<00:01:42.909> but<00:01:43.119> from<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:43.869> safety<00:01:44.409> perspective

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
of time but from a safety perspective

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.440 
of time but from a safety perspective
it's<00:01:45.310> worth<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.640> wait<00:01:45.670> to<00:01:45.939> get<00:01:46.030> those<00:01:46.210> tires

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
it's worth the wait to get those tires

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.020 
it's worth the wait to get those tires

dangerous how would you suggest that

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
to make sure you don't have any build up

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.140 
to make sure you don't have any build up
around<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.140> battery<00:03:01.580> these<00:03:02.580> batteries<00:03:03.030> are

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
around the battery these batteries are

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.130 
around the battery these batteries are
at<00:03:03.690> their<00:03:04.050> peak<00:03:04.580> performance<00:03:05.600> and<00:03:06.600> it<00:03:06.810> takes<00:03:07.020> a

at their peak performance and it takes a

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
at their peak performance and it takes a
little<00:03:07.260> bit<00:03:07.410> extra<00:03:07.560> out<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:07.920> them<00:03:08.010> in<00:03:08.100> the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
little bit extra out of them in the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.640 
little bit extra out of them in the
winter<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:09.090> guess<00:03:09.810> in<00:03:09.990> the<00:03:10.080> summer<00:03:10.320> when<00:03:10.530> it

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
winter I guess in the summer when it

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.320 
winter I guess in the summer when it
doesn't<00:03:10.830> start<00:03:11.130> it's<00:03:11.340> not<00:03:11.520> so<00:03:11.730> bad<00:03:11.910> but<00:03:12.150> in<00:03:12.270> the

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
doesn't start it's not so bad but in the

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.430 
doesn't start it's not so bad but in the
winter<00:03:12.570> it<00:03:12.660> can<00:03:12.720> be<00:03:12.930> both<00:03:13.500> inconvenient<00:03:14.370> and

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
winter it can be both inconvenient and

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.280 
winter it can be both inconvenient and
uncomfortable<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:17.040> radiator<00:03:17.990> creates<00:03:18.990> a<00:03:19.110> lot

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
uncomfortable the radiator creates a lot

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.740 
uncomfortable the radiator creates a lot
of<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.530> heat<00:03:19.800> component<00:03:20.520> within<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.970> engine

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
of the heat component within the engine

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.060 
of the heat component within the engine
