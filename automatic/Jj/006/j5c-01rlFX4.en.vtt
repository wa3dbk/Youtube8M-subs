00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
transition definitely just like I said

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.210 
transition definitely just like I said
before<00:01:15.660> the<00:01:15.960> speed<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.260> the<00:01:16.290> game<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:16.830> being

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
before the speed of the game just being

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.530 
before the speed of the game just being
able<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.520> make<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.700> transition<00:01:18.060> while

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540
