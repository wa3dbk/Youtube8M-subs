boob<00:03:58.020> I<00:03:58.290> last<00:03:58.580> breast<00:03:59.580> fed<00:03:59.850> on<00:04:00.090> I<00:04:00.360> know<00:04:00.480> that

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
boob I last breast fed on I know that

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.930 
boob I last breast fed on I know that
probably<00:04:01.260> seems<00:04:01.590> really<00:04:01.980> strange<00:04:02.220> but<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:02.760> tree

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
probably seems really strange but a tree

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.050 
probably seems really strange but a tree
works<00:04:03.180> so<00:04:03.420> um<00:04:04.160> depending<00:04:05.160> on<00:04:05.280> which<00:04:05.430> wrist<00:04:05.760> I'm

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
works so um depending on which wrist I'm

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.690 
works so um depending on which wrist I'm
wearing<00:04:06.420> it<00:04:06.660> on<00:04:06.830> that<00:04:07.830> means<00:04:08.010> that<00:04:08.160> I<00:04:08.190> just<00:04:08.430> fed

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
wearing it on that means that I just fed

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.070 
wearing it on that means that I just fed
on<00:04:08.880> that<00:04:08.910> side<00:04:09.270> so<00:04:09.480> then<00:04:09.630> I<00:04:09.690> know<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:09.989> the

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
on that side so then I know that the

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.570 
on that side so then I know that the
next<00:04:10.290> time<00:04:10.350> I<00:04:10.620> go<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:10.770> the<00:04:10.980> other<00:04:11.040> side<00:04:11.250> yeah

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
next time I go to the other side yeah

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.620 
next time I go to the other side yeah
I'm<00:04:12.330> weird<00:04:12.690> like<00:04:12.750> that<00:04:12.870> but<00:04:13.200> it<00:04:13.290> really<00:04:16.489> bag

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
I'm weird like that but it really bag

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.229 
I'm weird like that but it really bag
I'm<00:04:18.630> just<00:04:18.840> carrying<00:04:19.169> my<00:04:19.500> storksak<00:04:20.310> Elizabeth

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
I'm just carrying my storksak Elizabeth

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.080 
I'm just carrying my storksak Elizabeth
changing<00:04:22.140> by<00:04:22.340> which<00:04:23.340> actually<00:04:23.520> matches<00:04:24.000> up

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
changing by which actually matches up

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.670 
changing by which actually matches up
pretty<00:04:24.210> well<00:04:24.360> with<00:04:24.540> the<00:04:24.660> shoes<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.200> that's

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
pretty well with the shoes and that's

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.840 
pretty well with the shoes and that's
probably<00:04:26.130> one<00:04:26.280> of<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.430> reasons<00:04:26.460> why<00:04:26.760> I've

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
probably one of the reasons why I've
