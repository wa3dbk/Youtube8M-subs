little<00:02:16.830> ridges<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.670> texture<00:02:18.180> will<00:02:18.390> actually

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
little ridges the texture will actually

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.170 
little ridges the texture will actually
just<00:02:19.410> lighten<00:02:19.950> up<00:02:20.070> a<00:02:20.190> little<00:02:20.220> bit<00:02:20.670> because<00:02:20.850> it

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
just lighten up a little bit because it

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.480 
just lighten up a little bit because it
is<00:02:21.210> a<00:02:21.420> little<00:02:21.840> bit<00:02:21.960> more<00:02:22.140> coarser<00:02:22.590> than<00:02:22.980> my

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
is a little bit more coarser than my

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.700 
is a little bit more coarser than my
natural<00:02:23.970> hair<00:02:24.210> but<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:24.930> see<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:25.530> did

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
natural hair but I see that it did

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.590 
natural hair but I see that it did
lighten<00:02:26.010> up<00:02:26.130> just<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.580> tad<00:02:26.850> bit<00:02:26.910> but<00:02:27.360> not<00:02:27.540> too

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
lighten up just a tad bit but not too

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.990 
lighten up just a tad bit but not too
much<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.440> still<00:02:28.980> do<00:02:29.220> not<00:02:29.250> lose<00:02:29.730> the

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
much so you still do not lose the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.480 
much so you still do not lose the
texture<00:02:30.480> from<00:02:31.020> this<00:02:31.260> hair<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:31.860> it's<00:02:32.070> very

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490

except you can see and it has a little

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.250 
except you can see and it has a little

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
bit of a natural luster to it so it's

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:52.949 
bit of a natural luster to it so it's
not<00:02:43.290> dull<00:02:43.710> and<00:02:44.070> not<00:02:44.100> too<00:02:44.340> shiny
