00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
one little trick that we found the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.690 
one little trick that we found the
really<00:01:05.930> like<00:01:06.110> is<00:01:06.460> you'd<00:01:07.460> be<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.550> pretty

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
really like is you'd be a pretty

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.160 
really like is you'd be a pretty
heavy-duty<00:01:08.060> roller<00:01:08.480> frame<00:01:08.720> to<00:01:08.870> roll<00:01:09.020> this

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
heavy-duty roller frame to roll this

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.190 
heavy-duty roller frame to roll this
stuff<00:01:09.410> out<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:10.510> with<00:01:11.510> the<00:01:11.600> amount<00:01:11.810> of<00:01:11.870> product

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
stuff out and with the amount of product

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.380 
stuff out and with the amount of product
that's<00:01:12.350> in<00:01:12.560> it<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:12.860> roller<00:01:13.100> can<00:01:13.520> wander<00:01:14.150> off

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
that's in it the roller can wander off

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.320 
that's in it the roller can wander off
the<00:01:14.900> roller<00:01:15.140> frame<00:01:15.470> so<00:01:15.710> we<00:01:15.800> take<00:01:16.010> a<00:01:16.150> bugle<00:01:17.150> head

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
the roller frame so we take a bugle head

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.150 
the roller frame so we take a bugle head
screw<00:01:17.750> and<00:01:18.050> put<00:01:18.590> it<00:01:18.680> in<00:01:18.770> right<00:01:18.950> there<00:01:18.980> and

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
screw and put it in right there and

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.610 
screw and put it in right there and
basically<00:01:19.670> attach<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.780> roller<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.380> the

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
basically attach the roller to the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.040 
basically attach the roller to the
roller<00:01:22.430> frame<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:23.240> that<00:01:23.840> kind<00:01:24.020> of

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
roller frame and that kind of

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.470 
roller frame and that kind of
counteracts<00:01:24.560> all<00:01:24.800> that<00:01:25.060> it<00:01:26.060> goes<00:01:26.270> on<00:01:26.450> really

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
counteracts all that it goes on really

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.620 
counteracts all that it goes on really

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
on the wall assembly all right so we're

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.300 
on the wall assembly all right so we're
going<00:02:35.989> to<00:02:36.049> describe<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.620> parts<00:02:36.920> of<00:02:37.010> our<00:02:37.129> wall

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
going to describe the parts of our wall

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.000 
going to describe the parts of our wall
assembly<00:02:37.610> at<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.090> stem<00:02:38.540> wall<00:02:38.780> so<00:02:39.739> we've<00:02:39.890> got

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
assembly at the stem wall so we've got

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.979 
assembly at the stem wall so we've got
our<00:02:40.129> stem<00:02:40.340> wall<00:02:40.519> with<00:02:41.180> our<00:02:41.360> last<00:02:41.540> dimeric

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
have we try our top of the stem while

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.860 
have we try our top of the stem while
really<00:02:49.010> flat<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.250> smooth<00:02:49.640> we've<00:02:50.359> got<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.540> 3<00:02:50.840> by

really flat and smooth we've got a 3 by
sill<00:02:51.440> plate<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:51.980> underneath<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.310> we've<00:02:52.670> got

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
sill plate and underneath that we've got

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.339 
sill plate and underneath that we've got
we<00:02:53.030> actually<00:02:53.359> do<00:02:53.480> use<00:02:53.659> two<00:02:53.930> layers<00:02:54.170> of

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
we actually do use two layers of

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.309 
we actually do use two layers of
gasketing<00:02:55.129> epdm<00:02:55.670> gasketing<00:02:56.329> that<00:02:57.019> is

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
gasketing epdm gasketing that is

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.280 
gasketing epdm gasketing that is
underneath<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:57.859> plate<00:02:58.359> when<00:02:59.359> we<00:02:59.510> set<00:03:00.200> our

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
underneath the plate when we set our

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.160 
underneath the plate when we set our
plywood<00:03:00.829> we<00:03:01.790> actually<00:03:02.150> bedded<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.659> plywood

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
plywood we actually bedded the plywood

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.319 
plywood we actually bedded the plywood
in<00:03:03.409> join<00:03:03.709> seam<00:03:04.069> filler<00:03:04.370> another<00:03:05.030> thing<00:03:05.239> you

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
in join seam filler another thing you

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:06.849 
in join seam filler another thing you
can<00:03:05.389> notice<00:03:05.480> here<00:03:05.840> we<00:03:05.989> held<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.379> plywood

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
can notice here we held the plywood

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.890 
can notice here we held the plywood
flush<00:03:07.519> with<00:03:07.819> the<00:03:07.940> face<00:03:08.120> of<00:03:08.329> the<00:03:08.420> stem<00:03:08.659> wall

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
flush with the face of the stem wall

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.020 
flush with the face of the stem wall
that<00:03:09.739> just<00:03:09.980> makes<00:03:10.190> everything<00:03:10.519> much<00:03:10.790> more

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
that just makes everything much more

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.089 
that just makes everything much more
seamless<00:03:11.299> when<00:03:11.750> it<00:03:11.900> comes<00:03:12.079> time<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.319> put<00:03:12.799> our

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
seamless when it comes time to put our

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.610 
seamless when it comes time to put our
our<00:03:13.670> poly<00:03:14.329> iso<00:03:14.720> foam<00:03:14.959> on<00:03:15.200> it<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.379> foams

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
our poly iso foam on it the foams

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.869 
our poly iso foam on it the foams
basically<00:03:16.099> going<00:03:16.190> to<00:03:16.310> come<00:03:16.430> all<00:03:16.639> the<00:03:16.760> way<00:03:16.790> down

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
basically going to come all the way down

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.610 
basically going to come all the way down
and<00:03:17.329> then<00:03:17.450> just<00:03:17.510> flushes<00:03:18.049> right<00:03:18.260> on<00:03:18.379> top<00:03:18.590> of

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
and then just flushes right on top of

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.129 
and then just flushes right on top of
the<00:03:18.859> stem<00:03:19.489> wall<00:03:19.670> then<00:03:19.879> we<00:03:20.000> switch<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.389> EPS<00:03:20.930> foam

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
the stem wall then we switch to EPS foam

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.970 
the stem wall then we switch to EPS foam
after<00:03:21.500> that<00:03:21.620> once<00:03:21.799> we<00:03:21.889> get<00:03:22.010> below<00:03:22.280> grade<00:03:23.980> we'll

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
after that once we get below grade we'll

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.500 
after that once we get below grade we'll
have<00:03:25.129> a<00:03:25.160> couple<00:03:25.340> shots<00:03:25.579> coming<00:03:25.879> up<00:03:26.090> of<00:03:26.299> just

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
have a couple shots coming up of just

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.420 
have a couple shots coming up of just
how<00:03:26.660> we<00:03:26.720> treated<00:03:27.169> this<00:03:27.260> on<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.530> face<00:03:27.799> after<00:03:28.129> we

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
how we treated this on the face after we

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.689 
how we treated this on the face after we
bedded<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.299> plywood<00:03:29.840> in<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:31.160> joint<00:03:31.400> seam

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:31.699 
bedded the plywood in the joint seam

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:34.869 
bedded the plywood in the joint seam
filler<00:03:31.970> we<00:03:32.299> come<00:03:32.510> back<00:03:32.720> on<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.049> face<00:03:33.440> and<00:03:33.859> do<00:03:34.849> a

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
filler we come back on the face and do a

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.270 
filler we come back on the face and do a
swath<00:03:35.660> of<00:03:35.900> joint<00:03:36.139> and<00:03:36.260> seam<00:03:36.440> filler<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:37.099> then

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
swath of joint and seam filler and then

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.920 
swath of joint and seam filler and then
we<00:03:37.489> run<00:03:37.609> the<00:03:37.669> cat<00:03:37.940> five<00:03:38.209> actually<00:03:38.480> all<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.900> way

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
we run the cat five actually all the way

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.319 
we run the cat five actually all the way
down<00:03:39.199> and<00:03:39.440> we<00:03:39.500> run<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.069> cat<00:03:40.220> five<00:03:40.489> down<00:03:40.879> about

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
down and we run the cat five down about

yet but pipe penetration we just cut the
hole<00:04:40.310> really<00:04:40.669> tight<00:04:40.909> and<00:04:41.180> then<00:04:41.749> we<00:04:41.870> can<00:04:42.020> come

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
hole really tight and then we can come

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.200 
hole really tight and then we can come
back<00:04:42.199> with<00:04:42.319> joint<00:04:42.710> and<00:04:42.830> seam<00:04:42.979> filler<00:04:43.249> and<00:04:43.639> cut

back with joint and seam filler and cut
in<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.509> whole<00:04:44.689> way<00:04:44.870> around<00:04:45.139> the<00:04:45.229> pipe<00:04:45.439> making

another<00:04:49.279> thing<00:04:49.580> we<00:04:50.240> really<00:04:50.479> like<00:04:50.509> about<00:04:50.659> fast

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
another thing we really like about fast

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.909 
another thing we really like about fast
flash<00:04:51.439> is<00:04:52.180> just<00:04:53.180> odd<00:04:53.990> attachments<00:04:54.620> like<00:04:54.740> this

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
flash is just odd attachments like this

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.469 
flash is just odd attachments like this
where<00:04:55.099> we<00:04:55.189> have<00:04:55.219> a<00:04:55.340> scaffold<00:04:55.879> frame<00:04:56.150> attached

to the plywood with most other flashings
you<00:05:00.680> would<00:05:00.800> have<00:05:00.949> to<00:05:01.099> leave<00:05:01.279> an<00:05:01.460> opening<00:05:01.849> here

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:02.029 
you would have to leave an opening here

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:03.070 
you would have to leave an opening here
that<00:05:02.180> you<00:05:02.240> would<00:05:02.360> have<00:05:02.539> to<00:05:02.629> come<00:05:02.779> back<00:05:02.930> and

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
that you would have to come back and

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.320 
that you would have to come back and
detail<00:05:03.439> in<00:05:03.710> it<00:05:03.949> would<00:05:04.069> be<00:05:04.129> several<00:05:04.939> different

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
detail in it would be several different

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.959 
detail in it would be several different
pieces<00:05:05.509> of<00:05:05.719> material<00:05:06.620> tied<00:05:07.460> in<00:05:07.639> with<00:05:07.669> each

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
other here when we pull this out we just

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.929 
other here when we pull this out we just
roll<00:05:11.240> on<00:05:11.449> more<00:05:11.860> cat5<00:05:12.860> and<00:05:12.889> it<00:05:13.340> just<00:05:13.520> blends<00:05:13.729> in

00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:13.939 
roll on more cat5 and it just blends in

roll on more cat5 and it just blends in
completely<00:05:14.509> seamlessly<00:05:15.430> we<00:05:16.430> have<00:05:16.550> that<00:05:16.729> in

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:16.909 
completely seamlessly we have that in

simple as what we do first we start with
is<00:05:38.150> we<00:05:38.270> we<00:05:38.930> cut<00:05:39.169> the<00:05:39.289> hole<00:05:39.439> as<00:05:39.589> tight<00:05:39.830> as

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
is we we cut the hole as tight as

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:41.950 
is we we cut the hole as tight as
possible<00:05:40.039> while<00:05:40.729> still<00:05:40.759> allowing<00:05:41.360> it<00:05:41.689> to<00:05:41.719> be

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
possible while still allowing it to be

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.089 
possible while still allowing it to be
buildable<00:05:42.589> so<00:05:43.580> go<00:05:44.180> up<00:05:44.419> eighth<00:05:44.719> or<00:05:45.139> 3/16<00:05:45.889> over

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:46.099 
buildable so go up eighth or 3/16 over

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:49.179 
buildable so go up eighth or 3/16 over
the<00:05:46.189> hole<00:05:46.310> diameter<00:05:46.930> the<00:05:47.930> pipe<00:05:48.110> diameter<00:05:48.680> and

00:05:49.179 --> 00:05:49.189 
the hole diameter the pipe diameter and

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:52.149 
the hole diameter the pipe diameter and
then<00:05:49.939> we<00:05:50.029> just<00:05:50.210> work<00:05:50.419> away<00:05:50.569> right<00:05:50.960> in<00:05:51.169> and<00:05:51.529> this

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
then we just work away right in and this

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:54.279 
then we just work away right in and this
this<00:05:52.580> stuff<00:05:52.759> works<00:05:53.029> in<00:05:53.240> mass<00:05:53.509> so<00:05:53.930> you<00:05:53.960> want<00:05:54.199> to

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
this stuff works in mass so you want to

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:58.119 
this stuff works in mass so you want to
have<00:05:54.409> a<00:05:54.439> decent<00:05:55.129> bead<00:05:55.550> on<00:05:55.789> it<00:05:56.949> because<00:05:57.949> what's

00:05:58.119 --> 00:05:58.129 
have a decent bead on it because what's

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:59.559 
have a decent bead on it because what's
going<00:05:58.279> to<00:05:58.310> end<00:05:58.370> up<00:05:58.520> happening<00:05:58.909> is<00:05:59.120> over<00:05:59.330> time

00:05:59.559 --> 00:05:59.569 
going to end up happening is over time

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:01.899 
going to end up happening is over time
that<00:05:59.870> pipe<00:06:00.169> is<00:06:00.529> going<00:06:01.339> to<00:06:01.399> expand<00:06:01.789> and

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:01.909 
that pipe is going to expand and

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:03.129 
that pipe is going to expand and
contract<00:06:02.000> and<00:06:02.509> the<00:06:02.569> building<00:06:02.899> is<00:06:02.960> going<00:06:03.020> to

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
contract and the building is going to

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:07.719 
contract and the building is going to
move<00:06:03.289> a<00:06:03.439> little<00:06:03.560> bit<00:06:03.800> and<00:06:05.949> if<00:06:06.949> this<00:06:07.250> think<00:06:07.580> if

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
move a little bit and if this think if

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.209 
move a little bit and if this think if
this<00:06:08.210> product<00:06:08.569> has<00:06:08.870> mass<00:06:09.139> to<00:06:09.409> it<00:06:09.589> it<00:06:09.860> can<00:06:10.009> move

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:10.219 
this product has mass to it it can move

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:14.950 
this product has mass to it it can move
with<00:06:10.520> the<00:06:10.639> building<00:06:12.009> so<00:06:13.009> that's<00:06:13.219> it<00:06:13.839> I'm<00:06:14.839> going

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
with the building so that's it I'm going

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.209 
with the building so that's it I'm going
to<00:06:15.020> leave<00:06:15.080> that<00:06:15.229> the<00:06:15.529> way<00:06:15.560> it<00:06:15.680> is<00:06:15.889> right<00:06:16.189> there

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:16.219 
to leave that the way it is right there

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:20.800 
to leave that the way it is right there
that's<00:06:16.699> that's<00:06:17.439> you<00:06:18.439> can<00:06:18.620> tool<00:06:18.889> it<00:06:19.069> out<00:06:19.360> it<00:06:20.360> can

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
that's that's you can tool it out it can

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.570 
that's that's you can tool it out it can
become<00:06:21.199> a<00:06:21.229> little<00:06:21.439> messy<00:06:22.069> if<00:06:22.189> you<00:06:22.279> really

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
become a little messy if you really

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.749 
become a little messy if you really
start<00:06:22.819> tooling<00:06:23.599> it<00:06:23.719> a<00:06:23.779> lot<00:06:24.219> to<00:06:25.219> try<00:06:25.460> and<00:06:25.580> get<00:06:25.669> it

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 
start tooling it a lot to try and get it

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:27.339 
start tooling it a lot to try and get it
on<00:06:25.849> there<00:06:26.060> fairly<00:06:26.330> good<00:06:26.659> right<00:06:27.199> in<00:06:27.259> the

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349 
on there fairly good right in the

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:30.279 
on there fairly good right in the
beginning<00:06:27.469> so<00:06:28.810> once<00:06:29.810> you've<00:06:29.990> applied<00:06:30.080> your

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289 
beginning so once you've applied your

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.649 
beginning so once you've applied your
joint<00:06:30.680> and<00:06:30.800> seam<00:06:30.979> filler<00:06:31.250> we<00:06:31.879> come<00:06:32.089> back<00:06:32.330> and

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:32.659 
joint and seam filler we come back and

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:36.309 
joint and seam filler we come back and
we'll<00:06:32.960> take<00:06:33.139> our<00:06:33.699> cat5<00:06:34.699> and<00:06:35.029> we'll<00:06:35.839> fill<00:06:36.169> in

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 
we'll take our cat5 and we'll fill in

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:37.839 
we'll take our cat5 and we'll fill in
the<00:06:36.439> spaces<00:06:36.710> that<00:06:36.949> were<00:06:37.069> missed<00:06:37.279> right<00:06:37.550> here

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:37.849 
the spaces that were missed right here

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:39.309 
the spaces that were missed right here
and<00:06:38.060> we'll<00:06:38.240> roll<00:06:38.389> it<00:06:38.449> right<00:06:38.750> out<00:06:38.930> onto<00:06:39.110> the

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:39.319 
and we'll roll it right out onto the

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:42.129 
and we'll roll it right out onto the
pipe<00:06:39.529> come<00:06:40.069> out<00:06:40.219> maybe<00:06:40.509> inch<00:06:41.509> and<00:06:41.690> a<00:06:41.750> half<00:06:41.779> two

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:42.139 
pipe come out maybe inch and a half two

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:45.020 
pipe come out maybe inch and a half two
inches<00:06:42.169> something<00:06:42.740> like<00:06:42.889> that<00:06:43.190> now

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030 
inches something like that now

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.430 
inches something like that now
another<00:06:45.180> once<00:06:45.780> again<00:06:45.960> the<00:06:46.080> beauty<00:06:46.320> of<00:06:46.350> these

products is you could use the fast flash
the<00:06:49.680> same<00:06:49.860> product<00:06:50.160> we<00:06:50.250> use<00:06:50.280> in<00:06:50.490> the<00:06:50.550> window

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
the same product we use in the window

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.460 
the same product we use in the window
openings<00:06:51.210> that<00:06:51.330> tools<00:06:51.630> really<00:06:51.900> well<00:06:52.140> which<00:06:52.320> is

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470

kind of nice

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.550 
kind of nice
the<00:06:54.180> cat5<00:06:54.600> we<00:06:54.810> would<00:06:54.930> normally<00:06:55.050> spread<00:06:55.440> on

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 
the cat5 we would normally spread on

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.120 
the cat5 we would normally spread on
with<00:06:55.680> a<00:06:55.710> roller<00:06:55.980> the<00:06:57.110> the<00:06:58.110> fast<00:06:58.380> flash<00:06:58.680> you<00:06:59.010> can

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.130 
with a roller the the fast flash you can

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.160 
with a roller the the fast flash you can
do<00:06:59.280> with<00:06:59.460> like<00:06:59.640> a<00:06:59.670> bondo<00:07:00.090> scraper<00:07:00.420> so<00:07:00.600> we<00:07:01.020> can

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:01.170 
do with like a bondo scraper so we can

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.050 
do with like a bondo scraper so we can
just<00:07:01.350> trial<00:07:02.070> it<00:07:02.280> the<00:07:02.370> whole<00:07:02.550> way<00:07:02.670> around<00:07:02.790> the

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 
just trial it the whole way around the

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.330 
just trial it the whole way around the
opening<00:07:03.510> and<00:07:03.750> then<00:07:04.050> just<00:07:04.620> you<00:07:04.950> could<00:07:05.070> probably

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 
opening and then just you could probably

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.630 
opening and then just you could probably
just<00:07:05.670> paint<00:07:06.030> it<00:07:06.210> right<00:07:06.390> onto<00:07:06.690> this<00:07:06.810> pipe<00:07:07.050> open

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:07.640 
just paint it right onto this pipe open

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.690 
just paint it right onto this pipe open
the<00:07:08.640> pipe<00:07:08.790> penetration<00:07:10.130> okay<00:07:11.130> so<00:07:11.190> in<00:07:11.460> our<00:07:11.520> next

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:11.700 
the pipe penetration okay so in our next

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.760 
the pipe penetration okay so in our next
couple<00:07:12.030> of<00:07:12.090> video<00:07:12.300> segments<00:07:12.900> now<00:07:13.530> that<00:07:13.650> we're

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:13.770 
couple of video segments now that we're

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.130 
couple of video segments now that we're
done<00:07:13.860> with<00:07:14.010> our<00:07:14.040> air<00:07:14.250> barrier<00:07:14.960> we're<00:07:15.960> going<00:07:16.080> to

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:16.140 
done with our air barrier we're going to

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.380 
done with our air barrier we're going to
do<00:07:16.290> window<00:07:16.860> installation<00:07:17.520> then<00:07:18.180> we're<00:07:18.270> going

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:18.390 
do window installation then we're going

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.390 
do window installation then we're going
to<00:07:18.420> a<00:07:18.510> preliminary<00:07:18.870> blower<00:07:19.440> door<00:07:19.710> test<00:07:20.040> and

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 
to a preliminary blower door test and

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.670 
to a preliminary blower door test and
we're<00:07:20.940> going<00:07:21.060> to<00:07:21.090> move<00:07:21.240> on<00:07:21.480> to<00:07:21.780> our<00:07:21.810> poly<00:07:22.470> a<00:07:22.560> so

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 
we're going to move on to our poly a so

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.830 
we're going to move on to our poly a so
we've<00:07:23.010> got<00:07:23.190> six<00:07:23.430> inches<00:07:23.610> of<00:07:23.850> poly<00:07:24.030> a<00:07:24.150> so<00:07:24.450> that's

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 
we've got six inches of poly a so that's

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.900
