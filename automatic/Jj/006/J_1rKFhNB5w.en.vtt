00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.410
 but like this time today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:11.230
 how to have 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:14.139
 some between 50 and 80 million 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.890
 coins in the game to think but to 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:22.060
 this we need to be root user 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.669
 okay the first thing is to go to the play hector and 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:29.669
 download president application is called 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:31.730
 haq app once downloaded in the 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:36.130
 tears 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.130
 we give it when two says 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.290
 aps 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.170
 we go and we look for our application to 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.880
 think 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.430
 and we give them when he says 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:58.320
 preference 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.320
 we go down to the last around 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.710
 this let's say ajn and we open our game 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:10.720
 to think is to see the amount of 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.100
 those who can not see I have 600 him with 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.310
 your currency 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.729
 OK 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:22.509
 the game will now play the 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.450
 application the throat says 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.130
 the last low 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.990
 through where 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:35.100
 we will put a score is that we will put the 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.100
 amount of coins 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.329
 I did not find I do not know 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.700
 99 million 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.990
 we go 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.990
 893 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.930
 and point 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.920
 this is 4 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.920
 It's me 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.410
 that is, is table 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.690
 we wait for it to be put here 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.440
 and already once it has been updated 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.470
 is 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.470
 we do not go back and we went out to home 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.550
 then later proclaim 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.040
 let's meditate and close our 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.700
 application to think and let's go back the 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.700
 let's open 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.540
 ostias my property because we 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.540
 well 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.550
 let's go back here 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:09.970
 if as it says good will sing of magician 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.020
 let's cross 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.020
 to erase the memory 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.329
 the body 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:26.030
 Well, as you can see here, it has been 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.030
 all weapons 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:34.310
 It's not much, but it's enough 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:37.610
 to use it for a good while, as 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.819
 word I can also accept the level 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.270
 200 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.890
 two are taken 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.890
 I have no problem 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.890
 this is from the host 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.870
 it's like to walk it's working 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.870
 perfectly 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.080
 another thing I wanted to comment you 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.950
 is that they can not 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:23.150
 I think you can not place a 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.980
 amount greater than 9 digits if 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.790
 they put a higher quantity or new 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.570
 digit 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.570
 I think that 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.120
 the application will not work to put 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.969
 so to show the one who moves me 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.849
 I will add two more 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:44.149
 I request more what we are going to do and then 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:46.869
 cancel everything here they have already gone 

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:46.869
 let's go back 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:55.110
 task we close the game to think 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.110
 I have a memory 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:03.430
 I do this it's always for what 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:06.760
 I missed the hands that I think about 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:09.430
 Well, how can you see how it works? 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.790
 it worked this time and he thought 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:15.310
 he stopped and every time he tried to open it 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:20.200
 Well, this will happen because I put a 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:23.700
 quantity greater than 9 digits 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:27.340
 Well, I think the game does not support a 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:30.790
 amount so big 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:36.220
 that's the reason why he presents 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:40.210
 so now go back and erase the two 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:44.520
 digits and you'll see that if it works if 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.520
 we have to close to the back 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:52.169
 we lose rice multitasking we closed the 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:55.249
 just think 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:06:00.549
 we save ram memory 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:06:00.549
 and now I try to open the game again 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.380
 now if it has not worked again that 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.710
 There have been no pardons 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.660
 perfectly 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.830
 to humans also work 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:17.380
 perfectly without any problem 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.690
 ok this is all if you liked the 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.810
 video give a like to help the 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.730
 community subscribe to the share channel 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:29.400
 video with your friends 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:29.400

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:37.980
 any doubt 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:39.930

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.150
