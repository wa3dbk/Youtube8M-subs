00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
so I really wanted a frame mount for my

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.280 
so I really wanted a frame mount for my
hero3<00:00:08.760> camera<00:00:09.389> for<00:00:09.599> when<00:00:09.690> I'm<00:00:09.809> out<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.080> a

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
hero3 camera for when I'm out to a

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.780 
hero3 camera for when I'm out to a
quadcopter<00:00:10.530> or<00:00:11.190> some<00:00:11.370> place<00:00:11.490> where<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.759> really

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.180 
quadcopter or some place where I really
wanted<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.269> lighter<00:00:12.450> mount<00:00:12.750> so<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.679> figured<00:00:14.099> I'd

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
wanted a lighter mount so I figured I'd

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.070 
wanted a lighter mount so I figured I'd
take<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.460> guys<00:00:14.580> through<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.910> process<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.509> 3d

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
take you guys through the process of 3d

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.200 
take you guys through the process of 3d
printing<00:00:16.470> one<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:17.430> we<00:00:17.580> have<00:00:17.760> our<00:00:18.619> form<00:00:19.619> 1<00:00:19.949> sl<00:00:20.820> 3d

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
printing one so we have our form 1 sl 3d

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.730 
printing one so we have our form 1 sl 3d
printer<00:00:21.570> over<00:00:21.720> here<00:00:21.990> uses<00:00:22.410> stereo

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
printer over here uses stereo

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.269 
printer over here uses stereo
lithography<00:00:23.390> so<00:00:24.390> your<00:00:24.510> 3d<00:00:24.840> print<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.410> I'm

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
lithography so your 3d print and I'm

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.990 
lithography so your 3d print and I'm
going<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.490> take<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.730> through<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.970> process

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
real quick so first place I check is

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.510 
real quick so first place I check is
usually<00:00:29.820> MakerBot<00:00:30.660> Thingiverse<00:00:31.460> it's<00:00:32.460> a

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
usually MakerBot Thingiverse it's a

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.540 
usually MakerBot Thingiverse it's a
great<00:00:32.840> compilation<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.079> ton<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.710> files<00:00:34.950> so

great compilation of a ton of files so

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.470 
great compilation of a ton of files so
just<00:00:35.880> search

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.280

thing about the four lamps printer is
the<00:00:50.680> software<00:00:51.070> that<00:00:51.190> comes<00:00:51.280> with<00:00:51.400> it<00:00:51.700> it<00:00:51.880> lets

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
the software that comes with it it lets

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.580 
the software that comes with it it lets
you<00:00:52.180> select<00:00:52.360> your<00:00:52.630> layer<00:00:52.810> height<00:00:53.110> between<00:00:53.380> the

three resolutions and your material

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.060 
three resolutions and your material
between<00:00:56.050> the<00:00:56.140> two<00:00:56.320> resins<00:00:56.680> that<00:00:56.830> they<00:00:56.920> offer

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
between the two resins that they offer

right<00:00:57.340> now<00:00:57.370> I'm<00:00:57.970> going<00:00:58.120> to<00:00:58.180> be<00:00:58.239> printing<00:00:58.540> in

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
right now I'm going to be printing in

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.410 
right now I'm going to be printing in
grey<00:00:58.870> today<00:00:58.930> and<00:00:59.410> at<00:00:59.680> a<00:00:59.710> hundred<00:01:00.280> micron<00:01:00.910> layer

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
grey today and at a hundred micron layer

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.930 
grey today and at a hundred micron layer
height<00:01:01.720> because<00:01:02.710> I<00:01:02.860> it's<00:01:03.340> just<00:01:03.400> a<00:01:03.580> structural

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
height because I it's just a structural

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.250 
height because I it's just a structural
piece<00:01:04.120> and<00:01:04.330> I<00:01:04.360> don't<00:01:04.540> really<00:01:04.660> need<00:01:04.809> any<00:01:05.020> fine

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
piece and I don't really need any fine

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.110 
piece and I don't really need any fine
detail<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:09.070> we're<00:01:09.310> just<00:01:09.340> gonna<00:01:09.520> find<00:01:09.760> the<00:01:09.910> file

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
detail so we're just gonna find the file

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.900 
detail so we're just gonna find the file
in<00:01:11.080> my<00:01:11.350> downloads<00:01:11.380> folder<00:01:11.920> and<00:01:12.640> there's<00:01:12.760> the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
in my downloads folder and there's the

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.780 
in my downloads folder and there's the
frame<00:01:14.460> I'm<00:01:15.460> going<00:01:15.880> to<00:01:16.710> auto<00:01:17.710> orient<00:01:18.340> it<00:01:18.520> see

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
frame I'm going to auto orient it see

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.580 
frame I'm going to auto orient it see
what<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.060> software<00:01:19.479> says<00:01:19.720> that<00:01:20.050> it<00:01:20.290> should<00:01:20.470> be

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
what the software says that it should be

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.400 
what the software says that it should be
mounted<00:01:21.040> at<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.840> then<00:01:22.960> I'm<00:01:23.020> going<00:01:23.140> to<00:01:23.170> tweak

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
mounted at and then I'm going to tweak

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.200 
mounted at and then I'm going to tweak
that<00:01:23.560> because<00:01:23.920> I<00:01:23.950> also<00:01:24.160> don't<00:01:24.310> want<00:01:24.670> supports

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
that because I also don't want supports

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.690 
that because I also don't want supports
in<00:01:25.540> places<00:01:26.500> where<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.770> con<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.280> camera<00:01:27.640> is

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
in places where the con the camera is

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.649 
in places where the con the camera is
going<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:27.880> come<00:01:28.030> in<00:01:28.150> close<00:01:28.420> contact<00:01:28.750> with

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
going to come in close contact with

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.510 
going to come in close contact with
okay<00:01:31.659> so<00:01:31.719> the<00:01:32.049> frame<00:01:32.320> is<00:01:32.350> fully<00:01:32.890> supported<00:01:33.460> in

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
okay so the frame is fully supported in

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.440 
okay so the frame is fully supported in
the<00:01:33.640> software<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:36.009> gives<00:01:36.219> us<00:01:36.369> a<00:01:36.520> job<00:01:36.969> volume<00:01:37.329> of

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
the software it gives us a job volume of

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.149 
the software it gives us a job volume of
twenty<00:01:37.840> point<00:01:38.049> three<00:01:38.289> milliliters<00:01:38.619> between

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
twenty point three milliliters between

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.649 
twenty point three milliliters between
point<00:01:39.369> six<00:01:39.549> milliliters<00:01:39.820> and<00:01:40.270> an<00:01:40.450> approximate

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
point six milliliters and an approximate

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.990 
point six milliliters and an approximate
time<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:41.049> two<00:01:41.409> hours<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:41.950> 53<00:01:42.189> minutes<00:01:42.369> so<00:01:42.969> now

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
time of two hours and 53 minutes so now

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.800 
time of two hours and 53 minutes so now
we're<00:01:43.179> going<00:01:43.270> to<00:01:43.329> go<00:01:43.420> over<00:01:43.539> to<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.659> printer

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
we're going to go over to the printer

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.719 
we're going to go over to the printer
put<00:01:44.049> some<00:01:44.200> more<00:01:44.319> resin<00:01:44.679> in<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:44.979> I'll<00:01:45.520> show<00:01:45.579> you

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
put some more resin in and I'll show you

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.570 
put some more resin in and I'll show you
the<00:01:45.880> transfer<00:01:46.210> process

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.490 

usually<00:01:52.150> like<00:01:52.300> the<00:01:52.450> top<00:01:52.630> off<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:53.020> resin<00:01:53.320> tray

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
usually like the top off the resin tray

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.590 
usually like the top off the resin tray
before<00:01:53.650> each<00:01:54.330> build

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.360 

now<00:02:00.080> that<00:02:00.230> the<00:02:00.290> resin<00:02:00.560> trees<00:02:00.770> all<00:02:00.920> topped<00:02:01.160> off

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
now that the resin trees all topped off

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.740 
now that the resin trees all topped off
I'm<00:02:01.580> gonna<00:02:01.700> go<00:02:01.850> ahead<00:02:01.940> and<00:02:02.030> send<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.390> file<00:02:02.570> to

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
I'm gonna go ahead and send the file to

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:14.280 
I'm gonna go ahead and send the file to
the<00:02:02.840> printer<00:02:03.610> so<00:02:04.610> I'm<00:02:04.670> gonna<00:02:04.790> form

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:24.200 

you

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:03:26.000 

you

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.040 

so<00:03:27.010> we've<00:03:27.130> gotten<00:03:27.460> the<00:03:27.580> part<00:03:27.820> of<00:03:28.000> all<00:03:28.300> dry<00:03:28.660> and

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
so we've gotten the part of all dry and

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.140 
so we've gotten the part of all dry and
now<00:03:30.040> we're<00:03:30.220> going<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:30.460> remove<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:30.940> from<00:03:31.030> the

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
now we're going to remove it from the

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.320 
now we're going to remove it from the
supports<00:03:31.570> and<00:03:31.870> they<00:03:32.170> just<00:03:32.350> break<00:03:32.620> off<00:03:33.270> kind<00:03:34.270> of

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
supports and they just break off kind of

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.880 
supports and they just break off kind of
sound<00:03:34.510> like<00:03:34.570> velcro<00:03:34.900> actually<00:03:35.470> you<00:03:35.590> can<00:03:35.740> hear

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
sound like velcro actually you can hear

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.209 
sound like velcro actually you can hear
them<00:03:36.010> just<00:03:38.850> a<00:03:39.850> break

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:42.219 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:44.649 

so<00:03:43.219> the<00:03:43.340> supports<00:03:43.730> leave<00:03:43.909> these<00:03:44.090> little<00:03:44.269> nubs

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
so the supports leave these little nubs

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.140 
so the supports leave these little nubs
and<00:03:45.530> what<00:03:45.769> you're<00:03:45.890> going<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.040> want<00:03:46.189> to<00:03:46.310> do<00:03:46.489> or

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
what I usually do is just take some wet

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.610 
what I usually do is just take some wet
