00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.990
 hello how I hope you are pretty 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.460
 well this time I'm going to teach you to 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.679
 make a gift that may well 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.200
 use it to win on February 14 or 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.629
 for father's day 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.170
 The materials that we will need are 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.170
 the following 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.430
 sweets of different types in this case 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.870
 I'm going to use chocolate flakes 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.870
 for chocolate dates 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.769
 I'm also going to use some slats 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.769
 to decorate my gift 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.149
 some lunettes 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.470
 colored gummies 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.670
 chocolate with mint 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.860
 and finally a bottle of glass that 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.840
 You can buy it in those stores where 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.790
 everything costs 15 pesos 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.340
 we started then introducing 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.100
 our sweets to the bottle for it 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.780
 we're going to need to make a funnel with 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.229
 a white sheet so that it is not bigger 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.229
 help 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.870
 first I'm going to put the leaflets 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.760
 taking care not to introduce too many 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.760
 so that the other sweets fit 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.070
 then I put the lunettes 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.680
 then chocolate with mint 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.640
 and since I see that I will not fit 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.230
 I'm going to put the gummies until the 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.170
 final until filling the bottle 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.650
 in my case as the cover of the 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.790
 bottle covers much of the volume 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.670
 I'm going to leave a space to be able 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.500
 cover it 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.409
 Hey samuel and why do you do it with 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.909
 chopsticks this I do to fill the 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.439
 most of the holes that can 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.439
 be between each of the gummies 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.130
 almost finished introducing the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.130
 gummies 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.590
 and now I will cover the bottle up 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.260
 this point we have roughly 80% 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.140
 finished 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.959
 now as the reason for this video is 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.909
 make it a gift that can be used 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.739
 as much as for valentine's day as 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.769
 for Father's Day we are going to make a 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.980
 small tie for it with a ribbon 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.709
 let's go around the neck of the bottle and 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.660
 let's move the longest part of the 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.880
 ribbon over the smallest part 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.390
 now the longest part we passed through 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.390
 center 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.280
 and we make it to the right side 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.280
 in this way 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.060
 let's pass the bar 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.060
 in the middle again 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.570
 thus 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.379
 and this time we are going to orient him 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.379
 to the left side 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.560
 now holding the short part we're going to 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.830
 move to the long part above 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.760
 our fingers 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.760
 thus 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.750
 making a kind of bridge over 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.750
 our knot 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.010
 the spare part we passed through the 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.010
 middle of the knot 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.820
 and as you can see there is a little bridge 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.640
 what we have done a while ago what is left 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.200
 is to spend the last time the bar for 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.200
 under the bridge that we have created 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.910
 and now it only remains to pull the extremes 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.410
 of the slats 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.410
 to adjust the knot 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.329
 we can play a little pulling each 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.340
 one end 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.879
 until the knot is adjusted to the size that 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.879
 we want 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.889
 since we are satisfied with the knot 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.830
 of our tie we are going to give you the 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:34.190
 finished in tip we all know 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.190
 with scissors 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.160
 depending on how long we want 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.350
 our tie 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.390
 let's cut diagonally 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.900
 until we obtain the form that we 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.900
 we want 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.750
 now yes we would have our tie 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.200
 finished only would be to hit 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:08.470
 the bottle so it does not get up 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:11.080
 now we leave the bottle aside and 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.110
 let's make a little hat that 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.420
 will combine with our bottle 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.460
 then for this and printed in a 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.370
 cardboard the template that I leave 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.550
 attached in the description we cut the 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.230
 rectangle only by around the 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.050
 we are going to cut it for both 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.060
 circumferences and finally the circle 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.560
 right 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.289
 since we have our pieces 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.990
 trimmed 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.999
 let's take the rectangular track and 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.670
 let's fold it along the 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:45.170
 lines that I am pointing out 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.170
 the one below and the one above 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.290
 once we have doubled our 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:54.630
 rectangle let's make some small 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.630
 eyelashes along our folds 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.909
 here I already have my figure cut out with 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.909
 tabs 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:09.670
 and what we are going to do now is 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:13.000
 the little eyelash that we had left in one 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:16.890
 from the ends we are going to fold it by the 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.890
 two sides so that it is well marked 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:22.830
 now what are we going to do with this tab 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:25.320
 it's pretty simple, let's paste 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.850
 the end that has remained unfolded 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.850
 on the tab 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:36.360
 once this is done we are going to double the 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.160
 small tabs inwards but 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.220
 only those at the top of the 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.500
 hat 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:46.910
 since we have done this we take our 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:49.240
 circle and we're going to stick it on our 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.240
 tabs 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.680
 and so we will have the top 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.680
 completed 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:05.940
 now the lashes that I had left over 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:10.490
 I have bent out with the purpose 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.490
 of sticking to the ring that I have left over 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.640
 then I will put glue on my hoop 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:21.460
 enough glue to adhere 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.270
 good to the eyelashes 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.910
 and we carefully introduce it 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.680
 from the top of the hat 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:32.880
 going down slowly 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.880
 so that it does not break 

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:39.210
 we press the tabs so that 

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.449
 adhere to the base and we already have our 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.610
 finished hat 

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:46.699
 As you can see, I changed the 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:49.490
 tie to my bottle so that it looks with 

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:51.409
 more life and I've set a bar 

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.649
 green to my hat 

00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:56.449
 then we put it to the bottle and 

00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:58.129
 we will already have our gifts of the day of 

00:07:56.449 --> 00:07:59.950
 Valentine's Day or Father's Day 

00:07:58.129 --> 00:08:01.810
 finished 

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:03.980
 I am samuel cum I hope that you have 

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.840
 liked this tutorial 

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:08.690

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:13.450

 Bye
