00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.700 
battlefield two back in 2005 for
something<00:00:42.690> like<00:00:42.780> that's<00:00:42.899> almost<00:00:43.320> 10<00:00:43.559> years

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
something like that's almost 10 years

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.160 
something like that's almost 10 years
ago<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.219> back<00:00:44.670> then<00:00:44.879> we<00:00:45.059> already<00:00:45.390> had<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> well

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
ago and back then we already had a well

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.200 
ago and back then we already had a well
a<00:00:46.200> very<00:00:46.590> end<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.039> m40a5<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.879> could<00:00:48.030> say

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
a very end of the m40a5 you could say

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.930 
a very end of the m40a5 you could say
which<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.750> course<00:00:48.960> was<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.379> m24<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.280> guess<00:00:50.640> most

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
which of course was the m24 I guess most

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.549 
which of course was the m24 I guess most
of<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.239> your<00:00:51.420> place<00:00:51.629> would<00:00:51.930> probably<00:00:52.379> note

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
of you in your place would probably note

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.340

from battlefield bad company 2 and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.500 
from battlefield bad company 2 and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
basically those two are kind of the same

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.630 
basically those two are kind of the same
they're<00:00:57.960> not<00:00:58.109> totally<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> same<00:00:58.920> but<00:00:59.550> they're

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
they're not totally the same but they're

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.420

based all on the r700 the m40 ND m24 so
yeah<00:02:38.970> that's<00:02:39.180> one<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.630> things<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.350> do

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
looks and feels and that I've been again

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.780 
looks and feels and that I've been again
using<00:02:51.990> it<00:02:52.110> quite<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.380> lot<00:02:52.590> in<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.740> past<00:02:52.950> one<00:02:53.700> of

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
using it quite a lot in the past one of

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.130 
using it quite a lot in the past one of
the<00:02:53.880> main<00:02:54.030> things<00:02:54.300> of<00:02:54.450> course<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.990> high

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
the main things of course is the high

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.320 
the main things of course is the high
rate<00:02:55.320> of<00:02:55.350> fire<00:02:55.470> of<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.490> m4<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:56.970> probably

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
rate of fire of it the m4 is probably

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.199 
rate of fire of it the m4 is probably
the<00:02:57.510> most<00:02:57.540> skillful<00:02:58.470> rifle<00:02:59.070> especially<00:02:59.640> since

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
the most skillful rifle especially since

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.660 
the most skillful rifle especially since
the<00:03:00.540> muzzle<00:03:00.870> velocity<00:03:01.230> is<00:03:01.410> extremely<00:03:02.190> low<00:03:02.370> it

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
the muzzle velocity is extremely low it

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.540 
the muzzle velocity is extremely low it
clocks<00:03:03.030> in<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.560> 480<00:03:04.560> meters<00:03:04.740> per<00:03:04.950> second<00:03:05.370> if<00:03:05.459> i'm

clocks in a 480 meters per second if i'm
not<00:03:05.640> mistaken<00:03:05.870> so<00:03:06.870> again<00:03:07.380> quite<00:03:08.040> slow<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.580> you

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
not mistaken so again quite slow and you

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.610 
not mistaken so again quite slow and you
have<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.910> come<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.240> sit<00:03:09.330> quite<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.750> bit<00:03:09.959> for<00:03:10.260> all

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
have to come and sit quite a bit for all

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.320 
have to come and sit quite a bit for all
those<00:03:10.860> headshots<00:03:11.130> however<00:03:11.640> if<00:03:11.910> you're<00:03:12.150> good

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
enough if your accuracy is really good

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.130 
enough if your accuracy is really good
you're<00:03:14.400> good<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:14.880> compensating<00:03:15.750> for<00:03:15.870> moving

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
you're good and compensating for moving

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.750 
you're good and compensating for moving
targets<00:03:16.530> for<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.800> bullet<00:03:17.070> drop<00:03:17.220> mode<00:03:17.430> stuff

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
targets for the bullet drop mode stuff

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.240 
targets for the bullet drop mode stuff
then<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.390> can<00:03:18.660> really<00:03:19.019> make<00:03:19.260> use<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:19.680> 60

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
then you can really make use of that 60

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.160 
then you can really make use of that 60
rounds<00:03:20.550> per<00:03:20.730> minute<00:03:20.850> which<00:03:21.420> is<00:03:21.750> again

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
rounds per minute which is again

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.040 
rounds per minute which is again
basically<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.160> thing<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.580> I<00:03:23.610> do<00:03:23.760> like<00:03:24.330> a<00:03:24.570> lot

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
basically the thing that I do like a lot

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.780 
basically the thing that I do like a lot
because<00:03:25.440> I'm<00:03:25.709> an<00:03:25.920> aggressive<00:03:26.280> recon<00:03:26.430> player

long-range capabilities because you can

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.960 
long-range capabilities because you can
still<00:03:31.290> get<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.650> one<00:03:31.950> hit<00:03:32.160> head<00:03:32.340> shot<00:03:32.580> at<00:03:32.790> all
