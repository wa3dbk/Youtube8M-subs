00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
learned about the shirt was you had to

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.970 
learned about the shirt was you had to
do<00:00:42.059> something<00:00:42.210> quite<00:00:42.510> special<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.080> sure<00:00:43.350> to

do something quite special to it sure to

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.160 
do something quite special to it sure to
make<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.129> finish<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.820> make<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.090> look<00:00:45.239> right<00:00:45.449> and

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
make it finish to make it look right and

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.070 
make it finish to make it look right and
I've<00:00:46.290> noticed<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:48.120> older<00:00:48.420> kids<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.809> cooler

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
I've noticed the older kids the cooler

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.840 
I've noticed the older kids the cooler
kids<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.620> were<00:00:49.710> wearing<00:00:50.070> bench<00:00:50.250> genesis

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
kids that were wearing bench genesis

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.770 
kids that were wearing bench genesis
they<00:00:51.300> do<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.720> to<00:00:51.900> their<00:00:52.050> shirt<00:00:52.290> and<00:00:52.760> I

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
they do this to their shirt and I

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.299 
they do this to their shirt and I
realized<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.989> was<00:00:55.019> very<00:00:55.530> special<00:00:56.190> very

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
realized it was very special very

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:05.899 
realized it was very special very
British<00:00:56.879> thing<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.629> do

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.399 

so<00:01:06.909> I<00:01:06.970> think<00:01:07.060> if<00:01:07.330> this<00:01:07.479> in<00:01:07.870> this<00:01:08.020> one<00:01:08.229> actually

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
so I think if this in this one actually

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.020 
so I think if this in this one actually
represents<00:01:09.159> a<00:01:09.250> very

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
represents a very

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.470 
represents a very
Libre<00:01:11.360> style<00:01:11.660> decision<00:01:12.910> Larry<00:01:13.910> does<00:01:14.150> this<00:01:14.270> by

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
Libre style decision Larry does this by

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.080 
Libre style decision Larry does this by
accident<00:01:14.630> I<00:01:15.080> just<00:01:15.110> fall<00:01:15.560> into<00:01:15.710> place

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
accident I just fall into place

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.359 
accident I just fall into place
so<00:01:17.090> transcends<00:01:17.750> the

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
so transcends the

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.569 
so transcends the

it's fashion enter the realm of pure

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:22.789 
it's fashion enter the realm of pure

modern there's so much meaning and code

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.580 
modern there's so much meaning and code
in<00:01:36.340> this<00:01:36.670> one<00:01:36.850> gesture<00:01:37.179> of<00:01:37.329> buttoning<00:01:37.689> up<00:01:37.840> you

say something more about you than just

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.219
