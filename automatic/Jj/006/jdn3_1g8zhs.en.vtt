00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 what we can learn about it is 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.309
 let me make a few explanations we 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.710
 we say the bible the word of god 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.380
 I'm saying but she's the word of 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.650
 god is infallible and she is errant 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.359
 this does not mean that there was no error of 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.630
 children 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.910
 Pedro wrote his first charge and 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.310
 sent to the churches of the lower asia 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.160
 the churches received from being a letter from the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.960
 apostle pedro man inspired by god 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.820
 here is the word of god makes a 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.100
 copy at the time does not 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.800
 had press then was copy made 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.230
 there they made copies of the letter of 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.600
 and read an original letter 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.250
 of Peter II read in lion how it was made 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.110
 of parchment 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.780
 You know what happens when you use it. 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.809
 long a thing she spends she 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.590
 ends but had copy then passed the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.629
 use copies and make copies of the copy and then 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.210
 make copy print copy 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.250
 so what we do not have anymore 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.989
 the originals that letter that pierced 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.119
 wrote the letter of Paul to the Romans 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.580
 we do not have any more originals that are 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.150
 called autographs but we have 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.850
 copies dating from the second century of 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.729
 third century 4th century we have at 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.700
 five thousand copies of the new 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.240
 testament and thousands of other 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.939
 copies of the Old Testament do not exist 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.009
 no other book that has so many 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.890
 you will speak for example of 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.960
 aristotle and platoon is not this 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.820
 Do you know how many copies you have of the works? 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.380
 of him and who are neither of him anymore 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.180
 reproduced in other 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.579
 sometimes it does not have ten twelve old copies 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.890
 those who do not have 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.869
 it people are so pulls more 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.759
 Bible was copied and I do not know if you 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.680
 to use the same criteria as some 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.299
 Atheists want to use it to discredit 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.090
 bible you will not believe that 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.299
 Aristotle existed that Plato existed 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.880
 is that Galileo existed that the mere existed 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.969
 because the Bible is the best book 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.179
 of the world in terms of quantity of 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.550
 competitors that we only have already 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.530
 Turn the cordless phone into a joke. 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.420
 Do you have a queue of people? 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.940
 You say to the first pastor 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.650
 augusto josÃ© ugly and if you have to go 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.319
 this to someone else happy like this 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.530
 the reverend augustus is ugly already changed right? 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.959
 is no longer part of the reverend john f 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.390
 You pass by others like that. 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.790
 Look, I saw that the Reverend Augustus is 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.580
 ugly but the pastor is worse 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.319
 There you will understand when you get there. 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.180
 last person already did the joke 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.480
 is happening when it comes to the last 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.360
 person compared with the first was 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.390
 there was change then it is 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.290
 natural that in the process of copying a 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.930
 scribe he changed a letter he changed 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.690
 a word by a synonym instead of 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.170
 say jesus christ said christ jesus 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.120
 and anyone who has ever made copies knows 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.810
 happens sometimes they copy the same line 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.760
 twice you jump line and when you 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.620
 do not know the language you are 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:18.209
 copying worse because he imagines a monk there 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:21.090
 Lithuania from anywhere in the world 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.130
 where he did not speak Greek and was part 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.200
 his work copy in the monasteries 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.110
 copy snippets from the bible 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.090
 there naturally he did not know Greek 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.620
 but he left the piano and copying would 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.630
 make a mistake that did not realize that 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.290
 because he does not even know the language. 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.390
 huh 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.549
 then in these copies we have of 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.500
 bible you will find us copy 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:45.269
 but because it has so many manuscripts like this 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.630
 scholars who are called 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:52.440
 Manuscript is soon the low criticism 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:55.470
 they compare the manuscripts and then we 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:00.120
 we can be sure almost absolute 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:03.000
 95% of the original text and the 5% that 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.880
 people have doubts pose no threat 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.799
 none is a word change and it is a 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.200
 The word that is missing does not threaten 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.359
 no major bible doctrine 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.250
 nothing nothing nothing nothing 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.410
 so when you hear this argument 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.049
 it 's no more paper, it's all you answer 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.500
 including the true role fits all 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.510
 including the truth then you have the 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.490
 copies and this 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.140
 high calling discipline criticizes the 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.810
 manuscript praises discipline 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.630
 she gives us 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.080
 some feel that it reaches 98 percent of 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.350
 certainty of what the original text was and 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:44.640
 that those who are lacking in 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.830
 The verification does not affect our 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.420
 the main doctrines of scripture 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.890
 then even more in competition when 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.170
 that the Bible is true I'm not 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.790
 saying that there was no error in the back 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.670
 What I'm saying is that god in your 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.820
 mercy preserved its truth 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.260
 through many copies and through the study 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.470
 we can make the 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.470
 recovery
