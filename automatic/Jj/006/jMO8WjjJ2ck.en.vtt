00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
fishing is around 300 and I probably

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.769 
fishing is around 300 and I probably
recommend<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.400> being<00:00:29.670> higher<00:00:30.179> than<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.599> if

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
recommend it being higher than that if

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.510 
recommend it being higher than that if
you<00:00:30.869> got<00:00:31.019> maxed<00:00:31.439> out<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.800> fishing<00:00:32.040> well

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
you got maxed out and fishing well

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.069 
you got maxed out and fishing well
that's<00:00:32.820> great<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.570> won't<00:00:33.750> have<00:00:33.899> any

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
that's great and you won't have any

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:34.729 
that's great and you won't have any
problems

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
problems

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.990 
problems
my<00:00:35.640> efficient<00:00:36.180> level<00:00:36.390> at<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.540> muck<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:37.260> good

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
my efficient level at the muck is good

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.630

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
okay so let's get started so I talked

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.429 
okay so let's get started so I talked

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
previously about having higher fishing

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.899 
previously about having higher fishing
and<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:32.329> want<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.390> suggest<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.259> get<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.560> rod

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
and I want to suggest you get the rod

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.840 
and I want to suggest you get the rod
that<00:01:36.170> you<00:01:37.170> get<00:01:37.380> by<00:01:37.560> doing<00:01:37.619> an<00:01:37.950> early<00:01:38.100> quest<00:01:38.579> I

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
that you get by doing an early quest I

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.760 
that you get by doing an early quest I
think<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:39.180> around<00:01:39.329> level<00:01:39.630> twenty<00:01:40.110> or<00:01:40.259> thirty

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.590 

some<00:01:43.770> reason<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.220> can't<00:01:44.460> find<00:01:44.549> one<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.090> did<00:01:45.360> have

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
some reason I can't find one I did have

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.200 
some reason I can't find one I did have
it<00:01:45.630> or<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.409> think<00:01:47.369> I've<00:01:47.670> got<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.030> different

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
it or I think I've got it on a different

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.590 
it or I think I've got it on a different
character<00:01:48.479> that's<00:01:49.170> probably<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.790> went

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
character that's probably it so I went

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.789 
character that's probably it so I went
to<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.840> auction<00:01:51.960> house<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.560> bought<00:01:52.619> this

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
to the auction house and bought this

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.679 
to the auction house and bought this
strong<00:01:53.189> fishing<00:01:53.640> pole<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:54.060> better<00:01:54.299> than<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
strong fishing pole it's better than the

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.819 
strong fishing pole it's better than the
normal<00:01:55.170> one<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.040> go<00:01:56.159> increase<00:01:56.520> fishing<00:01:57.000> so

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
normal one is to go increase fishing so

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.370 
normal one is to go increase fishing so
that's<00:01:58.829> always<00:01:58.979> helpful<00:02:00.200> okay

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
that's always helpful okay

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.750 
that's always helpful okay
