00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
campaign this is a actually the very

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.769 
campaign this is a actually the very
first<00:00:28.740> one<00:00:29.090> takes<00:00:30.090> place<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.540> first

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
first one takes place in the first

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.620 
first one takes place in the first
mission<00:00:31.110> and<00:00:31.369> it<00:00:32.369> requires<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.090> defeat

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
mission and it requires that you defeat

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.040 
mission and it requires that you defeat
or<00:00:33.990> kill<00:00:34.980> rather<00:00:35.250> all<00:00:36.150> three<00:00:36.450> factories<00:00:36.990> that

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
or kill rather all three factories that

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.470 
or kill rather all three factories that
are<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.770> lab<00:00:38.010> before<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.329> actually

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
are in the lab before you actually

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.560 
are in the lab before you actually
complete<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.050> mission<00:00:40.670> so<00:00:41.670> there<00:00:42.360> isn't

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
complete the mission so there isn't

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.490 
complete the mission so there isn't
really<00:00:42.630> a<00:00:42.780> time<00:00:43.080> limit<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:45.020> so<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.110> can

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
really a time limit on this so you can

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.350 
really a time limit on this so you can
build<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.070> lot<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.580> zerglings<00:00:47.850> if<00:00:48.240> you're

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
build up a lot of zerglings if you're

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.480 
build up a lot of zerglings if you're
having<00:00:48.510> any<00:00:48.660> trouble<00:00:48.810> and<00:00:49.370> therefore<00:00:50.370> it's

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 
having any trouble and therefore it's

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.630 
having any trouble and therefore it's
pretty<00:00:50.700> easy<00:00:51.740> anyway<00:00:52.740> so<00:00:53.010> let's<00:00:53.160> go<00:00:53.430> ahead<00:00:53.460> and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
pretty easy anyway so let's go ahead and

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.850 
pretty easy anyway so let's go ahead and
get<00:00:53.880> started<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:58.050> as<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.350> start<00:00:58.380> the<00:00:58.620> mission

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
get started so as we start the mission

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.620 
get started so as we start the mission
I'm<00:00:59.640> just<00:00:59.820> going<00:00:59.970> to<00:01:00.030> go<00:01:00.150> through<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.450> at<00:01:00.540> two

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
I'm just going to go through it at two

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.650 
I'm just going to go through it at two
hundred<00:01:00.690> percent<00:01:01.200> playback<00:01:01.770> speed<00:01:02.070> because

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
hundred percent playback speed because

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.050 
hundred percent playback speed because
it's<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.960> very<00:01:04.170> basic<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.460> know<00:01:05.580> there

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
it's a very basic and you know there

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.840 
it's a very basic and you know there
isn't<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> lot<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.540> talk<00:01:06.659> about<00:01:06.720> here<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:08.280> you

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
isn't a lot to talk about here so you

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.710 
isn't a lot to talk about here so you
shouldn't<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.150> much<00:01:09.210> trouble<00:01:09.270> with<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
shouldn't have much trouble with the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.609 
shouldn't have much trouble with the
achievement<00:01:10.880> so<00:01:11.880> just<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.960> instructs

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
achievement so just like it instructs

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.950 
achievement so just like it instructs
you<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.740> do<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.310> sort<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.579> the<00:01:14.670> tutorial

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
you to do this is sort of the tutorial

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.450 
you to do this is sort of the tutorial
mission<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.859> have<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.070> build<00:01:17.249> Hatcher

unfortunately in this mission you cannot

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.830 
unfortunately in this mission you cannot
build<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:11.009> second<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.520> tree<00:02:11.790> anywhere<00:02:12.390> because

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
build a second a tree anywhere because

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.550 
build a second a tree anywhere because
it<00:02:13.200> limits<00:02:13.520> where<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:14.640> build<00:02:14.819> things<00:02:15.060> so

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
and you have to just build up d'Orleans

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.660 
and you have to just build up d'Orleans
at<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.290> rate<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.709> one<00:02:20.099> hatchery<00:02:20.459> can

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
at the rate that one hatchery can

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.140 
at the rate that one hatchery can
produce<00:02:20.819> them<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:23.280> that's<00:02:23.430> sort<00:02:24.030> of

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
produce them so that's sort of

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:33.710 
produce them so that's sort of
unfortunate<00:02:29.750> I'm<00:02:30.750> just<00:02:31.200> waiting<00:02:31.709> for<00:02:32.720> more

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
unfortunate I'm just waiting for more

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.309 
unfortunate I'm just waiting for more
stuff<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.560> happen<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:38.250> there<00:02:38.880> we<00:02:39.000> go<00:02:39.230> try<00:02:40.230> to

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
stuff to happen and there we go try to

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:47.390 
stuff to happen and there we go try to
get<00:02:40.440> our<00:02:40.530> zerglings<00:02:40.950> finally<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:43.519> just<00:02:46.400> waiting

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
get our zerglings finally I just waiting

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.170 
get our zerglings finally I just waiting
for<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.640> cutscene<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:50.030> unfortunately<00:02:51.030> is

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
for the cutscene and unfortunately is

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.820 
for the cutscene and unfortunately is
one<00:02:51.569> of<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.720> early<00:02:51.959> missions<00:02:52.260> before<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.709> get

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
one of the early missions before you get

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.280 
one of the early missions before you get
access<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.580> select<00:02:54.060> all<00:02:54.269> command<00:02:54.540> for

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
access to the select all command for

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.370 
access to the select all command for
your<00:02:55.380> army<00:02:55.850> so<00:02:56.959> probably<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.049> most<00:02:58.170> annoying

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
your army so probably the most annoying

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.160 
your army so probably the most annoying
thing<00:02:58.650> about<00:02:58.680> this<00:02:58.980> mission<00:02:59.190> is<00:03:00.170> continuously

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
thing about this mission is continuously

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.870 
thing about this mission is continuously
selecting<00:03:01.769> all<00:03:02.670> your<00:03:02.880> units<00:03:04.700> but<00:03:05.700> otherwise

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
selecting all your units but otherwise

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.289 
selecting all your units but otherwise
as<00:03:06.209> long<00:03:06.420> as<00:03:06.569> you<00:03:06.690> continuously<00:03:07.530> produce<00:03:08.299> as

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
as long as you continuously produce as

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.930 
as long as you continuously produce as
many<00:03:09.540> zergling<00:03:10.019> as<00:03:10.200> you<00:03:10.349> have<00:03:10.530> larva<00:03:11.010> again

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
many zergling as you have larva again

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.020 
many zergling as you have larva again
except<00:03:12.239> for<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.420> overlords<00:03:13.190> then<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.760> should

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
except for the overlords then you should

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.580 
except for the overlords then you should
have<00:03:15.060> an<00:03:15.269> observer<00:03:15.569> lanes<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.930> really<00:03:16.200> just<00:03:16.410> go

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
have an observer lanes to really just go

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.289 
have an observer lanes to really just go
through<00:03:16.769> everything<00:03:17.099> that<00:03:17.370> is<00:03:17.790> presented<00:03:18.269> to

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
through everything that is presented to

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:26.390 
through everything that is presented to
you<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:19.170> just<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:20.780> attack<00:03:21.780> move<00:03:25.070> try<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.130> use

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
you and just a attack move try to use

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.180 
you and just a attack move try to use
the<00:03:26.700> hatcheries<00:03:27.410> Waypoint<00:03:28.410> on<00:03:28.620> one<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.130> your

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
the hatcheries Waypoint on one of your

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.660 
the hatcheries Waypoint on one of your
zerglings<00:03:29.700> just<00:03:30.030> randomly<00:03:30.510> pick<00:03:31.019> one<00:03:31.049> and

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
zerglings just randomly pick one and

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.890 
zerglings just randomly pick one and
check<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.760> every<00:03:32.940> once<00:03:33.090> in<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.299> while<00:03:33.450> I<00:03:33.750> just

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
check it every once in a while I just

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.979 
check it every once in a while I just
hotkey<00:03:34.500> minor<00:03:34.709> hatchery<00:03:35.100> 24<00:03:36.140> and<00:03:38.209> my<00:03:39.209> units<00:03:39.660> to

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
hotkey minor hatchery 24 and my units to

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.130 
hotkey minor hatchery 24 and my units to
one<00:03:40.350> or<00:03:40.500> two<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:41.209> so<00:03:42.209> every<00:03:42.420> time<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.720> hit<00:03:42.810> for

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
one or two and so every time you hit for

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.400 
one or two and so every time you hit for
to<00:03:43.380> rebuild<00:03:43.799> from<00:03:44.430> your<00:03:44.640> larva<00:03:45.030> spam<00:03:46.019> your<00:03:46.200> s

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
to rebuild from your larva spam your s

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.199 
to rebuild from your larva spam your s
is<00:03:46.620> easy<00:03:47.420> you<00:03:48.530> can<00:03:49.530> also<00:03:49.650> see<00:03:49.950> if<00:03:50.069> the<00:03:50.310> way

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
is easy you can also see if the way

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.910 
is easy you can also see if the way
point<00:03:51.569> is<00:03:51.840> still<00:03:52.139> on<00:03:52.350> when<00:03:52.560> your<00:03:52.739> reserve

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
point is still on when your reserve

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.160 
point is still on when your reserve
lanes<00:03:53.069> in<00:03:53.250> your<00:03:53.340> pack<00:03:53.549> if<00:03:53.819> not<00:03:54.720> obviously

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
lanes in your pack if not obviously

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.840 
lanes in your pack if not obviously
means<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.650> one<00:03:55.799> that<00:03:55.950> you<00:03:56.040> selected<00:03:56.430> got

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
means the one that you selected got

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.180 
means the one that you selected got
killed<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:57.630> that<00:03:58.530> will<00:03:58.650> happen<00:03:58.799> a<00:03:58.950> few<00:03:59.010> times

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
killed and that will happen a few times

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.789 
killed and that will happen a few times
but<00:03:59.670> otherwise<00:04:00.480> this<00:04:00.930> will<00:04:01.139> allow<00:04:01.650> you<00:04:01.709> to

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
but otherwise this will allow you to

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.330 
but otherwise this will allow you to
keep<00:04:01.950> reserve<00:04:02.280> lanes<00:04:02.459> with<00:04:03.359> you<00:04:04.340> and

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
keep reserve lanes with you and

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.590 
keep reserve lanes with you and
obviously<00:04:05.579> you<00:04:05.819> want<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.030> kill<00:04:06.209> off<00:04:06.359> all<00:04:06.600> the

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
obviously you want to kill off all the

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.150 
obviously you want to kill off all the
little<00:04:09.600> release<00:04:09.900> valve<00:04:10.200> things<00:04:10.560> so<00:04:10.829> you<00:04:10.889> get

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
little release valve things so you get

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.190 
little release valve things so you get
extra<00:04:11.459> zerglings<00:04:12.000> without<00:04:12.600> having<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:13.019> build

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
extra zerglings without having to build

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.670 
extra zerglings without having to build
them<00:04:13.440> wait<00:04:13.799> for<00:04:13.980> them<00:04:14.100> from<00:04:14.220> your<00:04:14.400> hatchery<00:04:15.680> so

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
them wait for them from your hatchery so

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.650 
them wait for them from your hatchery so
make<00:04:16.859> sure<00:04:16.889> you<00:04:17.070> do<00:04:17.160> that<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.579> then<00:04:18.299> just<00:04:18.479> kill

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
make sure you do that and then just kill

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.160 
make sure you do that and then just kill
everything<00:04:18.900> as<00:04:19.229> you<00:04:19.440> come<00:04:19.769> up<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:19.919> it

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.670 

so<00:04:26.170> the<00:04:26.530> only<00:04:27.750> remotely<00:04:28.750> challenging<00:04:29.440> part<00:04:29.620> of

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
so the only remotely challenging part of

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.990 
so the only remotely challenging part of
this<00:04:29.770> achievement<00:04:30.100> is<00:04:30.490> the<00:04:31.270> very<00:04:31.510> final<00:04:31.990> room

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
this achievement is the very final room

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.940 
this achievement is the very final room
where<00:04:34.000> you<00:04:34.180> have<00:04:34.390> to<00:04:34.600> ensure<00:04:35.050> that<00:04:35.350> you<00:04:35.500> kill

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
where you have to ensure that you kill

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.370 
where you have to ensure that you kill
the<00:04:36.760> two<00:04:37.030> factories<00:04:37.570> before<00:04:38.080> you<00:04:38.230> actually

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
the two factories before you actually

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.650 
the two factories before you actually
kill<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.770> final<00:04:39.370> Eradicator<00:04:40.030> because<00:04:40.480> if<00:04:40.570> you

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
kill the final Eradicator because if you

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.890 
kill the final Eradicator because if you
kelly<00:04:40.840> Eradicator<00:04:41.410> the<00:04:42.130> mission<00:04:42.430> ends<00:04:42.900> so

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
kelly Eradicator the mission ends so

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.360 
kelly Eradicator the mission ends so
make<00:04:44.080> sure<00:04:44.110> you<00:04:44.350> split<00:04:44.650> your<00:04:44.740> zerglings<00:04:45.220> a

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
make sure you split your zerglings a

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.150 
make sure you split your zerglings a
little<00:04:45.580> bit<00:04:45.700> as<00:04:45.910> it<00:04:46.030> in<00:04:46.150> there<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:47.040> focus<00:04:48.040> down

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
little bit as it in there and focus down

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.460 
little bit as it in there and focus down
the<00:04:48.340> factories<00:04:48.760> first<00:04:49.030> there's<00:04:49.900> a<00:04:49.960> bunch<00:04:50.230> left

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
the factories first there's a bunch left

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.830 
the factories first there's a bunch left
behind<00:04:50.830> here<00:04:51.150> and<00:04:52.150> as<00:04:52.330> soon<00:04:52.480> as<00:04:52.600> you<00:04:52.660> kill

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
behind here and as soon as you kill
