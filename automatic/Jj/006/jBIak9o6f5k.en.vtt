00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 what immersed in the nardò and today 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.529
 let's go to carini a moment let's go to 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.900
 watch the pokémon battle that has us 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.849
 unfortunately cirino's mandate is still on xy 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:21.560
 sorry but I haven't finished ras yet 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:24.840
 I know where to regret, however, Zelda school 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.730
 however, too many things are enough together and not 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.130
 I can handle them all together I will have to 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.789
 finish now yes it's true so let's go 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.789
 immediately to see it 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:43.380
 ok the battle starts near ah 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.190
 sebastiano one of the two names to no 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.450
 sebastian is the rino opponent 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.310
 the man and crick composite opening 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.160
 this is a rain dance team 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:57.060
 he had also written in the mail and we have 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.100
 a gard award against an inquisitor then 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.660
 two goblins and one of these has a prankster 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.060
 friendster joker i think we are 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.800
 the one that allows you to have more 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.080
 priority on the shows they don't do 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.350
 income damage 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.210
 but nec mega man click which I adore 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:19.180
 at least in xy because it was out now 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:21.120
 pressed by everything and mega man cards 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.800
 seems that of the opponent a team 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.470
 standard of gisti at least from what 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:31.120
 I see protection from now 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:33.640
 masters to be able to have speed and 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.530
 so what makes a parà system is yes 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.240
 a double focus on mac trick is protected 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.850
 and it is spun because it will be protected 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.200
 protection quite presentable 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.420
 of the pac man and trick to be more 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.970
 fast now probably pressures 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.440
 because the priority probably arrives 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:02:01.229
 lightning in cats face in version 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.229
 does nothing to pay one ok or own 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:11.670
 playful the lunar force by call 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.670
 the wire usually 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.650
 and we have an attack a special attack 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.090
 decreased but it seems to me more a status 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:25.930
 that is, it seems more like a special support 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.910
 which puts the momentum judged it 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.530
 will receive a boost if I'm not mistaken the more 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.739
 I remember those during his abilities 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.370
 however, I assume that there are some protections apart 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:38.140
 poles tod's 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:43.989
 let's see what our plus combines 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:48.090
 they say of the ray and therefore special e 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.090
 the super stuffing is not enough year 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.020
 maybe donate a lot of ambrus 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.320
 navigation to bad shots as of 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.320
 hate 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:06.799
 maybe not maybe I will say it will succeed 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:08.540
 probably to send that one of 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:14.709
 pokemon of the opponent so I think that 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.709
 to a bar I assume at least top secret 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:22.519
 nicolò hydro pump and fails 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.189
 that's why I'm not there I prefer not 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.980
 I'll see her with fa when I can why not 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:30.799
 I never trust that 80 percent no 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.319
 I don't like it at all because I know it 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:38.269
 I always see with lunar force and judged 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.169
 does it today we have toxic rock with leather 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.609
 in st 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:47.449
 for sure that the black things with a 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:58.659
 cloth then made sure a nice tonic and 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:04:02.210
 I guess we see it was there 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:05.680
 but ethnic similar thing 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:08.180
 the situation is not among the best for 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.290
 Ieri lino I do not know if he wins or is lost 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:15.700
 interrupted may be that they do well 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:19.250
 20 in the queue is not very good for example 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:23.180
 means the next round but next 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.630
 believes out thunder-challenged thunder 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.180
 sub-church dances if you don't know it at a 100 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:34.580
 percent chance of continuing 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:36.350
 so it is very strong very powerful can 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.090
 being who wins zain because now i 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.400
 sent that I have two photos of two 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.410
 doors mortally rain but then 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.940
 thunder will no longer receive his 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:50.870
 apprehension infinite salon flame 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:55.490
 but loyal arriving and will be certain title 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.600
 London down to another era yet 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.440
 apolito 2000 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:03.970
 medicated of the assistance to the left 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:09.350
 more risk ok ok ok the risk for 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:11.240
 good ok ok alpine skiing nice protection 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.030
 predict because in my opinion comes a 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.760
 thunder are chosen even if unloaded 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.410
 it would have been very very comfortable on 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:23.560
 this but next three because it would 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:27.800
 caught a super effective double let's see 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.720
 good ok sultan did well in 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.230
 effects because the pair of jeans is not 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.230
 a nice thing 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.479
 she 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:41.810
 oh well it remains a fido share and therefore 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:44.630
 I assume the game ends with that 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:48.530
 stop sicro how much served will not succumb 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:51.220
 finish savory waterfall will receive a bust 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.220
 more abundance 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:06:00.060
 I different but neither creek has no defenses 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:02.820
 very high absorbed which will do much harm 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.740
 because it is dark and tasty and therefore comes 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:09.240
 mandate that I end in battle 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:11.550
 here with one with a fantastic a 0 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.980
 Cirino Battle You Had is a team 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.930
 very good for raindance it works 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.150
 very well in my opinion you could do two 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.760
 changes however it is something 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.310
 of choice is not because the team as it has 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.870
 said it works well for doubles 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.120
 I think you could put a discharge 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.670
 instead of thunder so less 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.670
 hits both enemy pokémon e 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.600
 at least you have a little bit more damage 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.670
 let's say 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.740
 furthermore I think you could remove the 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:41.590
 after a while I put them 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.910
 hydro hot because I don't know the names in 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.100
 Italian are only those in English 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.100
 so you could put on an intro flash 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.550
 aki at least 100 percent 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.850
 work 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.500
 and so you have at least 30 percent of 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.120
 burn your opponent who is not 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.430
 actually hurt if you think about it then 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.830
 maybe you could do it for the rest though 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.600
 all is well is a team very well 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.430
 then built the other to say 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.040
 naturally I remind you that if you want 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.990
 send gameplay a battle 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.290
 pokémon there is a button here for some 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:13.240
 part this here was on xy the video that 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.580
 he did antonio also for now 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.410
 so just do the same identical 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.610
 things because the game hasn't changed 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.740
 practically nothing as far as 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.120
 this concerns this so I would say that for 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.630
 this video is everything and see you at 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.630
 next festival
