00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:11.419
 human beings often feel the desire to elevate them to another 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:12.559
 place 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.019
 and it happens that we do not know how 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.019
 it's like climbing a mountain from which everything would be different 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.859
 it's an internal desire to change something in life 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.069
 what happens 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:24.349
 in the environment 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.390
 and in our state of consciousness 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.390
 some things that I've gone through we do not like 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.630
 or maybe other 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.220
 they should pass 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.220
 and still not achieved 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.060
 how we feel when this occurs 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.220
 If you feel longing to transform some tedh in your life 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.320
 in the way how what being is going 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.830
 the car in could be something very useful on your way from climbing to climbing 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.320
 visualize for a few moments 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.910
 that your alchemy process 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.690
 it's like climbing a mountain 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.420
 sometimes we are confused which on the summit we want to climb 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.100
 and we only know that we want to transform 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.789
 we do not know at times what we will find when starting these processes 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.150
 at times 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.710
 we hear an inner voice that tells us 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.720
 what will be positive what we will find 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.720
 sometimes 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.330
 it has gone up a bit 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.510
 but not enough 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.880
 Maybe he gets discouraged when he's not clear on where to go 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.060
 or found big rocks on the way 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.350
 what we call 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.030
 limiting beliefs 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.320
 that do not allow him to continue 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.890
 and maybe he thinks 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.950
 That is so difficultt 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.080
 I can see mental maps that keep him trapped 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.350
 imprisoned 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.350
 we can think that this climbing is for others 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.160
 and we go into comfort 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.210
 in comfort 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.460
 but there are circumstances that ratify that you have to go to the expansion zone 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.040
 and this implies the declaration of not knowing 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.290
 recognize 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.030
 that there is something to learn 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.030
 and the answer was within ourselves 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.380
 my friend 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.939
 a cobos 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.359
 surely it can accompany 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:12.749
 but keep in mind 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:15.049
 that he does not carry his backpack 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:16.369
 your suitcase 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:19.579
 and will not give you advice either 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:20.999
 this coupe 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:22.859
 it will not indicate the route 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.959
 he does not know them either 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.959
 and it will only ask you questions 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.439
 the route you will travel is very personal 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.939
 making an analogy 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:34.230
 he is not interested 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.569
 if you get to read and school aconcagua 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.669
 nor will suggest the summit 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:42.099
 in the room you will decide 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.349
 the cous 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.210
 He said 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.010
 find your own summit 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.839
 and already feel that it can accompany 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:51.229
 if you do not admit 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:52.669
 you the best 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:55.359
 may question 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.359
 So what's the use of a mattress in mountain climbing? 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:00.979
 only for 

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:03.749
 accompany me on the route 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:06.849
 and friend the cous has some advantage over you 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:08.969
 he can observe 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.379
 something of the mountaineering equipment that you carry 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.799
 you sometimes do not observe it well I have accustomed you to take it 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.809
 and it does not seem important 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:21.269
 the cous 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.689
 It inspires you to dig inside your backpack or suitcase and there you can find 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:27.679
 extraordinary things 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:30.019
 that will help you climb 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.009
 or also the couch can observe there great weights 

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:37.589
 that you have been carrying and that you have only made it more difficult is to walk 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.529
 only you can 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:44.019
 listen to your luggage and decide what to do with it 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.500
 only you decide until when 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.540
 and where to load the heavy backpack 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.709
 and when it is necessary to get rid of it or to another side 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.559
 It is your own decision 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:58.769
 i 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:03:59.849
 ask yourself 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.099
 how competent are you 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.449
 for taking decisions 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.889
 the cous trust in you and you in him 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.279
 he knows that there will come a time when you will decide what to do with the weight 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:14.189
 of the backpack 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.720
 when I came to those great obstacles that block you the path of 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.370
 ascent 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.340
 and before it is decided to return 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.050
 the cous will induce him to keep the obstacle in a different way 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.870
 and you can ask yourself 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.360
 be like but the big rock that hinder route differently 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:35.919
 indeed 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.559
 and not only that 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:39.660
 sometimes the rock becomes tiny 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.229
 you discover 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.680
 because your mind has created that rock 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.439
 discovers that it impelled him to be 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:47.830
 and what do you want 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.599
 that happens with that obstacle 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:53.599
 or you will also wonder what you have to remove learn 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:56.159
 sabina thing 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:58.110
 maybe all the obstacles 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.029
 they are to learn 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.979
 Car 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.300
 it is a process to design the future 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.689
 it is a process 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:06.960
 enke that mountain day 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.050
 Climb with you 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.300
 but everything depends on the summit that you climb 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.689
 possibly you prefer to go to a river 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.719
 an island and not the summit 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:18.180
 and that is also valid 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.539
 the defiant 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.199
 And pleasant 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.689
 so 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.289
 the cous can also be there 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.309
 in that challenging and enjoyable part 

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:29.409
 remember 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:30.800
 the couch 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.559
 He is not an expert in what you experts 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:34.550
 He too 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.120
 he is a sensitive and daring human being 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.180
 to tell him what he feels 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.180
 without opinions or advice 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.879
 it's like a reflection to look at 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:47.879
 only that this one reflected can penetrate deep inside 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.740
 and you discover 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.930
 that inside you there is much more than you thought 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.639
 and discover how wonderful 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:57.409
 what is inside yourself 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:58.770
 the way 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.569
 to climb the mountain 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.819
 it is not a way up 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:04.869
 it's a path in 

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:06.300
 towards that place 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.300
 everything is possible 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:13.719
 accept it 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.139
 triple-double uu 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:18.379
 consulting symbiosis 

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:21.279
 With
