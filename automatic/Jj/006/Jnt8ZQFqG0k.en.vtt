footwork on your approach shots a
question<00:00:11.810> I<00:00:11.960> get<00:00:12.140> asked<00:00:12.620> a<00:00:12.680> lot<00:00:12.710> on<00:00:13.400> the

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
question I get asked a lot on the

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.170 
question I get asked a lot on the
approach<00:00:14.480> is<00:00:14.780> do<00:00:15.170> I<00:00:15.230> stop<00:00:15.740> to<00:00:16.010> hit<00:00:16.160> the<00:00:16.280> shot<00:00:16.520> or

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
approach is do I stop to hit the shot or

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.270 
approach is do I stop to hit the shot or
do<00:00:17.420> I<00:00:17.450> try<00:00:17.570> to<00:00:17.840> keep<00:00:18.170> moving<00:00:18.680> through<00:00:19.040> the

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:19.280 
do I try to keep moving through the

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.940 
do I try to keep moving through the
approach<00:00:19.640> and<00:00:19.970> the<00:00:20.690> answer<00:00:21.170> is<00:00:21.380> is<00:00:21.680> is

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
approach and the answer is is is

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.940 
approach and the answer is is is
actually<00:00:22.460> it<00:00:22.550> depends<00:00:22.990> based<00:00:23.990> on<00:00:24.289> what<00:00:24.680> type

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
actually it depends based on what type

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.490 
actually it depends based on what type
of<00:00:25.010> all<00:00:25.430> my<00:00:25.670> opponents<00:00:26.000> given<00:00:26.690> me<00:00:26.869> is<00:00:27.080> gonna

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
of all my opponents given me is gonna

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.400 
of all my opponents given me is gonna
dictate<00:00:27.880> whether<00:00:28.880> I<00:00:29.000> stop<00:00:29.420> completely<00:00:29.840> or

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
dictate whether I stop completely or

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.350 
dictate whether I stop completely or
whether<00:00:31.100> I<00:00:31.160> try<00:00:31.460> to<00:00:31.520> move<00:00:31.789> through<00:00:32.119> it<00:00:32.300> a

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
whether I try to move through it a

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.520 
whether I try to move through it a
little<00:00:32.540> more<00:00:32.720> in<00:00:32.840> advance<00:00:33.260> on<00:00:33.590> the<00:00:33.980> net<00:00:34.160> okay

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
little more in advance on the net okay

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.040 
little more in advance on the net okay
for<00:00:36.530> me<00:00:36.850> when<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:37.940> ball<00:00:38.120> sits<00:00:38.540> up<00:00:38.780> a<00:00:38.899> little

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
for me when the ball sits up a little

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.170 
for me when the ball sits up a little
bit<00:00:39.230> higher<00:00:39.500> and<00:00:39.710> I<00:00:39.829> can<00:00:40.010> make<00:00:40.280> my<00:00:40.550> point<00:00:41.060> of

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
bit higher and I can make my point of

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.470 
bit higher and I can make my point of
contact<00:00:41.810> closer<00:00:42.590> to<00:00:42.829> my<00:00:42.950> shoulder<00:00:43.460> is<00:00:43.640> a<00:00:44.090> time

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
contact closer to my shoulder is a time

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.530 
contact closer to my shoulder is a time
where<00:00:44.660> I'm<00:00:44.750> gonna<00:00:44.840> actually<00:00:45.320> stop<00:00:45.680> completely

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
where I'm gonna actually stop completely

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.990 
where I'm gonna actually stop completely
really<00:00:47.540> load<00:00:47.840> my<00:00:48.140> legs<00:00:48.440> and<00:00:48.860> hit<00:00:49.640> a<00:00:49.670> very

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
really load my legs and hit a very

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.560 
really load my legs and hit a very
aggressive<00:00:50.870> shot<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:52.280> I've<00:00:53.000> always<00:00:53.329> felt

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
aggressive shot and so I've always felt

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.150 
aggressive shot and so I've always felt
like<00:00:53.809> it<00:00:53.989> was<00:00:54.110> okay<00:00:54.230> to<00:00:54.500> stay<00:00:54.860> a<00:00:54.890> little

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
like it was okay to stay a little

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.209 
like it was okay to stay a little
farther<00:00:55.640> back<00:00:55.790> and<00:00:56.329> stop<00:00:56.750> completely<00:00:57.410> because

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
farther back and stop completely because

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.639 
farther back and stop completely because
the<00:00:58.370> shot<00:00:58.610> I'm<00:00:58.790> gonna<00:00:58.940> produce<00:00:59.180> is<00:00:59.750> a<00:01:00.290> much

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
the shot I'm gonna produce is a much

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.380 
the shot I'm gonna produce is a much
bigger<00:01:00.920> more<00:01:01.309> aggressive<00:01:01.820> ball<00:01:02.030> and

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
bigger more aggressive ball and

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.629 
bigger more aggressive ball and
hopefully<00:01:02.960> puts<00:01:03.469> my<00:01:03.620> opponent<00:01:04.189> in<00:01:04.339> a<00:01:04.459> bad

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:04.639 
hopefully puts my opponent in a bad

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:07.389 
hopefully puts my opponent in a bad
position<00:01:04.899> so<00:01:05.899> now<00:01:06.139> even<00:01:06.499> though<00:01:06.770> I<00:01:06.799> have<00:01:07.100> more

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
position so now even though I have more

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.080 
position so now even though I have more
distance<00:01:07.999> to<00:01:08.240> run<00:01:08.479> up<00:01:08.719> off<00:01:08.929> my<00:01:09.170> approach<00:01:09.560> I'm

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
distance to run up off my approach I'm

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.730 
distance to run up off my approach I'm
expecting<00:01:11.090> a<00:01:11.149> little<00:01:11.389> weaker<00:01:11.780> ball<00:01:11.990> coming

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
expecting a little weaker ball coming

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.519 
expecting a little weaker ball coming
back<00:01:13.030> okay<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:14.179> then<00:01:14.689> I've<00:01:14.869> always<00:01:15.049> felt<00:01:15.380> like

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:15.529 
back okay and then I've always felt like

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:17.230 
back okay and then I've always felt like
when<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.889> ball<00:01:16.039> is<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.219> little<00:01:16.249> bit<00:01:16.579> lower<00:01:16.939> on

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
when the ball is a little bit lower on

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.840 
when the ball is a little bit lower on
my<00:01:17.420> approach<00:01:17.859> that's<00:01:18.859> a<00:01:19.100> shot<00:01:19.340> I've<00:01:19.490> wanted<00:01:19.789> to

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
my approach that's a shot I've wanted to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.449 
my approach that's a shot I've wanted to
carry<00:01:20.240> my<00:01:20.479> momentum<00:01:20.779> through<00:01:21.289> because<00:01:22.189> if<00:01:22.340> I

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:22.459 
carry my momentum through because if I

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:24.550 
carry my momentum through because if I
try<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:22.909> get<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:23.299> the<00:01:23.569> low<00:01:23.779> one<00:01:24.049> and<00:01:24.079> stop

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
try to get to the low one and stop

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.039 
try to get to the low one and stop
completely<00:01:25.130> there's<00:01:26.029> a<00:01:26.119> chance<00:01:26.479> I<00:01:26.659> just<00:01:26.689> end

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
completely there's a chance I just end

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.899 
completely there's a chance I just end
up<00:01:27.170> reaching<00:01:27.499> a<00:01:27.829> little<00:01:27.950> bit<00:01:28.219> too<00:01:28.429> far<00:01:28.700> and

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
up reaching a little bit too far and

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.719 
up reaching a little bit too far and
popping<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:29.599> ball<00:01:29.749> up<00:01:30.340> which<00:01:31.340> we<00:01:31.549> know

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
popping the ball up which we know

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.730 
popping the ball up which we know
doesn't<00:01:31.999> leave<00:01:32.389> us<00:01:32.569> in<00:01:32.779> a<00:01:32.869> good<00:01:33.049> position<00:01:33.109> for

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
doesn't leave us in a good position for

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.039 
doesn't leave us in a good position for
that<00:01:33.859> first<00:01:34.130> volley<00:01:34.509> okay<00:01:35.509> so<00:01:35.569> what<00:01:35.840> I'm<00:01:35.929> gonna

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
that first volley okay so what I'm gonna

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.830 
that first volley okay so what I'm gonna
demonstrate<00:01:36.289> today<00:01:36.829> is<00:01:37.279> a<00:01:38.240> couple<00:01:38.689> different

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
demonstrate today is a couple different

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.620 
demonstrate today is a couple different
approach<00:01:39.289> shots<00:01:39.560> one<00:01:40.039> where<00:01:40.819> it<00:01:40.909> sits<00:01:41.179> up<00:01:41.420> and

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
approach shots one where it sits up and

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.499 
approach shots one where it sits up and
another<00:01:42.469> where<00:01:42.679> it<00:01:42.799> sits<00:01:43.099> low<00:01:43.399> and<00:01:43.729> you<00:01:44.329> guys

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
another where it sits low and you guys

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.010 
another where it sits low and you guys
can<00:01:44.749> watch<00:01:44.990> how<00:01:45.319> my<00:01:45.529> feet<00:01:45.859> react<00:01:46.869> something<00:01:47.869> to

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
can watch how my feet react something to

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.659 
can watch how my feet react something to
tie<00:01:48.200> in<00:01:48.439> to<00:01:48.619> this<00:01:48.740> that's<00:01:49.009> very<00:01:49.099> very

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:49.669 
tie in to this that's very very

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:53.169 
tie in to this that's very very
important<00:01:50.209> is<00:01:50.359> how<00:01:51.079> early<00:01:51.469> I<00:01:51.950> judge<00:01:52.490> whether

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
important is how early I judge whether

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.749 
important is how early I judge whether
the<00:01:53.419> ball<00:01:53.599> sits<00:01:54.020> up<00:01:54.259> or<00:01:54.499> is<00:01:55.159> going<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.399> be<00:01:55.459> down

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
the ball sits up or is going to be down

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.499 
the ball sits up or is going to be down
if<00:01:56.029> we<00:01:56.959> take<00:01:57.229> too<00:01:57.529> long<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:57.829> decide<00:01:58.520> high<00:01:59.450> or

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
if we take too long to decide high or

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.010 
if we take too long to decide high or
