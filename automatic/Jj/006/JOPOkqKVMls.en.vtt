like<00:03:53.220> this<00:03:53.430> product<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.270> give<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.660> eight

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
like this product and give it a eight

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.310 
like this product and give it a eight
out<00:03:55.890> of<00:03:55.920> ten<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.459> would<00:03:56.640> probably<00:03:57.150> give<00:03:57.300> it<00:03:57.510> a<00:03:57.870> 10

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
out of ten I would probably give it a 10

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.550 
out of ten I would probably give it a 10
out<00:03:58.500> of<00:03:58.530> 10<00:03:58.650> if<00:03:59.010> it<00:03:59.940> was<00:04:00.510> really<00:04:00.989> scratch<00:04:01.290> proof

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
out of 10 if it was really scratch proof

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.140
