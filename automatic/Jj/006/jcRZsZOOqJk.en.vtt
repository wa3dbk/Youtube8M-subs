00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.730
 Line out 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.870
 Headphone out 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.420
 Power adapter jack 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.690
 Mike position 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:37.620
 It becomes Of The Nariin 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.620
 Attach the missing headset microphone to my queen 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.690
 Hmm 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.610
 There is audio from the speaker like this when you raise the microphone volume 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.540
 Power Amplifier Oh 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:05.420
 1.9 at nomura We have a large collection of lamps 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:12.970
 Most existing guitars with built-in amps have around 7 watts, but this singer 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.970
 Song guitar answer the power of price as 1.9 watts and a built-in amplifier guitar 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.930
 Line out to pa amp etc 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:26.290
 Play is also available in a large volume if you open 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.290
 The sound from the speaker is muted when using line art 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:36.780
 Play you can without the investment mind around if you use headphones 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.780
 Because the sound is also muted from the speakers, it is also ideal for night practice 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.030
 Use the power adapter when using for a short time 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.720
 To Oguju Allie 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.010
 External sound sources can be connected 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:59.930
 Connect with ipod and play together with your favorite songs 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:04.100
 But it is also possible to play the drug in the bag 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.450
 Singer song machine down xk is working the same scale as regular size 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.850
 I will 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:14.480
 What-neck built guitar to many things, such as the guitar of toys that were scaled down in the name 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.580
 Tuning There were many unstable pitch 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.569
 Singer live this guitar 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.980
 Villa size xk 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:25.190
 In addition, it will be possible to obtain the best performance when you stretch the acoustic string 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:32.290
 It has been fitted with a tension bar 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:32.290
 I am thinking that it will stabilize the drawdown and tuning which does not change with usual by this 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.690
 p mother said 1 full range double cone is adopted 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:44.500

 The installation position of the speaker is located away from the source 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.110
 this is 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:53.030
 There is a speaker near or under illusion of vision and hand over the speakers in the range of play 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.220
 I will come and go 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.220
 Oh Fu'a hands above N speak 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:06.700
 It becomes a sound like this often and it becomes an unpleasant sound 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:11.650
 The speaker is in this position for this reason 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.920
 Hurry up and try playing with an ipod and bad rhythms and simple rhythms 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.920

 Then, as an extra, sing the guitar electric string and output it from the guitar amplifier 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.750

 It is possible to play
