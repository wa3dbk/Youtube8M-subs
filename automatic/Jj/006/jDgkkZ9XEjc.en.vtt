thousand rpms and that peak torque has
been<00:01:32.750> increased<00:01:33.170> as<00:01:33.349> well<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:34.369> this<00:01:34.520> machine

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
been increased as well so this machine

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.430 
been increased as well so this machine
is<00:01:35.000> going<00:01:35.179> to<00:01:35.270> perform<00:01:35.630> better<00:01:35.929> in<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.229> dirt

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
is going to perform better in the dirt

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.740 
is going to perform better in the dirt
than<00:01:36.800> its<00:01:36.950> predecessor<00:01:37.610> it's<00:01:38.149> also<00:01:38.450> going<00:01:38.690> to

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
than its predecessor it's also going to

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.790 
than its predecessor it's also going to
be<00:01:38.869> able<00:01:38.959> to<00:01:39.080> do<00:01:39.319> that

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
be able to do that

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.699 
be able to do that
biron<00:01:40.759> and<00:01:41.090> at<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.630> same<00:01:41.840> time<00:01:42.110> reduce<00:01:42.530> your

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:42.709 
biron and at the same time reduce your

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:45.880 
biron and at the same time reduce your
fuel<00:01:42.979> consumption<00:01:43.429> by<00:01:43.700> as<00:01:43.819> much<00:01:44.030> as<00:01:44.209> 5%<00:01:44.890> so

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
fuel consumption by as much as 5% so

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.400 
fuel consumption by as much as 5% so
increased<00:01:46.670> productivity<00:01:47.179> reduce<00:01:48.110> fuel

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
increased productivity reduce fuel

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.199 
increased productivity reduce fuel
consumption<00:01:48.800> that's<00:01:49.099> a<00:01:49.340> great<00:01:49.610> combination

00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:50.209 
consumption that's a great combination

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:54.090 
consumption that's a great combination
for<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.420> customer
