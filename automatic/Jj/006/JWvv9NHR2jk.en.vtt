more<00:02:25.640> retro<00:02:26.360> than<00:02:26.540> hitting<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.350> bat<00:02:27.710> and

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
more retro than hitting the bat and

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.510 
more retro than hitting the bat and
backwards<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:29.660> forwards<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:31.100> ball<00:02:31.280> rather

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
backwards and forwards the ball rather

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.630 
backwards and forwards the ball rather
between<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.480> bats<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:32.930> that's<00:02:33.920> pretty<00:02:34.340> much

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
between the bats and that's pretty much

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.410 
between the bats and that's pretty much
it<00:02:35.330> for<00:02:35.660> about<00:02:36.230> sixty<00:02:36.650> P<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:38.030> that's<00:02:38.210> it
