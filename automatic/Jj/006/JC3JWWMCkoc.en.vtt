00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 then you did not want but the end you go 

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.230
 I didn't want with all of myself though 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.639
 unfortunately philippe does not have it in the end 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.559
 accepted our economic offer e 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.150
 so unfortunately I will be forced to 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.490
 follow it myself an economic offer 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.520
 important but it's been a while since 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.100
 courts the sea ​​is from November that 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.529
 however we offered him this 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.439
 three-year contract here in Verona with 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.890
 a very high figure for any 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.710
 so he is an Italian coach 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.290
 anyway after months that he thought of 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.600
 precisely this contract has 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.340
 decided to make a life choice of 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.300
 remain close to the family anyway 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.219
 in France 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.410
 and this experience that is about to begin 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.850
 as you see it, you are there for a while 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.379
 imagined 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.230
 well yes also because we a 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.940
 therefore we have already been there 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.489
 expect to go there also for 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.440
 however, organize ourselves with accommodation in 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.300
 sense that we should rent one 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.629
 flat 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.860
 then later after barcelona however also 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.350
 filippo will know if he will also come to 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.159
 narbonne therefore will be a little clearer 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.799
 all the details 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.080
 if filippo does not reach him 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.509
 As well, this could weigh 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.590
 surely it would weigh a little bit though 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.450
 I am convinced about my swimming project 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.939
 then 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.369
 andrea is still alone after the 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:32.119
 Olympics at a psychological level as you are 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.460
 was on a psychological level well in the 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.280
 sense beyond disappointment for the 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.700
 result and sincerely I have been 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.179
 was well trying anyway to do 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.079
 pass this year a little softer always 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:48.979
 with the determination to think about 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:52.100
 redemption in the coming years 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.009
 the goal closest to the goal the most 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.289
 nearby will be the absolute of 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.420
 in April where I will try a little in 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.159
 back I will do some 100 200 back then 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.689
 we'll see what happens 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.880
 I also asked filippo he told me 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.709
 that you can't tell me what you do to san 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.660
 valentino who organizes he asked 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:09.890
 I didn't even know him from him 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.250
 I knew he said he already has us already 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.430
 thought of who is the most romantic of you 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.430
 two 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.760
 then his answer was correct in 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.760
 good luck
