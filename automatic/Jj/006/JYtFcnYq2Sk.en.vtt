have three motion sensors we have a
microphone<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.650> think<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.099> back<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.400> front

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.040 
microphone I think the back and front
camera<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.000> going<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.210> be<00:00:30.269> really<00:00:30.480> interesting

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
camera is going to be really interesting

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.749 
camera is going to be really interesting
and<00:00:31.679> there's<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> lot<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.070> cool<00:00:32.309> stuff<00:00:32.340> you

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
could do with it I am particularly when

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.650 
could do with it I am particularly when
it<00:00:34.590> comes<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.950> augmented<00:00:35.520> reality<00:00:36.090> actually

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
it comes to augmented reality actually

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.720 
it comes to augmented reality actually
you're<00:00:36.930> looking<00:00:37.320> at<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.620> screen<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.399> can<00:00:38.520> see

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
you're looking at the screen you can see

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.400 
you're looking at the screen you can see
through<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.210> screen<00:00:39.540> into<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.140> real<00:00:40.379> world

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
through the screen into the real world

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.920 
through the screen into the real world
and<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.610> can<00:00:41.760> move<00:00:41.940> around<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.540> then<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:42.780> can

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
and you can move around and then we can

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.380 
and you can move around and then we can
lay<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.770> augmented<00:00:44.250> reality<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.820> top<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.210> that

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
lay the augmented reality on top of that

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.779 
lay the augmented reality on top of that
so<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.110> could<00:00:46.350> scan<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.770> your<00:00:46.920> face<00:00:47.160> put

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
so you could scan in your face put

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.270 
so you could scan in your face put
yourself<00:00:48.270> into<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.600> game<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.950> games<00:00:50.190> like

reality fighter that's exactly what
we're<00:00:52.050> doing<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.890> lot<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.100> fun<00:00:53.250> scanning

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
we're doing it's a lot of fun scanning

out of it reattach is really interesting

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.189

on the MGP just blows it away when you
make<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.090> step<00:01:39.420> up<00:01:39.600> from<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.869> standard<00:01:40.380> def

make that step up from like standard def

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.560 
make that step up from like standard def
to<00:01:40.740> high<00:01:40.920> def<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.880> kind<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.150> just<00:01:42.329> got<00:01:42.450> that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
to high def you kind of just got that

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.120 
to high def you kind of just got that
same<00:01:42.810> magic<00:01:43.229> again<00:01:43.530> but<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> handheld

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
same magic again but on a handheld

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.880 

we<00:01:47.600> look<00:01:47.750> at<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:47.960> connectivity<00:01:48.619> of<00:01:48.650> the

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
we look at the connectivity of the

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.859 
we look at the connectivity of the
device<00:01:49.190> and<00:01:49.549> I<00:01:50.240> think<00:01:50.420> that<00:01:50.570> will<00:01:50.690> help

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
device and I think that will help

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.510 
device and I think that will help

broaden the audience make it very

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.880 
broaden the audience make it very
relevant<00:01:52.940> device<00:01:53.390> for<00:01:53.690> people<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:54.530> when<00:01:54.680> you

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
relevant device for people and when you

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.120 
relevant device for people and when you
layer<00:01:55.430> on<00:01:55.460> top<00:01:55.610> of<00:01:55.970> that<00:01:56.090> some<00:01:56.299> of<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.509> bespoke

I<00:02:39.500> think<00:02:40.010> just<00:02:40.069> using<00:02:40.580> that<00:02:40.610> solely<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:41.420> could

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
I think just using that solely you could

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.540 
I think just using that solely you could
do<00:02:41.690> some<00:02:41.900> really<00:02:42.140> cool<00:02:42.440> stuff<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:43.010> work<00:02:43.519> a

little big planet have an extra features
is<00:02:46.400> fantastic<00:02:47.330> because<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:47.900> means<00:02:48.050> then<00:02:48.350> that

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
is fantastic because it means then that

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.430 
is fantastic because it means then that
we<00:02:48.709> can<00:02:48.920> make<00:02:49.100> tools<00:02:49.880> so<00:02:50.720> people<00:02:50.989> can<00:02:51.170> then

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
we can make tools so people can then

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.430 
we can make tools so people can then
create<00:02:51.590> games<00:02:52.250> using<00:02:53.090> those<00:02:53.420> new<00:02:53.750> features<00:02:53.989> be

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
create games using those new features be

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.060 
create games using those new features be
a<00:02:54.470> real<00:02:55.190> torch<00:02:55.459> blunts<00:02:56.000> or<00:02:56.180> tilt<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:57.739> online

a real torch blunts or tilt the online
sides<00:02:58.430> of<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.790> game<00:02:59.000> when<00:02:59.900> you<00:02:59.989> think<00:03:00.200> about

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
sides of the game when you think about

little big planet it's the creation
that's<00:03:02.930> perhaps<00:03:03.140> one<00:03:03.410> of<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.560> most<00:03:03.590> exciting

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
that's perhaps one of the most exciting

parts and have great creation you need
great<00:03:06.650> creation<00:03:07.160> tools<00:03:07.489> so<00:03:08.299> with<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.540> new

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
great creation tools so with the new

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.250 
great creation tools so with the new
user<00:03:09.260> interfaces<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:11.150> creation<00:03:11.720> can<00:03:11.959> become
