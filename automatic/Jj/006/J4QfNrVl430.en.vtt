Unreal<00:01:43.200> Tournament<00:01:43.229> 3<00:01:43.590> anymore<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.280> we<00:01:44.460> don't

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
Unreal Tournament 3 anymore so we don't

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.710 
Unreal Tournament 3 anymore so we don't
really<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:45.000> access<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> lot<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.049> those<00:01:47.720> you

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
really have access to a lot of those you

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.069 
really have access to a lot of those you
know<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:49.110> static<00:01:49.470> meshes<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:51.079> populate

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
know like static meshes that populate

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.359 
know like static meshes that populate
the<00:01:52.200> levels<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:54.320> guys<00:01:55.320> would<00:01:55.560> make<00:01:55.590> props<00:01:56.070> we

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the levels so guys would make props we

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.459 
the levels so guys would make props we
definitely<00:01:56.909> need<00:01:57.210> those<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.140> guess<00:01:58.290> that

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
definitely need those but I guess that

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.460 
definitely need those but I guess that
does<00:01:58.710> sort<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.070> fall<00:01:59.250> into<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.880> environment

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
does sort of fall into the environment

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.670 
does sort of fall into the environment
