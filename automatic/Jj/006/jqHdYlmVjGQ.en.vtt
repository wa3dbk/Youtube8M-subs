California my name is Frederick gospel
and<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.810> drift

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.000 

drifting<00:00:46.610> is<00:00:46.730> all<00:00:46.970> about<00:00:47.329> control<00:00:48.140> it's<00:00:48.440> it's

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
drifting is all about control it's it's

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.920 
drifting is all about control it's it's
controlling<00:00:49.610> a<00:00:49.670> car<00:00:49.940> that's<00:00:50.210> essentially<00:00:50.780> out

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
controlling a car that's essentially out

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.340 
controlling a car that's essentially out
of<00:00:50.960> control<00:00:51.440> you<00:00:52.280> you<00:00:52.579> want<00:00:52.790> to<00:00:52.910> pour<00:00:53.629> into<00:00:53.989> it

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
of control you you want to pour into it

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.830 
of control you you want to pour into it
as<00:00:54.500> much<00:00:54.710> angle<00:00:55.220> as<00:00:55.340> possible<00:00:55.940> you<00:00:56.540> want<00:00:56.720> to<00:00:56.780> go

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
as much angle as possible you want to go

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.049 
as much angle as possible you want to go
as<00:00:56.989> quick<00:00:57.290> as<00:00:57.470> possible<00:00:57.530> as<00:00:58.129> much<00:00:58.370> smoke<00:00:58.670> as

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
as quick as possible as much smoke as

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.880 
as quick as possible as much smoke as
possible<00:00:59.570> and<00:00:59.750> it's<00:00:59.989> it's<00:01:00.350> a<00:01:00.470> show<00:01:02.680> so<00:01:03.680> a<00:01:03.710> lot

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
possible and it's it's a show so a lot

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.890 
possible and it's it's a show so a lot
of<00:01:03.920> people<00:01:04.309> say<00:01:04.580> that<00:01:04.610> there's<00:01:04.970> a<00:01:05.059> lot<00:01:05.300> of<00:01:05.449> egos

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
of people say that there's a lot of egos

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.499 
of people say that there's a lot of egos
in<00:01:05.930> racing<00:01:06.650> and<00:01:06.860> I<00:01:07.850> guess<00:01:08.090> that's<00:01:08.300> true

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
in racing and I guess that's true

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.870 
in racing and I guess that's true
because<00:01:08.930> in<00:01:09.229> order<00:01:09.440> to<00:01:09.619> compete<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:10.580> in<00:01:10.670> order

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
because in order to compete and in order

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.280 
because in order to compete and in order
to<00:01:10.910> win<00:01:11.210> you<00:01:11.270> have<00:01:11.450> to<00:01:11.690> have<00:01:11.780> a<00:01:11.840> very<00:01:12.050> strong

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
to win you have to have a very strong

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.090 
to win you have to have a very strong
drive<00:01:12.680> but<00:01:13.070> I<00:01:13.100> think<00:01:13.490> drifting<00:01:14.330> has<00:01:15.020> a<00:01:15.440> little

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
drive but I think drifting has a little

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.730 
drive but I think drifting has a little
bit<00:01:16.220> more<00:01:16.430> of<00:01:16.550> a<00:01:16.610> friendly<00:01:17.270> vibe<00:01:18.080> going<00:01:18.619> on

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
bit more of a friendly vibe going on

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.400 
bit more of a friendly vibe going on
because<00:01:19.310> it's<00:01:19.490> it's<00:01:19.880> a<00:01:20.060> judge<00:01:20.360> sport<00:01:20.810> it's

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
because it's it's a judge sport it's

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.529 
because it's it's a judge sport it's
kind<00:01:21.770> of<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.070> action<00:01:22.759> sport<00:01:23.060> of<00:01:23.360> racing

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
kind of the action sport of racing

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.529 
kind of the action sport of racing
because<00:01:24.020> people<00:01:24.380> express<00:01:25.039> themselves<00:01:25.729> that

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
because people express themselves that

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:27.820 
because people express themselves that
are<00:01:26.630> their<00:01:26.750> competition<00:01:27.259> cars<00:01:27.470> and<00:01:27.680> through

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
are their competition cars and through

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.499 
are their competition cars and through
their<00:01:28.039> drifting<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:28.580> I<00:01:29.060> think<00:01:29.300> it's

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
their drifting and I think it's

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.930 
their drifting and I think it's
basically<00:01:29.869> a<00:01:30.170> huge<00:01:30.380> family<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.009> I<00:01:31.460> guess<00:01:31.729> it's

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
basically a huge family and I guess it's

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.460 
basically a huge family and I guess it's
it's<00:01:32.180> in<00:01:32.479> the<00:01:32.630> it's<00:01:32.810> in<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:32.960> name

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
it's in the it's in the name

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.560 
it's in the it's in the name
we<00:01:33.680> just<00:01:33.860> rift<00:01:34.130> around<00:01:34.550> and<00:01:34.880> people<00:01:35.420> just

we just rift around and people just

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.540 
we just rift around and people just
accommodate<00:01:36.170> us<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:36.619> we<00:01:37.130> would<00:01:37.280> accommodate

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
accommodate us and we would accommodate

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.290 
accommodate us and we would accommodate
any<00:01:37.910> drifter<00:01:38.300> that<00:01:38.509> comes<00:01:38.660> here<00:01:38.840> -<00:01:40.060> I'm<00:01:41.060> from

dress card so the first thing you want
to<00:02:43.370> accommodate<00:02:43.910> is<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.420> steering<00:02:44.780> handle<00:02:44.900> so

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
to accommodate is the steering handle so

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.589 
to accommodate is the steering handle so
you<00:02:45.860> need<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.160> build<00:02:46.340> much<00:02:47.030> more<00:02:47.300> steering

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
you need to build much more steering

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.780 
you need to build much more steering
angle<00:02:47.959> than<00:02:48.110> what<00:02:48.260> stock<00:02:48.620> that<00:02:49.160> that's<00:02:49.340> that's

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
angle than what stock that that's that's

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.470 
angle than what stock that that's that's
a<00:02:49.910> first

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
a first

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.280 
a first
you<00:02:50.810> also<00:02:50.900> need<00:02:51.200> a<00:02:51.230> limited
