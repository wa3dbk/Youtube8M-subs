00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.509
 So everyone I hope you 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.280
 be well 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.859
 so today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.439
 special tutorial valentine's day and more 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.520
 precisely a watch and go so I love 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.199
 this hairstyle and I find that she is 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.210
 really very suitable for the event 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.269
 with the little loops that gives a 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.590
 romantic side no here I am going to you 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.800
 present how I realized this 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.800
 freshness 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.390
 so we start with the coatch so the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.940
 coatch we will wash our hair with 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.930
 a shampoo so I 'm going 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.280
 separated but the show into several 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.739
 sections to show you how 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.370
 I apply my coach 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.370
 it's pretty simple 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.220
 I started by moistening my hair 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.460
 the principle of kuwait it's going to be 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:02.050
 start drawing your curls knowing 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.730
 that the watch and go will draw your 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.479
 loops finally loops that exists 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.920
 already 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.610
 the loops you already have it's not going 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.680
 you create loops I 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.040
 use the coatch as shining 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.400
 cleans hours of chÃ©mery on coco net and 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.400
 hibiscus 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.290
 so we apply a good amount 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.759
 and you already see that it starts to me 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.340
 draw beautiful curls 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.940
 we're going to make a little young valve and a 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.940
 small bench all 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:51.560
 and I'm going to realize that on all of 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:52.970
 my head then we will advance the coach 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.670
 you do not have to 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.080
 leave very long two three 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.970
 minutes is enough 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.460
 and here you are already seeing that it has 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.289
 started to draw pretty loops 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.560
 finally it was starting to bring out 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.399
 my loops I will start with his 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.140
 parts and my hair in several 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.140
 sections for the continuation of the hairstyle 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.670
 day goes back as if because saadane 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.840
 at the level of the loops and there I go 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.870
 apply castor oil 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.400
 at the level of my roots to avoid 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.400
 to have the scalp too dry 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:39.550
 then I will see my hair change 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:43.570
 to draw my loops and that the 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:47.560
 the cream can accentuate its 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:50.260
 loops and there i will use the curl 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.720
 Thinks and as always chamouille 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.720
 on cocoon notes and hibiscus 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:09.220
 so we apply the cream so 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:12.610
 generous with the fingers because with 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.940
 a comb the curls are less well 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.940
 cartoon 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.580
 so we apply well on the whole 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.580
 length 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.050
 and you can shake a little bit your 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.550
 hair to further draw the 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.550
 loops and to give more volume 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:52.390
 that's what it gives after cream and 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.230
 now we will apply the gel to 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.230
 seal the curls 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.520
 so there is no need for 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.520
 apply too much 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.350
 just enough to seal the loops of 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.350
 the section you are styling 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:25.129
 and so here we do the same thing 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.129
 on the whole debt 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.389
 And here's the result 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.220
 so there do not worry like you 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.780
 can see it we see a little bit the 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.710
 product but once your hair 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.760
 will have dried 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.760
 we will not see anything 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:55.759
 and now let's go for the 

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:55.759
 hairstyle 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.290
 so we'll do a little line on the 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:08.020
 side we will go to the back of the head 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:16.120
 so here we go back to hair 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:19.230
 doing a big twist until 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.230
 middle of the head roughly 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:24.329
 do not worry if it's not ultra 

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:26.429
 I really like hairstyles 

00:05:24.329 --> 00:05:28.349
 with a side a little hairy hairy so 

00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:29.639
 the facs and small locks that 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.249
 go out everywhere I find it 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:35.669
 nice enough and so here now we 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:39.719
 goes to the front of the head and we go 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:41.489
 do a big twist by leaving a 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:43.849
 little bit the hair from the top a little 

00:05:41.489 --> 00:05:43.849
 jester 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:50.210
 and you will bring back the tip of this 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:54.200
 tornado in the middle of the head and 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:56.000
 maintain with a new era it's 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.740
 really fast and I think that 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.580
 go 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:03.520
 hairstyle class ago is enough 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.440
 romantic foundation goes a long way we're going 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.780
 add a small accessory and benny 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.169
 So that's a new boy from 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.169
 my collection 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.890
 for her placed on the head at the level of 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.890
 the stop of the blow been 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:32.240
 and here are the girls a little bit of 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:37.990
 lipstick to make it a little 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.990
 little more sensual and that's the culture 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.189
 so here I hope this hairstyle 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.210
 you will have pleased with the small accessory 

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:48.310
 dream of a mug 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.629
 I make you very big kisses I you 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.629
