00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.556
- Hi, I'm Kevin Nealon
and this is Laugh Lessons,

00:00:02.556 --> 00:00:04.538
where we teach kids the art of comedy,

00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:06.006
and today I have my good friend,

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:07.908
the hilarious Tom Papa, with me.

00:00:07.908 --> 00:00:11.778
He's been on the Tonight Show,
Conan, Letterman, everything,

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:14.998
which means that these kids
won't have any idea who he is.

00:00:14.998 --> 00:00:16.817
So Tom, when did you first
realize you were funny?

00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:17.518
How old were you?

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:18.792
- Uh, about 34.

00:00:18.792 --> 00:00:19.493
- 34?

00:00:19.493 --> 00:00:20.988
- Yeah, it was about 10
years into my career.

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:22.389
(laughing)

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:24.324
- I think humor can help kids deal

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:26.093
with the problems they have in life.

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:28.428
- I mean as far as
like, as far as bullies?

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:29.496
- Yeah.

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:30.664
- I mean yeah, I guess it's good to get

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:33.166
laugh in before you get
punched in the face.

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:38.732
(chalk tapping)
(cheerful music)

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:40.742
- Hey guys.

00:00:40.742 --> 00:00:41.487
- Hey.

00:00:41.487 --> 00:00:42.075
- How's it going?

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:42.809
- Good.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.411
- It's me.

00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:44.311
- Tom?

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:45.579
- Oh, you recognize me!

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:46.847
It must be TV.

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:48.115
Nice to see you, what's your name?

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:49.216
- (sings) Silas.

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:50.350
- (sings) Silas!

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.085
- No, I just read your name card.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.453
- Oh, you haven't seen me on TV?

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:54.155
- No.

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:54.721
- Oh.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.849
- My name is Aidan, nice to meet you.

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:57.925
- Nice to meet you.

00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:00.427
One, two, three, go.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:01.128
Sneak attack!

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:03.525
(kids laugh)

00:01:03.525 --> 00:01:05.099
Sneak attack.

00:01:05.236 --> 00:01:06.425
How was school today?

00:01:06.425 --> 00:01:07.091
- [Both] Good.

00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:07.618
- Yeah?

00:01:07.618 --> 00:01:09.701
(coughs)

00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:12.706
Make sure we get Purell
at the end of this.

00:01:13.855 --> 00:01:15.289
Are you guys funny in class?

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:16.881
- [Both] Yeah!
- You're pretty funny?

00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:17.911
You know how to make a joke?

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:18.779
- Yeah I'm weird.

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:20.136
- You're weird?

00:01:20.136 --> 00:01:22.115
I don't see that.

00:01:24.437 --> 00:01:26.146
So, you guys look like you like to laugh.

00:01:26.146 --> 00:01:27.273
- (laughing) Yes!

00:01:27.273 --> 00:01:28.588
- Give me a joke, do you have one?

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:31.090
- What does it sound like
when a giraffe throws up?

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.126
- What does it sound like
when a giraffe throws up?

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:34.227
I don't know.

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:39.227
- Huuuuuuuuuuuurrrghghg.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.710
- That's pretty good.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.613
Not great, but pretty good.

00:01:44.613 --> 00:01:46.673
The setup was great, giraffe throwing up.

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:48.542
I'm already laughing,
we were laughing, right?

00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:51.444
Then the huuuuuuuu was good, and then

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:55.388
the end was like hurgh, not a big payoff.

00:01:55.388 --> 00:01:57.758
A good thing to do when
you tell an animal joke

00:01:57.758 --> 00:01:59.686
is, uh, make the animal talk.

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:00.487
- All right.

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:01.321
- Okay? Try that.

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:04.086
- What does it sound like
when a giraffe throws up?

00:02:04.086 --> 00:02:05.309
- I don't know, what?

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:10.309
- Huuuuuuuuuuuuuuublurghgh.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.133
Oh no, I have thrown up on my shoes!

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.235
- (laughs) Look, we're
laughing, we're laughing.

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:16.203
Good job.

00:02:16.203 --> 00:02:17.804
Good job.

00:02:18.188 --> 00:02:21.053
Another thing that audiences
really really love,

00:02:21.053 --> 00:02:24.807
they like differences
between men and women.

00:02:24.807 --> 00:02:26.079
They love it.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.350
Tell me why you don't hang out with girls.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.172
- 'Cause they're annoying.

00:02:29.172 --> 00:02:30.084
- 'Cause they're annoying!

00:02:30.084 --> 00:02:31.885
Yeah. Why don't you hang out with boys?

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:35.745
- Like, 'cause today when I went to camp,

00:02:35.745 --> 00:02:39.560
someone hit me on the nose
and my nose started bleeding.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.905
- And it was a boy.

00:02:40.905 --> 00:02:41.807
- Yeah.
- Of course.

00:02:41.807 --> 00:02:43.108
Girls don't do that.

00:02:43.108 --> 00:02:44.465
Whenever someone's bleeding,

00:02:44.465 --> 00:02:46.971
it's because they were near a boy.

00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:48.536
Sorry, Jesse, but it's true.
- No it's not!

00:02:48.536 --> 00:02:49.478
- It's pretty true.
- No!

00:02:49.478 --> 00:02:51.076
- Have you ever, has a
girl ever made you bleed?

00:02:51.076 --> 00:02:51.853
- No.

00:02:51.853 --> 00:02:52.710
- No!

00:02:53.878 --> 00:02:55.788
This is a good thing to do, a lot of times

00:02:55.788 --> 00:02:57.811
I'll be telling a joke
about men and women,

00:02:57.811 --> 00:03:00.580
and I'll go into the voice of my wife.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.984
(screechy voice) Everybody get to bed.

00:03:02.984 --> 00:03:04.126
What's wrong with you kids?

00:03:04.126 --> 00:03:05.719
Why are you all staying up?

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:07.648
Nyah nyah nyah nyah.

00:03:07.648 --> 00:03:10.023
That's how my wife talks, so I tell

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.692
the audience and then they laugh.

00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:13.680
Now are there boys that drive you crazy?

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.274
- Um, when I'm trying to do work sometimes

00:03:16.274 --> 00:03:19.068
he talks and I can't really
think of anything to write.

00:03:19.068 --> 00:03:20.790
- 'Cause he's distracting you.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.682
A good thing to do whenever
you're gonna imitate a boy,

00:03:23.682 --> 00:03:26.715
is just go uh duh duh duh duh duh duh.

00:03:26.715 --> 00:03:27.608
Duh duh duh.

00:03:27.608 --> 00:03:29.088
And we'll all think it's a boy.

00:03:29.088 --> 00:03:31.387
So, say "I'm sitting at my
desk and I'm trying to write

00:03:31.387 --> 00:03:34.406
"and this guy next to me comes
up," and then do the voice.

00:03:34.406 --> 00:03:39.406
- Okay I'm trying to do work
and then he keeps bothering me.

00:03:40.986 --> 00:03:42.382
- And then he comes over and...

00:03:42.382 --> 00:03:44.713
- Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh.
- [Tom] Duh duh duh.

00:03:44.713 --> 00:03:46.835
I'm a guy, duh duh duh.

00:03:46.835 --> 00:03:47.766
Guys are stupid.

00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:48.481
We're not bright.

00:03:48.481 --> 00:03:49.659
- So you're saying you're stupid?

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.421
- Yeah we are, but we can use that

00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:53.533
stupidity to our advantage.

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:54.674
I don't do anything in my house,

00:03:54.674 --> 00:03:56.903
because my wife thinks I'm an idiot.

00:03:57.378 --> 00:03:59.128
Girls, am I right?

00:03:59.128 --> 00:03:59.739
- Yeah!

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.508
- Are they the worst?
- Yeah.

00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:03.910
- How many playdates
do you have with girls?

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.973
- Probably like, 10.

00:04:05.973 --> 00:04:06.719
- 10?

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:08.214
- You like the ladies.

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:09.875
- No, my mom forces me.

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:11.427
- Your mom forces you, 'cause she likes

00:04:11.427 --> 00:04:14.665
the other mom and they
hang out, or the other dad.

00:04:14.665 --> 00:04:16.559
Yeah, that's how it goes.

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:18.337
Do they drink wine during these playdates?

00:04:18.337 --> 00:04:19.024
- Yes!

00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:20.125
- Oh boy.

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:22.729
They're boozing it up and you have to

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.000
play Littlest Petshop with some girl.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.129
All right, I'm gonna be your mom.

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:29.561
(screechy voice) You guys
just play a little bit more.

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:32.512
I'm gonna have a little
more of this, please!

00:04:32.512 --> 00:04:34.518
(kids laughing)

00:04:34.518 --> 00:04:36.804
Silas, put that down!

00:04:36.804 --> 00:04:39.792
These kids, I swear, I
can't wait for summer.

00:04:39.792 --> 00:04:42.527
I'm putting them in summer camp.

00:04:42.527 --> 00:04:44.284
(laughs) See how funny that is?

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:45.185
- Yeah.

00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:46.852
- Can you do it, can you imitate your mom?

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:48.691
- (screechy voice) Oh
Aidan, you're not allowed

00:04:48.691 --> 00:04:51.182
to play your video games on the weekdays.

00:04:51.182 --> 00:04:53.583
- (laughs) That's perfect,
'cause I can see her.

00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:55.266
I can totally see her.

00:04:55.266 --> 00:04:58.334
Uh, is there anyone else in
your family that's funny?

00:04:58.766 --> 00:04:59.700
- My sister.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.395
- Oooh this is gonna
be good, let's hear it.

00:05:02.395 --> 00:05:05.172
- She always gets on top of me,

00:05:06.154 --> 00:05:10.210
and then she always poops and I smell it.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.078
- Eew. (laughs)

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.040
- Look, some people like blue comedy.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.192
You can get dirty, I'm not
gonna tell you what to do.

00:05:19.192 --> 00:05:22.259
But, know your audience,
that's all I'm gonna say.

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:23.323
- Okay.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.672
- She poops on you?

00:05:24.672 --> 00:05:27.346
- No! She poops in the
diaper but I smell it.

00:05:27.346 --> 00:05:28.628
- Oh, she's a baby!

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:30.530
Oh, thank god.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.972
Thank god.

00:05:31.972 --> 00:05:34.384
I had her being like 15.

00:05:34.384 --> 00:05:36.636
You gotta tell us that.

00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:38.338
(kids laugh)

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:41.207
The key thing you have
to remember in life,

00:05:41.557 --> 00:05:46.557
is life is hard, it's
hard and it's miserable.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.697
It's our job to laugh at all that.

00:05:49.697 --> 00:05:51.660
Always look to your family,

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.568
always look for things
that make you angry.

00:05:53.568 --> 00:05:55.883
A lot of times it's your
family that makes you angry,

00:05:55.883 --> 00:05:57.954
and you can build a
whole career off of it.

00:05:57.954 --> 00:06:00.059
Everyone's gonna know
that you're the funny one,

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:02.333
and your family life is
gonna be so much better.

00:06:02.333 --> 00:06:05.799
It's not gonna be great,
but it'll be better.

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:07.834
- So, you learned a lot.
- [Silas] I know.

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:09.476
You're much better off
now, aren't you, in life?

00:06:09.476 --> 00:06:10.012
- Yeah.

00:06:10.012 --> 00:06:12.347
- You guys are gonna make a
lot of money as comedians.

00:06:12.347 --> 00:06:13.411
Get ready for that.

00:06:13.411 --> 00:06:14.316
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:06:14.316 --> 00:06:15.136
Come on, let's get out of here.

00:06:15.136 --> 00:06:16.156
Let's go do an open mic night!

00:06:16.156 --> 00:06:17.902
There's an open mic night down here.

00:06:17.902 --> 00:06:19.146
Let's go.

00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:20.531
- Hey where's my thing?

00:06:20.531 --> 00:06:22.024
- Come on, leave your props here.

00:06:22.024 --> 00:06:23.049
I don't like prop comics.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.699
- But we forgot our stuff!

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.553
- Yeah, we forgot our cheerios.

00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:31.991
- What does it sound like
when a giraffe throws up?

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.460
Huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu (choking sound)

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:43.803
Oh no, I have thrown up on my shoes!
