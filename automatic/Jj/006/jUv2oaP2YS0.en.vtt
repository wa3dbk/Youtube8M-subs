himself making it nasty now the thing is
I<00:00:39.710> was<00:00:40.039> a<00:00:40.219> little<00:00:40.460> bit<00:00:40.579> suspicious<00:00:40.909> after<00:00:41.239> his

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
I was a little bit suspicious after his

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.270 
I was a little bit suspicious after his
first<00:00:41.859> 164<00:00:42.859> KD<00:00:43.269> game<00:00:44.269> and<00:00:44.889> because<00:00:45.889> I'm<00:00:46.010> a<00:00:46.039> good

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
first 164 KD game and because I'm a good

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.599 
first 164 KD game and because I'm a good
player<00:00:46.399> 3<00:00:46.940> 15<00:00:47.329> kv<00:00:47.719> and<00:00:47.929> I<00:00:48.620> don't<00:00:49.100> get<00:00:49.249> gameplays

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
player 3 15 kv and I don't get gameplays

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.750 
player 3 15 kv and I don't get gameplays
like<00:00:49.819> never<00:00:50.210> never<00:00:50.809> I<00:00:51.170> can't<00:00:51.559> imagine<00:00:52.159> that

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
like never never I can't imagine that

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.160 
like never never I can't imagine that
I'd<00:00:52.819> ever<00:00:52.969> get<00:00:53.089> a<00:00:53.149> gameplay<00:00:53.569> like<00:00:53.749> that<00:00:53.899> and

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
I'd ever get a gameplay like that and

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.930 
I'd ever get a gameplay like that and
the<00:00:54.559> reason<00:00:54.920> is<00:00:55.039> because<00:00:55.069> I'm<00:00:55.579> playing

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
the reason is because I'm playing

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.660 
the reason is because I'm playing
against<00:00:56.539> players<00:00:57.519> within<00:00:59.530> 150<00:01:00.530> or<00:01:00.979> 200<00:01:01.489> school

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
against players within 150 or 200 school

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.450 
against players within 150 or 200 school
per<00:01:01.819> minute<00:01:02.030> either<00:01:02.329> side<00:01:02.510> of<00:01:02.659> myself<00:01:02.839> and<00:01:03.460> so

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
per minute either side of myself and so

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.550 
per minute either side of myself and so
players<00:01:04.699> have<00:01:04.940> pretty<00:01:05.420> much<00:01:05.540> the<00:01:06.229> all-round

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
players have pretty much the all-round

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.340 
players have pretty much the all-round
ability<00:01:06.950> that<00:01:07.100> I<00:01:07.160> have<00:01:07.480> if<00:01:08.480> not<00:01:08.540> a<00:01:09.080> little<00:01:09.260> bit

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
ability that I have if not a little bit

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.830 
ability that I have if not a little bit
worse<00:01:09.530> but<00:01:09.970> you<00:01:10.970> might<00:01:11.180> get<00:01:11.420> a<00:01:11.450> couple<00:01:11.750> of

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
worse but you might get a couple of

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
worse but you might get a couple of
people<00:01:12.110> in<00:01:12.230> the<00:01:12.320> lobby<00:01:12.470> that<00:01:12.680> are<00:01:12.770> a<00:01:12.800> bit

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
people in the lobby that are a bit

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.540 
people in the lobby that are a bit
special<00:01:13.190> now<00:01:13.700> by<00:01:13.820> special<00:01:14.240> i<00:01:14.440> say<00:01:15.440> i<00:01:16.040> mean

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
special now by special i say i mean

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.200 
special now by special i say i mean
they're<00:01:17.510> not<00:01:17.660> very<00:01:17.840> good<00:01:18.280> but<00:01:19.280> Jaina<00:01:19.820> I<00:01:20.000> just

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
they're not very good but Jaina I just

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.730

thought<00:01:20.390> this<00:01:20.780> is<00:01:20.960> a<00:01:20.990> bit<00:01:21.170> i'm<00:01:21.410> going<00:01:21.590> to<00:01:21.650> go

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
thought this is a bit i'm going to go

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.290 
thought this is a bit i'm going to go
and<00:01:21.800> have<00:01:21.890> a<00:01:21.980> look<00:01:22.010> at<00:01:22.190> his<00:01:22.280> elite<00:01:22.580> page<00:01:22.820> now

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300

and have a look at his elite page now
this<00:01:23.450> is<00:01:23.510> his<00:01:23.750> elite<00:01:23.990> page<00:01:24.230> that<00:01:24.830> you<00:01:24.950> are

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
this is his elite page that you are

this is his elite page that you are
looking<00:01:25.340> at<00:01:25.430> now<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:25.760> you'll<00:01:26.240> see<00:01:26.480> clearly

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
looking at now and you'll see clearly

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.550 
looking at now and you'll see clearly
that<00:01:27.290> his<00:01:27.590> stats<00:01:27.890> don't<00:01:28.100> make<00:01:28.370> sense<00:01:28.700> he<00:01:29.330> has<00:01:30.140> a

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
that his stats don't make sense he has a

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.400 
that his stats don't make sense he has a
1.7<00:01:31.550> k<00:01:31.580> d<00:01:31.760> which<00:01:32.150> is<00:01:32.330> rather<00:01:32.570> low<00:01:32.870> for<00:01:33.110> somebody

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
1.7 k d which is rather low for somebody

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.110 
1.7 k d which is rather low for somebody
of<00:01:33.530> his<00:01:33.620> ability<00:01:34.100> because<00:01:34.520> he<00:01:34.730> is<00:01:34.850> a<00:01:34.910> good

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
of his ability because he is a good

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.110 
of his ability because he is a good
player<00:01:35.240> now<00:01:36.430> his<00:01:37.430> score<00:01:37.700> per<00:01:37.820> minute<00:01:38.030> is

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
player now his score per minute is

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.210 
player now his score per minute is
rather<00:01:38.330> low<00:01:38.600> for<00:01:38.870> considering<00:01:39.830> it's<00:01:39.950> almost

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
rather low for considering it's almost

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.940 
rather low for considering it's almost
double<00:01:40.580> plus<00:01:40.790> on<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.330> xbox<00:01:41.870> and<00:01:42.080> i<00:01:42.740> thought<00:01:42.890> to

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
double plus on the xbox and i thought to

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.970 
double plus on the xbox and i thought to
myself<00:01:43.070> why<00:01:43.790> is<00:01:44.150> this<00:01:44.480> so<00:01:45.200> i<00:01:45.230> had<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:45.500> little<00:01:45.770> bit

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
myself why is this so i had a little bit

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.610 
myself why is this so i had a little bit
of<00:01:46.010> a<00:01:46.190> look<00:01:46.340> through<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:46.790> he's<00:01:47.750> reverse

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
of a look through and he's reverse

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.560 
of a look through and he's reverse
boosting<00:01:49.100> that's<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.550> only<00:01:50.030> way<00:01:50.180> to<00:01:50.240> describe

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
boosting that's the only way to describe

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.840 
boosting that's the only way to describe
it<00:01:50.870> what<00:01:51.440> he's<00:01:51.560> doing<00:01:51.890> he's<00:01:52.340> having<00:01:52.550> a<00:01:52.580> couple

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
it what he's doing he's having a couple

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.580 
it what he's doing he's having a couple
of<00:01:52.940> games<00:01:53.090> on<00:01:53.300> domination<00:01:53.870> or<00:01:53.990> kill<00:01:54.380> confirmed

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
of games on domination or kill confirmed

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.399 
of games on domination or kill confirmed
or<00:01:54.920> whatever<00:01:55.340> team<00:01:56.150> deathmatch<00:01:56.600> he's<00:01:57.080> doing

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
or whatever team deathmatch he's doing

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.020 
or whatever team deathmatch he's doing
well<00:01:57.620> and<00:01:57.920> then<00:01:58.850> he<00:01:59.810> plays<00:02:00.080> gun<00:02:00.290> game<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:01.030> dies

and<00:02:02.570> doesn't<00:02:03.320> kill<00:02:03.560> now<00:02:04.250> I'm<00:02:04.370> not<00:02:04.520> quite<00:02:04.729> sure

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
and doesn't kill now I'm not quite sure

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.490 
and doesn't kill now I'm not quite sure
