00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.760 
careful not to break it
I'm<00:02:36.870> gonna<00:02:38.510> get<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.660> blade<00:02:39.900> out<00:02:39.930> once<00:02:40.530> we<00:02:40.650> get

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
I'm gonna get that blade out once we get

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.770 
I'm gonna get that blade out once we get
the<00:02:40.920> wanna<00:02:41.100> set<00:02:41.340> out<00:02:41.489> it<00:02:42.239> just<00:02:42.840> slides<00:02:43.200> out

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
the wanna set out it just slides out

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.610 
the wanna set out it just slides out
okay<00:02:45.780> now<00:02:46.769> that<00:02:47.220> we<00:02:47.310> have<00:02:47.430> that<00:02:47.549> out<00:02:48.440> we<00:02:49.440> can

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
okay now that we have that out we can

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.160 
okay now that we have that out we can
actually<00:02:49.769> measure<00:02:50.390> exactly<00:02:51.390> what<00:02:51.570> we<00:02:51.720> need<00:02:51.870> so

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
actually measure exactly what we need so

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.220 
actually measure exactly what we need so
as<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.320> can<00:02:55.470> see<00:02:56.239> this<00:02:57.239> is<00:02:57.450> pretty<00:02:57.810> much<00:02:57.930> one

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
as you can see this is pretty much one

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.680 
as you can see this is pretty much one
of<00:02:58.320> this<00:02:59.299> if<00:03:00.299> we<00:03:00.570> look<00:03:00.840> at<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:03.330> metal

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
of this if we look at the the metal

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.400 
of this if we look at the the metal
piece<00:03:04.080> here<00:03:04.560> has<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:05.790> cut<00:03:06.120> pretty<00:03:06.930> much<00:03:07.080> sort<00:03:07.350> of

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
piece here has a cut pretty much sort of

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.009 
piece here has a cut pretty much sort of
set<00:03:07.709> up<00:03:07.799> or<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.180> pre-cut<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.540> if<00:03:09.600> we<00:03:09.720> take<00:03:09.840> the

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
set up or a pre-cut so if we take the

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.100 
set up or a pre-cut so if we take the
pliers<00:03:10.910> we're<00:03:11.910> gonna<00:03:12.090> do<00:03:12.269> is<00:03:12.950> here<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:15.450> break

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
pliers we're gonna do is here and break

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.750 
pliers we're gonna do is here and break
it<00:03:16.320> off

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
it off

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.710 
it off
one

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.290 

India<00:03:24.520> okay<00:03:25.520> now<00:03:25.910> we<00:03:25.970> can<00:03:26.150> put<00:03:26.360> those<00:03:26.510> in<00:03:28.300> now

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
India okay now we can put those in now

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.290 
India okay now we can put those in now
what<00:03:29.570> we<00:03:29.690> want<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:29.960> do<00:03:30.050> is<00:03:30.200> actually<00:03:31.270> cut<00:03:32.270> off

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
what we want to do is actually cut off

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.360 
what we want to do is actually cut off
the<00:03:33.160> rubber<00:03:34.160> off<00:03:34.460> it<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.860> just<00:03:36.860> measured<00:03:37.220> by

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
the rubber off it so just measured by

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.190 
the rubber off it so just measured by
eye<00:03:37.400> does<00:03:38.000> have<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:38.270> be<00:03:38.300> perfect<00:03:38.630> but<00:03:39.020> the

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
eye does have to be perfect but the

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.740 
eye does have to be perfect but the
closer<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.650> get<00:03:39.770> the<00:03:39.830> better<00:03:40.450> this<00:03:41.450> is<00:03:41.510> pretty

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
closer you get the better this is pretty

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:51.660 
closer you get the better this is pretty
much<00:03:41.810> one<00:03:42.050> of<00:03:42.080> this<00:03:47.200> scissors<00:03:48.880> and<00:03:49.880> cut<00:03:50.120> it<00:03:50.270> off

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
much one of this scissors and cut it off

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.870 
much one of this scissors and cut it off
all<00:03:52.670> right<00:03:52.910> so<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:55.010> clip<00:03:55.250> one<00:03:55.459> of<00:03:55.490> the<00:03:55.640> clips

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
all right so the clip one of the clips

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.960 
all right so the clip one of the clips
I'm<00:03:56.810> going<00:03:56.959> to<00:03:57.020> move<00:03:57.080> it<00:03:57.230> back<00:03:57.260> here<00:03:57.970> alright

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
I'm going to move it back here alright

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.900 
I'm going to move it back here alright
so<00:03:59.360> the<00:04:00.050> part<00:04:00.410> that's<00:04:00.920> on<00:04:01.070> this<00:04:01.280> side<00:04:01.520> which

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
so the part that's on this side which

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.250 
so the part that's on this side which
you<00:04:01.940> can<00:04:02.180> see<00:04:02.390> is<00:04:02.570> has<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:04.390> yellow<00:04:05.390> let's<00:04:06.110> see

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
you can see is has the yellow let's see

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.290 
you can see is has the yellow let's see
if<00:04:06.320> you<00:04:06.530> see<00:04:06.680> it<00:04:06.740> has<00:04:07.430> sort<00:04:07.640> of<00:04:07.700> little<00:04:08.000> clips

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
if you see it has sort of little clips

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.320 
if you see it has sort of little clips
here<00:04:08.540> this<00:04:08.780> is<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.020> locking<00:04:09.380> mechanism<00:04:10.330> under

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
here this is the locking mechanism under

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.320 
here this is the locking mechanism under
it<00:04:11.480> actually<00:04:12.400> it's<00:04:13.400> not<00:04:13.550> the<00:04:13.610> one<00:04:13.820> where<00:04:14.030> locks

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
it actually it's not the one where locks

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.870 
it actually it's not the one where locks
so<00:04:14.540> it<00:04:14.600> doesn't<00:04:14.930> so<00:04:15.500> doesn't<00:04:15.860> move<00:04:16.040> so<00:04:16.310> you<00:04:16.760> can

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
so it doesn't so doesn't move so you can

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.009 
so it doesn't so doesn't move so you can
see<00:04:17.030> here<00:04:18.100> hopefully<00:04:19.100> you<00:04:19.130> can<00:04:19.250> see<00:04:19.459> it<00:04:20.019> it's

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
see here hopefully you can see it it's

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.440 
see here hopefully you can see it it's
two<00:04:21.230> right<00:04:21.380> here<00:04:21.620> so<00:04:22.580> what<00:04:22.970> we<00:04:23.060> want<00:04:23.210> to<00:04:23.300> do

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
two right here so what we want to do

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.450 
two right here so what we want to do
here<00:04:23.690> is<00:04:23.930> because<00:04:24.560> you<00:04:24.800> see<00:04:25.040> it's<00:04:25.190> not<00:04:25.400> a

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
here is because you see it's not a

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.060 
here is because you see it's not a
perfect<00:04:26.150> client<00:04:26.630> could<00:04:27.290> actually<00:04:27.530> probably

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
perfect client could actually probably

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.150 
perfect client could actually probably
cut<00:04:28.370> it<00:04:28.400> off<00:04:28.610> lightly<00:04:29.380> let's<00:04:30.380> do<00:04:30.590> that<00:04:30.740> just<00:04:30.800> in

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
cut it off lightly let's do that just in

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.740 
cut it off lightly let's do that just in
case<00:04:32.350> just<00:04:33.350> slightly

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
case just slightly

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.020 
case just slightly
so<00:04:36.750> it's<00:04:36.900> even<00:04:37.110> out<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:40.560> we<00:04:41.490> can<00:04:41.610> actually

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
so it's even out and we can actually

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.290 
so it's even out and we can actually
split<00:04:42.389> these<00:04:42.719> slide<00:04:43.469> that<00:04:43.710> off<00:04:43.889> of<00:04:44.219> this<00:04:44.969> waste

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
split these slide that off of this waste

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.189 
split these slide that off of this waste
it's<00:04:45.780> just<00:04:46.050> not<00:04:46.280> right<00:04:47.280> at<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:47.580> edges<00:04:47.990> like<00:04:48.990> it

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
it's just not right at the edges like it

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:59.869 
it's just not right at the edges like it
was<00:04:49.490> okay<00:04:50.490> I'm<00:04:51.030> going<00:04:51.180> to<00:04:51.240> put<00:04:51.569> it<00:04:51.659> back<00:04:51.780> in

00:04:59.869 --> 00:04:59.879 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:02.359 

you<00:05:00.449> see<00:05:00.599> that's<00:05:00.809> why<00:05:00.929> I<00:05:00.959> asked<00:05:01.919> you<00:05:02.009> to<00:05:02.039> our

00:05:02.359 --> 00:05:02.369 
you see that's why I asked you to our

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:04.429 
you see that's why I asked you to our
neither<00:05:03.089> clips<00:05:03.419> on<00:05:03.599> because<00:05:03.839> this<00:05:04.020> will<00:05:04.259> help

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:04.439 
neither clips on because this will help

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:09.889 
neither clips on because this will help
you<00:05:04.889> get<00:05:05.069> those<00:05:06.949> railings<00:05:07.949> back<00:05:08.399> in<00:05:08.899> the

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:09.899 
you get those railings back in the

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:11.809 
you get those railings back in the
Robert<00:05:10.259> otherwise<00:05:10.589> they're<00:05:11.219> gonna<00:05:11.309> fly<00:05:11.639> all

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:11.819 
Robert otherwise they're gonna fly all

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:12.559 
Robert otherwise they're gonna fly all
over<00:05:11.999> the<00:05:12.089> place

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 
over the place

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.850 
over the place
so<00:05:13.259> let's<00:05:13.469> lock<00:05:13.649> this<00:05:13.830> in<00:05:14.839> okay<00:05:15.839> once<00:05:16.349> that's

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
so let's lock this in okay once that's

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.239 
so let's lock this in okay once that's
done<00:05:17.509> all<00:05:18.509> you<00:05:18.959> got<00:05:19.110> to<00:05:19.229> do<00:05:19.349> is<00:05:19.589> take<00:05:20.069> your

00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:20.249 
done all you got to do is take your

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:24.589 
done all you got to do is take your
blade<00:05:20.459> again<00:05:21.649> and<00:05:22.649> you<00:05:23.429> can<00:05:23.639> begin<00:05:23.819> sliding<00:05:24.419> so

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
blade again and you can begin sliding so

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:26.329 
blade again and you can begin sliding so
this<00:05:24.779> case<00:05:24.990> we're<00:05:25.169> going<00:05:25.289> to<00:05:25.349> remove<00:05:25.949> one<00:05:26.219> of

bucks<00:06:49.760> per<00:06:50.000> -<00:06:50.540> and<00:06:50.950> that's<00:06:51.950> it<00:06:52.070> for<00:06:52.190> 26<00:06:52.700> inch
