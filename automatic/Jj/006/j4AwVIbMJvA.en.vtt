00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.990
 hi paolo can you explain how to maintain 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.790
 the forks always efficient 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.010
 yes I'll explain it right away it's an operation 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.040
 very simple 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.779
 the cause is when you clean the bike 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.990
 often it happens that in the area behind the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.840
 para stem remain crusts of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.810
 mud when those dry 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.410
 damage both the dust cover on 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.980
 oil seal and internal bushings because 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.219
 when the fork sinks found 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.440
 the intersection finds the dry incrustation e 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.559
 unfortunately when it is hidden by par 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.820
 then go with the spear 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.690
 I suggest you with a simple 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:55.079
 straccino puts himself in this position 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.829
 you take a simple vd 40 that everyone 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.850
 know 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:03.780
 just give it a sprinkle and do this 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:08.729
 operation until the end is maintained 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.799
 lubricated fork is always clean 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.960
 also in the area and more hidden because a 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.680
 it happens to me very often when i am 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.979
 send the forks to find the bike 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.670
 in the area hidden here so much 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.560
 old dried mud and this does damage 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.290
 eventually it ends up in the forks 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:34.229
 and block the beauty of the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.460
 feeling of the sliding fork e 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:43.140
 break the channels ok paolo in the case of 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.320
 ktm which has a more closed parallel 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.570
 closed if we capture yes we do 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.549
 on the ktm we have done now there 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.270
 I show so many pilasters we have them 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.369
 cut to do this 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.990
 this was closed we cut it 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.869
 so you can always enter with it 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.610
 trawl and go all the way to 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.700
 clean them so much 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.100
 no problem whatsoever 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.260
 cut and then show us the palast e 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.080
 the original of the ktm spoke 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.330
 in the original of the ktm this one here 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.960
 it is closed or closed and well we go to 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:25.020
 remove with the air you cut here e 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.840
 here these two are taken away 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.980
 strips but do not create any 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.370
 problem that goes thank you please hello a 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.370
 all
