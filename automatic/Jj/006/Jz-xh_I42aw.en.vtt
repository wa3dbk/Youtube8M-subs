00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.120
 hello everyone in this tutorial or 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.310
 teach you a trick to make the 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.290
 our smartphone's battery in this 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.690
 case in the aberri do not lose its useful life 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.889
 and last longer we will obviously need 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.719
 The smartphone charger is the 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.540
 smartphone and this device that I have here 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.310
 which is a plug with timer in 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.020
 many internet tutorials on how 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.490
 make the battery last longer explains 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.340
 that we must deactivate the location 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.930
 in 3g the bluetooth or lower the brightness 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.000
 but in this case I'm going to talk to you 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.070
 on the battery charge 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.560
 most people usually leave the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.480
 mobile charging all night and do not 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.330
 should do because about loading the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.000
 battery shorten your life like most 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.470
 we do not have another moment to load it 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.300
 because we use all day I'm going to 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.800
 explain how to charge it during the night 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.340
 without damaging our battery 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.230
 smartphone 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.450
 the idea is very simple simply 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.160
 consists in programming what hours we want 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.020
 that is loaded on our smartphone at 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.690
 long at night and for that 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.120
 we will use the plug with timer 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.559
 in this case and most of the cases 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.710
 because almost all I've seen are 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.800
 well it works in the following way what 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.500
 we connect the current 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.090
 and we turn this roulette by dialing the time 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.070
 which is at the moment of which we are 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:20.100
 connecting for example right now they are 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.100
 the 5 then we put that are the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.430
 17 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.869
 once connected there are some tabs 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.520
 around the clock and the hours that 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.740
 We want to load it. 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.509
 download them for example I have it 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.820
 programmed to load 5 and 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.340
 medium to 7 if I want it to be loaded 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.630
 four and a half 71 of these two tabs 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.299
 I will explain what is the 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.369
 procedure to prepare the load 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.219
 as I told you we connect in the in 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.470
 social the current we put the time that 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.340
 is 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.340
 5 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.280
 you're ready, we connect our plug 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.770
 our smartphone is loading us and 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.179
 now let's simulate that obviously 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.890
 spend the hours are what we have 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.250
 programmed 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.590
 would launch until three thirty of the 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.239
 morning 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.519
 and once passed this time the 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:23.050
 smartphone is charging when 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.050
 arrive at seven thirty in the morning 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.680
 the smartphone finishes charging 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.480
 lastly I wanted to say that it is in 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.400
 temporizing jet is simple 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.860
 to get in most of the 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.720
 shopping centers or large 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.160
 surfaces for less than five euros what 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.410
 you have 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.730
 I hope this has been useful for you 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.730
 tutorial and until next time
