hoping to achieve it's it's it's all
about<00:03:12.140> authenticity<00:03:12.440> so<00:03:13.010> it's<00:03:13.160> obviously

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
about authenticity so it's obviously

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.040 
about authenticity so it's obviously
hyper<00:03:13.700> realistic<00:03:14.120> but<00:03:14.450> we<00:03:14.540> are<00:03:14.660> running<00:03:14.780> in

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
hyper realistic but we are running in

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.540 
hyper realistic but we are running in
60fps<00:03:16.090> so<00:03:17.290> that's<00:03:18.290> a<00:03:18.560> that's<00:03:19.010> going<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.370> give

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
60fps so that's a that's going to give

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.090 
60fps so that's a that's going to give
us<00:03:19.580> some<00:03:19.940> slightly<00:03:20.570> more<00:03:20.900> intense<00:03:21.620> experience

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
us some slightly more intense experience

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.620 
us some slightly more intense experience
slightly<00:03:22.550> smaller<00:03:22.820> mouths<00:03:23.120> maybe<00:03:23.390> than<00:03:23.540> you

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
slightly smaller mouths maybe than you

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.000 
slightly smaller mouths maybe than you
guys<00:03:23.780> are<00:03:23.930> used<00:03:24.080> to<00:03:24.170> playing<00:03:24.470> on<00:03:25.300> but

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
guys are used to playing on but

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.050 
guys are used to playing on but
graphically<00:03:28.010> we're<00:03:28.250> in<00:03:28.310> Northern<00:03:28.670> Europe<00:03:28.730> so

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
graphically we're in Northern Europe so

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.630 
graphically we're in Northern Europe so
it's<00:03:29.210> pretty<00:03:29.450> dark<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:30.800> we're<00:03:31.370> not<00:03:31.490> only

it's pretty dark and we're not only

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.430 
it's pretty dark and we're not only

right<00:03:40.550> I<00:03:40.820> would<00:03:41.240> let's<00:03:41.450> just<00:03:41.660> say<00:03:41.750> they'll<00:03:41.960> be
