00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:06.680 

well<00:00:05.069> i<00:00:05.130> think<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.609> new<00:00:06.000> design<00:00:06.210> of<00:00:06.569> the

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
well i think the the new design of the

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.860 
well i think the the new design of the
total<00:00:07.140> one<00:00:07.290> nxg<00:00:07.319> you<00:00:07.830> can<00:00:08.010> really<00:00:08.250> feel<00:00:08.580> the

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
total one nxg you can really feel the

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.100 
total one nxg you can really feel the
DNA<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:09.900> supreme<00:00:10.730> which<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:11.940> precision<00:00:12.420> so<00:00:12.929> we

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
DNA of supreme which is precision so we

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.799 
DNA of supreme which is precision so we
really<00:00:13.349> try<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.620> put<00:00:14.219> focus<00:00:14.490> on<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.120> elements

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
really try to put focus on the elements

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.560 
really try to put focus on the elements
of<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.170> skate<00:00:16.410> we<00:00:16.800> really<00:00:17.070> decided<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.699> expose

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
of the skate we really decided to expose

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.950 
of the skate we really decided to expose
the<00:00:18.930> composite<00:00:19.619> quarter<00:00:20.010> by<00:00:20.660> minimizing<00:00:21.660> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
the composite quarter by minimizing the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.259 
the composite quarter by minimizing the
usage<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:23.039> upper<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.550> same<00:00:24.029> fashion

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
usage of the upper and the same fashion

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.630 
usage of the upper and the same fashion
for<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.019> tenant<00:00:25.350> guard<00:00:25.529> we<00:00:25.949> decided<00:00:26.430> to

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
for the tenant guard we decided to

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.790 
for the tenant guard we decided to
expose<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.420> tenant<00:00:27.869> guard<00:00:28.019> one<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.619> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
expose the tenant guard one of the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.519 
expose the tenant guard one of the
design<00:00:29.189> elements<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.240> add<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.660> ribs<00:00:30.960> in

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
design elements is to add the ribs in

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.959 
design elements is to add the ribs in
the<00:00:31.590> shape<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> tunnel<00:00:32.399> guard<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.790> add

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
the shape of the tunnel guard to add

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.080 
the shape of the tunnel guard to add
some<00:00:33.270> some<00:00:33.809> structure<00:00:34.460> component<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.610> think

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
some some structure component I think

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.479 
some some structure component I think
one<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.510> most<00:00:36.750> iconic<00:00:36.989> element<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
one of the most iconic element is the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.130 
one of the most iconic element is the
chrome<00:00:38.790> detail<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.600> have<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
chrome detail that you have on the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.900 
chrome detail that you have on the
bottom<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.620> tenant<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.070> they're<00:00:41.670> really

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
bottom of the tenant and they're really

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.510 
bottom of the tenant and they're really
speaks<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.899> highlight<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.559> new<00:00:43.770> technology

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
speaks and highlight the new technology

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.940 
speaks and highlight the new technology
that<00:00:44.700> we<00:00:44.820> have<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.450> NXT<00:00:46.140> skate<00:00:46.379> there's<00:00:46.890> a

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
that we have this NXT skate there's a

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.459 
that we have this NXT skate there's a
lot<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.160> energy<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.730> goes<00:00:47.910> into<00:00:47.969> designing

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
lot of energy that goes into designing

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.520 
lot of energy that goes into designing
the<00:00:49.469> skates<00:00:50.539> you<00:00:51.539> know<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.199> have<00:00:52.350> to

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the skates you know that we have to

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.920 
the skates you know that we have to
build<00:00:53.160> richness<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.449> case<00:00:54.719> it

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
build richness and for this case it

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.970 
build richness and for this case it
actually<00:00:55.079> takes<00:00:55.530> at<00:00:56.370> least<00:00:56.430> 10<00:00:56.910> months<00:00:57.270> to

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
actually takes at least 10 months to

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.700 
actually takes at least 10 months to
finalize<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.640> look<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.149> escape<00:01:00.570> it's<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.559> long

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
finalize the look of escape it's a long

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.369 
finalize the look of escape it's a long
process<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.430> lot<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.760> trial<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.090> error<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.600> if

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
process a lot of trial and error and if

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.260 
process a lot of trial and error and if
there's<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.739> lot<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.920> work<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.460> we<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.150> be

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
there's a lot of work and we have to be

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.060 
there's a lot of work and we have to be
smart<00:01:06.570> about<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.869> materials<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.380> choose<00:01:07.619> well

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
smart about the materials we choose well

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.219 
smart about the materials we choose well
I<00:01:08.130> think<00:01:08.220> black<00:01:08.970> white<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.479> yellow<00:01:09.840> became

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
I think black white and yellow became

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.000 
I think black white and yellow became
the<00:01:10.409> identity<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.040> supreme<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.630> decide<00:01:12.960> to

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
the identity of supreme so we decide to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.620 
the identity of supreme so we decide to
was<00:01:14.010> picking<00:01:14.340> up<00:01:14.460> where<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.880> amazing<00:01:15.390> left

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
was picking up where the amazing left

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.719 
was picking up where the amazing left
off<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.470> yellow<00:01:16.650> part<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.340> total<00:01:17.610> one

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
off so the yellow part on the total one

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.999 
off so the yellow part on the total one
was<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.330> aconnick<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.140> decided<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.770> keep

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
was the aconnick so we decided to keep

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.359 
was the aconnick so we decided to keep
those<00:01:20.640> details<00:01:21.119> but<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.140> more<00:01:22.350> edgy<00:01:23.100> edgy

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
those details but in a more edgy edgy

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.910 
those details but in a more edgy edgy
look<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.090> we<00:01:24.270> redesigned<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.900> toe<00:01:25.110> cap<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:25.770> we

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
look so we redesigned the toe cap but we

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.520 
look so we redesigned the toe cap but we
kept<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> same<00:01:26.670> internal<00:01:27.180> dimensions<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:28.259> our

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
kept the same internal dimensions so our

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.020 
kept the same internal dimensions so our
players<00:01:28.799> i<00:01:29.040> really<00:01:29.310> like<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.670> internal

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
players i really like the internal

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.300 
players i really like the internal
dimensions<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:31.079> total<00:01:31.380> once<00:01:31.560> Cape<00:01:31.770> you're

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
dimensions of a total once Cape you're

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.280 
dimensions of a total once Cape you're
gonna<00:01:32.490> keep<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.060> same<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.750> same<00:01:33.780> kind<00:01:34.229> of

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
gonna keep the same the same kind of

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.770 
gonna keep the same the same kind of
feeling<00:01:34.530> usually<00:01:35.220> we<00:01:35.400> wanted<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.509> link

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
feeling usually we wanted to have a link

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.440 
feeling usually we wanted to have a link
between<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.350> outsole<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.979> abrasion<00:01:38.939> pad<00:01:39.119> so

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
between the outsole the abrasion pad so

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.899 
between the outsole the abrasion pad so
this<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> small<00:01:40.229> subtle<00:01:40.770> detail<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.850> I

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
this is a small subtle detail but I

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.910 
this is a small subtle detail but I
think<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.270> adds<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.229> flow<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
think it adds the to the flow of the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.429 
think it adds the to the flow of the
skate<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.399> think<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.939> eyelets<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:46.020> think<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
skate I think the eyelets I think the

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.410 
skate I think the eyelets I think the
goal<00:01:46.619> really<00:01:46.829> talks<00:01:47.130> about<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.790> premium

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
goal really talks about a premium

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.420 
goal really talks about a premium
product<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.020> i<00:01:49.530> think<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.860> total<00:01:50.250> one<00:01:50.399> nxg

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
product and i think this total one nxg

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.539 
product and i think this total one nxg
is<00:01:51.119> really<00:01:52.020> all<00:01:52.409> about<00:01:52.470> performance<00:01:52.920> and

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
is really all about performance and

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.999

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
quarter really speaks about the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.570 
quarter really speaks about the
technology

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
technology

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.880 
technology
the<00:02:00.730> precision<00:02:01.510> and<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:02.050> work<00:02:02.410> that's<00:02:02.620> put

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
the precision and the work that's put

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.890 
the precision and the work that's put
into<00:02:03.010> this<00:02:03.250> case<00:02:03.460> i<00:02:03.580> think<00:02:03.850> it's<00:02:04.000> a<00:02:04.090> it's<00:02:04.300> going
