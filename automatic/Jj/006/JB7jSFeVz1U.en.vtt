00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.000
 [Robert Winston] It's incredible when you think I keep my hands 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.340
 The place where someone once felt, thought and loved 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.000
 For centuries, scientists struggled to understand 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.250
 What's the matter with this unattractive facility 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 [Vilayanur Ramachandran] This is the mass of gelatin you can hold on your palm 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 And he can think about the clutter of inter-space space 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.470
 [Carl Sagan] The brain evolved from the inside outward 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.000
 Its structure reflects all the stages through which it passed 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.240
 [Jill Bolte Taylor] Information in the form of energy simultaneously influences 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.000
 Through all of our sensory systems in the form of energy 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.150
 And then explode into this huge collage 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.500
 Since that moment looks like this 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 How it feels and how it sounds 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.500
 Explode in this huge collage 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.800
 And at that point we are perfect 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.000
 We are whole and beautiful 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.600
 [Robert Winston] Looks pretty disgusting 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.050
 Wrinkled like a nut, and soft as a mushroom 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.000
 [Carl Sagan] What we know is encoded in cells called neurons 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.400
 And there are about a hundred billion neural links around here 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.500
 This fussy and magnificent network of neurons is called 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.100
 Zealous weaving apartment 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.700
 Neurons also store sounds and music passages 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.000
 The whole orchestra plays in our heads 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.650
 Information amounts to 20 million tomatoes 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.000
 It's inside the head of each of us 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.100
 The brain is a very large place in a very small area 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.660
 [Jill Bolte Taylor] Information in the form of energy simultaneously influences 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.050
 Through all of our sensory systems in the form of energy 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.540
 And then explode into this huge collage 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.600
 Since that moment looks like this 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.000
 How it feels and how it sounds 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.900
 [Carl Sagan] No more in the grace of the reptilian brain, we can change ourselves 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.500
 Think about the possibilities 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.800
 [Bill Nye] You think of your brain as a newspaper 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.210
 Think about all the information I can store 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.000
 But they do not take up much space because they are bent 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.550
 [Oliver Sacks] We look at the eyes, but we look at the brain 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.000
 Brain watching is often called imagination 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.600
 [different] 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.400
 [Jill Bolte Taylor] And then explode into this huge collage 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.000
 And at that point we are perfect 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.600
 We are whole and beautiful 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.500
 [Robert Winston] It's the toughest part of the human body 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.000
 And yet it dominates the way we live our adult lives 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.000
 It's the brain. 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.000
