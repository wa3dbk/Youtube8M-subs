00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:07.359
 ubi rat and did pond 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.969
 First, they should decide if one 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:12.309
 basin or manufactures is sufficient or 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.730
 if the size of your garden is one 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.320
 individual foils pond admits 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.630
 basically the bigger the pond 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.789
 is created the more stable is the 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.429
 against temperature fluctuations and in 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.619
 ideal for its ecological balance 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.769
 is a location with few trees 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.150
 old leaves or pollen 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.950
 falling branches worsen the 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.530
 water quality and thus the 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.989
 living conditions for plants and animals 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.570
 a place in the semi-shade is perfect 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.120
 worry about six hours of sun a day 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.070
 for ideal growth of the plants too 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.120
 however, much heat increases that 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.609
 algae growth 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.980
 Check also before the earth excavation for 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.140
 your pond whether underground cable or 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.510
 could be damaged 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.210
 for pump or filter you should have one 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.280
 near the electricity connection 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.059
 Shape your pond with one 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.620
 rope he comes on a grassy surface 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.930
 First remove the grass 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.500
 then they gradually wear the 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.160
 Earth layer from the sum should be about 10 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.680
 to 20 cm deep are the 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:21.670
 shallow water zone 40 to 70 the deep set 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.710
 without at least 90 better but 120 to 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.660
 150 centimeters 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.970
 keep checking if the 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.510
 planned pond turn on a level 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.850
 lie 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.460
 The easiest way to do this is with a roof slat 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.750
 and spirit level roots and stones 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.660
 they should remove 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.460
 These could later be the pond film 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.660
 to damage 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.970
 additional protection can be achieved if 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.610
 she partly flows under the foil 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.010
 which size your pond foil have 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.170
 you should be able to calculate online 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.150
 Now prepare the fleece and the 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.760
 pond film at warm temperatures 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.790
 the foil is very flexible and leaves 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.520
 easier to see smooth 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.590
 so that the dry environment becomes that 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.020
 Water should not be sucked out of the pond 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.100
 The film is pulled vertically upwards 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.780
 and be covered with stones 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.180
 after the application of substrate and 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.650
 gravel in the deep water zone you can 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.210
 start with the filling of your pond 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.160
 if they are strongly calcareous 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.170
 have tap water should the 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.830
 rain the filling of your pond 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.740
 leave 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.020
 even if that takes about one 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.240
 third of their pond can be filled 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.940
 they plant the deep-water zone 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.290
 do it easily 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.930
 basically , they only apply 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.580
 native wild and to the location 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.890
 a plant-adapted 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.500
 Your top professional will be pleased to advise you 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.209
 The choice of plants there is 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.700
 different pond pumps for 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.680
 different needs the choice of 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.200
 The right technique depends on the size 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.480
 from the dough and whether fish in the pond 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.489
 If you live your pond in the spring 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.650
 cleanse and become too big 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.780
 they will cut down aquatic plants 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.269
 long enjoy this jewel 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.400
 then change the uv c lamp 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.739
 your filter so you a possible 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.739
 algae poor pond season can enjoy
