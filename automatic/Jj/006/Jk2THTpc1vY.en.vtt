00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 pakhira branch of the Moscow metro began 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.690
 walk a new type of train with a through 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.000
 passage between cars for passengers 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.280
 there is space for comfort and safety 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.469
 But for raw hook, these compounds should 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.520
 become impregnable fortress cn one 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.750
 the train rolled Alexey Platonov 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.430
 air conditioning large light displays and 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.470
 wide doors to these innovations in 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.550
 Moscow subway trains passengers already 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.539
 managed to get used to 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.580
 however today on 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.590
 Serpukhov-Timiryazevskaya line waiting for them 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.560
 surprise train seems to be normal but 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.030
 built on a completely new principle 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.950
 such a perspective in trains metropolitan 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.020
 subway passengers will see for the first time from 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.210
 the first carriage is viewed last 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.440
 but the main thing of course is not in the beauty in 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.559
 new compositions increased 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.730
 passenger capacity and ease of travel 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.920
 metro in full swing implemented 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.149
 rolling stock upgrade program 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.160
 main types of public transport 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.559
 should be the most modern in 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.420
 as soon as possible such a task 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.670
 put the mayor of Moscow some more 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.690
 months ago we took the program 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.910
 rolling stock upgrades 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.330
 Moscow metro 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.820
 him in recent years but almost 27 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.090
 percent of subway cars 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:15.010
 each year there are about 300 new 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.350
 wagons and we are constantly changing 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.570
 gradually changing the procurement system for the first time 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.450
 this year a contract has been concluded 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.520
 life cycle which means not 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.830
 only the supply of wagons but also 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.840
 producer responsibility for everything 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.910
 his time on the metro to 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.950
 new lineup was prepared in line 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.140
 type Warsaw first 4 months 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.330
 run in without passengers and safety 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.920
 shipments primarily through open 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.380
 transitions between cars managed 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.780
 increase train capacity by almost 15 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.140
 percent or 200 passengers we don't 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.640
 so much we can do in terms of 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.850
 compaction of motion graphics therefore 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.270
 our main efforts will be related to 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.210
 creating additional spaces for 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.360
 train passengers and of course raising 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.050
 traffic safety Moscow 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.940
 subway 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.560
 in the new train disappeared between 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.420
 carriages and therefore increased 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.310
 safety while finding the composition 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.560
 platforms to the same corrugated 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.599
 transitions deprived fish of the opportunity 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.760
 ride outside earlier their fun 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.190
 often led to tragedy new belt 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.200
 it became even easier and more economical for the first time in 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.000
 the lineup included not motor cars but 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.190
 it means maintenance has become easier and 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.020
 faster now such compositions we 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.620
 go to the Moscow metro 3 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.300
 things and i think we summarize this whole 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.239
 complex issues that as a result 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.670
 operating these trains will appear for 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.550
 to have a new train 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.680
 the contract we signed 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.020
 introduce these all features already and 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.970
 modify the compositions taking into account the wishes 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.370
 our passengers first passengers already 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.110
 noted the undoubted convenience of the train from 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.000
 type yes the center of the capital with them 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.040
 swept subway heads 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.769
 and department of transportation 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.209
 one more time transition model new search 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.900
 which will be the seventeenth year this 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.560
 the train will be 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.689
 most modern generation 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.090
 comparable best places 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.010
 which is the world for the next five years 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.680
 metropolitan subway will get three more 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.390
 Thousands of the most modern cars Alexei 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.390
