element is not working they've got the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.119

resources to go to other places and
let's<00:00:50.670> underscore<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.539> because<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.110> is

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
let's underscore this because this is

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.729 
let's underscore this because this is
long<00:00:53.010> been<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.370> criticism<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:54.149> Team<00:00:54.809> USA<00:00:55.410> and
