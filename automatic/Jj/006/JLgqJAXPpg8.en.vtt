00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.360 

that<00:01:53.300> video<00:01:53.720> lived<00:01:54.020> on<00:01:54.200> YouTube<00:01:54.590> for<00:01:54.920> years

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
documentary year exactly and I'm sure if

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.469 
documentary year exactly and I'm sure if
YouTube<00:02:00.770> existed<00:02:01.610> at<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.790> time<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:02.360> boys

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
YouTube existed at the time the boys

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:03.790

cellphone<00:02:02.960> footage<00:02:03.170> would<00:02:03.440> have<00:02:03.560> made<00:02:03.680> it

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
cellphone footage would have made it

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.620 
cellphone footage would have made it
there<00:02:03.920> too<00:02:04.100> I<00:02:04.280> believe<00:02:05.090> we've<00:02:05.270> got<00:02:05.450> that

there too I believe we've got that
footage<00:02:05.960> as<00:02:06.110> well<00:02:06.290> can<00:02:06.500> we<00:02:06.619> put<00:02:06.830> that<00:02:07.010> up<00:02:07.130> on

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
footage as well can we put that up on

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:20.610 
footage as well can we put that up on
the<00:02:07.369> screen<00:02:07.490> right<00:02:07.670> now

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.160 

it's<00:02:21.099> astonishing<00:02:21.819> footage<00:02:22.000> my<00:02:22.569> guess<00:02:22.870> is

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
it's astonishing footage my guess is

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.479 
it's astonishing footage my guess is
that<00:02:23.380> there<00:02:23.680> are<00:02:23.739> many<00:02:23.830> other<00:02:24.069> pieces<00:02:24.310> of

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
that there are many other pieces of

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.190 
that there are many other pieces of
video<00:02:24.610> evidence<00:02:24.910> out<00:02:25.270> there<00:02:25.300> right<00:02:25.720> now<00:02:25.750> and

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
video evidence out there right now and

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.199 
video evidence out there right now and
I'm<00:02:26.560> sure<00:02:26.800> that<00:02:27.010> some<00:02:27.370> of<00:02:27.550> these<00:02:27.640> wind<00:02:27.910> up<00:02:28.090> on

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
I'm sure that some of these wind up on

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.690 
I'm sure that some of these wind up on
the<00:02:28.330> Internet
