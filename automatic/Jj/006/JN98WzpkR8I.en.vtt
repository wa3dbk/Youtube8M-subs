some extra parts like that that they

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.459 
some extra parts like that that they
bought<00:01:54.570> from<00:01:56.180> NASA<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.630> they<00:01:57.899> melted<00:01:58.290> them

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
bought from NASA and they melted them

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.690 
bought from NASA and they melted them
down<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.829> they<00:01:58.920> use<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.340> some<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.640> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
down and they use it in some of the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.310 
down and they use it in some of the
metal<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.030> watch<00:02:00.299> here<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.930> goes

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
metal the watch here and that that goes

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.590 
metal the watch here and that that goes
along<00:02:01.590> with<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.890> DNA<00:02:02.430> theme<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> brand<00:02:03.420> if

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
along with the DNA theme of the brand if

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.749 
along with the DNA theme of the brand if
you<00:02:03.689> remember<00:02:03.990> there<00:02:04.140> was<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.469> Titanic<00:02:05.189> DNA

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
you remember there was the Titanic DNA

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.069 
you remember there was the Titanic DNA
which<00:02:05.909> did<00:02:06.149> something<00:02:06.450> similar<00:02:06.630> with<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
which did something similar with the

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:07.580 
which did something similar with the
Titanic

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
Titanic

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.639 
Titanic
so<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.610> dial<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:09.090> really<00:02:09.390> really<00:02:09.539> cool<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.140> I

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
so the dial is really really cool and I

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.250 
so the dial is really really cool and I
don't<00:02:11.099> remember<00:02:11.340> specifically<00:02:11.970> how<00:02:12.629> it<00:02:12.989> was

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
don't remember specifically how it was

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.120 
don't remember specifically how it was
purred

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
purred

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.880 
purred
but<00:02:14.670> they<00:02:14.910> used<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.540> kind<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.380> technique<00:02:16.860> to

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
but they used a kind of a technique to

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.830 
but they used a kind of a technique to
build<00:02:17.340> up<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.790> layers<00:02:17.820> there<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.540> make<00:02:18.690> it

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
build up the layers there to make it

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.730 
build up the layers there to make it
look<00:02:18.990> like<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.290> was<00:02:19.410> pixels<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.430> detailing<00:02:21.270> is

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
look like it was pixels so detailing is

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.530 
look like it was pixels so detailing is
really<00:02:22.740> really<00:02:23.010> fantastic<00:02:23.810> in<00:02:24.810> terms<00:02:25.320> of<00:02:26.540> just

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
really really fantastic in terms of just

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.690 
really really fantastic in terms of just
sort<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.080> how<00:02:28.350> first<00:02:28.740> it's<00:02:28.950> three-dimensional

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
sort of how first it's three-dimensional

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.340 
sort of how first it's three-dimensional
and<00:02:29.910> then<00:02:30.300> you<00:02:30.450> I'm<00:02:30.630> just<00:02:30.780> turning<00:02:30.960> here<00:02:31.290> as

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
and then you I'm just turning here as

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.600 
and then you I'm just turning here as
you<00:02:31.410> can<00:02:31.470> see<00:02:31.560> in<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.860> light<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.280> different

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
you can see in the light the different

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.820 
you can see in the light the different
textures<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.540> it's<00:02:33.690> not<00:02:33.900> just<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.440> matter<00:02:34.680> of

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
textures so it's not just a matter of

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.350 
textures so it's not just a matter of
being<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:37.050> looking<00:02:37.620> like<00:02:37.890> pac-man<00:02:38.400> but<00:02:39.210> also

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
being the looking like pac-man but also

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.080 
being the looking like pac-man but also
having<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.080> various<00:02:40.530> types<00:02:40.860> of

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
having the various types of

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.650 
having the various types of
three-dimensional<00:02:42.090> look<00:02:42.180> there<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.510> making

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
three-dimensional look there and making

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.300 
three-dimensional look there and making
it<00:02:42.750> look<00:02:42.840> nice<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.620> can<00:02:43.770> see<00:02:43.950> there<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.190> the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
it look nice you can see there that the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.370 
it look nice you can see there that the
ghost<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.910> pac-man<00:02:45.150> are<00:02:45.450> applied<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:46.140> best

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
ghost and pac-man are applied the best

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.620 
ghost and pac-man are applied the best
thing<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.250> don't<00:02:48.150> really<00:02:48.390> think<00:02:48.480> I

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
thing is and I I don't really think I

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.560 
thing is and I I don't really think I
can<00:02:48.780> show<00:02:48.960> you<00:02:49.020> here<00:02:49.350> but<00:02:49.820> mmm<00:02:50.820> yeah<00:02:51.120> the

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
can show you here but mmm yeah the

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.440 
can show you here but mmm yeah the
pac-man<00:02:52.320> in<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.070> different<00:02:53.430> ghosts<00:02:53.790> are<00:02:53.910> loom

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
pac-man in the different ghosts are loom

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.680 
pac-man in the different ghosts are loom
filled<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.590> they<00:02:55.770> glow<00:02:56.130> in<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:57.120> dark<00:02:57.360> which<00:02:57.570> is

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
filled so they glow in the dark which is

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.510 
filled so they glow in the dark which is
really<00:02:57.930> really<00:02:58.080> neat<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:59.010> like<00:02:59.130> I<00:02:59.250> said<00:02:59.430> the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
really really neat and like I said the

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.280 
really really neat and like I said the
detailing<00:02:59.940> was<00:03:00.030> really<00:03:00.270> great<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.780> look<00:03:01.170> at

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
detailing was really great you look at

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.140 
detailing was really great you look at
the<00:03:01.380> eyes<00:03:01.560> closely<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.490> you<00:03:02.580> can<00:03:02.730> see<00:03:02.940> that

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
the eyes closely and you can see that

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.360 
the eyes closely and you can see that
it's<00:03:03.330> just<00:03:03.480> it's<00:03:03.690> definitely<00:03:04.380> has<00:03:04.800> a<00:03:04.830> look<00:03:05.220> of

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
it's just it's definitely has a look of

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.810 
it's just it's definitely has a look of
pixels<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.300> it's<00:03:07.230> just<00:03:07.470> very<00:03:07.500> very<00:03:07.710> crisp<00:03:08.220> one

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
pixels and it's just very very crisp one

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.480 
pixels and it's just very very crisp one
thing<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.960> in<00:03:10.200> my<00:03:10.410> opinion<00:03:10.620> they<00:03:11.040> did<00:03:11.220> really

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
thing that in my opinion they did really

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.140 
thing that in my opinion they did really
really<00:03:11.940> wrong<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.830> to<00:03:13.830> not<00:03:13.980> make<00:03:14.190> pac-man<00:03:14.730> spin

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
really wrong is to not make pac-man spin

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
really wrong is to not make pac-man spin
around<00:03:15.270> as<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:16.170> seconds<00:03:16.560> hand<00:03:16.880> it's<00:03:17.880> he<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:19.020> in

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
around as the seconds hand it's he is in

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.250 
around as the seconds hand it's he is in
the<00:03:19.290> exact<00:03:19.680> position<00:03:19.980> that<00:03:20.810> he<00:03:21.810> would<00:03:21.960> need<00:03:22.140> to

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
the exact position that he would need to

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.990 
the exact position that he would need to
be<00:03:22.470> for<00:03:22.800> the<00:03:22.890> subsidiary<00:03:23.220> seconds<00:03:23.820> hand

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
be for the subsidiary seconds hand

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.300 
be for the subsidiary seconds hand
especially<00:03:24.480> with<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.260> concept<00:03:25.680> of<00:03:25.800> movements

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
especially with the concept of movements

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.490 
especially with the concept of movements
that<00:03:26.460> remains<00:03:27.300> or<00:03:27.450> amuses<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:27.960> lot<00:03:28.200> so<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.410> think

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
that remains or amuses a lot so I think

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.200 
that remains or amuses a lot so I think
it<00:03:28.710> was<00:03:28.800> very<00:03:28.860> strange<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:29.670> they<00:03:29.820> decided

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
it was very strange that they decided

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.590 
it was very strange that they decided
not<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.540> make<00:03:31.040> pac-man<00:03:32.040> spin<00:03:32.430> around<00:03:32.610> like<00:03:33.120> us

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
not to make pac-man spin around like us

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.910 
not to make pac-man spin around like us
like<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:33.930> second<00:03:34.380> hand<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.590> think<00:03:34.680> they've<00:03:34.890> been

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
like a second hand I think they've been

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.950 
like a second hand I think they've been
a<00:03:35.010> really<00:03:35.220> great<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.550> do<00:03:35.670> but<00:03:36.210> they<00:03:36.330> didn't<00:03:36.690> oh

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
a really great to do but they didn't oh

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.630 
a really great to do but they didn't oh
well<00:03:37.500> maybe<00:03:37.740> they'll<00:03:37.980> do<00:03:38.100> that<00:03:38.220> next<00:03:38.430> time

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
well maybe they'll do that next time

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.820 
well maybe they'll do that next time
around<00:03:38.760> so<00:03:38.970> let's<00:03:39.060> get<00:03:39.210> that<00:03:39.360> on<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.600> wrists

makes it interesting and definitely

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.900 
makes it interesting and definitely
helps<00:04:04.110> reduce<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.830> visual<00:04:05.040> mass<00:04:05.550> because

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
helps reduce the visual mass because

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.400 
helps reduce the visual mass because
otherwise<00:04:06.120> if<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:06.570> was<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:06.720> brighter<00:04:07.020> colored

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
otherwise if it was a brighter colored

hard to see unfortunately there are no
real<00:04:13.470> our<00:04:13.680> indicators<00:04:14.400> there<00:04:14.610> other<00:04:14.790> than<00:04:15.030> the

real our indicators there other than the

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
argit logo up there 12 o'clock but I

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.120 
argit logo up there 12 o'clock but I
think<00:04:18.150> overall<00:04:18.590> it's<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.650> very<00:04:19.859> interesting

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
think overall it's a very interesting

watch<00:04:20.580> this<00:04:21.540> particular<00:04:22.169> version<00:04:22.590> so<00:04:22.740> there's

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
watch this particular version so there's

four<00:04:23.130> of<00:04:23.160> them<00:04:23.370> I<00:04:23.460> believe<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:23.880> each<00:04:24.000> one<00:04:24.210> is

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
four of them I believe and each one is

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.690 
four of them I believe and each one is
limited<00:04:24.660> to

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
limited to

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.480 
limited to
believe<00:04:25.910> 20<00:04:26.390> pieces<00:04:26.870> each<00:04:27.410> so<00:04:27.800> that's<00:04:27.980> only<00:04:28.160> 80

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
believe 20 pieces each so that's only 80

pieces in the entire set which is a very
very<00:04:31.010> low<00:04:31.220> number<00:04:31.250> but<00:04:31.760> they<00:04:32.030> are<00:04:32.150> quite

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
very low number but they are quite

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.920 
very low number but they are quite
expensive

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
expensive
