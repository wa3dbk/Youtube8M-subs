the other end of the pipe out so just

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.510 
the other end of the pipe out so just
remove<00:01:09.870> these<00:01:10.080> screws<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.800> whoop<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.250> that's

pulled all the packing off the tip and

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.470 
pulled all the packing off the tip and
this<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:26.100> rest<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.670> going<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:26.940> end<00:02:27.240> up

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
this the the rest is going to end up

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.630 
this the the rest is going to end up
going<00:02:27.840> like<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:28.530> but<00:02:28.830> since<00:02:29.130> this<00:02:29.310> piece

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
going like this but since this piece

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.030 
going like this but since this piece
actually<00:02:29.940> fits<00:02:30.480> into<00:02:30.870> here<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:31.800> won't

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
actually fits into here and this won't

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.890 
actually fits into here and this won't
mold<00:02:32.400> over<00:02:32.610> what<00:02:32.970> we're<00:02:33.120> going<00:02:33.240> to<00:02:33.330> do<00:02:33.510> is<00:02:33.630> cut

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
mold over what we're going to do is cut

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.199 
mold over what we're going to do is cut
this<00:02:34.080> outer<00:02:34.380> ring<00:02:34.890> off<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:35.490> we<00:02:35.640> can<00:02:35.819> mold<00:02:36.060> the

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
this outer ring off so we can mold the

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.040 
this outer ring off so we can mold the
screen<00:02:36.600> over<00:02:37.610> okay<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.970> just<00:02:39.090> clip<00:02:39.750> this

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
screen over okay so I just clip this

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.520 
screen over okay so I just clip this
just<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.590> little<00:02:40.800> bit<00:02:40.950> here<00:02:41.520> with<00:02:41.760> some<00:02:42.530> dikes

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
just a little bit here with some dikes

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.600 
just a little bit here with some dikes
and<00:02:44.120> it<00:02:45.120> allows<00:02:45.480> this<00:02:45.959> screen<00:02:47.300> just<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.599> peel

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
and it allows this screen just to peel

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.640 
and it allows this screen just to peel
out<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.910> here

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
out of here

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.160 
out of here
all<00:02:53.640> right<00:02:53.849> so<00:02:54.180> we<00:02:54.360> got<00:02:55.310> we<00:02:56.310> got<00:02:56.519> that<00:02:56.790> off<00:02:57.170> what

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
all right so we got we got that off what

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.140 
all right so we got we got that off what
this<00:02:58.379> is<00:02:58.530> going<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.829> do<00:02:58.950> is<00:02:59.159> this<00:02:59.370> basically

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
this is going to do is this basically

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.309 
this is going to do is this basically
can<00:03:00.450> go<00:03:00.659> here<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:02.540> I'm<00:03:03.540> just<00:03:03.780> going<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:03.989> mold

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
can go here and I'm just going to mold

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:11.990 
can go here and I'm just going to mold
that<00:03:05.810> around<00:03:06.810> like<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:09.799> hopefully<00:03:10.799> it<00:03:11.670> will

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
that around like that hopefully it will

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.640 
that around like that hopefully it will
allow<00:03:12.689> this<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:14.310> pinch<00:03:16.609> like<00:03:17.609> it<00:03:17.849> does<00:03:18.650> right

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
allow this to pinch like it does right

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.259 
allow this to pinch like it does right
in<00:03:19.829> there<00:03:21.349> so<00:03:22.349> you<00:03:22.920> can<00:03:22.950> see<00:03:23.370> inside<00:03:23.760> of<00:03:23.819> there

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
in there so you can see inside of there

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.680 
in there so you can see inside of there
what<00:03:25.019> it's<00:03:25.170> going<00:03:25.319> to<00:03:25.379> look<00:03:25.470> like<00:03:26.540> all<00:03:27.540> right

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
what it's going to look like all right

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.470 
what it's going to look like all right
so<00:03:27.930> we've<00:03:28.079> got<00:03:28.349> it<00:03:28.530> all<00:03:28.790> pressed<00:03:29.790> around<00:03:29.970> there

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
so we've got it all pressed around there

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.720 
so we've got it all pressed around there
we're<00:03:30.720> just<00:03:30.930> going<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.139> put<00:03:31.409> our<00:03:31.440> packing<00:03:32.190> back
