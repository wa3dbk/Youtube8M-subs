00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
that that I came across is this w7i

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.399 
that that I came across is this w7i
sticks<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.879> got<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.270> ages<00:01:03.870> ago<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
sticks and I got this ages ago in the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.440 
sticks and I got this ages ago in the
pound<00:01:04.680> shop<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:05.220> pound<00:01:05.610> world<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.939> think<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.270> was

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
pound shop in pound world I think it was

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.770 
pound shop in pound world I think it was
and<00:01:07.790> when<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.850> got<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.090> back<00:01:09.210> home<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.600> thought

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
and when I got it back home I thought

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.000 
and when I got it back home I thought
I'm<00:01:09.869> sure<00:01:10.020> I've<00:01:10.140> got<00:01:10.200> something<00:01:10.619> very<00:01:10.650> very

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
I'm sure I've got something very very

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.590 
I'm sure I've got something very very
similar<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.670> want<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> put<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.270> two<00:01:12.420> together

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
similar I want to put the two together

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.719 
similar I want to put the two together
they<00:01:13.140> do<00:01:13.290> look<00:01:13.500> very<00:01:13.530> similar<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.369> just<00:01:14.580> put

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
they do look very similar and I just put

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.170 
they do look very similar and I just put
this<00:01:14.880> one<00:01:15.119> at<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> side<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:17.490> NYX<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:18.060> to

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
this one at the side of the NYX just to

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.870 
this one at the side of the NYX just to
show<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:21.290> so<00:01:22.290> hopefully<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.130> see<00:01:23.340> I

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
show you so hopefully you can see I

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.350 
show you so hopefully you can see I
think<00:01:24.090> I'll<00:01:24.360> put<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.750> bad<00:01:24.960> place<00:01:25.259> but<00:01:26.360> and

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
think I'll put it in a bad place but and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.499 
think I'll put it in a bad place but and
this<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.900> twist<00:01:28.409> up<00:01:28.619> one<00:01:28.799> as<00:01:29.250> well<00:01:29.549> which<00:01:30.360> is

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
this is a twist up one as well which is

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.289 
this is a twist up one as well which is
always<00:01:30.689> handy<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.520> white<00:01:32.820> pearl

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
always handy and this is in white pearl

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.240 
always handy and this is in white pearl
I<00:01:33.509> think<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:35.119> is<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.930> w7<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.009> this

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
I think and that is the w7 one and this

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.030 
I think and that is the w7 one and this
is<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.820> next<00:01:39.119> one<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:40.380> don't<00:01:40.710> think<00:01:40.950> you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
is the next one and I don't think you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.219 
is the next one and I don't think you
can<00:01:41.189> really<00:01:41.340> see<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.909> yeah<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.479> because

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
can really see you can yeah and because

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.289 
can really see you can yeah and because
of<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.470> glare<00:01:45.950> well<00:01:46.950> yeah<00:01:47.159> that's

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
of the glare well yeah that's

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.230 
of the glare well yeah that's
the<00:01:49.109> color<00:01:49.380> there<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.890> they<00:01:50.429> do<00:01:50.640> look<00:01:50.850> very

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
the color there and they do look very

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.910 
the color there and they do look very
very<00:01:51.329> similar<00:01:51.570> but<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.140> would<00:01:52.350> say<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.829> they

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
very similar but I would say that they

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.249 
very similar but I would say that they
are<00:01:53.070> very<00:01:53.250> different<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.939> texture<00:01:54.359> the<00:01:54.990> next

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
are very different in texture the next

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.980 
are very different in texture the next
one<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.649> very<00:01:56.520> soft<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.149> creaming<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.780> just

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
one is very soft and creaming it just

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.160 
one is very soft and creaming it just
glides<00:01:58.320> onto<00:01:58.590> your<00:01:58.829> skin<00:01:59.479> whereas<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.869> one

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
glides onto your skin whereas this one

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.889 
glides onto your skin whereas this one
the<00:02:01.560> w7<00:02:02.219> one<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.819> little<00:02:03.090> bit<00:02:03.299> harder<00:02:03.719> and

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
the w7 one is a little bit harder and

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.959 
the w7 one is a little bit harder and
you<00:02:03.960> do<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.259> work<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.500> little<00:02:04.619> bit<00:02:04.860> more<00:02:05.250> to

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
you do have to work a little bit more to

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.889 
you do have to work a little bit more to
get<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.210> color<00:02:07.099> payoff<00:02:08.099> but<00:02:08.660> equally<00:02:09.660> both

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
get the color payoff but equally both

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.839 
get the color payoff but equally both
it's<00:02:10.140> good<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:11.400> definitely<00:02:11.610> recommend

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
it's good and I definitely recommend

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.240 
it's good and I definitely recommend
them<00:02:12.330> both<00:02:12.540> but<00:02:13.410> it<00:02:13.500> was<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.769> I<00:02:13.799> show<00:02:14.069> you

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
them both but it was that I show you

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.470 
them both but it was that I show you
just<00:02:14.489> in<00:02:14.640> case<00:02:14.819> you're<00:02:14.940> struggling<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.299> get

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
just in case you're struggling to get

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.000 
just in case you're struggling to get
