00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
lot for it like here at the college but

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.959 
lot for it like here at the college but
as<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.870> see<00:00:37.260> behind<00:00:37.590> me<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:38.010> am<00:00:38.250> sitting<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.910> my

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
as you see behind me I am sitting in my

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.319 
as you see behind me I am sitting in my
dorm<00:00:39.350> this<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.500> one<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.770> two<00:00:41.300> windows<00:00:42.300> that

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
dorm this is one of the two windows that

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.030 
dorm this is one of the two windows that
I<00:00:42.629> have<00:00:42.870> I'll<00:00:43.140> give<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> peek<00:00:43.649> out<00:00:43.800> there<00:00:43.950> in

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
I have I'll give you a peek out there in

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.840 
I have I'll give you a peek out there in
a<00:00:44.070> second<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:45.200> it's<00:00:46.200> pretty<00:00:46.440> small<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.250> think

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
a second but it's pretty small I think

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.150 
a second but it's pretty small I think
out<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.180> all<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> people<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.719> I'm<00:00:49.469> living

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
out of all the people that I'm living

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.069 
out of all the people that I'm living
with<00:00:50.309> on<00:00:50.489> my<00:00:50.640> floor<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> smallest<00:00:51.780> one

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
with on my floor I have the smallest one

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.029 
with on my floor I have the smallest one
but<00:00:52.350> that's<00:00:52.469> quite<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.860> by<00:00:52.949> chance<00:00:55.010> one<00:00:56.010> of

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
but that's quite just by chance one of

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.470 
but that's quite just by chance one of
the<00:00:56.190> guys<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.520> think<00:00:56.879> two<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.180> them<00:00:57.300> might<00:00:57.449> have

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
the guys I think two of them might have

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.799 
the guys I think two of them might have
sinks<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.289> one<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.500> them<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.770> frigerator<00:00:59.039> so

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
sinks and one of them is a frigerator so

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.599 
sinks and one of them is a frigerator so
it's<00:01:00.809> nice<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.500> them<00:01:01.680> we'll<00:01:02.280> probably<00:01:02.430> all

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
it's nice for them we'll probably all

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.289 
it's nice for them we'll probably all
share<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.030> frigerator<00:01:03.420> though<00:01:05.119> you<00:01:06.119> might

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
share the frigerator though you might

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.490 
share the frigerator though you might
hear<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> buzzing<00:01:06.810> noise<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> background

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
hear a buzzing noise in the background

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.370 
hear a buzzing noise in the background
that's<00:01:07.830> because<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.400> temperature<00:01:08.850> today<00:01:09.750> has

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
that's because the temperature today has

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.010 
that's because the temperature today has
been<00:01:11.990> about<00:01:12.990> 88<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.220> 91<00:01:15.000> degrees<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.900> tomorrow

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
been about 88 to 91 degrees and tomorrow

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.340 
been about 88 to 91 degrees and tomorrow
it's<00:01:16.380> expected<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.860> be<00:01:17.009> even<00:01:17.400> warmer<00:01:17.580> and

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
it's expected to be even warmer and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.270 
it's expected to be even warmer and
someday<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:19.439> supposed<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.740> cool<00:01:19.920> off<00:01:20.070> down

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
someday it's supposed to cool off down

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.830 
someday it's supposed to cool off down
to<00:01:20.310> about<00:01:21.470> mid<00:01:22.470> low<00:01:22.920> 80s<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:24.299> pretty<00:01:24.570> hot

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
would think in the u.s. so it does have

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.570

a<00:03:10.940> chapel<00:03:11.270> he<00:03:11.990> does<00:03:12.230> have<00:03:12.500> nuns<00:03:12.830> and<00:03:13.130> monks<00:03:13.190> you

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
a chapel he does have nuns and monks you
