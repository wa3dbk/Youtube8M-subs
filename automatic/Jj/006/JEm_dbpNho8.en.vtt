you<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:55.260> gap<00:02:55.560> between<00:02:55.920> where<00:02:56.579> you<00:02:56.609> are<00:02:56.910> and

you the gap between where you are and

you the gap between where you are and

with realism it needs to be filled with
possibility<00:03:05.180> because<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.420> gap<00:03:06.720> is<00:03:07.049> the
