00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.990 
so mom liked the torque which came in
this<00:01:43.200> case<00:01:43.470> from<00:01:43.619> Hondas<00:01:43.950> 2.4<00:01:44.549> liter<00:01:44.759> earth

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
this case from Hondas 2.4 liter earth

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.090 
this case from Hondas 2.4 liter earth
dreams<00:01:45.329> 4-cylinder<00:01:46.140> engine<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.710> doesn't

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
dreams 4-cylinder engine it doesn't

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.560 
dreams 4-cylinder engine it doesn't
shoot<00:01:47.250> rainbows<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.880> saplings<00:01:48.299> from<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
shoot rainbows and saplings from the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.330 
shoot rainbows and saplings from the
tailpipes<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.380> name<00:01:49.500> implies<00:01:49.530> but<00:01:50.130> it's

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
tailpipes like the name implies but it's

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.280 
tailpipes like the name implies but it's
very<00:01:50.460> clean<00:01:50.850> promises<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.600> be<00:01:51.689> great<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:52.020> fuel

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
very clean promises to be great on fuel

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.200 
very clean promises to be great on fuel
and<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.680> remarkably<00:01:53.189> athletic<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:54.030> get

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
and it is remarkably athletic you get

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.539 
and it is remarkably athletic you get
190<00:01:54.899> horsepower<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.590> with<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.979> new<00:01:56.100> CVT

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
190 horsepower and with a new CVT

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.910 
190 horsepower and with a new CVT
transmission<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.689> uses<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.079> power<00:01:58.350> very

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
transmission it uses that power very

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.850 
transmission it uses that power very
very<00:01:59.189> well<00:01:59.430> so<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> CVT<00:02:00.840> are<00:02:01.200> continually

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
very well so a CVT are continually

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.380 
very well so a CVT are continually
variable<00:02:02.280> transmission<00:02:02.880> that's<00:02:03.030> kind<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.299> a

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
variable transmission that's kind of a

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.060 
variable transmission that's kind of a
new<00:02:03.570> thing<00:02:03.810> for<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.110> Accord<00:02:04.439> all<00:02:04.799> you've<00:02:04.979> got

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
new thing for the Accord all you've got

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.560 
new thing for the Accord all you've got
to<00:02:05.159> know<00:02:05.280> if<00:02:05.399> someone<00:02:05.729> driving<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.390> that

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
to know if someone driving it is that

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.119 
to know if someone driving it is that
basically<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.229> feels<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.770> like<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.009> really

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
basically it feels just like a really

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.040 
basically it feels just like a really
smooth<00:02:08.520> shifting

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
smooth shifting

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.110 
smooth shifting
automatic<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.650> doesn't<00:02:09.920> actually<00:02:10.430> have<00:02:10.910> any

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
automatic it doesn't actually have any

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.300 
automatic it doesn't actually have any
gear<00:02:11.330> so<00:02:11.570> it<00:02:11.660> delivers<00:02:11.840> power<00:02:12.230> on<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:12.800> smooth

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
gear so it delivers power on a smooth

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.100 
gear so it delivers power on a smooth
and<00:02:13.550> endless<00:02:13.670> surge<00:02:14.240> but<00:02:14.450> when<00:02:14.600> you<00:02:14.690> put<00:02:14.990> your

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
and endless surge but when you put your

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.790 
and endless surge but when you put your
foot<00:02:15.380> down

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
foot down

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.310 
foot down
it<00:02:15.980> sort<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.370> pretends<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.030> downshift<00:02:17.270> so<00:02:17.810> nine

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
it sort of pretends to downshift so nine

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.780 
it sort of pretends to downshift so nine
times<00:02:18.350> out<00:02:18.740> of<00:02:18.770> ten<00:02:19.010> this<00:02:19.160> just<00:02:19.370> feels<00:02:19.490> like<00:02:19.670> a

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
times out of ten this just feels like a

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.310 
times out of ten this just feels like a
really<00:02:19.880> smooth<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.570> really<00:02:20.690> responsive

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
really smooth and really responsive

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.350 
really smooth and really responsive
automatic<00:02:21.770> transmission<00:02:22.340> there's<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.150> bigger

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
automatic transmission there's a bigger

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.420 
automatic transmission there's a bigger

v6 engine available if the four-cylinder
somehow<00:02:25.790> isn't<00:02:26.030> enough<00:02:26.420> but<00:02:26.780> most<00:02:26.960> folks<00:02:27.200> on<00:02:27.380> a

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
somehow isn't enough but most folks on a

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.080 
somehow isn't enough but most folks on a
test<00:02:27.710> drive<00:02:27.770> will<00:02:28.070> find<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.400> smaller<00:02:28.670> engine

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
test drive will find the smaller engine

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.580 
test drive will find the smaller engine
just<00:02:29.270> fine<00:02:29.570> when<00:02:29.990> it<00:02:30.080> came<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.410> power

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
just fine when it came to the power
