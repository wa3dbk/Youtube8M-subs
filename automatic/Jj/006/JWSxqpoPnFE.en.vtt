00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
to me was the feel and comfort of the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.539 
to me was the feel and comfort of the
ball<00:01:39.540> when<00:01:39.750> receiving<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.290> pass<00:01:40.500> or<00:01:40.890> making<00:01:41.460> a

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
ball when receiving a pass or making a

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.550 
ball when receiving a pass or making a
touch<00:01:41.790> some<00:01:42.600> boots<00:01:42.840> feel<00:01:43.079> like<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.439> will

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
touch some boots feel like you will

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.530 
touch some boots feel like you will
restrict<00:01:44.009> with<00:01:44.280> your<00:01:44.430> touch<00:01:44.729> they<00:01:45.119> may<00:01:45.299> seem

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
restrict with your touch they may seem

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.660 
restrict with your touch they may seem
too<00:01:45.810> bulky<00:01:46.110> they<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:47.040> don't<00:01:47.250> get<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.490> good

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
too bulky they just don't get a good

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.969 
too bulky they just don't get a good
feel<00:01:47.880> for<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.060> ball<00:01:48.329> these<00:01:49.049> boots<00:01:49.320> are<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
feel for the ball these boots are the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.160 
feel for the ball these boots are the
opposite<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.850> if<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.329> make<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> pass<00:01:51.899> or

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
opposite of that if you make a pass or

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.139 
opposite of that if you make a pass or
touch<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.710> really<00:01:53.070> does<00:01:53.310> feel<00:01:53.610> as<00:01:53.850> if<00:01:54.000> you're

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
touch it really does feel as if you're

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.420

was<00:02:50.100> that<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.790> colors<00:02:51.150> have<00:02:51.300> faded<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.780> little

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
was that the colors have faded a little

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.690 
was that the colors have faded a little
and<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:52.590> doesn't<00:02:52.920> bother<00:02:53.040> me<00:02:53.160> too<00:02:53.280> much

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
and this doesn't bother me too much

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.490 
and this doesn't bother me too much
because<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:54.209> know<00:02:54.270> with<00:02:54.600> bright<00:02:54.900> colored<00:02:55.320> boots

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
because I know with bright colored boots

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.560 
because I know with bright colored boots
such<00:02:55.770> as<00:02:55.920> these<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.640> color<00:02:56.940> fading<00:02:57.330> does

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
such as these and color fading does

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.050 
such as these and color fading does
happen<00:02:58.050> after<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.500> little<00:02:58.800> while<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.880> only

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
happen after a little while the only

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.850 
happen after a little while the only
other<00:03:00.360> noticeable<00:03:00.930> change<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.739> the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
other noticeable change is that the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.800 
other noticeable change is that the
stripes<00:03:02.280> on<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.700> side<00:03:03.060> of<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.330> boot<00:03:03.510> where

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
stripes on the side of the boot where

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.150 
stripes on the side of the boot where
you<00:03:03.959> strike<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.530> ball<00:03:04.680> when<00:03:04.830> you<00:03:04.920> pass<00:03:05.130> the

ball have rubbed off slightly this is

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.680 
ball have rubbed off slightly this is
only<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.100> visual<00:03:08.310> change<00:03:08.820> so<00:03:09.300> this<00:03:09.480> won't

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
only a visual change so this won't

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.150 
only a visual change so this won't
change<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.290> performance<00:03:10.470> of<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.130> overall

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
change the performance of the overall

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.970 
change the performance of the overall
boot<00:03:12.050> there<00:03:13.050> isn't<00:03:13.320> any<00:03:13.440> big<00:03:13.650> disadvantage

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
boot there isn't any big disadvantage

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.580 
boot there isn't any big disadvantage
with<00:03:14.520> these<00:03:14.760> boots<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.390> only<00:03:15.660> area<00:03:16.080> from<00:03:16.290> whom
