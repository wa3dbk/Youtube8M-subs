that main reasons offensively well I
think<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:34.260> think<00:03:34.560> one<00:03:34.950> I<00:03:35.190> think<00:03:35.519> we're<00:03:35.700> faster

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
think I think one I think we're faster

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.899 
think I think one I think we're faster
or<00:03:36.930> stronger<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.620> think<00:03:38.190> Taylor's<00:03:38.370> faster

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
or stronger I think Taylor's faster

or stronger I think Taylor's faster
stronger<00:03:39.260> got<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.290> lot<00:03:40.379> of<00:03:40.409> confidence<00:03:40.769> the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
stronger got a lot of confidence the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.379 
stronger got a lot of confidence the
other<00:03:41.069> two<00:03:41.190> guys<00:03:41.340> behind<00:03:41.579> him<00:03:41.760> as<00:03:41.970> well<00:03:42.150> better

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
other two guys behind him as well better

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.750 
other two guys behind him as well better
faster<00:03:42.810> stronger<00:03:43.049> Marion<00:03:43.829> Grice<00:03:44.010> is<00:03:44.280> faster

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
faster stronger Marion Grice is faster

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.119 
faster stronger Marion Grice is faster
stronger<00:03:45.060> DJ<00:03:45.989> Foster's<00:03:46.409> faster<00:03:46.859> and<00:03:46.950> stronger

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
stronger DJ Foster's faster and stronger

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.879 
stronger DJ Foster's faster and stronger
so<00:03:47.879> we've<00:03:48.180> really<00:03:48.659> developed<00:03:49.200> our<00:03:49.379> personnel

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
so we've really developed our personnel

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.800 
so we've really developed our personnel
and<00:03:50.190> then<00:03:50.609> we<00:03:50.730> have<00:03:50.849> some<00:03:51.000> dynamic<00:03:51.389> gas<00:03:51.540> coming

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
and then we have some dynamic gas coming

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.660 
and then we have some dynamic gas coming
in<00:03:51.989> that<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:52.739> think<00:03:52.829> they're<00:03:53.190> really<00:03:53.340> going<00:03:53.579> to

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
in that I think they're really going to

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.720 
in that I think they're really going to

the same game left foot opponent so it

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.360 
the same game left foot opponent so it
does<00:05:35.169> have<00:05:35.200> a<00:05:35.380> different<00:05:35.710> spin<00:05:35.890> to<00:05:36.130> it<00:05:36.160> and

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
does have a different spin to it and

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.040 
does have a different spin to it and
it's<00:05:36.490> tough<00:05:36.669> to<00:05:36.820> handle<00:05:36.910> it's<00:05:37.630> different<00:05:37.990> you
