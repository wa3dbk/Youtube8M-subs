my other video I had a blue piece for a

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.350 
my other video I had a blue piece for a
reservoir<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.370> they've<00:00:35.640> color-coded<00:00:36.270> all

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
reservoir so they've color-coded all

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.049 
reservoir so they've color-coded all

as<00:01:23.490> usual<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.240> EK<00:01:24.630> they<00:01:24.990> they<00:01:25.439> print<00:01:25.740> out

these<00:01:34.880> it's<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.970> little<00:01:36.390> hardware<00:01:36.659> bag<00:01:37.020> ok<00:01:37.950> so

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
these it's a little hardware bag ok so

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.800 
these it's a little hardware bag ok so
here<00:01:39.450> are<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.689> little<00:01:40.020> paper<00:01:40.560> washers<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:42.720> i

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
here are the little paper washers and i

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.840 
here are the little paper washers and i
believe<00:01:43.259> these<00:01:43.530> are<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> screws<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.700> that

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
believe these are for the screws so that

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.639 
believe these are for the screws so that
they<00:01:44.939> don't<00:01:45.060> damage<00:01:45.420> them<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.170> motherboard

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
they don't damage them the motherboard

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.100 
they don't damage them the motherboard
when<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.950> mount<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:48.600> there<00:01:48.930> are<00:01:49.020> also

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
when you mount it and there are also

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.499 
when you mount it and there are also
some<00:01:49.530> standoffs<00:01:50.189> here<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:51.180> see<00:01:51.210> these

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
some standoffs here if you see these

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.580 
some standoffs here if you see these
little<00:01:51.810> plastic<00:01:52.049> rings<00:01:54.079> and<00:01:55.079> those<00:01:55.259> are<00:01:55.439> two

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
little plastic rings and those are two

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.190 
little plastic rings and those are two
to<00:01:56.430> go<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.729> cover<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.329> gaps<00:01:57.570> between<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
to go to cover the gaps between the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.649 
to go to cover the gaps between the
board<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.159> water<00:01:59.549> block<00:02:00.119> when<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.479> mount

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
board and the water block when you mount

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.529 
board and the water block when you mount
it<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:03.049> they<00:02:04.049> include<00:02:04.200> an<00:02:04.590> ounce<00:02:04.740> for<00:02:05.009> as<00:02:05.280> well

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.210 

here's<00:02:08.539> a<00:02:08.599> bracket<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:09.410> get<00:02:09.590> on<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:09.830> bottom<00:02:10.099> of

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
here's a bracket to get on the bottom of

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.640 
here's a bracket to get on the bottom of
the<00:02:10.280> motherboard<00:02:10.959> so<00:02:11.959> this<00:02:12.110> goes<00:02:12.290> under<00:02:12.620> the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
the motherboard so this goes under the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.920 
the motherboard so this goes under the
motherboard<00:02:13.250> waterblock<00:02:13.970> goes<00:02:14.180> on<00:02:14.330> top<00:02:14.569> and

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
motherboard waterblock goes on top and

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:22.869 
motherboard waterblock goes on top and
then<00:02:15.080> your<00:02:15.230> screws<00:02:15.590> go<00:02:15.890> through<00:02:16.129> this<00:02:21.879> that

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
then your screws go through this that

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:30.580 
then your screws go through this that
piece<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.209> foam<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:27.280> little<00:02:28.280> red<00:02:28.489> piece<00:02:29.590> this

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
piece of foam a little red piece this

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.880 
piece of foam a little red piece this
goes<00:02:30.830> on<00:02:30.860> top<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.610> guess<00:02:31.819> that<00:02:32.090> so<00:02:32.780> here's<00:02:33.769> what

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
goes on top I guess that so here's what

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.309 
goes on top I guess that so here's what
they've<00:02:34.040> done<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.549> can<00:02:37.690> replace<00:02:38.690> this<00:02:38.930> black

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
they've done you can replace this black

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.949 
they've done you can replace this black
piece<00:02:39.620> here<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.040> guess<00:02:40.310> with<00:02:40.610> that<00:02:40.810> let's<00:02:41.810> go

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
piece here I guess with that let's go

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:49.690 
piece here I guess with that let's go
ahead<00:02:41.989> and<00:02:42.110> open<00:02:42.380> this<00:02:42.440> up<00:02:42.709> still<00:02:43.190> sealed<00:02:48.700> want

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
ahead and open this up still sealed want

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.250 
ahead and open this up still sealed want
to<00:02:49.760> try<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.180> touch<00:02:50.360> this<00:02:50.630> as<00:02:50.840> little<00:02:51.170> as

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
to try and touch this as little as

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.490 
to try and touch this as little as
possible<00:02:52.180> it's<00:02:53.180> it's<00:02:53.630> nickel-plated<00:02:54.079> copper

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
possible it's it's nickel-plated copper

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.949 
possible it's it's nickel-plated copper
so<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.310> shouldn't<00:02:55.819> hurt<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.299> touch<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.510> but

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
so it shouldn't hurt it to touch it but

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.430 
so it shouldn't hurt it to touch it but
I<00:02:57.200> figured<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.450> less<00:02:59.450> I<00:02:59.720> touch<00:02:59.750> it<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.260> better

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
I figured the less I touch it the better

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.690 
I figured the less I touch it the better
just<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.370> keep<00:03:01.519> buying<00:03:01.819> oils<00:03:02.239> off<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:03.049> it<00:03:03.700> it

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
just to keep buying oils off of it it

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.720 
just to keep buying oils off of it it
looks<00:03:04.970> pretty<00:03:05.150> clean<00:03:05.540> you<00:03:05.780> can<00:03:05.930> see<00:03:06.140> the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
looks pretty clean you can see the

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.880 
looks pretty clean you can see the
results<00:03:07.730> of<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.910> milling<00:03:08.329> here<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:08.930> it's

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
results of the milling here and it's

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.150 
results of the milling here and it's
different<00:03:10.220> depths<00:03:10.850> and<00:03:11.090> different<00:03:11.510> cuts<00:03:12.160> for

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
different depths and different cuts for

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.809 
different depths and different cuts for
different<00:03:13.459> parts<00:03:13.730> of<00:03:13.819> the<00:03:13.880> motherboard<00:03:15.819> just

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
different parts of the motherboard just

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.509 
different parts of the motherboard just
turn<00:03:16.970> it<00:03:17.000> over<00:03:17.269> on<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.480> other<00:03:17.569> side<00:03:18.220> so<00:03:19.220> this

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
turn it over on the other side so this

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.349 
turn it over on the other side so this
is<00:03:19.549> the<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.959> nickel<00:03:21.410> acetal<00:03:22.269> version<00:03:23.269> and

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
is the the nickel acetal version and

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.420 
is the the nickel acetal version and
this<00:03:26.359> piece<00:03:26.810> obviously<00:03:27.410> you<00:03:27.560> can<00:03:27.709> put<00:03:27.950> here

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
this piece obviously you can put here

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.129 
this piece obviously you can put here
and<00:03:28.639> replace<00:03:28.910> if<00:03:29.239> you<00:03:29.389> want<00:03:29.600> to<00:03:29.750> add<00:03:29.840> some

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
and replace if you want to add some

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.800 
and replace if you want to add some
color<00:03:30.410> this<00:03:31.220> is<00:03:31.340> red<00:03:31.639> to<00:03:31.970> go<00:03:32.120> along<00:03:32.389> with<00:03:32.420> the

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
color this is red to go along with the

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.610 
color this is red to go along with the
ax<00:03:32.840> seuss<00:03:33.310> rampage<00:03:34.310> three<00:03:34.790> extreme<00:03:35.620> matches

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
ax seuss rampage three extreme matches

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.199 
ax seuss rampage three extreme matches
that<00:03:37.269> and<00:03:38.269> then<00:03:38.510> it<00:03:38.660> looks<00:03:38.870> like<00:03:39.790> this<00:03:40.790> piece

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
that and then it looks like this piece

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.440 
that and then it looks like this piece
here<00:03:41.810> you<00:03:42.440> can<00:03:42.739> use<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:43.790> piece<00:03:44.000> off<00:03:44.239> the

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
here you can use the piece off the

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.809 
here you can use the piece off the
motherboard<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.139> put<00:03:45.380> on<00:03:45.560> here<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:46.579> cover

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
motherboard and put on here to cover

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
you're familiar with the board you'll

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.479 
you're familiar with the board you'll
know<00:03:59.150> what<00:03:59.269> I'm<00:03:59.359> talking<00:03:59.389> about<00:04:00.040> and<00:04:01.040> here's

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
know what I'm talking about and here's

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.420 
know what I'm talking about and here's
the<00:04:03.190> ports<00:04:04.419> for<00:04:05.419> your<00:04:05.540> Barb's<00:04:06.019> our

the ports for your Barb's our
compression<00:04:07.430> fittings<00:04:07.970> in<00:04:08.870> this<00:04:09.680> case<00:04:09.919> I'm

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
compression fittings in this case I'm

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.379 
compression fittings in this case I'm
going<00:04:10.160> to<00:04:10.310> be<00:04:10.400> using<00:04:10.609> some<00:04:11.030> bitspower

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
going to be using some bitspower

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.569 
going to be using some bitspower
compression<00:04:12.200> fittings<00:04:12.530> so<00:04:13.220> it<00:04:13.310> looks<00:04:13.519> like

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
compression fittings so it looks like

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.199 
compression fittings so it looks like
this<00:04:14.389> is<00:04:14.570> this<00:04:15.380> goes<00:04:15.590> over<00:04:15.919> the<00:04:16.639> Northbridge

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
this is this goes over the Northbridge

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.129 
this is this goes over the Northbridge
and<00:04:17.660> then

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
and then

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.510 
and then
down<00:04:18.319> and<00:04:19.180> then<00:04:20.180> down<00:04:20.959> along<00:04:21.469> the<00:04:21.709> side<00:04:21.979> so<00:04:22.370> the

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
down and then down along the side so the

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.270 
down and then down along the side so the
CPU<00:04:23.240> is<00:04:23.389> going<00:04:23.569> to<00:04:23.629> go<00:04:23.749> here<00:04:24.050> it's<00:04:24.860> a<00:04:24.949> really

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
CPU is going to go here it's a really

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
CPU is going to go here it's a really
solid<00:04:25.669> piece<00:04:26.150> it's<00:04:27.080> pretty<00:04:27.319> heavy<00:04:28.090> looks<00:04:29.090> like

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
solid piece it's pretty heavy looks like

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.540 
solid piece it's pretty heavy looks like
really<00:04:29.749> good<00:04:29.900> quality<00:04:30.409> though<00:04:30.560> I<00:04:30.889> think<00:04:31.430> it's

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
really good quality though I think it's

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.309 
really good quality though I think it's
going<00:04:31.699> to<00:04:31.759> look<00:04:31.879> really<00:04:31.909> good<00:04:32.330> I'm<00:04:33.139> going<00:04:33.259> to

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:33.319 
going to look really good I'm going to

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.350 
going to look really good I'm going to
