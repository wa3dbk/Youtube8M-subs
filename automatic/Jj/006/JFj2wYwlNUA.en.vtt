00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:03.320 
it's such a beautiful day I thought I

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.410 
it's such a beautiful day I thought I
would<00:00:03.470> check<00:00:03.620> out<00:00:03.830> other<00:00:04.250> aspects<00:00:04.759> of<00:00:04.880> my<00:00:05.029> RV

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.420 
would check out other aspects of my RV

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.900 
would check out other aspects of my RV
and<00:00:05.720> here<00:00:06.259> is<00:00:06.410> a<00:00:06.440> patch<00:00:06.799> job<00:00:07.160> that<00:00:07.400> I<00:00:07.430> did<00:00:07.670> on<00:00:07.880> my

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
and here is a patch job that I did on my

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.940 
and here is a patch job that I did on my
exhaust<00:00:08.510> system<00:00:08.960> I<00:00:09.140> used<00:00:09.710> some<00:00:09.830> of<00:00:09.860> that

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
exhaust system I used some of that

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.220 
exhaust system I used some of that
wraparound<00:00:10.309> bandaging<00:00:11.090> and<00:00:11.360> then<00:00:11.900> I<00:00:12.080> don't

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
wraparound bandaging and then I don't

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.419 
wraparound bandaging and then I don't
know<00:00:12.290> if<00:00:12.380> you<00:00:12.440> could<00:00:12.559> tell<00:00:12.710> but<00:00:12.800> that's<00:00:12.980> a<00:00:13.070> tin

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:13.429 
know if you could tell but that's a tin

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.480 
know if you could tell but that's a tin
can<00:00:13.760> a<00:00:14.120> suit<00:00:14.660> can<00:00:14.900> that's<00:00:15.139> over<00:00:15.380> there<00:00:15.530> there

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
can a suit can that's over there there

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.029 
can a suit can that's over there there
was<00:00:16.850> a<00:00:17.480> piece<00:00:18.020> of<00:00:18.050> metal<00:00:18.380> that<00:00:18.470> was<00:00:18.529> suspended

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
was a piece of metal that was suspended

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.090 
was a piece of metal that was suspended
down<00:00:19.190> from<00:00:19.369> here<00:00:19.730> and<00:00:20.660> it<00:00:20.750> looks<00:00:20.900> like<00:00:21.080> this

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
down from here and it looks like this

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.670 
down from here and it looks like this
it<00:00:22.430> was<00:00:22.609> clipped<00:00:23.060> up<00:00:23.210> there<00:00:23.630> you<00:00:24.140> know<00:00:24.260> through

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
it was clipped up there you know through

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.679 
it was clipped up there you know through
it<00:00:25.039> was<00:00:25.189> threaded<00:00:25.550> through<00:00:25.730> here<00:00:26.000> and<00:00:26.180> then

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
it was threaded through here and then

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.050 
it was threaded through here and then
kind<00:00:27.320> of<00:00:27.439> created<00:00:27.710> a<00:00:27.769> loop<00:00:28.010> that<00:00:28.519> kind<00:00:28.760> of<00:00:28.820> held

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
kind of created a loop that kind of held

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.480 
kind of created a loop that kind of held
this<00:00:29.210> in<00:00:29.449> place<00:00:29.720> and<00:00:30.019> unfortunately<00:00:30.650> it<00:00:31.310> has

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
this in place and unfortunately it has

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.889 
this in place and unfortunately it has
obvious<00:00:31.939> well<00:00:32.090> obviously<00:00:32.569> there's<00:00:32.719> a<00:00:32.780> fair

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
obvious well obviously there's a fair

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.469 
obvious well obviously there's a fair
amount<00:00:33.079> of<00:00:33.109> rust<00:00:33.319> to<00:00:33.739> it<00:00:33.920> so<00:00:34.359> we're<00:00:35.359> gonna

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:35.479 
amount of rust to it so we're gonna

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:40.569 
amount of rust to it so we're gonna
rebuild<00:00:36.139> something<00:00:36.979> like<00:00:37.489> this<00:00:39.549> so<00:00:40.549> I

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
rebuild something like this so I

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.119 
rebuild something like this so I
purchased<00:00:40.940> a<00:00:41.030> piece<00:00:41.179> of<00:00:41.479> metal<00:00:42.199> and<00:00:42.440> this<00:00:42.949> is

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
purchased a piece of metal and this is

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:44.439 
purchased a piece of metal and this is
the<00:00:43.280> label<00:00:43.609> of<00:00:43.729> it<00:00:43.850> it's<00:00:43.969> just<00:00:44.120> a<00:00:44.179> regular

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
the label of it it's just a regular

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.779 
the label of it it's just a regular
piece<00:00:44.600> of<00:00:44.629> metal<00:00:45.049> and<00:00:45.260> I<00:00:45.769> cut<00:00:46.010> it<00:00:46.100> in<00:00:46.190> half<00:00:46.429> I

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
piece of metal and I cut it in half I

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.149 
piece of metal and I cut it in half I
tested<00:00:47.749> it<00:00:47.809> with<00:00:48.019> this<00:00:48.139> piece<00:00:48.379> and<00:00:48.709> it<00:00:49.010> sure

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
tested it with this piece and it sure

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:50.799 
tested it with this piece and it sure
enough<00:00:49.190> will<00:00:49.639> Bend<00:00:50.030> into<00:00:50.299> a<00:00:50.329> nice<00:00:50.510> circle

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
enough will Bend into a nice circle

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.629 
enough will Bend into a nice circle
quite<00:00:51.049> easily<00:00:51.289> but<00:00:52.129> the<00:00:52.219> first<00:00:52.399> thing<00:00:52.549> I'm

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:52.639

quite easily but the first thing I'm
going<00:00:52.729> to<00:00:52.789> do<00:00:52.940> is<00:00:53.179> I've<00:00:53.299> got<00:00:53.329> this<00:00:53.569> piece<00:00:53.780> laid

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:54.049 
going to do is I've got this piece laid

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:55.750 
going to do is I've got this piece laid
out<00:00:54.229> here<00:00:54.499> and<00:00:54.679> clamped<00:00:55.010> down<00:00:55.039> on<00:00:55.129> the<00:00:55.399> table

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
out here and clamped down on the table

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.430 
out here and clamped down on the table
and<00:00:55.909> all<00:00:56.269> I'm<00:00:56.420> doing<00:00:56.659> is<00:00:56.749> I'm<00:00:56.869> taking<00:00:57.229> this

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
and all I'm doing is I'm taking this

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.250 
and all I'm doing is I'm taking this
this<00:00:58.100> nail<00:00:58.489> this<00:00:58.729> tack<00:00:59.059> and<00:00:59.719> I'm<00:00:59.809> just<00:01:00.019> putting

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260

I'm gonna put in those marks first okay
so<00:01:07.280> I've<00:01:07.490> got<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.670> bunch<00:01:08.000> of<00:01:08.090> those<00:01:08.210> little

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479

don't<00:01:08.750> know<00:01:08.869> if<00:01:08.930> you<00:01:08.990> can<00:01:09.109> see<00:01:09.350> them<00:01:09.439> but<00:01:09.530> just

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
don't know if you can see them but just

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.910 
don't know if you can see them but just
these<00:01:09.799> little<00:01:10.640> tiny<00:01:11.000> holes<00:01:11.659> not<00:01:12.530> really<00:01:12.740> hole

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
these little tiny holes not really hole

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.200 
these little tiny holes not really hole
it's<00:01:13.070> just<00:01:13.189> divots<00:01:13.579> and<00:01:13.640> I<00:01:13.759> put<00:01:13.909> them<00:01:13.969> on<00:01:14.090> both

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
it's just divots and I put them on both

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.080 
it's just divots and I put them on both
sides<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:14.869> now<00:01:15.380> I'm<00:01:15.799> going<00:01:16.250> to<00:01:16.340> use<00:01:16.579> those<00:01:16.880> to

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
sides and now I'm going to use those to

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.529 
sides and now I'm going to use those to
guide<00:01:17.240> my<00:01:17.450> drill<00:01:17.719> bit<00:01:17.899> to<00:01:17.929> drill<00:01:18.170> holes<00:01:19.539> okay

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
guide my drill bit to drill holes okay

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:21.969 
guide my drill bit to drill holes okay
the<00:01:20.630> first<00:01:20.780> holes<00:01:21.049> didn't<00:01:21.320> work<00:01:21.500> they<00:01:21.920> were

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
the first holes didn't work they were

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.039 
the first holes didn't work they were
just<00:01:22.219> too<00:01:22.369> small<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:23.030> what<00:01:23.450> would<00:01:23.570> happen<00:01:23.750> is

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
just too small and what would happen is

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.480 
just too small and what would happen is
I<00:01:24.259> would<00:01:24.380> put<00:01:24.469> the<00:01:24.590> drill<00:01:24.799> bit<00:01:24.950> on<00:01:25.070> there<00:01:25.310> and

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
I would put the drill bit on there and

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.480 
I would put the drill bit on there and
it<00:01:25.609> would<00:01:25.700> just<00:01:25.729> still<00:01:26.920> just<00:01:27.920> kind<00:01:28.100> of<00:01:28.189> dance

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
it would just still just kind of dance

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.459 
it would just still just kind of dance
around<00:01:28.670> all<00:01:28.939> over<00:01:28.969> the<00:01:29.210> place<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:29.689> it<00:01:30.109> wasn't

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
around all over the place so it wasn't

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:31.599 
around all over the place so it wasn't
catching<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.829> hole<00:01:31.009> so<00:01:31.159> what<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:31.340> ended<00:01:31.520> up

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
catching the hole so what I ended up

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:33.999 
catching the hole so what I ended up
doing<00:01:31.759> was<00:01:31.909> just<00:01:32.329> taking<00:01:32.689> this<00:01:32.810> screw<00:01:33.200> putting

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
doing was just taking this screw putting

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.260 
doing was just taking this screw putting
it<00:01:34.100> in<00:01:34.189> there<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.520> then<00:01:34.609> you<00:01:34.789> know<00:01:34.820> whacking

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
it in there and then you know whacking

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.730 
it in there and then you know whacking
it<00:01:35.329> with<00:01:35.420> a<00:01:35.450> hammer<00:01:35.749> a<00:01:35.869> number<00:01:36.200> of<00:01:36.320> times<00:01:36.560> to

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
it with a hammer a number of times to

it down off of the table like an
assembly<00:01:46.939> line<00:01:47.149> and<00:01:47.179> then<00:01:47.509> just<00:01:47.539> drill<00:01:48.170> the

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
assembly line and then just drill the

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.039 
assembly line and then just drill the
holes<00:01:49.119> alright<00:01:50.119> first<00:01:50.539> set<00:01:50.719> of<00:01:50.780> holes<00:01:50.899> are

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
holes alright first set of holes are

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.599 
holes alright first set of holes are
drilled<00:01:51.140> now<00:01:51.649> it's<00:01:51.799> time<00:01:51.979> to<00:01:52.100> file<00:01:52.280> them<00:01:52.429> down

gonna it's it's gonna create a nice Bend
to<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.239> so<00:02:39.450> see<00:02:39.720> if<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:39.840> can<00:02:39.930> get<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.080> in<00:02:40.140> the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
to it so see if I can get it in the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.800 
to it so see if I can get it in the
shape<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.470> want

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
shape I want

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.449 
shape I want
well<00:02:42.810> there's<00:02:43.170> one<00:02:43.440> side<00:02:43.739> that<00:02:44.040> was<00:02:44.130> actually

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
well there's one side that was actually

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.000 
well there's one side that was actually
pretty<00:02:44.640> easy<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:45.000> do<00:02:45.270> so<00:02:46.140> now<00:02:46.320> I'm<00:02:46.590> gonna<00:02:46.709> bend

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
pretty easy to do so now I'm gonna bend

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.940 
pretty easy to do so now I'm gonna bend
this<00:02:47.130> side<00:02:47.370> same<00:02:47.940> process<00:02:48.680> put<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.770> in<00:02:49.860> the

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
this side same process put it in the

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.210 
this side same process put it in the
little<00:02:50.070> spot<00:02:50.400> here<00:02:51.800> and<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:52.920> don't<00:02:52.980> want<00:02:53.160> to

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
little spot here and I don't want to

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.440 
little spot here and I don't want to
bend<00:02:53.340> too<00:02:53.489> much<00:02:53.640> from<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.880> beginning<00:02:54.150> because

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450

bend too much from the beginning because
I<00:02:54.540> want<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.810> part<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.140> be<00:02:55.260> straight<00:02:56.180> so<00:02:57.180> then

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
I want that part to be straight so then

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.620 
I want that part to be straight so then
I'll<00:02:57.420> just<00:02:57.480> move<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.840> in<00:02:58.019> end<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.100> up<00:03:02.450> my<00:03:03.450> way

I'll just move it in end it up my way

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.180 
I'll just move it in end it up my way
around<00:03:03.810> here<00:03:04.820> and<00:03:05.820> I'll<00:03:06.299> pull<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.600> out<00:03:06.980> at<00:03:07.980> this

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
around here and I'll pull it out at this

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.380 
around here and I'll pull it out at this
point<00:03:08.400> I'll<00:03:08.549> take<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.760> look<00:03:09.000> at<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.269> I'll

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.180 
next thing I got to do is I got to see I
got<00:03:21.540> a<00:03:21.720> kind<00:03:22.200> of<00:03:22.290> precision<00:03:22.530> measure<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.160> so

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
got a kind of precision measure it so

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.229 
got a kind of precision measure it so
I'll<00:03:23.310> probably<00:03:23.459> have<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.700> come<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:23.970> do<00:03:24.060> some

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
I'll probably have to come and do some

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.150 
I'll probably have to come and do some
more<00:03:24.360> bending<00:03:24.720> but<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.320> should<00:03:25.590> be<00:03:25.680> able<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.920> put

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
more bending but I should be able to put

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.640 
more bending but I should be able to put
in<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.370> couple<00:03:26.579> of<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.940> bolt<00:03:27.780> or<00:03:27.930> two<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.410> you

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
in a couple of a bolt or two and you

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.140 
in a couple of a bolt or two and you
know<00:03:28.739> Loctite<00:03:29.160> them<00:03:29.280> up<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.549> it<00:03:29.670> should<00:03:30.000> hold

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
know Loctite them up and it should hold

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.890 
know Loctite them up and it should hold
pretty<00:03:30.390> well<00:03:32.150> okay<00:03:33.150> here's<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.510> spot<00:03:33.690> we're

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
pretty well okay here's the spot we're

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.960 
pretty well okay here's the spot we're
working<00:03:34.230> from<00:03:34.500> so<00:03:34.829> I've<00:03:35.010> got<00:03:35.220> my<00:03:35.370> two<00:03:35.610> pieces

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
working from so I've got my two pieces

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.300 
working from so I've got my two pieces
of<00:03:36.000> metal<00:03:36.440> they're<00:03:37.440> essentially<00:03:37.920> gonna<00:03:38.040> hang

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
of metal they're essentially gonna hang

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.470 
of metal they're essentially gonna hang
like<00:03:38.340> this<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:39.239> then<00:03:40.110> I've<00:03:40.200> got<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.500> holes

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
like this and then I've got the holes

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.610 
like this and then I've got the holes
I'm<00:03:42.480> pretty<00:03:42.660> much<00:03:42.750> gonna<00:03:42.930> work<00:03:43.140> like<00:03:43.290> a<00:03:43.350> belt

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
I'm pretty much gonna work like a belt

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.080 
I'm pretty much gonna work like a belt
loop<00:03:43.769> so<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.130> speak<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.549> I've<00:03:44.610> got<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.760> couple

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
loop so to speak and I've got a couple

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.900 
loop so to speak and I've got a couple
of<00:03:45.180> bolts<00:03:45.390> here<00:03:45.750> so<00:03:46.670> unfortunately<00:03:47.670> I've<00:03:47.790> only

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
of bolts here so unfortunately I've only

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.430 
of bolts here so unfortunately I've only
got<00:03:48.090> two<00:03:48.269> hands<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:48.720> I'll<00:03:48.959> have<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:49.200> do<00:03:49.320> the

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
got two hands so I'll have to do the

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.600 
got two hands so I'll have to do the
work<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:49.829> then<00:03:49.950> kind<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:50.190> show<00:03:50.340> you<00:03:50.400> what<00:03:50.579> I

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
work and then kind of show you what I

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.390 
work and then kind of show you what I
did<00:03:50.730> but<00:03:51.570> if<00:03:51.959> I<00:03:52.140> if<00:03:52.320> this<00:03:52.470> works<00:03:52.769> it<00:03:53.100> means<00:03:53.280> I'll

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
did but if I if this works it means I'll

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.490 
did but if I if this works it means I'll
have<00:03:53.519> a<00:03:53.549> $5<00:03:54.030> fix<00:03:54.360> here<00:03:54.570> so<00:03:54.870> that's<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.380> good

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
have a $5 fix here so that's a good

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.410 
have a $5 fix here so that's a good
thing

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
thing

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.090 
thing
okay<00:03:57.420> piece<00:03:57.630> number<00:03:57.900> one<00:03:58.079> is<00:03:58.200> in<00:03:58.350> place<00:03:58.650> and

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
okay piece number one is in place and

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.039 
okay piece number one is in place and
what<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.340> do<00:03:59.430> is<00:03:59.640> I<00:03:59.730> use<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.150> existing<00:04:00.420> holder

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
what I do is I use the existing holder

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.210 
what I do is I use the existing holder
and<00:04:01.200> you<00:04:01.260> see<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.500> kind<00:04:01.680> of<00:04:01.709> goes<00:04:01.890> underneath

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
and you see it kind of goes underneath

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.370 
and you see it kind of goes underneath
the<00:04:02.340> crossmember<00:04:03.000> here<00:04:03.030> so<00:04:03.810> that<00:04:03.959> means<00:04:04.170> that

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
the crossmember here so that means that

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.860 
the crossmember here so that means that
when<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:04.620> comes<00:04:04.739> down<00:04:05.299> it's<00:04:06.299> gonna<00:04:06.420> keep<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:06.780> in

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
when it comes down it's gonna keep it in

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.449 
when it comes down it's gonna keep it in
place<00:04:07.079> and<00:04:07.500> it's<00:04:07.650> gonna<00:04:07.739> be<00:04:07.890> able<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.100> handle

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
place and it's gonna be able to handle

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.280 
place and it's gonna be able to handle
you<00:04:08.850> know<00:04:08.880> a<00:04:08.970> reasonable<00:04:09.540> amount<00:04:09.870> of<00:04:09.989> torque

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
you know a reasonable amount of torque

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.789 
you know a reasonable amount of torque
on<00:04:10.470> it

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.240 

yeah<00:04:13.799> that<00:04:14.010> should<00:04:14.129> work<00:04:14.280> well<00:04:15.000> we'll<00:04:15.239> see

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
yeah that should work well we'll see

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.740 
yeah that should work well we'll see
okay<00:04:17.250> so<00:04:17.579> now<00:04:17.699> I've<00:04:17.850> got<00:04:18.090> my<00:04:18.209> two<00:04:18.239> pieces<00:04:18.570> of

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
okay so now I've got my two pieces of

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.740 
okay so now I've got my two pieces of
metal<00:04:18.959> it<00:04:19.889> looks<00:04:20.100> a<00:04:20.190> little<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.609> little<00:04:21.540> janky

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
metal it looks a little a little janky

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.670 
metal it looks a little a little janky
but<00:04:21.930> it's<00:04:22.229> bolted<00:04:22.650> in<00:04:22.770> there<00:04:22.949> and<00:04:23.370> I<00:04:23.610> got<00:04:23.729> a<00:04:23.790> I

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
but it's bolted in there and I got a I

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.810 
but it's bolted in there and I got a I
ended<00:04:25.680> up<00:04:25.770> stripping<00:04:26.130> one<00:04:26.460> I<00:04:26.490> don't<00:04:26.639> know<00:04:26.729> if

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
ended up stripping one I don't know if

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.090 
ended up stripping one I don't know if
you<00:04:26.910> can<00:04:27.030> see<00:04:27.270> it<00:04:27.360> here<00:04:27.590> it's<00:04:28.590> van<00:04:28.830> get<00:04:28.979> nice

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
you can see it here it's van get nice

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.430 
you can see it here it's van get nice
and<00:04:29.130> close<00:04:29.539> seal<00:04:30.539> turn<00:04:30.720> it<00:04:30.810> up<00:04:30.900> just<00:04:30.930> falling

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
and close seal turn it up just falling

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.240 
and close seal turn it up just falling
right<00:04:31.590> apart<00:04:36.590> Matt<00:04:37.590> there<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:37.889> is<00:04:37.979> the<00:04:38.100> one

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
right apart Matt there it is the one

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.029 
right apart Matt there it is the one
down<00:04:38.539> yeah<00:04:39.539> but<00:04:39.930> I<00:04:40.110> got<00:04:40.320> that<00:04:40.470> bolt<00:04:40.680> in<00:04:40.860> there

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
down yeah but I got that bolt in there

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.010 
down yeah but I got that bolt in there
and<00:04:41.820> it<00:04:41.910> seems<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.180> be<00:04:42.270> holding<00:04:42.389> it<00:04:42.660> up<00:04:42.750> nicely

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
and it seems to be holding it up nicely

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.210 
and it seems to be holding it up nicely
so<00:04:44.000> I<00:04:45.000> think<00:04:45.750> I<00:04:45.870> got<00:04:46.320> a<00:04:46.350> five<00:04:46.560> dollar<00:04:46.800> fix<00:04:47.039> here

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
so I think I got a five dollar fix here

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.500 
so I think I got a five dollar fix here
you<00:04:47.490> know<00:04:47.580> this<00:04:47.760> has<00:04:47.910> got<00:04:47.940> a<00:04:48.090> little<00:04:48.330> bit<00:04:48.419> of

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
you know this has got a little bit of

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.600 
you know this has got a little bit of
given<00:04:48.780> spring<00:04:49.199> which<00:04:49.800> is<00:04:49.949> good<00:04:50.160> but<00:04:50.430> not<00:04:50.550> too

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
given spring which is good but not too

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.310 
given spring which is good but not too
much<00:04:51.000> it'll<00:04:51.210> it'll<00:04:51.479> hold<00:04:51.660> it<00:04:51.810> relatively<00:04:52.169> in

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
much it'll it'll hold it relatively in

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.070 
much it'll it'll hold it relatively in
place<00:04:52.560> and<00:04:52.910> you<00:04:53.910> know<00:04:54.030> I<00:04:54.210> can<00:04:54.419> I<00:04:54.570> can<00:04:54.810> wait<00:04:54.960> to
