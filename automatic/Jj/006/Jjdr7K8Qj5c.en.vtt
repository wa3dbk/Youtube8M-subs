00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
because the last adaptation wasn't very

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.889 
because the last adaptation wasn't very
good<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:59.219> was<00:00:59.309> all<00:00:59.609> right<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.660> wasn't

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
good it was all right but it wasn't

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.930 
good it was all right but it wasn't
really<00:01:01.170> appealing<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.770> audiences<00:01:02.309> above<00:01:02.789> the
