00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
season what I got right was picking the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.520 
season what I got right was picking the
Cardinals<00:00:37.850> over<00:00:37.970> the<00:00:38.090> Cubs<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:39.050> Athletics

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530

over the White Sox and the Nationals
over<00:00:41.839> the<00:00:41.930> Padres<00:00:42.250> oddly<00:00:43.250> enough<00:00:43.489> I<00:00:43.640> was<00:00:43.910> right

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
over the Padres oddly enough I was right

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.090 
over the Padres oddly enough I was right
in<00:00:44.360> picking<00:00:44.720> a<00:00:44.900> split<00:00:45.260> between<00:00:45.440> the<00:00:45.650> Pirates

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
in picking a split between the Pirates

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.789 
in picking a split between the Pirates
and<00:00:46.190> Rockies<00:00:46.699> my<00:00:47.510> only<00:00:47.690> big<00:00:47.900> problem<00:00:48.379> was<00:00:48.589> I

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:48.799 
and Rockies my only big problem was I

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:51.130 
and Rockies my only big problem was I
got<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.220> games<00:00:49.489> wrong<00:00:49.820> in<00:00:50.059> Game<00:00:50.690> one<00:00:50.720> of<00:00:50.960> the

got the games wrong in Game one of the
doubleheader<00:00:51.470> I<00:00:51.890> was<00:00:52.280> close<00:00:52.549> to<00:00:52.580> being

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
doubleheader I was close to being

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.880 
doubleheader I was close to being
correct<00:00:53.330> on<00:00:53.510> picking<00:00:54.049> the<00:00:54.140> Pirates<00:00:54.589> for<00:00:54.710> that

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
correct on picking the Pirates for that

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.160 
correct on picking the Pirates for that
one<00:00:55.100> as<00:00:55.280> James<00:00:56.000> McDonald<00:00:56.510> went<00:00:56.659> six<00:00:56.989> innings

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
one as James McDonald went six innings

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.500 
one as James McDonald went six innings
without<00:00:57.559> surrendering<00:00:57.979> a<00:00:58.339> hit<00:00:58.580> until<00:00:58.820> Troy
