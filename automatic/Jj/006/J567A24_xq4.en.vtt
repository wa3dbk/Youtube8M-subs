00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.670
 so i am here with the tom im 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:06.740
 test lab by pc games hardware us 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.980
 have a new mainboard here that 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.660
 rampage 4 black edition of asus is 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.700
 not yet available if so 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.129
 really before it's actually in the trade 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.589
 is what is special about these now 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.329
 socket 2011 mainboard I'll give it once 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.529
 Over the tower stands next to me and there 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:24.259
 Maybe you can just explain 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.869
 which now resides on the motherboard itself 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.609
 So in principle falls first 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.619
 of course the black coloring in 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.710
 eye, therefore, of course, the name black 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.640
 edition otherwise only from the layout 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.190
 times typical x79 features this is the pc 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.990
 here we have quad channel 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.180
 Memory 8 RAM benches 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:49.730
 So there is a lot of memory 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:52.930
 wrap up quad sli or crossfire is 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:58.880
 possible with this word we have 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:02.920
 a total of 2468 ten sata connections the 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.659
 are now 26 seconds selectable 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.390
 but not native from the pch 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.850
 but let extra chip soldered that 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.800
 this is the great sound chip 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.100
 which is on it is in the creative 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.950
 chip the latest revision of the sound 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.590
 core chip i have it myself now 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.979
 can not hear loud asus but sounds 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.900
 Great 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.960
 We will be in a later test then 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.940
 see that europe was also a lot 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.229
 Wire is a lot of equipment each 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.549
 quantity usb 3.0 of course also per 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.370
 third party chip realized on in 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.440
 my x79 board these two golden 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.729
 connections which we still see the 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.610
 are for the bluetooth 4.0 and wlan 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.680
 ac antenna so after the newest 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.470
 radio standard one comes here also 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.960
 cope and of course the 721 outputs 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.380
 for the sound chip there are too 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.659
 see 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.640
 ok, now it costs so he just bends 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.540
 four euros 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.850
 Of course, there is something else now 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.220
 I do not quite believe that other thing either 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.810
 unsettling from a bit star trek 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.790
 tricorder moderately what can I stand 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.300
 make part because 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.960
 so that's right the part is the so-called 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.210
 looks like panel and so we can without 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.280
 Software tools or the wifi to use 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.290
 practically directly on the hardware level 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.880
 It will overclock with a cable then 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.480
 connected to the mainboard what he 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:29.680
 here the connection exactly and there can 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.900
 We then tell about tension he tells 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.370
 everything directly without setting on the 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.320
 bias or have to access 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.480
 any other third party tools 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.070
 under windows and that is supposed to 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.830
 also directly take over the attitude 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.260
 So without a restart would be necessary 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.459
 on the display we can then the the 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.930
 results we always have 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.120
 nice to see and check 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.160
 you can also temperature sensor well 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.930
 connect 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.940
 especially interesting of course if you 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.650
 now more extreme cooling methods like 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.650
 dry ice or liquid nitrogen 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.570
 wants to use this but also very much 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.170
 expensive bridge processors the 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.540
 come in 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.280
 In addition, falling wants to bring potential 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.840
 So that's just as normal 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.640
 standard user of course makes us 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.709
 That's right 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.570
 I thank the tom that was this 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.140
 rampage 4 black edition as one here 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.000
 By the way, does not look completely inappropriate 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.070
 black flag assassin's creed 4 's available 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.160
 also as download code because show yourself 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.620
 unfortunately not download now 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.890
 the whole thing is not forgotten from 18 so 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:37.380
 but you have to be 18 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.380
 I say thank you and see you soon
