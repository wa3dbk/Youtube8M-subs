00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.440
 Nespresso machines are very popular with these types of clubs you can create your own 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.419
 make coffee tea 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:14.129
 I have you they are only for sale on the internet or in an espresso shop 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.900
 but that now changes with an export 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.680
 and expats are plastic capsules that you can fill at home with your own coffee 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.289
 and off 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.949
 according to in express device can place 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.730
 according to the manufacturers, the use of an export can make the cups sixty percent 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.269
 cost savings 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.330
 the framework of the course is doing well 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
 you have to put the first filter in the lid 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.780
 and then you play it you can with coffee 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.450
 what can you do by simply passing a container of coffee or you can do it 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.630
 with a spoon 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.480
 you have to be careful that the edge that there is no coffee remains because that 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.740
 can also cause shortening 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.470
 so when it is filled, close the lid 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.620
 a place in the coffee machine 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.520
 if your piece is placed 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.270
 in any case 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.100
 and that starts 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.710
 the first use of a kutcher does not seem to close the lid properly 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.910
 but if they are used more often, it goes better 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.910
 and see if you say so 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.900
 he compared the coffee we made with an export with the coffee that 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.320
 we made with an original nespresso cups 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.850
 the coffee from the export is no avail and there is no kick one but the kema days 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.820
 it is less good than that of express too 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.140
 we have asked a number of coffee lovers what they think of the export cup 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.290
 that's what the suitcases say in the report 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.290
 So flatter Jan smit a nice technique 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.880
 too often do you discover the website 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.000
 Finally, there were fit experts again, that says something 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.540
 that is not here 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.479
 I don't actually see myself as having more visits to I have got you 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.940
 that seems to me you know do that 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.940
 Well I don't think it's a little more money for his account 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.580
 this is the third grade 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.070
 reusing the clubs is fine in itself, you have to be careful as 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.850
 you do not do anything because he may still be injured, open your lid 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.479
 and then in advance in writing 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.349
 and then you have a relax 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.449
 the cups of an export don't make it to the real thing 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.909
 in terms of appearance, the coffee year does not look the same as your nespresso 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:25.999
 cups used 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:30.340
 the manufacturer of the neck shot advises the church to be used two to three times 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.839
 but to achieve the claimed cost saving of 60 percent 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:36.099
 whatever you eat you use it four times 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.649
 in theory that is possible, but the quality of the tickets is deteriorating fairly quickly 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:42.849
 You have to wonder if you have that hassle 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.019
 and the hassle of many and emptying and cleaning the cost saving 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:47.500
 find worth
