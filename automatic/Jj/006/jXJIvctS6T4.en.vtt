00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
gotta move it around a little kind of

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.619 
gotta move it around a little kind of
dead<00:00:58.100> center<00:00:58.609> so<00:00:58.850> I'm<00:00:59.210> gonna<00:00:59.390> put<00:00:59.600> down

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
dead center so I'm gonna put down

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.040 
dead center so I'm gonna put down
another<00:01:00.230> letter<00:01:02.379> this<00:01:03.379> one's<00:01:03.649> gonna<00:01:03.829> be<00:01:03.920> an<00:01:04.129> F

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
another letter this one's gonna be an F

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.160 
another letter this one's gonna be an F
I<00:01:06.050> don't<00:01:06.500> want<00:01:06.620> to<00:01:06.710> be<00:01:06.830> green<00:01:07.100> that's<00:01:07.430> uh<00:01:08.170> make

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
I don't want to be green that's uh make

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.750 
I don't want to be green that's uh make
it<00:01:09.200> on<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.500> upper<00:01:09.710> opposite<00:01:10.280> side<00:01:10.520> of<00:01:10.550> the

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
it on the upper opposite side of the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.740 
it on the upper opposite side of the
spectrum<00:01:11.060> let's<00:01:11.540> make<00:01:11.810> it<00:01:11.840> purple<00:01:12.260> and<00:01:16.750> I'm

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
spectrum let's make it purple and I'm

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.340 
spectrum let's make it purple and I'm
gonna<00:01:17.900> use<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.320> move<00:01:18.560> tool<00:01:22.690> so<00:01:23.690> currently

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
gonna use the move tool so currently

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.780 
gonna use the move tool so currently
they're<00:01:24.590> kind<00:01:24.860> of<00:01:26.170> overlapping<00:01:27.280> but<00:01:28.280> let's

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
they're kind of overlapping but let's

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.990 
they're kind of overlapping but let's
make<00:01:29.000> them<00:01:29.210> intertwine<00:01:31.840> so<00:01:32.840> we're<00:01:33.530> going<00:01:33.740> to

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
make them intertwine so we're going to

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.330 
make them intertwine so we're going to
rasterize<00:01:35.000> these<00:01:35.720> let<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.350> text<00:01:36.620> layers<00:01:36.950> and

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
rasterize these let the text layers and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.590 
rasterize these let the text layers and
I'm<00:01:38.090> going<00:01:38.480> to<00:01:38.600> go<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.810> layer<00:01:39.680> rasterize<00:01:40.600> type

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
I'm going to go to layer rasterize type

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.980 
I'm going to go to layer rasterize type
so<00:01:44.600> now<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:45.860> can't<00:01:46.280> edit<00:01:46.460> these<00:01:47.150> anymore

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
so now the can't edit these anymore

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.130 
so now the can't edit these anymore
these<00:01:48.320> are<00:01:48.500> just<00:01:49.690> normal<00:01:50.980> drawings<00:01:52.990> so<00:01:53.990> I'm

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
these are just normal drawings so I'm

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.610 
these are just normal drawings so I'm
gonna<00:01:54.310> knock<00:01:55.310> down<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.850> opacity<00:01:56.150> a<00:01:56.510> little

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
gonna knock down the opacity a little

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.860 
gonna knock down the opacity a little
knock<00:01:57.620> it<00:01:57.770> down<00:01:57.800> about<00:01:58.160> 50<00:01:58.670> on<00:01:58.910> both<00:01:59.210> of<00:01:59.420> them

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.270 

Photoshop<00:02:02.870> is<00:02:03.050> a<00:02:03.080> very<00:02:03.320> powerful<00:02:03.560> tool<00:02:04.040> for

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
Photoshop is a very powerful tool for

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.560 
Photoshop is a very powerful tool for
artists<00:02:04.760> now<00:02:05.120> I'm<00:02:05.180> going<00:02:05.330> to<00:02:05.390> show<00:02:05.540> you

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
artists now I'm going to show you

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.240 
artists now I'm going to show you
technique<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:06.410> make<00:02:06.590> your<00:02:06.740> project<00:02:06.950> even

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
technique to make your project even

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.960 
technique to make your project even
better

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.550 

and<00:02:11.970> I'm<00:02:12.510> not<00:02:12.630> sure<00:02:12.690> about<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.080> placement<00:02:13.320> of

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
and I'm not sure about the placement of

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.690 
and I'm not sure about the placement of
these<00:02:13.710> letters<00:02:14.010> I'm<00:02:14.100> going<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.280> actually<00:02:14.580> move

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
these letters I'm going to actually move

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.990 
these letters I'm going to actually move
this<00:02:14.880> F<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.390> little<00:02:15.660> bit<00:02:15.930> more<00:02:16.610> right<00:02:17.610> there

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
this F a little bit more right there

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.850 
this F a little bit more right there
that<00:02:18.210> looks<00:02:18.450> good<00:02:21.830> there<00:02:22.830> we<00:02:23.460> go<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:25.620> we<00:02:25.740> have

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
that looks good there we go so we have

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.440 
that looks good there we go so we have
the<00:02:25.980> hard<00:02:26.160> round<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.700> we<00:02:26.790> have<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.090> opacity

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
the hard round and we have the opacity

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.300 
the hard round and we have the opacity
at<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.050> hundred<00:02:28.320> percent<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.000> F<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.390> on<00:02:30.570> top

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
at a hundred percent so the F is on top

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.890 
at a hundred percent so the F is on top
so<00:02:32.900> we<00:02:33.900> are<00:02:34.020> going<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:35.030> erase<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.240> F<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.870> make

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
so we are going to erase the F to make

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.210 
so we are going to erase the F to make
it<00:02:37.140> kind<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.470> overlap<00:02:38.960> and<00:02:39.960> so<00:02:42.530> in<00:02:43.530> fact<00:02:43.590> might

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
it kind of overlap and so in fact might

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.850 
it kind of overlap and so in fact might
just<00:02:44.400> be<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.550> little<00:02:44.670> easier<00:02:44.970> let's<00:02:45.950> get<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.190> s

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
just be a little easier let's get the s

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.100 
just be a little easier let's get the s
layer<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.220> let's<00:02:50.730> go<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.000> load<00:02:51.420> selection

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
layer and let's go to load selection

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.330 
layer and let's go to load selection
select<00:02:52.560> load<00:02:52.800> selection<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.810> channel<00:02:54.810> s

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
select load selection and channel s

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.340 
select load selection and channel s
transparency<00:02:56.340> okay<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.420> then<00:02:58.020> let's<00:02:58.140> go<00:02:58.320> to

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
transparency okay and then let's go to

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.110 
transparency okay and then let's go to
the<00:02:58.470> F<00:02:58.680> layer<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.430> way<00:02:59.610> when<00:02:59.850> you're

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
the F layer and this way when you're

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.510 
the F layer and this way when you're
racing<00:03:00.540> things<00:03:00.780> we<00:03:00.959> only<00:03:01.320> erase<00:03:01.620> what's

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
racing things we only erase what's

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.470 
racing things we only erase what's
around<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.900> s<00:03:06.410> so<00:03:07.410> we're<00:03:07.590> going<00:03:07.770> to<00:03:07.860> have<00:03:08.480> the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
around the s so we're going to have the

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.540 
around the s so we're going to have the
s<00:03:09.600> up<00:03:09.870> on<00:03:10.110> here
