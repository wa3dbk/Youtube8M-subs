incredibly solid beautiful metal work
here

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
here

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.740 
here
one<00:02:14.020> of<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.170> things<00:02:14.349> to<00:02:14.590> look<00:02:15.250> at<00:02:15.630> just<00:02:16.630> to

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
one of the things to look at just to

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.770 
one of the things to look at just to
admire<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.590> essentially<00:02:18.459> is<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.880> see<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.420> lot<00:02:19.690> of

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
admire it essentially is to see a lot of

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.080 
admire it essentially is to see a lot of
the<00:02:19.870> detail<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:21.370> really<00:02:21.580> kind<00:02:21.760> of<00:02:21.790> have<00:02:21.940> to

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
the detail you really kind of have to

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.780 
the detail you really kind of have to
look<00:02:22.330> very<00:02:22.360> closely<00:02:23.110> I<00:02:23.620> don't<00:02:24.340> know<00:02:24.489> if<00:02:24.550> our

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
look very closely I don't know if our

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.400 
look very closely I don't know if our
cameras<00:02:25.330> can<00:02:25.450> even<00:02:25.660> pick<00:02:25.780> it<00:02:25.900> up<00:02:26.020> but<00:02:26.170> it's<00:02:26.319> a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
cameras can even pick it up but it's a

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.430 
cameras can even pick it up but it's a
very<00:02:26.800> fine<00:02:27.160> detail<00:02:27.670> on<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:27.910> metalwork<00:02:28.440> here

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
very fine detail on the metalwork here

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.240 
very fine detail on the metalwork here
and<00:02:30.280> throughout<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:32.170> it's<00:02:32.290> just<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.500> again<00:02:33.220> a

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
and throughout so it's just a again a

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.650 
and throughout so it's just a again a
gorgeous<00:02:33.670> microphone<00:02:34.440> very<00:02:35.440> compact<00:02:35.950> -<00:02:36.660> one

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
gorgeous microphone very compact - one

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.059 
gorgeous microphone very compact - one
of<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.780> other<00:02:37.810> features<00:02:38.140> here<00:02:38.530> as<00:02:38.769> well<00:02:39.040> I

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
of the other features here as well I

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.550 
of the other features here as well I
thought<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:39.610> was<00:02:39.760> pretty<00:02:39.819> neat<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:41.140> it

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
thought this was pretty neat is it

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.250 
thought this was pretty neat is it
basically<00:02:41.739> on<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.220> c-clamp<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.870> point<00:02:44.140> which

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
basically on the c-clamp the point which

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.259 
basically on the c-clamp the point which
attaches<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:44.920> microphone<00:02:45.340> stand<00:02:45.519> you

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
attaches to the microphone stand you

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.539 
attaches to the microphone stand you
have<00:02:46.360> a<00:02:46.420> lever<00:02:46.660> here<00:02:47.049> which<00:02:47.230> allows<00:02:47.920> you<00:02:48.280> to

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
have a lever here which allows you to

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.880 
have a lever here which allows you to
you<00:02:49.000> know<00:02:49.090> basically<00:02:49.239> you're<00:02:49.630> gonna<00:02:49.890> it's

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
you know basically you're gonna it's

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.080 
you know basically you're gonna it's
gonna<00:02:51.040> be<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.220> little<00:02:51.310> bit<00:02:51.459> difficult<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.880> show

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
gonna be a little bit difficult to show

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.750 
gonna be a little bit difficult to show
here<00:02:52.360> without<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.750> being<00:02:52.870> on<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.049> stand<00:02:53.290> but

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
here without it being on the stand but

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.650 
here without it being on the stand but
essentially<00:02:54.760> whenever<00:02:55.000> you're<00:02:55.120> pulling<00:02:55.480> this

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
essentially whenever you're pulling this

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.309 
essentially whenever you're pulling this
to<00:02:56.470> loosen<00:02:56.890> it<00:02:57.239> this<00:02:58.239> could<00:02:58.450> be<00:02:58.630> you<00:02:59.019> know<00:02:59.140> with

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
to loosen it this could be you know with

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.920 
to loosen it this could be you know with
several<00:03:00.069> turns<00:03:00.370> or<00:03:00.790> or<00:03:01.269> what-have-you<00:03:01.510> you

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
several turns or or what-have-you you

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.539 
several turns or or what-have-you you
might<00:03:02.170> actually<00:03:02.410> have<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:02.799> little<00:03:03.250> bit<00:03:03.430> of<00:03:03.459> a

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
might actually have a little bit of a

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.839 
might actually have a little bit of a
difficult<00:03:04.510> positioning<00:03:05.220> they<00:03:06.220> have

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
difficult positioning they have

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.070 
difficult positioning they have
basically<00:03:07.150> made<00:03:07.360> this<00:03:07.569> to<00:03:07.690> where<00:03:07.780> you<00:03:07.930> can

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
basically made this to where you can

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.259 
basically made this to where you can
actually<00:03:08.230> pull<00:03:08.560> this<00:03:08.709> out<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.220> change<00:03:10.120> the

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
actually pull this out and change the

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.479 
actually pull this out and change the
position<00:03:10.420> of<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.780> lever<00:03:10.959> so<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:12.160> can<00:03:12.310> get<00:03:12.459> a

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
position of the lever so you can get a

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.699 
position of the lever so you can get a
better<00:03:12.670> angle<00:03:12.910> at<00:03:13.180> tightening<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:13.690> or<00:03:14.410> to

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
better angle at tightening it or to

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.150 
better angle at tightening it or to
loosen<00:03:15.069> it<00:03:15.160> accordingly<00:03:16.140> so<00:03:17.140> it's<00:03:17.320> a<00:03:17.380> very<00:03:17.620> lot

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
loosen it accordingly so it's a very lot

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.400 
loosen it accordingly so it's a very lot
of<00:03:18.280> thought<00:03:18.850> and<00:03:19.140> functionality<00:03:20.140> has<00:03:20.260> gone

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
of thought and functionality has gone

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.789 
of thought and functionality has gone
into<00:03:20.620> this<00:03:21.180> all<00:03:22.180> in<00:03:22.390> all<00:03:22.510> for<00:03:23.230> anyone<00:03:23.560> looking

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
into this all in all for anyone looking

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.789 
into this all in all for anyone looking
for<00:03:23.859> a<00:03:24.010> very<00:03:24.340> serious<00:03:25.500> microphone<00:03:26.500> on<00:03:26.739> a

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
for a very serious microphone on a

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.539 
for a very serious microphone on a
fairly<00:03:27.400> limited<00:03:27.579> budget<00:03:29.010> this<00:03:30.010> is<00:03:30.190> basically

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
fairly limited budget this is basically

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.250 
fairly limited budget this is basically
one<00:03:30.910> of<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.090> strong<00:03:31.450> contenders<00:03:31.959> and<00:03:32.109> should

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
one of the strong contenders and should

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.539 
one of the strong contenders and should
be<00:03:32.319> considered<00:03:32.530> on<00:03:32.799> your<00:03:32.950> shortlist<00:03:33.310> of
