I<00:00:55.770> didn't<00:00:56.280> do<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.430> video<00:00:56.940> myself<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.809> because

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
I didn't do this video myself is because

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.240 
I didn't do this video myself is because
first<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.100> all<00:01:00.230> he<00:01:01.230> shows<00:01:01.500> pretty<00:01:01.800> well<00:01:02.039> in

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
first of all he shows pretty well in

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.289 
first of all he shows pretty well in
this<00:01:02.399> video<00:01:02.789> how<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.570> done<00:01:04.610> like<00:01:05.610> everything

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
this video how it's done like everything

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.620 
this video how it's done like everything
is<00:01:07.250> pretty<00:01:08.250> perfect<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.090> video<00:01:09.420> and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
is pretty perfect in this video and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.490 
is pretty perfect in this video and
secondly<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> feeling<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.060> this

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
secondly I have a feeling that this

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.810 
secondly I have a feeling that this
might<00:01:13.500> be<00:01:13.740> considered<00:01:14.360> bark<00:01:15.360> abuse<00:01:16.369> since<00:01:17.369> it

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
might be considered bark abuse since it

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.960 
might be considered bark abuse since it
doesn't<00:01:18.119> really<00:01:18.360> make<00:01:18.570> sense<00:01:19.369> now<00:01:20.369> what<00:01:20.759> he<00:01:20.909> is

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
doesn't really make sense now what he is

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.330 
doesn't really make sense now what he is
going<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.390> do<00:01:21.509> when<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> creeps<00:01:22.049> one<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:23.040> he's

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
going to do when the creeps one is he's

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.100 
going to do when the creeps one is he's
going<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.700> scale<00:01:23.939> his<00:01:24.090> taunt<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.689> then<00:01:24.960> he's

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
going to scale his taunt and then he's

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.100 
going to scale his taunt and then he's
going<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.470> taunt<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.659> opponent's<00:01:27.659> creep<00:01:27.869> wave

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
going to taunt the opponent's creep wave

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.640 
going to taunt the opponent's creep wave
now<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.520> spell<00:01:29.850> clearly<00:01:30.390> says<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650
