00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
well this one the tip is made out of

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:57.169 
well this one the tip is made out of
stainless<00:00:55.199> steel<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.100> not<00:00:56.129> if<00:00:56.729> you<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:56.999> see

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:57.179 
stainless steel and not if you can see

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:59.739 
stainless steel and not if you can see
but<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.569> depth<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:58.019> this<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.409> almost<00:00:59.100> perfect

00:00:59.739 --> 00:00:59.749 
but the depth of this is almost perfect

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.479 
but the depth of this is almost perfect
for<00:01:00.749> the<00:01:00.839> depth<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.289> every<00:01:01.769> ourian<00:01:02.100> jug<00:01:02.280> filled

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
for the depth of every ourian jug filled

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.310 
for the depth of every ourian jug filled
with<00:01:02.789> it

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.560 

so<00:01:07.320> all<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:07.649> to<00:01:07.829> do<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:09.299> put<00:01:09.540> a

so all you have to do is just put a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.420 
so all you have to do is just put a
little<00:01:09.750> bit<00:01:09.899> of<00:01:09.990> mild<00:01:10.229> pressure<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.280> top

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
little bit of mild pressure on the top

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.859 
little bit of mild pressure on the top
of<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.759> orange<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.210> want<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.479> start<00:01:12.719> at

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
of the orange and you want to start at

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.520 
of the orange and you want to start at
the<00:01:12.990> stem<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.340> push<00:01:15.000> down<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.659> as

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
the stem and you just push down and as

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.770 
the stem and you just push down and as
you<00:01:16.710> can<00:01:16.890> see<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.250> conforms<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.210> side<00:01:18.450> of

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
you can see it conforms to the side of

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.230 
you can see it conforms to the side of
the<00:01:19.259> orange<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.369> just<00:01:20.549> pull<00:01:20.820> down<00:01:20.850> about

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
the orange and you just pull down about

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.389 
the orange and you just pull down about
halfway<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.750> start<00:01:22.140> scoring<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.950> you

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
halfway to start scoring it and you

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.620 
halfway to start scoring it and you
repeat<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:25.009> until<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.189> get<00:01:26.399> a<00:01:27.000> couple<00:01:27.539> of

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
repeat that until you get a couple of

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.219 
repeat that until you get a couple of
good

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
good

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.490 
good
sections<00:01:28.770> started<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:30.810> then<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:30.990> go<00:01:31.289> back

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
sections started and then you go back

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.730 
sections started and then you go back
and<00:01:31.859> you<00:01:32.039> can<00:01:32.070> use<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:33.359> flat<00:01:33.719> end<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
and you can use the flat end of the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.170 
and you can use the flat end of the
metal<00:01:35.539> to<00:01:36.539> separate<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.229> peel<00:01:37.789> away<00:01:38.789> from<00:01:38.939> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
metal to separate the peel away from the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.050 
metal to separate the peel away from the
section<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.810> scored<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.909> then<00:01:41.909> you

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
section you just scored and then you

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.230 
section you just scored and then you
just<00:01:42.299> pull<00:01:43.109> that<00:01:43.289> section<00:01:43.649> back<00:01:43.859> and<00:01:44.250> if<00:01:45.210> you

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
just pull that section back and if you

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.260 
just pull that section back and if you
notice<00:01:45.719> the<00:01:46.409> depth<00:01:46.649> here<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.460> didn't<00:01:47.969> break

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
notice the depth here it didn't break

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.389 
notice the depth here it didn't break
into<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.750> need<00:01:48.929> of<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.140> orange<00:01:49.469> at<00:01:49.649> all<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.130> I

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
into the need of the orange at all so I

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.980 
into the need of the orange at all so I
don't<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.820> any<00:01:50.969> juice<00:01:51.240> spilling<00:01:51.689> down<00:01:51.840> my

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
don't have any juice spilling down my

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.800 
don't have any juice spilling down my
hands<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.070> also<00:01:53.250> got<00:01:53.939> into<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.329> pits<00:01:54.600> just

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
hands but it also got into the pits just

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.279 
hands but it also got into the pits just
fine<00:01:55.200> too<00:01:55.469> so<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.890> wasn't<00:01:56.460> too<00:01:56.729> shallow<00:01:57.289> I

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
fine too so it wasn't too shallow I

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.289 
fine too so it wasn't too shallow I
don't<00:01:58.859> have<00:01:59.009> any<00:01:59.159> orange<00:01:59.549> peel<00:01:59.969> under<00:02:00.179> my
