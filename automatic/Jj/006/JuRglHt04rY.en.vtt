okay<00:00:02.280> just<00:00:02.460> got<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.669> PW<00:00:03.179> cylinder<00:00:03.600> head<00:00:03.750> back

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
okay just got the PW cylinder head back

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.530 
okay just got the PW cylinder head back
from<00:00:04.549> machine<00:00:05.549> shop<00:00:05.759> from<00:00:05.940> being<00:00:06.120> bored<00:00:06.390> out

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540

the new piston here piston rings I
should<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:30.470> shown<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.679> before<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.920> put

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
should have shown you this before I put

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.680 
should have shown you this before I put
the<00:00:32.279> pit<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.730> rings<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.149> piste<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.480> don't

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
the pit the rings on the piste I don't

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.240 
the pit the rings on the piste I don't
like<00:00:33.809> taking<00:00:34.140> rings<00:00:34.350> off<00:00:34.530> again<00:00:34.829> sometimes

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
like taking rings off again sometimes

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.799 
like taking rings off again sometimes
they<00:00:35.370> snap<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:35.969> never<00:00:36.210> want<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.480> do<00:00:36.630> that

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
they snap and you never want to do that

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.049 
they snap and you never want to do that
but<00:00:37.680> if<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.910> can<00:00:39.090> see<00:00:40.430> me<00:00:41.430> kind<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.670> hard<00:00:41.879> you

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
but if you can see me kind of hard you

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.790 
but if you can see me kind of hard you
see<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.390> little<00:00:42.600> pin<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.440> edge<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.680> the

any way the wider spot there's a little

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.510 
any way the wider spot there's a little
pin<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.210> keeps<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.129> piston<00:00:56.129> ring<00:00:56.280> from

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
pin that keeps the piston ring from

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.420 
pin that keeps the piston ring from
spinning<00:00:57.379> and<00:01:00.020> there<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.320> your<00:01:02.010> ring

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
the bottom one also has a pin on it now

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.580 
the bottom one also has a pin on it now
we're<00:02:06.390> going<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.540> install<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:07.020> inside<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
we're going to install this inside the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.260 
we're going to install this inside the
cylinder<00:02:08.009> first<00:02:08.340> because<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:08.789> easier<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.179> do

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
cylinder first because it's easier to do

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.790 
cylinder first because it's easier to do
it<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.479> way<00:02:09.629> then<00:02:09.780> push<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.170> jug<00:02:10.349> over<00:02:10.530> top

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
it that way then push the jug over top

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.080 
it that way then push the jug over top
of<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.039> once<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:11.400> on<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:11.730> we'll<00:02:11.849> put<00:02:12.000> it

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
of it once it's on so we'll put it

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.430 
of it once it's on so we'll put it
inside<00:02:12.330> the

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
inside the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.730 
inside the
the<00:02:13.560> cylinder<00:02:13.920> jug<00:02:14.160> here<00:02:14.400> well<00:02:15.470> one<00:02:16.470> thing<00:02:16.680> you

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
the cylinder jug here well one thing you

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.230 
the cylinder jug here well one thing you
ought<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.830> make<00:02:16.980> sure<00:02:17.100> is<00:02:17.220> piston<00:02:17.550> orientation

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
ought to make sure is piston orientation

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.280 
ought to make sure is piston orientation
there's<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.480> an<00:02:19.190> arrow<00:02:20.190> on<00:02:20.460> this<00:02:20.880> one<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.360> think

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
there's a an arrow on this one I think

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.050 
there's a an arrow on this one I think
there<00:02:22.410> wasn't<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.710> stock<00:02:22.920> one<00:02:23.100> as<00:02:23.250> well<00:02:23.430> but

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
there wasn't the stock one as well but

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.520 
there wasn't the stock one as well but
it's<00:02:24.240> going<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.510> point<00:02:24.750> toward<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.230> exhaust

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
it's going to point toward the exhaust

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.830 
it's going to point toward the exhaust
is<00:02:25.770> going<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.040> point<00:02:26.250> down<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:26.850> that's<00:02:27.660> to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
is going to point down and that's to

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.070 
is going to point down and that's to
make<00:02:27.960> sure<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.730> piston<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.660> two-stroke

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
make sure and a piston and a two-stroke

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.360 
make sure and a piston and a two-stroke
you<00:02:31.200> have<00:02:31.320> ports<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.830> are<00:02:31.890> covered<00:02:32.250> and

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
you have ports that are covered and

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.520 
you have ports that are covered and
uncovered<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.880> see<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.120> ports<00:02:33.390> in<00:02:33.570> there<00:02:33.750> you

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
uncovered to see the ports in there you

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.930 
uncovered to see the ports in there you
have<00:02:34.650> an<00:02:34.740> intake<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.100> exhaust<00:02:35.370> port<00:02:35.850> and

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
have an intake and exhaust port and

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.350 
have an intake and exhaust port and
expansion<00:02:36.390> port<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.810> those<00:02:37.440> are<00:02:39.320> yeah<00:02:41.360> those

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
expansion port and those are yeah those

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.850 
expansion port and those are yeah those
are<00:02:42.510> covered<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:42.930> uncovered<00:02:43.050> as<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.680> Rings

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
are covered and uncovered as the Rings

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.480 
are covered and uncovered as the Rings
go<00:02:44.100> by<00:02:44.250> them<00:02:44.690> now<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:46.470> reason<00:02:46.890> there's<00:02:47.370> an

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
go by them now the reason there's an

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.010 
go by them now the reason there's an
orientation<00:02:47.910> on<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.150> piston<00:02:48.570> rings<00:02:48.780> and

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
orientation on the piston rings and

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.420 
orientation on the piston rings and
where<00:02:49.320> these<00:02:49.470> little<00:02:49.680> pins<00:02:50.040> are<00:02:50.220> where<00:02:50.370> it

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
where these little pins are where it

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.820 
where these little pins are where it
wants<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.700> Rings<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.150> stay<00:02:51.360> if<00:02:51.930> this<00:02:52.140> open<00:02:52.560> end

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
wants the Rings to stay if this open end

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.940 
wants the Rings to stay if this open end
of<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.130> Rings<00:02:53.960> was<00:02:54.960> to<00:02:55.140> pass<00:02:55.350> over<00:02:55.710> one<00:02:55.860> of

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
of the Rings was to pass over one of

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.620 
of the Rings was to pass over one of
those<00:02:56.040> ports<00:02:56.490> it<00:02:56.610> would<00:02:56.730> just<00:02:56.910> tear<00:02:57.420> those

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
those ports it would just tear those

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.920 
those ports it would just tear those
rings<00:02:57.900> off<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.920> basically<00:02:59.330> they're<00:03:00.330> oriented

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
rings off so basically they're oriented

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.900 
rings off so basically they're oriented
so<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.260> only<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.590> completely<00:03:02.280> flat<00:03:02.460> part<00:03:02.850> of

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
so that only a completely flat part of

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.220 
so that only a completely flat part of
the<00:03:03.030> piston<00:03:03.360> rings<00:03:03.570> will<00:03:03.720> go<00:03:03.840> over<00:03:03.990> top<00:03:04.170> of

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
the piston rings will go over top of

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.940 
the piston rings will go over top of
those<00:03:04.470> ports<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.900> and<00:03:06.900> not<00:03:07.170> crack<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.620> piston

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
those ports and and not crack the piston

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.450 
those ports and and not crack the piston
ring<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:09.860> you<00:03:10.860> know<00:03:10.950> that's<00:03:11.160> why<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.310> always

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
ring and you know that's why I always

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.400 
ring and you know that's why I always
have<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.790> make<00:03:11.940> sure<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.480> piston<00:03:12.810> orientation

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
have to make sure the piston orientation

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.970 
have to make sure the piston orientation
like<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.740> said<00:03:13.980> on<00:03:14.130> this<00:03:14.310> one<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:16.380> arrow<00:03:16.590> points

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
like I said on this one the arrow points

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.420 
like I said on this one the arrow points
down<00:03:17.160> toward<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.550> exhaust<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:19.850> on<00:03:20.850> this

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
down toward the exhaust and on this

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.550 
down toward the exhaust and on this
ahead<00:03:23.430> it<00:03:23.550> will<00:03:23.670> be<00:03:23.760> this<00:03:23.880> way

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
ahead it will be this way

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.870 
ahead it will be this way
so<00:03:25.560> we're<00:03:25.650> going<00:03:25.740> to<00:03:25.800> do<00:03:25.890> is<00:03:25.980> I'm<00:03:26.640> going<00:03:26.820> to

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
so we're going to do is I'm going to

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.220 
so we're going to do is I'm going to
lube<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.150> I'm<00:03:27.750> going<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:27.990> use<00:03:28.110> some

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
lube the I'm going to use some

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.900 
lube the I'm going to use some
two-stroke<00:03:28.620> oil<00:03:28.800> and<00:03:29.100> lube<00:03:29.340> up<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.610> inside<00:03:29.880> of

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
two-stroke oil and lube up the inside of

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.750 
two-stroke oil and lube up the inside of
the<00:03:30.060> cylinder<00:03:30.209> there<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:30.780> then<00:03:31.380> I'm<00:03:31.560> going<00:03:31.680> to

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
the cylinder there and then I'm going to

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.490 
the cylinder there and then I'm going to
compress<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.390> do<00:03:33.540> these<00:03:33.690> by<00:03:33.900> finger<00:03:34.290> a

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
compress the you do these by finger a

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.350 
compress the you do these by finger a
car<00:03:35.070> one<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.400> obviously<00:03:35.760> couldn't<00:03:36.060> do<00:03:36.180> but

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
car one you obviously couldn't do but

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.960 
car one you obviously couldn't do but
for<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:36.660> dirt<00:03:37.290> bike<00:03:37.500> or<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.709> little<00:03:37.970> small

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
for a dirt bike or a little small

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.640 
for a dirt bike or a little small
motorcycle<00:03:39.270> small<00:03:39.810> engines<00:03:40.140> you<00:03:40.260> can<00:03:40.290> just

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
motorcycle small engines you can just

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.680 
motorcycle small engines you can just
compress<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.250> Rings<00:03:41.700> by<00:03:41.880> hand<00:03:42.180> do<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.480> top

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
compress the Rings by hand do the top

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.900 
compress the Rings by hand do the top
one<00:03:42.830> slightly<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:43.980> gently<00:03:44.130> from<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.520> bottom

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
one slightly and gently from the bottom

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.150 
one slightly and gently from the bottom
and<00:03:45.060> then<00:03:45.270> the<00:03:46.140> bottom<00:03:46.440> ring<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:46.739> push<00:03:46.950> it<00:03:47.070> up

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
and then the bottom ring you push it up

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.949 
and then the bottom ring you push it up
past<00:03:47.400> make<00:03:48.000> sure<00:03:48.120> they<00:03:48.270> stay<00:03:48.480> on<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.720> pins

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
past make sure they stay on the pins
