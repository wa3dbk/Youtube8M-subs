00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
not that expensive you can get a new one

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.860

and they have a retainer clip in there
and<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.710> looks<00:00:46.920> like<00:00:47.070> some<00:00:47.730> kind<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:49.010> squeezing

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
and it looks like some kind of squeezing

and it looks like some kind of squeezing
fitting<00:00:51.530> bracket<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.829> side<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.100> may<00:00:53.520> be

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
fitting bracket on this side that may be

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.389 
fitting bracket on this side that may be
broken<00:00:54.090> off<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.660> one<00:00:54.870> but<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:55.949> far<00:00:56.190> as<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
broken off on this one but as far as the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.720 
broken off on this one but as far as the
light<00:00:56.610> goes<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:57.840> turn<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.500> quarter<00:00:59.399> of

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
light goes you just turn it a quarter of

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.240 
light goes you just turn it a quarter of
a<00:00:59.850> turn<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.710> pull<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.859> bulb<00:01:02.100> out<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:04.250> so

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
a turn and pull the bulb out of it so

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.390 
a turn and pull the bulb out of it so
let's<00:01:05.700> see<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.270> reach<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.770> or<00:01:07.770> how<00:01:08.340> we

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
let's see if we can reach that or how we

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.330 
let's see if we can reach that or how we
can<00:01:08.700> reach<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.540> bumper<00:01:09.900> assembly

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
can reach it in this bumper assembly

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.090 
can reach it in this bumper assembly
looking<00:01:11.340> at<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.700> from<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> backside<00:01:13.100> it

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
looking at this from the backside it

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.590 
looking at this from the backside it
didn't<00:01:14.520> look<00:01:14.610> like<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.970> really<00:01:15.119> has<00:01:15.360> much

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
didn't look like it really has much

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.469 
didn't look like it really has much
access<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.979> I'm<00:01:17.580> gonna<00:01:17.759> stick<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> screwdriver

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
access so I'm gonna stick a screwdriver

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.609 
access so I'm gonna stick a screwdriver
or<00:01:18.930> something<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.320> here

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
or something in here

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.580 
or something in here
and<00:01:19.770> try<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.430> pry<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.090> out<00:01:21.380> because<00:01:22.380> that's

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
and try to pry that out because that's

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.039 
and try to pry that out because that's
the<00:01:22.710> side<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.159> looks<00:01:23.310> like<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:24.150> has<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.689> clip

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049
