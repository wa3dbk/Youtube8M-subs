00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.500 

so<00:00:07.670> the<00:00:07.760> big<00:00:07.910> tip<00:00:08.570> here<00:00:08.870> is<00:00:09.250> and<00:00:10.250> the<00:00:11.090> first

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510 
so the big tip here is and the first

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.080 
so the big tip here is and the first
thing<00:00:11.780> you<00:00:12.650> need<00:00:12.770> to<00:00:12.830> do<00:00:13.040> is<00:00:13.550> make<00:00:13.850> sure<00:00:13.880> your

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
thing you need to do is make sure your

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.520 
thing you need to do is make sure your
chimneys<00:00:14.389> nice<00:00:14.570> and<00:00:14.809> clean<00:00:15.049> and<00:00:15.080> you've

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
chimneys nice and clean and you've

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.760 
chimneys nice and clean and you've
cleaned<00:00:15.830> out<00:00:15.980> the<00:00:16.129> box<00:00:16.340> inside<00:00:17.090> the<00:00:17.150> actual

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
cleaned out the box inside the actual

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.400 
cleaned out the box inside the actual
fire<00:00:18.770> and<00:00:19.160> then<00:00:19.430> the<00:00:20.150> next<00:00:20.539> step<00:00:20.900> is<00:00:21.080> to<00:00:21.230> place

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
fire and then the next step is to place

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.680 
fire and then the next step is to place
in<00:00:21.680> wood<00:00:21.860> and<00:00:22.160> it's<00:00:23.120> all<00:00:23.210> about<00:00:23.300> making<00:00:23.510> sure

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690 
in wood and it's all about making sure

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.020 
in wood and it's all about making sure
you<00:00:23.960> make<00:00:24.140> really<00:00:24.770> nice<00:00:24.920> channels<00:00:25.640> of<00:00:25.790> air<00:00:25.910> to

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.030 
you make really nice channels of air to

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.930 
you make really nice channels of air to
throw<00:00:26.300> so<00:00:26.750> for<00:00:27.080> the<00:00:27.140> air<00:00:27.260> to<00:00:27.380> flow<00:00:27.710> through

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940 
throw so for the air to flow through

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.540 
throw so for the air to flow through
quickly<00:00:29.140> and<00:00:30.140> easily<00:00:30.530> and<00:00:30.830> others<00:00:31.370> like<00:00:31.460> to

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
quickly and easily and others like to

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.340 
quickly and easily and others like to
imagine<00:00:31.760> it<00:00:32.000> a<00:00:32.180> stream<00:00:32.599> obviously<00:00:33.170> you<00:00:33.230> can

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
imagine it a stream obviously you can

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.560 
imagine it a stream obviously you can
actually<00:00:33.440> feel<00:00:33.739> the<00:00:33.920> air<00:00:34.040> flowing<00:00:34.520> but<00:00:34.700> it

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
actually feel the air flowing but it

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.910 
actually feel the air flowing but it
just<00:00:35.719> kind<00:00:35.930> of<00:00:35.989> seems<00:00:36.200> logical

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
just kind of seems logical

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.290 
just kind of seems logical
once<00:00:37.250> you<00:00:37.460> have<00:00:37.579> someone<00:00:39.969> so<00:00:40.969> what<00:00:41.120> I've<00:00:41.210> done

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
once you have someone so what I've done

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.209 
once you have someone so what I've done
is<00:00:41.449> place<00:00:41.749> the<00:00:41.929> three<00:00:42.109> logs<00:00:42.350> quite<00:00:42.890> close

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
is place the three logs quite close

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.489 
is place the three logs quite close
together<00:00:43.429> and<00:00:43.879> you<00:00:44.030> can<00:00:44.179> see<00:00:44.390> I've<00:00:44.539> tried<00:00:45.379> to

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:45.499 
together and you can see I've tried to

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:50.290 
together and you can see I've tried to
make<00:00:45.620> little<00:00:45.859> channels<00:00:47.170> so<00:00:48.909> you<00:00:49.909> can<00:00:50.120> already

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
make little channels so you can already

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.509 
make little channels so you can already
hear<00:00:50.539> it<00:00:50.600> starting<00:00:50.929> to<00:00:50.989> crackle<00:00:51.319> and<00:00:52.249> I<00:00:52.339> can

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
hear it starting to crackle and I can

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.880 
hear it starting to crackle and I can
see<00:00:52.969> the<00:00:53.390> smoke<00:00:53.629> floating<00:00:54.050> this<00:00:54.559> will<00:00:54.769> work

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
see the smoke floating this will work

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.290 
see the smoke floating this will work
even<00:00:55.249> if<00:00:55.339> you<00:00:55.399> don't<00:00:55.550> have<00:00:55.670> hot<00:00:55.850> coals<00:00:56.089> and

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
even if you don't have hot coals and

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.169 
even if you don't have hot coals and
he's<00:00:56.420> starting<00:00:56.749> completely<00:00:57.409> cold<00:00:58.120> now<00:00:59.120> you

00:00:59.169 --> 00:00:59.179 
he's starting completely cold now you

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:02.579 
he's starting completely cold now you
might<00:00:59.420> also<00:00:59.449> be<00:00:59.749> able<00:00:59.899> to<00:01:00.140> see<00:01:00.409> these<00:01:01.309> three

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
might also be able to see these three

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.049 
might also be able to see these three
bricks<00:01:03.589> at<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:03.859> top<00:01:04.010> of<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.190> fireplace<00:01:04.430> and

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
bricks at the top of the fireplace and

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.430 
bricks at the top of the fireplace and
they<00:01:06.550> can<00:01:07.550> indicate<00:01:08.240> where<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:08.630> airflow<00:01:08.990> is<00:01:09.170> I

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
they can indicate where the airflow is I

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
they can indicate where the airflow is I
should<00:01:10.190> also<00:01:10.340> point<00:01:10.490> out<00:01:10.759> that<00:01:10.939> I<00:01:11.149> have<00:01:11.320> the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
should also point out that I have the

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.760 
should also point out that I have the
damper<00:01:13.460> completely<00:01:14.180> open<00:01:14.540> which<00:01:15.439> is<00:01:15.560> very

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
damper completely open which is very

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.539 
damper completely open which is very
important<00:01:17.710> so<00:01:18.710> once<00:01:18.890> I've<00:01:19.009> got<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.340> three

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
important so once I've got the three

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.789 
important so once I've got the three
place<00:01:20.360> then<00:01:20.960> go<00:01:21.110> ahead<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.380> put<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.590> fire

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
place then go ahead and put the fire

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.219 
place then go ahead and put the fire
light<00:01:22.100> as<00:01:22.280> he<00:01:22.630> so<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:23.750> can<00:01:23.840> probably<00:01:23.960> see<00:01:24.200> the

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
light as he so you can probably see the

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:25.209 
light as he so you can probably see the
fire<00:01:24.469> lighters<00:01:24.740> are<00:01:24.770> in<00:01:24.950> there<00:01:25.070> nice<00:01:25.189> and

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
fire lighters are in there nice and

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:31.649 
fire lighters are in there nice and
tight<00:01:25.430> I'm<00:01:25.700> just<00:01:25.820> going<00:01:25.939> to<00:01:26.000> light<00:01:26.149> them<00:01:26.299> up

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.770 

look<00:01:32.659> at<00:01:32.780> that<00:01:32.899> bursting<00:01:33.619> into<00:01:33.740> flame

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
look at that bursting into flame

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.289 
look at that bursting into flame
beautifully<00:01:37.000> obviously<00:01:38.000> it's<00:01:38.090> because<00:01:38.149> I

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
beautifully obviously it's because I

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:39.370 
beautifully obviously it's because I
have<00:01:38.420> fire<00:01:38.630> lighters<00:01:38.869> that<00:01:38.899> you<00:01:39.049> can<00:01:39.140> already

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
have fire lighters that you can already

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.050 
have fire lighters that you can already
see<00:01:39.649> how<00:01:40.039> the<00:01:40.100> flame<00:01:40.369> is<00:01:40.490> traveling<00:01:40.850> around<00:01:40.909> to

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
see how the flame is traveling around to

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.679 
see how the flame is traveling around to
the<00:01:41.119> other<00:01:41.270> side<00:01:41.390> of<00:01:41.659> this<00:01:41.780> log<00:01:42.049> and<00:01:43.689> burning

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
the other side of this log and burning

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.980 
the other side of this log and burning
up<00:01:44.780> very<00:01:45.079> fast<00:01:45.560> as<00:01:45.770> well<00:01:45.950> so<00:01:46.189> that<00:01:46.990> that's

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
up very fast as well so that that's

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.630 
up very fast as well so that that's
great<00:01:48.229> and<00:01:48.680> it's<00:01:48.799> gonna<00:01:48.920> build<00:01:49.070> a<00:01:49.189> nice<00:01:49.369> strong

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
great and it's gonna build a nice strong

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.929 
great and it's gonna build a nice strong
fire<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.179> then<00:01:50.509> you<00:01:51.350> can<00:01:51.530> go<00:01:52.520> back<00:01:52.700> to<00:01:52.729> your

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
fire and then you can go back to your

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.810 
fire and then you can go back to your
local<00:01:53.299> she<00:01:54.020> should<00:01:54.170> have<00:01:54.350> handy<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:55.130> you<00:01:55.670> put

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
local she should have handy and you put

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.080 
local she should have handy and you put
another<00:01:56.030> you<00:01:56.390> know<00:01:56.509> one<00:01:56.659> on<00:01:56.810> top<00:01:56.990> crossways

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
another you know one on top crossways

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.039 
another you know one on top crossways
they<00:01:59.090> kind<00:01:59.390> of<00:01:59.479> making<00:01:59.600> your<00:01:59.750> noughts<00:01:59.929> and

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
they kind of making your noughts and

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.569 
they kind of making your noughts and
crosses<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:00.710> then<00:02:00.799> you<00:02:00.859> get<00:02:00.950> another<00:02:01.009> one

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.510 

down<00:02:04.579> on<00:02:04.759> crossways<00:02:05.600> with<00:02:06.170> a<00:02:06.200> gap

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
down on crossways with a gap

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.420 
down on crossways with a gap
what<00:02:08.619> just<00:02:09.619> why<00:02:09.709> you<00:02:09.770> should<00:02:09.920> wear<00:02:10.039> gloves

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.120 

okay<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.930> is<00:02:15.050> not<00:02:15.170> perfect<00:02:15.620> but<00:02:15.770> I<00:02:15.830> think<00:02:16.010> it

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
okay that is not perfect but I think it

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.410 
okay that is not perfect but I think it
demonstrates<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.730> point<00:02:16.940> so<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:17.180> can<00:02:17.270> say

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
demonstrates the point so you can say

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.449 
demonstrates the point so you can say
the<00:02:17.510> plank<00:02:17.750> is<00:02:17.840> coming<00:02:18.110> up<00:02:18.280> through<00:02:19.280> all<00:02:19.310> the

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
the plank is coming up through all the

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.150 
the plank is coming up through all the
gap<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.790> then<00:02:19.880> you<00:02:19.970> shut<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.450> door<00:02:20.860> now<00:02:21.860> when

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
gap and then you shut the door now when

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.050 
gap and then you shut the door now when
you<00:02:22.280> do<00:02:22.400> that<00:02:23.019> don't<00:02:24.489> do<00:02:25.489> it<00:02:25.610> full<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:25.880> just

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
you do that don't do it full it just

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.430 
you do that don't do it full it just
sort<00:02:26.390> of<00:02:26.420> leave<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.780> handle<00:02:27.080> not<00:02:27.230> fully

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
sort of leave the handle not fully

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.920 
sort of leave the handle not fully
twisted<00:02:27.830> in

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.510 

so<00:02:31.930> this<00:02:32.110> is<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.380> fire<00:02:32.560> at<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.100> 10-minute

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
so this is the fire at the 10-minute

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.580 
so this is the fire at the 10-minute
mark<00:02:33.550> and<00:02:33.820> you<00:02:33.880> can<00:02:34.030> see<00:02:34.240> it's<00:02:35.170> definitely

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
mark and you can see it's definitely

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.550 
mark and you can see it's definitely
burning<00:02:35.830> without<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.730> fire<00:02:36.940> lighters<00:02:37.560> the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
burning without the fire lighters the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.810 
burning without the fire lighters the
log<00:02:38.710> that<00:02:38.830> was<00:02:38.950> already<00:02:39.130> warm<00:02:39.400> it's<00:02:39.550> obviously

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
log that was already warm it's obviously

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.730 
log that was already warm it's obviously
a<00:02:40.090> lot<00:02:40.300> further<00:02:40.510> advanced<00:02:40.900> but<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:41.470> can<00:02:41.590> see

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
a lot further advanced but you can see

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.620 
a lot further advanced but you can see
the<00:02:41.920> cold<00:02:42.580> dry<00:02:42.790> ones<00:02:42.970> are<00:02:43.090> doing<00:02:43.150> just<00:02:43.420> fine<00:02:43.480> on

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
the cold dry ones are doing just fine on

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.900 
the cold dry ones are doing just fine on
their<00:02:43.900> own<00:02:44.020> too<00:02:44.200> so<00:02:44.440> I'm<00:02:45.220> going<00:02:45.550> to<00:02:45.580> shut<00:02:45.790> the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
their own too so I'm going to shut the

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.940 
their own too so I'm going to shut the
door<00:02:45.940> now<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.480> come<00:02:47.320> back<00:02:47.350> in<00:02:47.590> half<00:02:47.680> an<00:02:47.860> hour

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.509 
door now and come back in half an hour
when<00:02:48.220> it<00:02:48.250> should<00:02:48.430> be<00:02:48.520> fully<00:02:48.730> established

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.690 

and<00:02:52.790> say<00:02:52.939> the<00:02:53.060> fire<00:02:53.269> is<00:02:53.510> well<00:02:54.049> and<00:02:54.319> truly<00:02:54.700> alert

things while the fires basically lit

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.399 
things while the fires basically lit
itself<00:03:17.359> and<00:03:17.510> got<00:03:17.599> established<00:03:17.870> which<00:03:18.230> is<00:03:18.379> a

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:18.409 
itself and got established which is a

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.009 
itself and got established which is a
huge<00:03:18.650> improvement<00:03:18.920> in<00:03:19.370> my<00:03:19.819> life<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.269> hope<00:03:20.480> will

I<00:03:22.639> have<00:03:23.450> tried<00:03:23.629> this<00:03:23.750> technique<00:03:24.079> in<00:03:24.290> an<00:03:24.409> open

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
I have tried this technique in an open

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.970 
I have tried this technique in an open
fireplace<00:03:24.919> and<00:03:25.370> it<00:03:25.459> didn't<00:03:25.730> work<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:26.359> I<00:03:27.349> think

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
fireplace and it didn't work so I think

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.210 
fireplace and it didn't work so I think
it<00:03:28.069> could<00:03:28.310> just<00:03:28.459> be<00:03:28.669> for<00:03:29.650> your<00:03:30.650> burning<00:03:30.980> fires

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
it could just be for your burning fires

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.580 
it could just be for your burning fires
like<00:03:31.579> this<00:03:31.870> particularly<00:03:32.870> slow<00:03:33.230> combustion

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
like this particularly slow combustion

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.280 
like this particularly slow combustion
heaters<00:03:34.040> I<00:03:34.370> don't<00:03:35.180> know<00:03:35.269> if<00:03:35.419> it's<00:03:35.540> just<00:03:35.750> for<00:03:35.900> lo

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
heaters I don't know if it's just for lo
