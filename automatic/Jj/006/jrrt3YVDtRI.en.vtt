00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
here on the body and then and then this

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.830 
here on the body and then and then this
is<00:02:56.859> a<00:02:56.890> waste<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:58.000> that<00:02:58.030> goes<00:02:58.569> here<00:02:58.930> and<00:03:00.840> and

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
is a waste so that goes here and and

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.979 
is a waste so that goes here and and
then<00:03:02.049> this<00:03:02.739> is<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.190> other<00:03:03.220> arm<00:03:03.819> so<00:03:04.150> that<00:03:04.540> goes

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
then this is the other arm so that goes

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.589 
then this is the other arm so that goes
here<00:03:05.349> and<00:03:07.260> this<00:03:08.260> these<00:03:09.190> are<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:09.730> two<00:03:09.760> feet<00:03:10.359> and
