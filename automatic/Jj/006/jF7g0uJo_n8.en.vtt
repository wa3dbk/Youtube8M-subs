00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.179
 situation from the life of one of my 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.480
 subscribers 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:20.720
 man recently bought motor oil 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:24.060
 onions this 10th 40 semi-synthetics and 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:28.019
 the essence of his problem was supposedly 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:32.130
 the fact that he bought here is oil 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.110
 left here and come home looking 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.840

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.270
 the rest there on the forums 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.610
 I saw this naturally, he somehow 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.489
 for worried thought it might be 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.940
 some fake or some new 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.710
 packaging is still some kind of left thoughts in 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.600
 wrong cards went to the head in 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:57.270
 Generally the fact is that this one of Lukoil 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.930
 which left is lukoil which 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.780
 developing in romania this one 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.600

 roughness such a relief and let's say 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.810

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.330
