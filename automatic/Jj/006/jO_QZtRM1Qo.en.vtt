back he's here kidding
I<00:00:15.540> probably<00:00:16.230> start<00:00:16.560> going<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.310> bit<00:00:17.460> thin<00:00:17.760> around

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
I probably start going a bit thin around

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.859 
I probably start going a bit thin around
the<00:00:18.090> crown<00:00:18.390> let's<00:00:18.690> get<00:00:18.840> see<00:00:19.670> from<00:00:20.670> about<00:00:20.869> 2008

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
the crown let's get see from about 2008

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.890 
the crown let's get see from about 2008
I<00:00:22.439> think<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.160> few<00:00:23.369> years<00:00:23.609> looked<00:00:24.539> at<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> few

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
I think so a few years looked at a few

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.960 
I think so a few years looked at a few
treatments<00:00:25.970> creams<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.420> taking<00:00:27.930> some

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
treatments creams and taking some

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.400 
treatments creams and taking some
propecia<00:00:29.970> that's<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.449> called<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.779> but

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
propecia that's it and called it but

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.810 
propecia that's it and called it but
it's<00:00:31.650> like<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> routine<00:00:32.399> thing<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.790> I

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
it's like a routine thing that I

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.360 
it's like a routine thing that I
couldn't<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.300> know<00:00:33.360> take<00:00:33.719> all<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.020> time<00:00:34.370> and

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
couldn't you know take all the time and

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.400 
couldn't you know take all the time and
then<00:00:35.579> I'd<00:00:36.210> stop<00:00:36.690> taking<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.079> really<00:00:37.350> and

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
then I'd stop taking on really and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.080 
then I'd stop taking on really and
slowly<00:00:37.710> girl<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.340> know<00:00:38.430> getting<00:00:38.670> naturally

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
slowly girl you know getting naturally

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.479 
slowly girl you know getting naturally
to<00:00:39.239> where<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.540> gets<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:40.020> then<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.100> knew<00:00:41.370> about

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
to where it gets to then I knew about

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.250 
to where it gets to then I knew about
this<00:00:41.760> because<00:00:42.030> he<00:00:42.210> they<00:00:42.329> could<00:00:42.480> get<00:00:42.600> done<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
this because he they could get done and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.900 
this because he they could get done and
we<00:00:43.320> camouflage<00:00:44.010> me<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> bit<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.610> thought<00:00:44.789> oh

we camouflage me a bit and I thought oh

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.029 
we camouflage me a bit and I thought oh
I'll<00:00:45.059> give<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.450> go<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:46.620> know<00:00:46.739> it's

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
I'll give that a go you know it's

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.590 
I'll give that a go you know it's
permanent<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.789> stay<00:00:48.059> there's<00:00:48.510> no

Lance<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.460> pointless<00:01:50.939> because<00:01:51.060> most<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.780> my

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
Lance is pointless because most of my

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.060 
Lance is pointless because most of my
hair<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.049> pretty<00:01:52.229> much<00:01:52.380> thinner<00:01:52.649> on<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.860> back

hair is pretty much thinner on the back

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.770 
hair is pretty much thinner on the back
I<00:01:53.340> think<00:01:53.610> people<00:01:53.850> who<00:01:53.909> have<00:01:53.970> transplants

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
I think people who have transplants

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.600 
I think people who have transplants
mislead<00:01:55.619> because<00:01:55.950> they're<00:01:56.070> taking<00:01:56.369> hair

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
getting big scar as well to the front

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.620 
getting big scar as well to the front
and<00:02:02.320> that's<00:02:02.920> not<00:02:03.070> all<00:02:03.190> so<00:02:03.460> long<00:02:04.240> lasting

eventually that would fall out if he got

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.850 
eventually that would fall out if he got

what gains a continuance thing but

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.970 
what gains a continuance thing but
that's<00:02:16.660> something<00:02:17.020> that<00:02:17.140> wouldn't<00:02:17.410> do<00:02:17.530> no

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
that's something that wouldn't do no

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.410 
that's something that wouldn't do no
it's<00:02:18.220> how<00:02:18.280> do<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.489> take<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.760> medications<00:02:19.330> you

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
it's how do you take the medications you

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.540 
it's how do you take the medications you
can't<00:02:19.600> keep<00:02:19.750> up<00:02:19.959> with<00:02:20.170> or<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:21.040> go<00:02:21.280> for<00:02:21.459> this

can't keep up with or you go for this

can't keep up with or you go for this
sort<00:02:21.910> of<00:02:21.940> option<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.480> I<00:02:22.540> normally<00:02:22.720> keep<00:02:23.020> my

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
sort of option and I normally keep my

sort of option and I normally keep my
hair<00:02:23.319> short<00:02:23.350> anyway<00:02:23.980> so<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.700> said<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.090> give<00:02:25.360> this

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
hair short anyway so I said to give this

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.300 
hair short anyway so I said to give this
a<00:02:25.569> go<00:02:25.690> this<00:02:25.900> is<00:02:26.020> probably<00:02:26.260> better<00:02:26.440> thing<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.130> do

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
a go this is probably better thing to do

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.070 
a go this is probably better thing to do
and<00:02:27.790> you<00:02:27.940> can<00:02:28.060> see<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.420> I've<00:02:28.540> pretty<00:02:28.989> much

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
and you can see that I've pretty much

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.020 
and you can see that I've pretty much
got<00:02:29.350> most<00:02:29.470> of<00:02:29.620> my<00:02:29.680> hair<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.280> what<00:02:30.670> apart<00:02:30.940> from

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
got most of my hair and what apart from

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.080 
got most of my hair and what apart from
here<00:02:31.360> just<00:02:31.750> your<00:02:32.350> crayon<00:02:32.920> diamond<00:02:33.610> teardrop

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
here just your crayon diamond teardrop

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.030 
here just your crayon diamond teardrop
shape<00:02:34.390> you<00:02:34.510> can<00:02:34.600> see<00:02:34.780> that's<00:02:35.650> where<00:02:35.890> it's

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
shape you can see that's where it's

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.590 
shape you can see that's where it's
thinning<00:02:36.269> when<00:02:37.269> it<00:02:37.360> cut<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.570> short

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
thinning when it cut you short

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.570 
thinning when it cut you short
everything<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.290> looks<00:02:38.680> okay<00:02:38.980> blends<00:02:39.370> quite

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
everything that looks okay blends quite

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.310 
everything that looks okay blends quite
well<00:02:39.760> we're<00:02:39.970> just<00:02:40.000> around<00:02:40.330> here<00:02:40.570> is<00:02:40.780> where<00:02:41.230> the

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
well we're just around here is where the

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.020 
well we're just around here is where the
treatments<00:02:41.709> issues<00:02:41.920> can<00:02:42.070> take<00:02:42.220> place<00:02:42.430> so<00:02:42.910> the

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
treatments issues can take place so the

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.660 
treatments issues can take place so the
idea<00:02:43.300> is<00:02:43.500> they<00:02:44.500> match<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:45.040> hair<00:02:45.190> color<00:02:45.430> and

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
idea is they match the hair color and

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.400 
idea is they match the hair color and
also<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:45.940> spacing<00:02:46.450> between<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:47.260> hair

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
also the spacing between the the hair

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.190 
also the spacing between the the hair
follicles<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.459> way<00:02:48.610> it<00:02:48.730> grows<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:49.480> just

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
follicles and the way it grows and just

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.870 
follicles and the way it grows and just
blend<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.590> in<00:02:50.680> really<00:02:50.709> so<00:02:51.130> he<00:02:51.190> camouflages

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
blend it in really so he camouflages

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.460 
blend it in really so he camouflages
well<00:02:52.060> with<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.300> rest<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:52.630> their<00:02:53.170> hair<00:02:53.320> they

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
well with the rest of their hair they

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.870 
well with the rest of their hair they
could<00:02:53.620> see<00:02:56.040> I'm<00:02:57.040> off<00:02:57.190> with<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.430> pain<00:02:57.670> and

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
could see I'm off with the pain and

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.520 
could see I'm off with the pain and
couldn't<00:02:58.330> set<00:02:58.450> back<00:02:58.600> if<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:58.989> bleeds<00:02:59.290> on<00:02:59.440> the

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
couldn't set back if you bleeds on the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.380 
couldn't set back if you bleeds on the
scalp<00:02:59.800> and<00:02:59.920> maybe<00:03:00.100> some<00:03:00.280> people's<00:03:00.610> skin<00:03:01.269> and

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
scalp and maybe some people's skin and

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.580 
scalp and maybe some people's skin and
be<00:03:01.450> more<00:03:01.600> sensitive<00:03:01.930> than<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.230> others<00:03:02.470> I

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
be more sensitive than the others I

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.759 
be more sensitive than the others I
think<00:03:02.799> I<00:03:02.980> would<00:03:03.100> say<00:03:03.190> my<00:03:03.340> skin<00:03:03.400> he's<00:03:03.700> sensitive

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
think I would say my skin he's sensitive

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.750 
think I would say my skin he's sensitive
apart<00:03:05.769> from<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:05.980> now<00:03:06.340> I<00:03:06.370> think<00:03:06.670> they're

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
apart from that now I think they're

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.830 
apart from that now I think they're
gonna<00:03:06.850> color<00:03:07.150> much<00:03:07.360> sheet<00:03:07.570> with<00:03:07.720> the

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
gonna color much sheet with the

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.870 
gonna color much sheet with the
remaining<00:03:08.170> here<00:03:08.440> so<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.709> won't<00:03:08.920> be<00:03:09.070> like<00:03:09.220> in

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
remaining here so it won't be like in

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.699 
remaining here so it won't be like in
the<00:03:10.030> bit<00:03:10.180> stunned<00:03:10.420> are<00:03:10.720> more<00:03:11.049> blacker<00:03:11.320> than<00:03:11.530> my

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
the bit stunned are more blacker than my

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.020 
the bit stunned are more blacker than my
other<00:03:11.860> here<00:03:12.040> I<00:03:12.070> think<00:03:12.310> they<00:03:12.400> watching<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:12.940> I

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
other here I think they watching and I

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.300
