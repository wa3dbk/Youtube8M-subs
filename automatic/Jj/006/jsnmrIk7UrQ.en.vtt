00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
stock one so I kept that I probably

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.530 
stock one so I kept that I probably
would<00:02:26.960> have<00:02:27.050> chosen<00:02:27.320> out<00:02:27.890> of<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:29.120> other<00:02:29.270> two

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540

would have chosen out of the other two
fuel<00:02:29.960> tank<00:02:30.170> 2<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:30.650> then<00:02:30.890> fuel<00:02:31.130> tank<00:02:31.310> one<00:02:31.460> so<00:02:32.060> I

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
fuel tank 2 and then fuel tank one so I

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.930 
fuel tank 2 and then fuel tank one so I
I<00:02:32.750> preferred<00:02:33.230> stock<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.740> kept<00:02:33.950> that<00:02:34.100> now<00:02:34.880> the

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
like a different wheel the front and the

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.650 
like a different wheel the front and the
rear<00:02:57.620> tire<00:02:58.070> but<00:02:58.760> I<00:02:58.790> actually<00:02:58.910> decided<00:02:59.210> to<00:02:59.480> go

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
rear tire but I actually decided to go

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.100 
rear tire but I actually decided to go
for<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.110> Stiletto<00:03:00.830> wheels<00:03:01.520> on<00:03:01.910> both<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.930> back

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110

for the Stiletto wheels on both the back
in<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.290> front<00:03:03.410> I<00:03:03.650> think<00:03:03.860> it<00:03:03.950> just<00:03:03.980> they<00:03:04.280> look

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
in the front I think it just they look

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.820 
in the front I think it just they look
really<00:03:04.700> cool<00:03:04.970> these<00:03:05.180> wheels<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:06.530> went<00:03:06.740> ahead

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
really cool these wheels so I went ahead

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.350 
really cool these wheels so I went ahead
and<00:03:07.010> did<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.340> now<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.790> cool<00:03:08.000> thing<00:03:08.030> about

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
and did that now the cool thing about

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.990 
and did that now the cool thing about
the<00:03:08.930> bike<00:03:09.170> wheels<00:03:09.470> is<00:03:09.740> that<00:03:10.280> when<00:03:10.580> you<00:03:10.610> put<00:03:10.850> on

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
the bike wheels is that when you put on

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.970 
the bike wheels is that when you put on
the<00:03:11.150> custom<00:03:11.600> tires<00:03:11.900> they<00:03:12.350> all<00:03:12.560> have<00:03:12.830> that

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
good on the bikes so all of them have it

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.570 
good on the bikes so all of them have it
no<00:03:17.810> matter<00:03:17.960> what<00:03:18.080> wheels<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:18.740> choose<00:03:18.980> so
