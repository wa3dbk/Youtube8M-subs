is a great great track I wouldn't say

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.680

it's<00:00:46.989> my<00:00:47.079> favourite<00:00:47.440> on<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.590> calendar<00:00:48.100> but<00:00:48.309> I

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
it's my favourite on the calendar but I

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.259 
it's my favourite on the calendar but I
definitely<00:00:49.690> do<00:00:50.050> enjoy<00:00:50.320> driving<00:00:50.679> it<00:00:51.070> on<00:00:51.309> pretty

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
much any game except on ko monsters just

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.099 
much any game except on ko monsters just
because<00:00:55.000> the<00:00:55.210> way<00:00:55.300> that<00:00:55.480> they<00:00:55.600> cause<00:00:55.809> react

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
because the way that they cause react

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:57.569 
because the way that they cause react
and<00:00:56.260> everything<00:00:56.500> like<00:00:56.589> I<00:00:56.829> try<00:00:57.190> that<00:00:57.219> quite

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
and everything like I try that quite

and everything like I try that quite
hard<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:57.820> enjoy<00:00:58.149> it<00:00:58.300> but<00:00:58.629> whatever<00:00:59.260> doesn't

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
hard to enjoy it but whatever doesn't

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.130 
hard to enjoy it but whatever doesn't
matter<00:01:00.179> it's<00:01:01.179> er<00:01:01.390> just<00:01:01.629> try<00:01:01.750> and<00:01:01.809> get<00:01:01.899> the<00:01:01.989> best

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
matter it's er just try and get the best

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.490 
matter it's er just try and get the best
result<00:01:02.410> we<00:01:02.469> can<00:01:02.649> here<00:01:02.949> and<00:01:04.379> accelerate<00:01:05.379> away

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
result we can here and accelerate away

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.010 
result we can here and accelerate away
and<00:01:06.280> try<00:01:06.580> and<00:01:06.760> get<00:01:06.910> into<00:01:07.120> q2<00:01:07.390> -<00:01:07.690> perfectly

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
and try and get into q2 - perfectly

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.780 
and try and get into q2 - perfectly
honest<00:01:08.200> that's<00:01:08.320> what<00:01:08.470> we're<00:01:08.590> doing<00:01:08.860> we're

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
honest that's what we're doing we're

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.990 
honest that's what we're doing we're
going<00:01:09.909> out<00:01:10.000> one<00:01:10.450> lap<00:01:10.659> time<00:01:11.549> see<00:01:12.549> what<00:01:12.700> we<00:01:12.820> can

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
going out one lap time see what we can

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.039 
going out one lap time see what we can
do<00:01:13.150> here<00:01:18.210> there<00:01:19.210> but<00:01:19.390> they<00:01:19.509> didn't<00:01:19.720> give<00:01:19.900> me<00:01:19.990> a

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
do here there but they didn't give me a

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.280 
do here there but they didn't give me a
penalty<00:01:20.590> so<00:01:20.649> that's<00:01:20.920> good<00:01:22.020> cause<00:01:23.020> they're

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
penalty so that's good cause they're

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.450 
penalty so that's good cause they're
probably<00:01:23.470> should've<00:01:23.710> got<00:01:23.860> penalty<00:01:24.250> there<00:01:24.399> you

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
probably should've got penalty there you

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.980 
probably should've got penalty there you
get<00:01:24.549> penalties<00:01:25.000> for<00:01:25.119> sometimes<00:01:25.509> things<00:01:25.840> that

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
get penalties for sometimes things that

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.280 
get penalties for sometimes things that
you<00:01:26.170> didn't<00:01:27.070> deserve<00:01:27.130> and<00:01:27.520> vice<00:01:27.790> versa<00:01:28.390> but<00:01:28.600> up

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
you didn't deserve and vice versa but up

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.600 
you didn't deserve and vice versa but up
to<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.560> finish<00:01:29.799> line<00:01:29.829> this<00:01:30.130> is<00:01:30.189> looking<00:01:30.549> like

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
to the finish line this is looking like

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.380 
to the finish line this is looking like
a<00:01:30.729> really<00:01:31.390> good<00:01:31.600> lap<00:01:31.810> time<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.470> actually<00:01:33.390> it's

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
a really good lap time and actually it's

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.100 
a really good lap time and actually it's
gonna<00:01:34.570> put<00:01:34.810> me<00:01:34.960> fooled<00:01:35.740> fastest<00:01:36.610> I<00:01:37.020> tell<00:01:38.020> you

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
what I think this is gonna be a good

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:48.289 
what I think this is gonna be a good
track<00:01:40.570> for<00:01:40.719> me<00:01:40.840> here<00:01:41.079> so<00:01:41.259> this<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:43.509> session

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:55.620 

see<00:01:49.299> what<00:01:49.450> I<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:53.700> expected<00:01:54.700> just<00:01:55.329> because

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
see what I just expected just because

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.840 
see what I just expected just because
I'm<00:01:55.750> so<00:01:55.869> behind<00:01:56.020> on<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:56.560> one<00:01:56.710> 2013<00:01:57.340> it<00:01:57.579> makes<00:01:57.729> me

probably<00:01:58.149> film

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
probably film

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.980 
probably film
I<00:01:58.540> could<00:01:59.050> do<00:01:59.140> better<00:01:59.290> on<00:01:59.410> this<00:01:59.680> but<00:02:00.780> now<00:02:01.780> let's

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
I could do better on this but now let's

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.630 
I could do better on this but now let's
try<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:02.350> go<00:02:02.500> for<00:02:02.800> even<00:02:03.370> better<00:02:03.610> laughing

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
try and go for even better laughing

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.800 
try and go for even better laughing
that's<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.820> way<00:02:06.940> I<00:02:06.970> want<00:02:07.180> to<00:02:07.240> do

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.220 

oopsie

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
oopsie

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.690 
oopsie
I<00:02:11.260> think<00:02:11.800> that<00:02:11.920> means<00:02:12.100> that's<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.370> end<00:02:12.520> of<00:02:12.580> my

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
I think that means that's the end of my

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.820 
I think that means that's the end of my
call<00:02:12.910> of<00:02:13.030> wine<00:02:13.240> now<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:13.780> don't<00:02:14.680> think

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.450 

fortunately<00:02:17.830> that's<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.220> end<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.370> the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
fortunately that's the end of the

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.560 
fortunately that's the end of the
qualifying<00:02:18.910> session<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:21.240> just<00:02:22.240> went<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.390> little

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
qualifying session I just went a little

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.840 
qualifying session I just went a little
bit<00:02:22.750> too<00:02:22.810> far<00:02:23.140> into<00:02:23.680> turn<00:02:23.920> one<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:24.580> just

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
bit too far into turn one and that just

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.160 
bit too far into turn one and that just
completely<00:02:25.270> messed<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.780> all<00:02:25.840> up<00:02:26.020> and

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
completely messed it all up and

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.550 
completely messed it all up and
terrorized<00:02:26.860> into<00:02:27.280> q2<00:02:27.610> as<00:02:27.850> well<00:02:28.440> but<00:02:29.440> I'm

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
terrorized into q2 as well but I'm

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.020 
terrorized into q2 as well but I'm
pretty<00:02:29.800> confident<00:02:30.400> we<00:02:30.580> can<00:02:30.700> have<00:02:30.820> a<00:02:30.850> good

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
pretty confident we can have a good

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.800 
pretty confident we can have a good
result<00:02:31.300> in<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.540> race<00:02:31.690> here<00:02:31.930> guys<00:02:32.110> so<00:02:33.810> actually

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
result in the race here guys so actually

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.120 
result in the race here guys so actually
I<00:02:34.930> honestly<00:02:35.350> think<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:35.680> probably<00:02:35.800> could<00:02:36.070> have

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
I honestly think I probably could have

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.730 
I honestly think I probably could have
got<00:02:36.280> pole<00:02:36.460> position<00:02:36.880> there<00:02:37.200> I'll<00:02:38.200> simplify

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
got pole position there I'll simplify

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.590 
got pole position there I'll simplify
this<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.520> overall<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.240> was<00:02:40.330> only<00:02:40.510> on<00:02:40.570> my

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
this to overall and that was only on my

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.740 
this to overall and that was only on my
first<00:02:41.320> lap<00:02:41.650> on<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:42.010> so<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.550> see<00:02:43.300> what<00:02:43.450> we<00:02:43.510> can<00:02:43.660> do

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
first lap on it so I see what we can do

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.030 
first lap on it so I see what we can do
in<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.930> race<00:02:44.080> here<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.380> think<00:02:44.650> we<00:02:44.740> can<00:02:44.920> do

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
in the race here I think we can do

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.580 
in the race here I think we can do
something<00:02:45.340> pretty<00:02:45.490> good<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.540> we<00:02:47.320> just<00:02:47.500> need

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
something pretty good and we just need

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.610 
something pretty good and we just need
to<00:02:47.620> do<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.250> bit<00:02:48.910> better<00:02:49.120> in<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.870> rest<00:02:50.080> we<00:02:50.320> think

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
to do a bit better in the rest we think

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.940 
to do a bit better in the rest we think
was<00:02:50.800> wine<00:02:51.070> but<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.940> q1<00:02:52.450> that<00:02:52.690> because<00:02:53.230> I<00:02:53.350> think

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
was wine but the q1 that because I think

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.080 
was wine but the q1 that because I think
that's<00:02:54.100> a<00:02:55.710> day<00:02:56.710> out<00:02:56.920> qualified<00:02:57.490> football<00:02:58.180> cars

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
that's a day out qualified football cars

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.550 
that's a day out qualified football cars
they<00:03:01.090> always<00:03:01.240> have<00:03:01.390> pretty<00:03:01.570> bad<00:03:01.810> start<00:03:02.140> so<00:03:02.440> we

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
they always have pretty bad start so we

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.809 
they always have pretty bad start so we
can<00:03:02.740> have<00:03:02.860> a

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
can have a

decent<00:04:34.850> race<00:04:35.180> apart<00:04:35.600> from<00:04:35.780> that<00:04:36.110> carnage<00:04:36.740> on

just let it go for like a little bit
longer<00:04:46.610> to<00:04:46.790> see<00:04:46.940> there's<00:04:47.120> any<00:04:47.270> more<00:04:47.390> carnage

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
it would crumple my prompt wing and
