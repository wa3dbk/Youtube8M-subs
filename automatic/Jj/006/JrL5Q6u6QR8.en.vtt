00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
but as you can see even under the light

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.900 
but as you can see even under the light
like<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.649> like<00:00:52.860> coming<00:00:53.160> from<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.460> window

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
like this is like coming from the window

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.479 
like this is like coming from the window
okay<00:00:54.829> it's<00:00:55.829> really<00:00:56.309> not<00:00:56.930> even<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.109> blue<00:00:58.620> like

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
okay it's really not even that blue like

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.569 
okay it's really not even that blue like
in<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.329> pictures<00:01:00.750> for<00:01:01.500> some<00:01:01.800> reason<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.370> comes

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
in the pictures for some reason it comes

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.719 
in the pictures for some reason it comes
out<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:04.140> be<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:05.129> lot<00:01:05.430> more<00:01:05.729> lighter<00:01:06.720> than<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.229> is

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
out to be a lot more lighter than it is

summertime I go to the beach a lot so I

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.420 
summertime I go to the beach a lot so I
need<00:04:09.849> a<00:04:09.879> watch<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.889> basically<00:04:11.889> won't<00:04:12.190> mess

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.920 
up and I think that if this one didn't
mess<00:04:17.410> up<00:04:17.590> then<00:04:18.340> this<00:04:18.910> one<00:04:19.120> should<00:04:19.599> do<00:04:19.750> quite

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
mess up then this one should do quite

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.880 
mess up then this one should do quite
good<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.829> only<00:04:21.099> thing<00:04:21.450> is<00:04:22.450> the<00:04:23.169> day<00:04:23.440> and<00:04:23.650> date
