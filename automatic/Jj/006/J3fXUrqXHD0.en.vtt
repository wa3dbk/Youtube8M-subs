is<00:02:06.940> one<00:02:07.090> we<00:02:07.210> have<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.510> keep<00:02:07.690> because<00:02:07.990> we<00:02:08.140> are<00:02:08.259> a

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
is one we have to keep because we are a

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.020 
is one we have to keep because we are a
constructor<00:02:08.800> championship<00:02:09.340> we<00:02:09.610> race<00:02:09.819> one

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
constructor championship we race one

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.119 
constructor championship we race one
another<00:02:10.300> I<00:02:10.599> hope<00:02:11.260> as<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.500> show<00:02:11.769> that<00:02:12.010> it's

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
another I hope as a show that it's

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.910 
another I hope as a show that it's
entertaining<00:02:13.090> if<00:02:13.750> all<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.019> cars<00:02:14.230> were<00:02:14.530> very

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
entertaining if all the cars were very

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.890 
entertaining if all the cars were very
open<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.909> you<00:02:15.970> could<00:02:16.090> see<00:02:16.300> everything<00:02:16.540> then

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
open and you could see everything then

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.690 
open and you could see everything then
we<00:02:17.290> almost<00:02:17.440> lose<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.860> constructor<00:02:18.310> title<00:02:18.640> to

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
we almost lose the constructor title to

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.460 
we almost lose the constructor title to
my<00:02:18.819> line<00:02:19.030> so<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.930> little<00:02:20.260> bit<00:02:20.409> of

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
my line so a little bit of

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.630 
my line so a little bit of
competitiveness<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.310> therefore<00:02:21.550> a<00:02:21.580> little

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
competitiveness and therefore a little

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.700 
competitiveness and therefore a little
bit<00:02:21.819> of<00:02:21.879> secrecy<00:02:22.209> and<00:02:22.360> enhance<00:02:23.170> board<00:02:23.380> what's

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
bit of secrecy and enhance board what's

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.900 
bit of secrecy and enhance board what's
the<00:02:23.830> trade-off<00:02:24.040> point<00:02:24.370> paddy<00:02:24.550> between

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
the trade-off point paddy between

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.550 
the trade-off point paddy between
keeping<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.660> secrets<00:02:26.020> that<00:02:26.050> you<00:02:26.140> have<00:02:26.380> to

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
keeping the secrets that you have to

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.550 
keeping the secrets that you have to
keep<00:02:26.740> and

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
keep and

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.020

anything's<00:02:27.920> up<00:02:28.099> to<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.700> pound<00:02:28.910> I

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
anything's up to the to the pound I

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.960 
anything's up to the to the pound I

interested in you guys are feel it

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.970 
interested in you guys are feel it
technologies<00:03:17.599> is<00:03:18.019> important<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:18.769> that

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
technologies is important and that

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.979 
technologies is important and that
information<00:03:19.610> is<00:03:19.910> important<00:03:20.330> I<00:03:20.420> think<00:03:20.510> I<00:03:20.780> think

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
information is important I think I think

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.960 
information is important I think I think
what's<00:03:21.200> fantastic<00:03:21.470> about<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.280> fan<00:03:22.489> base<00:03:22.730> of

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
what's fantastic about the fan base of

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.020 
what's fantastic about the fan base of
Formula<00:03:23.330> One<00:03:23.480> is<00:03:23.750> that<00:03:24.319> they<00:03:24.530> are<00:03:24.739> generally<00:03:25.489> a

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
Formula One is that they are generally a

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.270 
Formula One is that they are generally a
very<00:03:26.480> technical<00:03:26.690> audience<00:03:27.170> I<00:03:27.709> think<00:03:28.130> that

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
very technical audience I think that

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.170 
very technical audience I think that
sets<00:03:28.610> sets<00:03:29.090> you<00:03:29.269> apart<00:03:29.330> from<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.940> sort<00:03:32.150> of

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
sets sets you apart from the the sort of

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.520 
sets sets you apart from the the sort of
football<00:03:32.570> fan<00:03:32.840> let's<00:03:33.560> say<00:03:33.799> I<00:03:34.090> knew<00:03:35.090> you<00:03:35.120> know

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
football fan let's say I knew you know

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.400 
football fan let's say I knew you know
you<00:03:36.940> you<00:03:37.940> know<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.120> understand<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:39.079> you<00:03:39.200> want

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.130 
you you know you understand and you want
to<00:03:39.590> understand<00:03:40.190> technology<00:03:41.030> and<00:03:41.359> I<00:03:42.109> think

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
to understand technology and I think

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.319 
to understand technology and I think
that's<00:03:42.590> great<00:03:42.799> and<00:03:42.950> we<00:03:43.370> need<00:03:43.609> to<00:03:43.760> make<00:03:43.940> sure<00:03:43.970> we

what<00:04:02.569> the<00:04:02.690> issues<00:04:02.930> will<00:04:03.049> be<00:04:03.370> blown<00:04:04.370> diffusers

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
what the issues will be blown diffusers

what the issues will be blown diffusers
are<00:04:04.850> going<00:04:05.060> for<00:04:05.209> Silverstone<00:04:06.280> what<00:04:07.280> issues

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
are going for Silverstone what issues

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.490 
are going for Silverstone what issues
have<00:04:07.910> you<00:04:08.000> had<00:04:08.150> for<00:04:08.299> optimizing<00:04:08.959> what<00:04:09.350> you

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
have you had for optimizing what you

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.000 
have you had for optimizing what you
have<00:04:09.680> and<00:04:10.069> what<00:04:10.819> risks<00:04:11.150> are<00:04:11.209> going<00:04:11.299> to<00:04:11.389> be<00:04:11.480> for

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
have and what risks are going to be for

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.430 
have and what risks are going to be for
greater<00:04:13.010> tire<00:04:13.430> degradation<00:04:13.670> and<00:04:14.420> issues<00:04:15.260> like

greater tire degradation and issues like

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.080 
greater tire degradation and issues like
that<00:04:15.470> I<00:04:15.799> don't<00:04:16.070> think<00:04:16.280> it<00:04:16.370> will<00:04:16.489> particularly

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
that I don't think it will particularly

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.659 
that I don't think it will particularly
change<00:04:17.419> tire<00:04:17.660> degradation<00:04:17.810> I<00:04:18.440> don't<00:04:19.430> think

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
change tire degradation I don't think

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.570 
change tire degradation I don't think
it's<00:04:19.820> going<00:04:20.060> to<00:04:20.150> be<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:21.680> magnitude<00:04:22.190> of<00:04:22.340> change

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
it's going to be the magnitude of change

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.000 
it's going to be the magnitude of change
that<00:04:22.910> is<00:04:23.060> perhaps<00:04:23.300> being<00:04:23.720> forecast<00:04:24.470> in<00:04:24.770> some

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
that is perhaps being forecast in some

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.290 
that is perhaps being forecast in some
areas<00:04:25.639> and<00:04:27.490> as<00:04:28.490> long<00:04:28.669> as<00:04:28.700> we're<00:04:28.910> still<00:04:29.030> on<00:04:29.150> top

I don't mind can you give us some sort

these devices and it will vary from team
to<00:04:49.710> team<00:04:49.860> and<00:04:50.330> I<00:04:51.330> won't<00:04:51.780> give<00:04:51.990> you<00:04:52.020> our<00:04:52.260> number

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
but I'll give you a sense of it if you

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.050 
but I'll give you a sense of it if you
imagine<00:04:55.470> that<00:04:55.710> these<00:04:56.130> things<00:04:56.460> might<00:04:56.700> be<00:04:56.880> worth

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
imagine that these things might be worth

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.920 
imagine that these things might be worth
say<00:04:57.360> point<00:04:57.660> a<00:04:57.810> to<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:58.080> second<00:04:58.470> dish<00:04:59.930> compared

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
say point a to the second dish compared

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.770 
say point a to the second dish compared
with<00:05:01.020> having<00:05:01.320> no<00:05:01.350> blown<00:05:01.860> diffuser<00:05:02.430> and<00:05:02.780> you

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
with having no blown diffuser and you

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.080 
with having no blown diffuser and you
broadly<00:05:04.140> going<00:05:04.860> down<00:05:05.100> to<00:05:05.280> about<00:05:05.430> half<00:05:05.670> of<00:05:05.940> the

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
broadly going down to about half of the

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.070 
broadly going down to about half of the
previous<00:05:06.270> authority<00:05:06.960> of<00:05:07.110> it<00:05:07.290> so<00:05:07.760> by<00:05:09.080> it's

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
previous authority of it so by it's

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.780 
previous authority of it so by it's
still<00:05:10.470> got<00:05:10.680> plenty<00:05:10.830> of<00:05:11.070> blowing<00:05:11.400> going<00:05:11.640> on

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
still got plenty of blowing going on

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.010 
still got plenty of blowing going on
because<00:05:12.150> you've<00:05:12.300> still<00:05:12.480> got<00:05:12.660> an<00:05:12.750> engine

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
because you've still got an engine

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.960 
because you've still got an engine
running<00:05:13.350> and<00:05:13.470> that<00:05:13.830> exhaust<00:05:14.220> is<00:05:14.490> still<00:05:14.760> going

right into your floor but we're not able

to optimize the use of the engine to

to optimize the use of the engine to

we're on partial throttle that was the
