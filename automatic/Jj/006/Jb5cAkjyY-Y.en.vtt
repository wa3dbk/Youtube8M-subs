00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.320 
13 what was it 8 CR MOV no no that's not
it<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.409> 14<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.310> something<00:01:08.939> like<00:01:09.150> I

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
it it's 14 and something like I

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.580 
it it's 14 and something like I
mentioned<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:09.780> my<00:01:09.900> previous<00:01:10.080> videos<00:01:10.560> but

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
mentioned in my previous videos but

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.310 
mentioned in my previous videos but
again<00:01:11.119> it's<00:01:12.119> not<00:01:12.299> about<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:12.930> actually

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
again it's not about that it's actually

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.080 
again it's not about that it's actually
about<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> actual<00:01:13.979> scale<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> video<00:01:15.000> is

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
about the actual scale so the video is

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.840 
about the actual scale so the video is
about<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.479> scale<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:15.930> not<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.229> blade<00:01:16.850> I'm
