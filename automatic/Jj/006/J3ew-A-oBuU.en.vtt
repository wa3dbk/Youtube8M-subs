awesome gluten free recipe and it's like

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.600 
awesome gluten free recipe and it's like
a<00:00:33.000> shrimp<00:00:33.480> lemon<00:00:34.160> pasta<00:00:35.160> dish<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:37.489> we<00:00:38.489> were

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
a shrimp lemon pasta dish and we were

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.100 
a shrimp lemon pasta dish and we were
trying<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.879> get<00:00:39.000> her<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.180> gotta<00:00:39.420> go<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.600> sleep

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
trying to get her I gotta go to sleep

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.400 
trying to get her I gotta go to sleep
because<00:00:40.640> it's<00:00:41.640> obviously<00:00:42.570> much<00:00:42.809> easier<00:00:43.290> to

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
because it's obviously much easier to

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.850 
because it's obviously much easier to
film<00:00:43.649> when<00:00:43.920> he's<00:00:44.399> asleep<00:00:45.260> however<00:00:46.260> we're

film when he's asleep however we're

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.920 
film when he's asleep however we're
driving<00:00:47.160> around<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.460> circles<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:48.270> no<00:00:48.660> such

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
driving around in circles and no such

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.930 
driving around in circles and no such
luck<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.039> think<00:00:50.789> option<00:00:51.780> B<00:00:52.079> for<00:00:52.920> tonight<00:00:53.309> is

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
luck so I think option B for tonight is

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.099 
luck so I think option B for tonight is
