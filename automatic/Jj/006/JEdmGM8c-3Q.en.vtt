00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.440 
end of the heat about 8.54 like a really
nice<00:01:34.350> running<00:01:34.619> where<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.860> have<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> barrel<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.119> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
nice running where I have a barrel to a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.050 
nice running where I have a barrel to a
fairly<00:01:36.960> big<00:01:37.140> invert<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:38.579> put<00:01:38.729> me<00:01:38.850> into<00:01:38.970> a

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
fairly big invert and that put me into a

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.280 
fairly big invert and that put me into a
pretty<00:01:39.240> commander<00:01:39.689> will<00:01:39.810> lead<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:39.990> think<00:01:40.079> of

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
pretty commander will lead I think of

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.469 
pretty commander will lead I think of

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
final day the really big day of the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.590 
final day the really big day of the
competition<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.610> was<00:01:50.939> seated<00:01:51.240> through<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
competition I was seated through the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.870 
competition I was seated through the
quarterfinals<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.860> came<00:01:53.159> up<00:01:53.189> against

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
quarterfinals and I came up against

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.330 
quarterfinals and I came up against
Pierre<00:01:54.060> Luc<00:01:54.180> Costas<00:01:54.570> he<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.350> myself<00:01:55.500> run

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
Pierre Luc Costas he and myself run

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.609 
Pierre Luc Costas he and myself run
about<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.640> same<00:01:56.850> age<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.630> think<00:01:58.409> there's

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
about the same age so I think there's

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.030 
about the same age so I think there's
that<00:01:58.799> era<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.520> competitiveness<00:02:00.090> between<00:02:00.840> us

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
that era of competitiveness between us

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.859 
that era of competitiveness between us
he<00:02:02.040> made<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.280> better<00:02:02.460> call<00:02:02.700> Andrew<00:02:02.939> gods<00:02:03.149> with

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
he made the better call Andrew gods with

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.499 
he made the better call Andrew gods with
with<00:02:04.770> harvester<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.189> heat<00:02:05.579> he<00:02:05.939> started<00:02:06.360> off

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
with harvester that heat he started off

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.169 
with harvester that heat he started off
started<00:02:07.079> off<00:02:07.170> early<00:02:07.849> picking<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.940> smaller

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
started off early picking the smaller

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.910 
started off early picking the smaller
waves<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.660> really<00:02:09.869> getting<00:02:10.050> like<00:02:10.500> boat<00:02:10.709> like
