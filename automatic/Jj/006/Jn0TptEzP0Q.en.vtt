at Daiso and I am a bit worried that the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.609 
at Daiso and I am a bit worried that the
pedals<00:01:09.210> aren't<00:01:09.540> connected<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.350> and

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
pedals aren't connected like this and

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.140 
pedals aren't connected like this and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
one piece so make sure you check the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:28.190 
one piece so make sure you check the
flowers<00:01:12.619> closely<00:01:13.619> before<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.220> purchase

and this piece is the hardest because

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.330 
and this piece is the hardest because
there's<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.110> little<00:01:35.320> plastic<00:01:35.530> piece<00:01:35.799> here<00:01:36.189> but

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
you're going to take a pair of scissors

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.880 
you're going to take a pair of scissors
then<00:01:40.299> you're<00:01:40.450> going<00:01:40.630> to<00:01:40.780> make<00:01:40.960> crisscross

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
then you're going to make crisscross

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:49.470 
then you're going to make crisscross
cuts<00:01:42.579> in<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.450> plastic

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.610 

if<00:01:50.480> you're<00:01:50.660> having<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:50.960> hard<00:01:51.140> time<00:01:51.170> leaving<00:01:51.470> the

if you're having a hard time leaving the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.070 
if you're having a hard time leaving the
candle<00:01:52.400> part<00:01:52.610> through<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:53.090> can<00:01:53.390> cut<00:01:53.810> off<00:01:54.050> a

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
candle part through you can cut off a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:06.050 
candle part through you can cut off a
little<00:01:54.530> bit<00:01:54.770> more

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.700 

then<00:02:06.659> you're<00:02:06.869> going<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.110> repeat<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.650> step

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
then you're going to repeat this step

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.090 
then you're going to repeat this step
and<00:02:08.250> just<00:02:08.750> make<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.080> whole<00:02:10.110> here<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.860> little

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
and just make the whole here a little

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:28.880 
and just make the whole here a little
bit<00:02:11.340> lighter<00:02:12.890> just<00:02:13.890> few<00:02:14.190> cuts<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:17.840> slide

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.199 

we're<00:02:29.890> losing<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.310> petals<00:02:30.670> on<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.000> flower

we're losing the petals on the flower

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.089 
we're losing the petals on the flower
try<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:31.630> make<00:02:31.840> sure<00:02:32.020> they<00:02:32.290> are<00:02:32.470> not<00:02:32.620> on<00:02:32.830> top<00:02:33.069> of

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
try to make sure they are not on top of

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.940 
try to make sure they are not on top of
each<00:02:33.340> other<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:34.900> they<00:02:35.110> are<00:02:35.319> like<00:02:35.500> this<00:02:35.709> you

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
each other that they are like this you

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.880 
each other that they are like this you
can<00:02:36.190> see<00:02:36.459> them<00:02:36.670> from<00:02:37.060> both<00:02:37.270> sides<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:38.020> just

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
can see them from both sides and just

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.830 
can see them from both sides and just
keep<00:02:39.040> repeating<00:02:39.190> this<00:02:39.610> step<00:02:39.819> until<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.630> run

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
keep repeating this step until you run
