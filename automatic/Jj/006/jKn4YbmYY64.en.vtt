00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
drive that's not what it looks like

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.110 
drive that's not what it looks like
that's<00:00:41.730> just<00:00:42.120> something<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.510> dragged<00:00:42.780> over<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
that's just something I dragged over and

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.049 
that's just something I dragged over and
it<00:00:45.120> takes<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.539> little<00:00:46.039> because<00:00:47.039> that's<00:00:47.340> one<00:00:47.940> of

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
it takes a little because that's one of

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.150 
it takes a little because that's one of
the<00:00:48.120> map<00:00:48.270> packs<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:49.170> was<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:49.469> for<00:00:49.680> example

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the map packs it was just for example

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.799 
the map packs it was just for example
but<00:00:50.280> that's<00:00:50.520> how<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.030> should<00:00:51.059> look<00:00:51.300> like<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
but that's how it should look like the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.029 
but that's how it should look like the
black<00:00:51.989> ops<00:00:52.199> files<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:54.440> just<00:00:55.440> kind<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.620> cancel
