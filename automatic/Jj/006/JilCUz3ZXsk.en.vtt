00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
like cardigan I like it because it's

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.620 
like cardigan I like it because it's
like<00:00:20.800> subtle<00:00:21.190> stripes<00:00:21.400> like<00:00:22.119> a<00:00:22.240> white<00:00:22.480> and

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
like subtle stripes like a white and

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.349 
like subtle stripes like a white and
then<00:00:22.720> like<00:00:22.900> a<00:00:22.930> translucent<00:00:23.680> white<00:00:23.890> I<00:00:23.949> guess

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359

and<00:00:25.359> that<00:00:25.390> is<00:00:25.690> by<00:00:25.810> the<00:00:25.869> brie<00:00:26.080> of<00:00:26.170> energy<00:00:26.619> so<00:00:26.830> you

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
and that is by the brie of energy so you

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.410 
and that is by the brie of energy so you
can<00:00:27.010> find<00:00:27.220> it<00:00:27.340> at<00:00:27.460> a<00:00:27.520> lot<00:00:27.850> of<00:00:27.970> different<00:00:28.240> places

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
buttons except the top one and then that

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.049 
buttons except the top one and then that
way<00:00:50.920> it<00:00:50.980> kind<00:00:51.129> of<00:00:51.250> looks<00:00:51.430> see<00:00:51.640> through<00:00:51.879> so<00:00:52.030> you

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
way it kind of looks see through so you

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:53.970 
way it kind of looks see through so you
can<00:00:52.210> still<00:00:52.420> see<00:00:52.600> the<00:00:52.780> sequins<00:00:53.260> kind<00:00:53.620> of<00:00:53.710> threw

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
can still see the sequins kind of threw

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.799 
can still see the sequins kind of threw
it<00:00:54.160> but<00:00:54.730> then<00:00:54.850> you<00:00:54.969> actually<00:00:55.120> really<00:00:55.480> see<00:00:55.690> it

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
it but then you actually really see it

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.810 
it but then you actually really see it
like<00:00:55.960> on<00:00:56.110> top<00:00:56.440> and<00:00:56.710> I<00:00:56.800> just<00:00:57.039> think<00:00:57.280> that<00:00:57.399> gives

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
like on top and I just think that gives

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.369 
like on top and I just think that gives
it<00:00:58.000> a<00:00:58.090> better<00:00:58.239> contrast<00:00:58.809> and<00:00:59.050> then<00:00:59.140> you<00:00:59.230> can

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
it a better contrast and then you can

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.229 
it a better contrast and then you can
see<00:00:59.559> some<00:00:59.829> of<00:00:59.860> it<00:01:00.039> on<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.640> bottom<00:01:00.969> I<00:01:01.090> just

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
see some of it on the bottom I just

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.750 
see some of it on the bottom I just
think<00:01:01.390> this<00:01:01.539> is<00:01:01.719> a<00:01:01.750> really<00:01:01.960> cute<00:01:02.289> idea<00:01:02.469> up<00:01:03.039> here

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
think this is a really cute idea up here

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.340 
think this is a really cute idea up here
and<00:01:03.940> then<00:01:04.149> for<00:01:04.629> jeans<00:01:04.839> are<00:01:05.019> just<00:01:05.049> wearing<00:01:05.259> a
