00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
to work a little bit better if you have

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.600 
to work a little bit better if you have
a<00:05:14.370> bando<00:05:14.850> to<00:05:15.090> place<00:05:15.330> it<00:05:15.570> over<00:05:15.750> so<00:05:16.710> now<00:05:17.310> that<00:05:17.370> we

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
a bando to place it over so now that we

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.310 
a bando to place it over so now that we
have<00:05:17.640> that<00:05:18.060> we<00:05:18.330> are<00:05:18.360> going<00:05:18.480> to<00:05:18.690> make<00:05:18.900> it<00:05:19.020> look<00:05:19.169> a

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
have that we are going to make it look a

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.770 
have that we are going to make it look a
little<00:05:19.410> bit<00:05:19.620> more<00:05:19.800> area<00:05:20.310> less<00:05:20.580> if<00:05:21.030> that's<00:05:21.540> a

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
little bit more area less if that's a

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.180 
word I don't think it is but I'm just
just<00:05:24.000> go<00:05:24.150> with<00:05:24.270> it<00:05:24.450> so<00:05:25.050> take<00:05:25.260> a<00:05:25.290> leftover<00:05:25.770> strip

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
just go with it so take a leftover strip

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.520 
just go with it so take a leftover strip
of<00:05:26.370> fabric<00:05:26.580> and<00:05:26.970> go<00:05:27.450> ahead<00:05:27.690> and<00:05:27.930> cinch<00:05:28.320> it<00:05:28.470> in

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
of fabric and go ahead and cinch it in

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.020 
of fabric and go ahead and cinch it in
and<00:05:28.800> you<00:05:28.860> just<00:05:28.890> tie<00:05:29.220> it<00:05:29.280> in<00:05:29.460> a<00:05:29.520> couple<00:05:29.850> knots

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
and you just tie it in a couple knots

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.810 
and you just tie it in a couple knots
and<00:05:30.330> that<00:05:30.900> makes<00:05:31.169> a<00:05:31.290> perfect<00:05:31.650> Ariel<00:05:32.370> top<00:05:32.580> it

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
and that makes a perfect Ariel top it

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.550 
and that makes a perfect Ariel top it
kind<00:05:33.030> of<00:05:33.090> just<00:05:33.360> makes<00:05:33.870> it<00:05:34.050> look<00:05:34.169> a<00:05:34.290> little<00:05:34.380> bit

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
kind of just makes it look a little bit

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.740 
kind of just makes it look a little bit
more<00:05:34.830> like<00:05:35.100> a<00:05:35.130> bathing<00:05:35.370> suit<00:05:35.700> top<00:05:35.910> I<00:05:36.090> think<00:05:36.120> so

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
more like a bathing suit top I think so

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.810 
more like a bathing suit top I think so
that<00:05:36.930> is<00:05:37.080> the<00:05:37.260> completed<00:05:37.650> DIY<00:05:38.130> costume<00:05:38.610> that's

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
that is the completed DIY costume that's

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.490 
that is the completed DIY costume that's
so<00:05:39.060> inexpensive

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
so inexpensive

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.560

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
don't want to show that much skin or

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.130
