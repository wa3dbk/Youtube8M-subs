00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
season which I think last week's

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.550 
season which I think last week's
performance<00:00:19.650> deserved<00:00:20.960> and<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.109> wasn't<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.439> be

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560

performance deserved and it wasn't to be
I<00:00:23.070> don't<00:00:23.609> think<00:00:23.789> we<00:00:24.090> can<00:00:24.240> have<00:00:24.420> any<00:00:24.570> complaints

stage<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.000> season<00:00:30.390> then<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:31.380> know<00:00:31.500> you're

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
stage of a season then you know you're

people's hands and obviously need to

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.819 
people's hands and obviously need to
have<00:00:36.329> done<00:00:36.540> better<00:00:36.690> than<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.649> course

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
have done better than that so of course

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.530 
have done better than that so of course
we<00:00:38.040> were<00:00:38.489> hoping<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.910> West<00:00:39.090> Brom<00:00:39.300> would<00:00:39.420> do

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
we were hoping that West Brom would do

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.560 
we were hoping that West Brom would do
is<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.660> flavor<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.829> wasn't<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.250> be<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
is a flavor it wasn't to be so the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.840 
is a flavor it wasn't to be so the
overriding<00:00:42.960> feeling<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.469> course<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.980> massive

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
overriding feeling of course is massive

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.729 
overriding feeling of course is massive
disappointment<00:00:45.120> if<00:00:45.989> it's<00:00:46.140> any<00:00:46.320> insulin<00:00:46.559> to

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
disappointment if it's any insulin to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
the worst feeling for me would be to be

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.480 
the worst feeling for me would be to be
sitting<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.590> bench<00:01:37.770> or<00:01:37.950> standing<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.430> the

feeling<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.750> should<00:01:42.810> have<00:01:43.079> done<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.200> little<00:01:43.320> bit

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
feeling I should have done a little bit

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.810 
feeling I should have done a little bit
more<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:43.979> should<00:01:44.189> have<00:01:44.280> done<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> bit<00:01:44.610> more

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
more we should have done a bit more

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.749 
more we should have done a bit more
that's<00:01:45.600> not<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.899> case<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:47.310> know<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.520> can

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
that's not the case you know you can

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.300 
that's not the case you know you can
feel<00:01:47.909> confident<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.600> yourself<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.310> contend

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
feel confident in yourself and contend

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.649 
feel confident in yourself and contend
that<00:01:50.430> you've<00:01:50.610> done<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.880> right<00:01:50.909> job<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.570> then

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
that you've done the right job and then

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.030 
that you've done the right job and then
obviously<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.110> players<00:01:52.350> need<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.740> deliver

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
obviously the players need to deliver

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.800 
obviously the players need to deliver
and<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.430> think<00:01:54.090> they've<00:01:54.180> been<00:01:54.210> excellent<00:01:54.630> for

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
and I think they've been excellent for

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.139 
and I think they've been excellent for
us<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.560> vast<00:01:55.799> majority<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.700> time<00:01:56.909> in

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
us and the vast majority of the time in

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.569 
us and the vast majority of the time in
these<00:01:57.479> games<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.140> then<00:01:58.740> looking<00:01:59.219> back<00:01:59.280> what

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
these games so then looking back what

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.370 
these games so then looking back what
we've<00:01:59.759> done<00:01:59.880> anything<00:02:00.119> different<00:02:00.719> probably

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
we've done anything different probably

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.490 
we've done anything different probably
not<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:02.070> course<00:02:02.340> you're<00:02:02.490> always<00:02:02.549> analyzing

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
not of course you're always analyzing

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.499 
not of course you're always analyzing
tactics<00:02:04.500> formations<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.369> it's<00:02:05.820> easy<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.299> say

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
tactics formations and it's easy to say

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.570 
tactics formations and it's easy to say
if<00:02:06.869> you'd<00:02:07.350> have<00:02:07.469> done<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.829> then<00:02:08.009> maybe<00:02:08.310> they

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
if you'd have done that then maybe they

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.400 
if you'd have done that then maybe they
wouldn't<00:02:08.849> have<00:02:08.970> scored<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.360> goal<00:02:09.509> but<00:02:09.780> that

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
wouldn't have scored a goal but that

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.220 
wouldn't have scored a goal but that
everything<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:10.860> done<00:02:11.009> for<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.220> reason<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.700> it's

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
everything is done for a reason and it's

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.229 
everything is done for a reason and it's
it's<00:02:12.440> meticulously<00:02:13.069> thought<00:02:13.159> through<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:13.760> as

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
it's meticulously thought through and as

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.610 
it's meticulously thought through and as
I<00:02:14.330> said<00:02:14.390> that's<00:02:14.599> one<00:02:14.810> of<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:14.959> things<00:02:15.019> that<00:02:15.230> I

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
I said that's one of the things that I

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.589 
I said that's one of the things that I
pride<00:02:16.040> myself<00:02:16.069> on<00:02:16.519> in<00:02:16.970> these<00:02:17.120> last<00:02:17.330> few<00:02:17.510> weeks

exceptional results of creditors could

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.729 
exceptional results of creditors could

in<00:02:33.349> chelsea<00:02:33.950> probably<00:02:34.610> at<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.819> time<00:02:35.090> when<00:02:35.330> they

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
in chelsea probably at a time when they

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.660 
in chelsea probably at a time when they
weren't<00:02:35.950> contesting<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.069> league<00:02:37.250> or<00:02:37.459> thought

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
weren't contesting the league or thought

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.369 
weren't contesting the league or thought
they<00:02:37.819> could<00:02:37.970> win<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.239> league<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.629> and<00:02:38.810> the

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
they could win the league and and the

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:40.960 
they could win the league and and the
same<00:02:39.560> old<00:02:39.829> trafford<00:02:40.069> you<00:02:40.370> know<00:02:40.519> we<00:02:40.700> had<00:02:40.819> the

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
same old trafford you know we had the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.789 
same old trafford you know we had the
sort<00:02:41.180> of<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.329> carnival<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:42.110> they<00:02:42.470> had<00:02:42.620> the

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
sort of the carnival and they had the

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.880 
sort of the carnival and they had the
after<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.190> carnival<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:44.739> they've<00:02:45.739> had<00:02:45.860> a

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
after the carnival so they've had a

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.710 
after the carnival so they've had a
little<00:02:46.129> bit<00:02:46.220> of<00:02:46.250> luck<00:02:46.459> that<00:02:46.489> way<00:02:46.879> i<00:02:47.090> think<00:02:47.599> even

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
little bit of luck that way i think even

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.740 
little bit of luck that way i think even
they<00:02:47.989> would<00:02:48.170> admit<00:02:48.470> that<00:02:48.650> but<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:50.390> know<00:02:50.420> put

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
they would admit that but you know put

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.119 
they would admit that but you know put
ourselves<00:02:50.840> in<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:51.230> situation<00:02:51.319> if<00:02:51.859> we'd<00:02:52.010> had

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
ourselves in that situation if we'd had

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:53.319 
ourselves in that situation if we'd had
done<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.370> we'd<00:02:52.549> have<00:02:52.579> been<00:02:52.730> saying<00:02:52.970> hang<00:02:53.180> on

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
enjoyed we've got one more game to go

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.040 
enjoyed we've got one more game to go
against<00:04:28.639> arsenal<00:04:29.030> I<00:04:29.120> mean<00:04:29.360> both<00:04:29.510> sides<00:04:29.780> really

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050

having<00:04:30.229> haven't<00:04:30.440> got<00:04:30.530> that<00:04:30.560> much<00:04:30.710> to<00:04:30.830> play<00:04:30.979> for

having haven't got that much to play for
but<00:04:31.310> I<00:04:31.370> guess<00:04:31.520> there's<00:04:31.669> an<00:04:31.760> incentive<00:04:32.180> to<00:04:32.210> end

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
but I guess there's an incentive to end

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.439 
but I guess there's an incentive to end
the<00:04:32.720> season<00:04:32.870> on<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.080> heisman<00:04:34.150> 27,000<00:04:35.150> reasons
