00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.630
 in the last 25 years at least 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.280
 a controversy 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.369
 I have as my opinion 

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:10.509
 of soccer lovers 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.569
 who was better 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:14.829
 maradona or pelé 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:16.800
 he is the maradona 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.599
 this question was of course raised by the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.390
 controversy 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.369
 Brazilians and Argentines 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.450
 we Argentines are survivors tell me that locals do not go any more power 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.680
 moreover a characteristic and there people her agent should not talk 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.570
 because when you open your mouth it is usually to talk nonsense 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.900
 there is no parameter 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.480
 from ascom / pr 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.750
 and maradona unquestionably pelé game 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.339
 much more than maradona allied maradona 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.420
 a good player without doubt a player with potential 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.880
 extraordinary capacity 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.080
 formidable 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.030
 is mainly the industrialization of agility 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.290
 intelligence 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.630
 but the pelé played much more undisputed 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.270
 the marathon runner 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.380
 Phew a class draw a comparative line 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.070
 Who was better than who? 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.070
 really or found the same level 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.580
 maradona 5 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.950
 and two Brazilian players were coming. 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.240
 the interim with 15 more than maradona to complain 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.759
 it is clear that either the flamenguistas will contest the ones in the club 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.190
 they do not admit any doubt he is a more complete player 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.500
 than 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.250
 although the site book is an extraordinary player's ability to 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.410
 domino finish even more than the inter leader but in the set in the 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.439
 building the organization 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.290
 ipv was a move now if you want 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.940
 on the other, the Brazilian football 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.760
 it's a comparison 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.760
 of a player who was some better judge 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.070
 even with the evil ronaldo phenomenon 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.750
 ronaldo phenomenon was the most complete player 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.749
 but and you could tell me the time but the higher value 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:05.170
 made more goals than the maradona the seville party of rossini 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.530
 I wish I could say that the councilman was better than the Socrates 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.129
 of course not 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.829
 with players over time 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.020
 was one of the greatest in the world of all time but ronaldo 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.939
 beyond 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:18.839
 of the lush football that 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:22.880
 on the one hand played a very different period than it was in the time of the pelé 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.150
 a little football 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.250
 it plays in a more genius way the marking power 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.429
 not so strong 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:31.730
 the schemes 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.999
 adopted by the coaches was not so latent so evident 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:40.929
 with the foot currently even so in front of the power of extraordinary marking 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:45.510
 of a capacity is to give physical strength really if you work in a more 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:46.290
 intense 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.220
 ronaldo was able to stand out 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.400
 and especially the good of European football football passes the football has 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.639
 a different style marking soccer 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:55.910
 the tax back 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.330
 really is the one in a different way than football is South American football more 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.010
 competition is a given that was really seen first is to fight 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.249
 and intensely on the psv of Holland 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:11.690
 escaping the greatest idols in the history of barcelona 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.170
 in Italian football 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.610
 plus the ability to excel if you take the franchise 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:17.669
 abiliity 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:22.029
 the undeniably public ig ronaldo was the most complete player because I wanted 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:26.839
 what advantage in the team he had in relation to the bad weather was a 

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:32.010
 player applied mainly in the aspect of professionalism with the award 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:36.809
 with intelligence with football good decision-making ability that has 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:40.130
 with the preparation one with that physical preparation mainly because she 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.200
 precaution on the question of physical 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.150
 some that the phenomenon would be a player of a contusion still of greater prominence 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.360
 of what has been worse yet is that despite the age but continues being a differential 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.559
 over all well 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:58.159
 Maradona said 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.999
 the br-290 bigger time at night to fly 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:04.350
 the worker sees reduced in February 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.420
 but the leader and marquize best player I saw that 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.269
 and maradona 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.600
 worse a basis in the rumor that all the more to gild 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.099
 more than to be sadder 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.870
 in my opinion the brazilian soccer players hulk 50 years 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:18.729
 nobody 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.350
 reached the plateau 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.269
 the ronaldo 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.230
 phenomenon in brazilian football and soccer
