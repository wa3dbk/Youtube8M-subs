00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
detail in them which I thought was

really nice and these were only six
pounds<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.330> probably<00:00:45.750> should<00:00:45.990> have<00:00:46.020> caught

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
pounds I probably should have caught

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.860

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
absolutely huge by the way they only had

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.730 
absolutely huge by the way they only had
medium<00:02:32.570> left<00:02:32.810> but<00:02:33.020> I<00:02:33.050> wasn't<00:02:33.290> just<00:02:33.530> going<00:02:33.680> to

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
medium left but I wasn't just going to

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.080 
medium left but I wasn't just going to
