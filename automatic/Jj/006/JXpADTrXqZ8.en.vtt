00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
with the cloning solutions and the first

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.490 
with the cloning solutions and the first
two<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.379> popped<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.980> cloning<00:00:17.400> solutions

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
two that popped in the cloning solutions

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.340 
two that popped in the cloning solutions
were<00:00:19.500> green<00:00:20.310> zone<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:23.630> let<00:00:24.630> me<00:00:24.750> see<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.230> was

and<00:01:08.780> starting<00:01:09.830> solutions<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.220> dry<00:01:11.400> mixes<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
and starting solutions and dry mixes and

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.770 
and starting solutions and dry mixes and
this<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.450> what<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.630> came<00:01:12.720> up<00:01:13.080> with<00:01:13.460> okay<00:01:14.659> so<00:01:15.659> in

even dilute this and try a solution for

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.420 
even dilute this and try a solution for
routing<00:02:17.870> okay<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:18.930> that's<00:02:19.350> one<00:02:19.590> two<00:02:19.770> three<00:02:20.100> dry

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
routing okay so that's one two three dry

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.240 
routing okay so that's one two three dry
mixes<00:02:20.850> this<00:02:21.000> is<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.240> fourth<00:02:21.480> dry<00:02:21.750> mix<00:02:22.050> on<00:02:22.380> this

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
mixes this is the fourth dry mix on this

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.750 
mixes this is the fourth dry mix on this
is<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.520> dr.<00:02:23.880> earth<00:02:24.030> squirrel<00:02:24.860> organic<00:02:25.860> -<00:02:26.069> the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
is the dr. earth squirrel organic - the

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.300 
is the dr. earth squirrel organic - the
numbers<00:02:27.090> are<00:02:27.240> 2<00:02:27.630> for<00:02:27.930> 2<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.410> NPK<00:02:28.920> s<00:02:28.980> and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
numbers are 2 for 2 and the NPK s and

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.030 
numbers are 2 for 2 and the NPK s and
this<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.640> starter<00:02:30.150> fertilizer<00:02:30.630> as<00:02:30.930> well<00:02:31.140> so

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
this is a starter fertilizer as well so

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.430 
this is a starter fertilizer as well so
that's<00:02:32.850> what<00:02:33.030> I'm<00:02:33.120> using<00:02:33.330> in<00:02:33.540> my<00:02:33.660> dry<00:02:33.930> mix<00:02:34.230> now

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
that's what I'm using in my dry mix now

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.490 
that's what I'm using in my dry mix now
this<00:02:35.220> one<00:02:35.490> in<00:02:35.790> particular<00:02:36.030> has<00:02:36.720> only<00:02:37.020> dr.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
this one in particular has only dr.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.440 
this one in particular has only dr.
earth<00:02:37.940> perlite<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.470> Earth<00:02:40.470> grow<00:02:40.770> soil<00:02:41.450> and

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
earth perlite and Earth grow soil and

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.080 
earth perlite and Earth grow soil and
that's<00:02:42.690> what<00:02:43.020> I<00:02:43.050> have<00:02:43.320> in<00:02:43.350> this<00:02:43.590> one<00:02:43.800> -<00:02:44.090> so

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
that's what I have in this one - so

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.690 
that's what I have in this one - so
that's<00:02:45.300> my<00:02:45.480> dry<00:02:45.750> mixes<00:02:46.200> for<00:02:46.709> these<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.370> if<00:02:47.580> you

that's my dry mixes for these and if you

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.229 
that's my dry mixes for these and if you
guys<00:02:47.820> can<00:02:48.090> see<00:02:49.489> it's<00:02:50.489> nice<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:50.730> healthy<00:02:51.060> and

these<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.950> all<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.160> branches<00:02:59.340> came<00:02:59.760> in<00:02:59.940> by

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
these and all the branches came in by

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.990 
these and all the branches came in by
itself<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.959> think<00:03:01.769> I<00:03:01.920> did<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.130> few<00:03:02.430> videos<00:03:02.820> on

sucker grow and it looks like it's
taking<00:03:20.820> on<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.090> same<00:03:21.299> characteristics<00:03:22.230> as

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
taking on the same characteristics as

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.890 
taking on the same characteristics as
this<00:03:22.620> one<00:03:22.799> here<00:03:23.040> again<00:03:23.299> I<00:03:24.299> haven't<00:03:24.570> taught

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
this one here again I haven't taught

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.620 
this one here again I haven't taught
this<00:03:25.170> but<00:03:25.620> you<00:03:26.400> know<00:03:26.549> it's<00:03:27.239> starting<00:03:27.420> to

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
this but you know it's starting to

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.289 
this but you know it's starting to
really<00:03:27.900> branch<00:03:28.110> out<00:03:28.350> on<00:03:28.590> its<00:03:28.799> own

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
really branch out on its own

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.569 
really branch out on its own
the<00:03:30.690> lighting<00:03:31.049> upstairs<00:03:31.530> I<00:03:31.799> have<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.040> wide

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
the lighting upstairs I have a wide

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.630 
the lighting upstairs I have a wide
spectrum<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.480> blue<00:03:33.720> light<00:03:34.130> and<00:03:35.130> I<00:03:35.310> think

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
spectrum and a blue light and I think

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.810 
spectrum and a blue light and I think
that<00:03:35.820> might<00:03:36.030> be<00:03:36.060> helping<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.690> as<00:03:36.900> well<00:03:37.790> okay<00:03:38.790> so

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
that might be helping it as well okay so

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.180 
that might be helping it as well okay so

weekly<00:04:19.320> update<00:04:19.799> on<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:20.820> we'll<00:04:21.060> see<00:04:21.239> how

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
weekly update on it and we'll see how

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.340 
weekly update on it and we'll see how
the<00:04:21.450> dry<00:04:21.750> mix<00:04:21.989> is

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
the dry mix is

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.270 
the dry mix is
work<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:23.630> each<00:04:24.630> pot<00:04:25.080> that<00:04:25.890> I'm<00:04:26.040> going<00:04:26.220> to

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
work and each pot that I'm going to

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.750 
work and each pot that I'm going to
transplant<00:04:26.790> I'll<00:04:27.120> be<00:04:27.960> using<00:04:28.170> a<00:04:28.440> different

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
transplant I'll be using a different

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.390 
transplant I'll be using a different
starter<00:04:29.760> mix<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:30.330> I'll<00:04:31.050> be<00:04:31.200> labeling<00:04:31.770> so<00:04:32.070> this

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
starter mix and I'll be labeling so this

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.400 
starter mix and I'll be labeling so this
one<00:04:32.610> here<00:04:32.910> is<00:04:33.090> going<00:04:33.180> to<00:04:33.240> be<00:04:33.360> dr.<00:04:33.780> at<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.140> next

one here is going to be dr. at the next

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.640 
one here is going to be dr. at the next
pot<00:04:34.620> out<00:04:34.830> is<00:04:35.190> going<00:04:35.730> to<00:04:35.790> be<00:04:35.850> biotin<00:04:36.480> next<00:04:37.470> pot

but as far as the liquid feed all of

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.360 
but as far as the liquid feed all of
them<00:04:44.250> will<00:04:44.400> get<00:04:44.580> nothing<00:04:45.300> but<00:04:45.390> liquid<00:04:45.630> NOx<00:04:46.370> but

the dry mixes is what's going to be the

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.130 
the dry mixes is what's going to be the
difference<00:04:49.650> in<00:04:49.830> each<00:04:50.190> one<00:04:50.460> of<00:04:50.580> these<00:04:50.700> pots<00:04:51.140> so
