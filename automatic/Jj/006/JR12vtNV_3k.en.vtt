to<00:05:07.680> recovery<00:05:08.129> and<00:05:08.490> a<00:05:09.300> bit<00:05:09.870> of<00:05:09.900> alt<00:05:10.139> matière

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
to recovery and a bit of alt matière

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.730 
to recovery and a bit of alt matière
bibs<00:05:11.009> clubs<00:05:11.759> even<00:05:12.210> and<00:05:12.419> our<00:05:13.020> pros<00:05:13.349> aren't<00:05:13.590> very

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
bibs clubs even and our pros aren't very

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.200 
bibs clubs even and our pros aren't very
good<00:05:13.800> at<00:05:13.949> the<00:05:14.069> moment<00:05:14.190> what<00:05:14.669> my<00:05:14.849> it's<00:05:15.000> not<00:05:15.180> i

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
good at the moment what my it's not i

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.879 
good at the moment what my it's not i
think<00:05:15.569> the<00:05:15.659> other<00:05:15.690> two<00:05:15.990> probably<00:05:16.469> got<00:05:16.680> a<00:05:16.710> bit

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
think the other two probably got a bit

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.779 
think the other two probably got a bit
on<00:05:17.009> a<00:05:17.039> bit<00:05:17.310> but<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:18.440> yeah<00:05:19.440> so<00:05:19.800> that's<00:05:20.190> the<00:05:20.400> idea

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
on a bit but and yeah so that's the idea

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:23.240 
on a bit but and yeah so that's the idea
obviously<00:05:21.690> a<00:05:22.050> couple<00:05:22.620> of<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.740> other<00:05:22.860> series

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
obviously a couple of the other series

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.439 
obviously a couple of the other series
they're<00:05:23.430> going<00:05:23.580> to<00:05:23.639> keep<00:05:23.759> going<00:05:23.969> couple<00:05:24.300> of

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
they're going to keep going couple of

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:25.909 
they're going to keep going couple of
the<00:05:24.569> other<00:05:24.690> series<00:05:25.050> might<00:05:25.259> stop<00:05:25.620> for<00:05:25.830> a<00:05:25.860> while

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
the other series might stop for a while

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.769 
the other series might stop for a while
like<00:05:26.250> pack<00:05:26.610> openings<00:05:27.060> as<00:05:27.180> well<00:05:27.360> i<00:05:27.389> can't
