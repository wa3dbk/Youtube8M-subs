00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.170 
so now which one you think sounded
better<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.840> one<00:00:31.080> did<00:00:31.669> why<00:00:32.669> did<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:32.940> sound

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
better this one did why did it sound

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.500 
better this one did why did it sound
better<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:34.260> team<00:00:34.469> fuller<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.309> sound<00:00:36.059> quality

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
better the team fuller the sound quality

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.790 
better the team fuller the sound quality
was<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.690> little<00:00:36.960> better<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.290> seemed<00:00:37.530> like<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
was a little better it seemed like the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.830 
was a little better it seemed like the
bass<00:00:37.980> was<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> little<00:00:38.610> richer<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.660> had<00:00:39.809> a

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
bass was a little richer just had a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.260 
bass was a little richer just had a
better<00:00:40.050> overall<00:00:40.469> sound<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.520> one<00:00:41.700> sounded

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
better overall sound this one sounded

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.060 
better overall sound this one sounded
better<00:00:42.420> because<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.290> think<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.040> a

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
better because I think that it is a

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.690 
better because I think that it is a
little<00:00:44.280> more<00:00:44.340> clear<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:46.250> less<00:00:47.250> interference

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
little more clear and less interference

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.569 
little more clear and less interference
from<00:00:48.149> outside<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:49.710> why<00:00:50.100> do<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.309> think<00:00:50.460> it

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
from outside and why do you think it

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.299 
from outside and why do you think it
sounded<00:00:50.879> better<00:00:51.379> I'll<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.710> have<00:00:52.860> my<00:00:52.890> sound

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
sounded better I'll just have my sound

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.229 
sounded better I'll just have my sound
to<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:54.469> didn't<00:00:55.469> seem<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:56.059> think<00:00:57.059> they<00:00:57.120> both

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
to it didn't seem I think they both

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.029 
to it didn't seem I think they both
sounded<00:00:57.539> nice<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.930> one<00:00:58.170> just<00:00:58.199> seemed<00:00:58.980> a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
sounded nice but this one just seemed a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.880 
sounded nice but this one just seemed a
little<00:00:59.129> bit<00:00:59.280> more<00:00:59.340> clear<00:00:59.760> some<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.629> those<00:01:00.890> this

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
little bit more clear some of those this

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.939 
little bit more clear some of those this
one<00:01:02.100> sounds<00:01:02.430> better<00:01:03.229> because<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.530> think<00:01:04.680> you

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
one sounds better because I think you

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.700 
one sounds better because I think you
got<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.250> little<00:01:05.369> more<00:01:05.610> like<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.090> bass<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.720> just

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
got a little more like the bass and just

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.649 
got a little more like the bass and just
