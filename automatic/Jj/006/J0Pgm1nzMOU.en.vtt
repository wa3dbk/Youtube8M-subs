best software but it's good for how-to

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.109 
best software but it's good for how-to
videos<00:02:07.069> it's<00:02:08.069> got<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.280> little<00:02:08.459> bit<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.729> blurry

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
videos it's got a little bit of blurry

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.969 
videos it's got a little bit of blurry
like<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:09.929> bandicam<00:02:10.289> over<00:02:10.560> here<00:02:10.679> probably<00:02:10.830> a

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
like this bandicam over here probably a

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.130 
like this bandicam over here probably a
little<00:02:11.250> blurred<00:02:11.430> worried<00:02:11.970> for<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.450> guys

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
little blurred worried for you guys

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.110 
little blurred worried for you guys
but<00:02:13.560> that's<00:02:13.890> not<00:02:14.069> too<00:02:14.340> much<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.850> problem

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
but that's not too much of a problem

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.460 
but that's not too much of a problem
because<00:02:15.510> if<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.930> tell<00:02:16.140> them<00:02:16.260> what<00:02:16.350> you're

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
because if you tell them what you're

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.900 
because if you tell them what you're
typing<00:02:16.800> it's<00:02:16.950> pretty<00:02:17.190> simple<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:19.670> then<00:02:20.670> that's

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
typing it's pretty simple so then that's

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.940 
typing it's pretty simple so then that's
