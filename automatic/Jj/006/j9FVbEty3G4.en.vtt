00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
trim levels the base RT and the srt8 we

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.580 
trim levels the base RT and the srt8 we
have<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.789> RT<00:00:21.270> now<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.080> vehicle<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.500> a

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
going to do a detailed driving review

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.529 
going to do a detailed driving review
because<00:00:25.949> we've<00:00:26.220> already<00:00:26.430> done<00:00:26.730> one<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.180> you

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
because we've already done one and you

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.089 
because we've already done one and you
can<00:00:27.660> find<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.050> every<00:00:28.260> man<00:00:28.380> driver<00:00:28.650> comm

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.149 

I<00:01:16.990> mentioned<00:01:17.990> earlier<00:01:18.290> there<00:01:18.439> are<00:01:18.470> three<00:01:18.890> trim

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
I mentioned earlier there are three trim

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.819 
I mentioned earlier there are three trim
levels<00:01:19.189> for<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.119> Challenger<00:01:20.630> in<00:01:20.720> 2014<00:01:21.649> the

can go for the optional 6-speed manual
that<00:02:00.560> one<00:02:00.799> kicks<00:02:01.100> out<00:02:01.929> 470<00:02:02.929> horsepower<00:02:03.110> and

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
that one kicks out 470 horsepower and

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:07.539 
that one kicks out 470 horsepower and

475 feet of torque that will melt your
face<00:02:07.789> off<00:02:09.009> our<00:02:10.009> vehicle<00:02:10.369> comes<00:02:10.580> standard<00:02:10.880> with

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
face off our vehicle comes standard with

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.210 
face off our vehicle comes standard with
18<00:02:11.660> inch<00:02:11.840> aluminum<00:02:12.080> wheels<00:02:12.319> but<00:02:12.739> we<00:02:12.890> have<00:02:13.069> the

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
18 inch aluminum wheels but we have the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.910 
18 inch aluminum wheels but we have the
optional<00:02:13.760> 20-inch<00:02:14.239> for<00:02:14.660> an<00:02:14.720> extra<00:02:14.959> grand<00:02:15.140> so

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
optional 20-inch for an extra grand so

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
optional 20-inch for an extra grand so
we'll<00:02:16.190> see<00:02:16.370> if<00:02:16.459> that<00:02:16.610> makes<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:16.910> difference

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
we'll see if that makes a difference

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.559 
we'll see if that makes a difference
today<00:02:17.569> as<00:02:17.780> we<00:02:18.170> do<00:02:18.290> our<00:02:18.319> 5<00:02:18.680> runs<00:02:19.040> from<00:02:19.310> 0<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.760> 60

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.330 

again<00:02:23.569> we<00:02:23.690> have<00:02:23.900> sequential<00:02:24.650> shift<00:02:24.950> control

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
again we have sequential shift control

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.250 
again we have sequential shift control
and<00:02:25.580> we<00:02:25.730> also<00:02:25.850> have<00:02:26.120> paddle<00:02:26.480> shifters<00:02:26.840> here<00:02:27.110> on

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
and we also have paddle shifters here on

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.600 
and we also have paddle shifters here on
the<00:02:27.380> steering<00:02:27.650> wheel<00:02:27.740> but<00:02:28.310> we're<00:02:28.400> just<00:02:28.430> gonna

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
the steering wheel but we're just gonna

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.790 
the steering wheel but we're just gonna
keep<00:02:28.850> it<00:02:28.970> in<00:02:29.060> drive<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:30.580> reset<00:02:31.580> this<00:02:32.800> we

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
keep it in drive and reset this we

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.030 
keep it in drive and reset this we
happen<00:02:34.100> to<00:02:34.160> also<00:02:34.280> have<00:02:34.520> a<00:02:34.550> 0-60<00:02:35.060> performance

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
happen to also have a 0-60 performance

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.590 
happen to also have a 0-60 performance
display<00:02:37.040> in<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.610> dash<00:02:37.819> in<00:02:38.090> front<00:02:38.209> of<00:02:38.360> us<00:02:38.450> but

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
display in the dash in front of us but

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.120 
display in the dash in front of us but
we're<00:02:38.690> going<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.840> use<00:02:38.900> our<00:02:39.080> solo<00:02:39.350> performance

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
we're going to use our solo performance

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.949 
we're going to use our solo performance
data<00:02:40.310> collector<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.300> go<00:02:41.480> from<00:02:41.630> here

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
data collector and go from here

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.410 
data collector and go from here
so<00:02:42.140> in<00:02:42.380> Drive<00:02:42.860> just<00:02:43.670> mean<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.000> car<00:02:44.180> nothing

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
so in Drive just mean the car nothing
