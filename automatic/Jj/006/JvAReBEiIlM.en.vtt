00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.150
 hello we are again to share a 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.890
 new recipe 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.599
 this time ok chocolate we started 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.399
 for the recipe for cupcakes 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.040
 chocolate we will need the 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.530
 following ingredients 180 grams of 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.070
 sugar 100 grams of unsalted butter 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.590
 3 eggs 180 grams of flour one 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.559
 teaspoon and half of rose 40 grams 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.379
 of cocoa without sugar 120 milliliters of 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.310
 semi-skimmed milk and a teaspoon of 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.360
 vanilla 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.090
 the first thing to do 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.470
 the butter with the sugar this is going to 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.410
 Taking a little while can be done with 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:05.089
 blender but only this process another 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.250
 thing that butter never ever 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.719
 of being previously melted heated 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.429
 in the microwave 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:14.289
 always room temperature take it out 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:14.289
 well in advance 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.939
 this is going to mix until it 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.939
 dissolve the butter 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.560
 of a creampie when we have it like that 10 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.670
 we are integrating we are going to add the eggs 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.009
 but one by one not the three of blows 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.110
 if they want first clear after yolk 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.680
 but everything suddenly does not have its secret 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.189
 because that way they will integrate better from the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.189
 another way 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.900
 everything is well integrated 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:02:00.180
 another secret does not need to beat with 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:04.180
 machine or beat with a hand whisk 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.220
 a lot because if you do not air it a lot 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.600
 dough and then the cupcake in the oven 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.850
 can 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.560
 and explode can be opened then 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.950
 it's always better 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.690
 mix more than beat 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.510
 this is because it is what you have to 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.670
 integrate good then let's go to 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.209
 add 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.400
 flour teaspoon flour 180 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.959
 grams a teaspoon and a half of rose 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.849
 of yeast then to any kind of 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:34.489
 yeast and cocoa 40 grams of cocoa 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:37.459
 all together and previously sifted everything 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:41.770
 never put it without sifting because if the 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:45.540
 mass then comes out with bad lumps 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.540
 let's integrate everything 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.819
 then we will add 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.739
 milk 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.739
 to 120 milliliters 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:06.989
 and a teaspoon of vanilla I 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.989
 liquid add can be in paste 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.300
 we finish integrating everything well and 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.010
 we will have 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.550
 our mass ready to pressure us 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.550
 break 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.610
 we already have our coffee mass 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.980
 done is your way out of the side that I'm 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.630
 using is not accurate you can 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.010
 use any spoon what happens 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.840
 that we have at the time of filling 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.580
 our capsules a little bit more than 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.400
 control is done with a spoon or a 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.850
 ladle is made a lot of fans you no no 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.950
 they look good 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.960
 we are filling out they are filled in so 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.300
 create two thirds to me I do not 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.610
 they like very very big because if not 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.230
 it appears I imagine a cupcake comes out all 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.210
 for outside that I like that when you 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.430
 see is flush 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.680
 good so we continue to press all and 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.420
 previously while we do our 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.890
 preparation it is convenient to heat the 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.860
 180 degree oven 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.930
 It is convenient to never place the dough without 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.960
 the preheated oven once you already 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.900
 We all lists Capsules 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.670
 let's cook 20 minutes 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.970
 right away they go up and they stay 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.860
 super fluffy have to 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.770
 try them because they are values ​​come out 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:24.320
 very many at this time I have a 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:27.250
 cooking plate 12 but more or less 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.250
 It's about 20 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.670
 good in a little while 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.100
 when they are ready let's see the 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:41.650
 final result I will tell you a 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:44.140
 little secret that clear the bases if 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.420
 They do not have the mold to place the 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.130
 bases in the oven capsules all 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.990
 container that goes inside the oven that 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.990
 have an orbit in this case I have 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:57.730
 cups for this the flan can place 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:02.010
 the capsule inside place the dough and 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.010
 cook the same on a baking sheet 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:22.249
 well they are done as you see 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:25.549
 they release the mold very easy 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:27.620
 back we can go by placing a 

00:05:25.549 --> 00:05:32.060
 exhibitor 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.880
 and to decorate them if you prefer you have to 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.070
 let them cool a little and ready 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.250
 to savor the wait 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.760
 but that they do it because this is 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.350
 spectacular 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.330
 let's open one to show the 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.370
 consistency that you have inside look 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.830
 look what this one is super mega 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.889
 spongy 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.920
 wet 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.890
 it's a pass 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.050
 and do not miss the next video in the 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.590
 which will we decorate these cakes with 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.590
 Christmas themes
