00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 long hair has been fashionable since 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.529
 I feel but always women who 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:21.750
 love to give the contra today we go to bed 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:23.939
 with hair Carlos Anaya your note that 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.160
 more and more people ending up carrying 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.599
 short hair I think that people are 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.849
 is daring more because they are 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.800
 realizing that the necks stand 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.620
 more the silhouette of the woman puts it more 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.930
 slender and the myth of having everything even 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.390
 it's from before but you very high 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.040
 important myths there are not many 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.260
 myths about short hair by 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.870
 example the case of giovanna already has the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.250
 wavy hair and it's kind dude friends what 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.860
 that I listened if you have hair 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.079
 curled up you cost it little 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.550
 mafalda immediately that's true or 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.309
 from tend the cut 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.620
 depends on the cut depends on the thickness of the 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.210
 Hair depends on the texture and 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.950
 wave strength 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.530
 people who have hair / who has 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.630
 medium curly and lass and thick and plentiful 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.090
 She is very afraid of cutting her hair in layers 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.850
 but the issue is what kind of layers like 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.340
 what kind of design do they use to work on 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.670
 cut and you definitely have to evaluate 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.880
 always the face the neck the necks the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.890
 height because they often leave 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.560
 grow hair and what you have is a 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.050
 mass type plus skirt the skin swells 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.570
 everything then the faces are hidden 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.399
 bodies hide and they are nothing they are pure 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.649
 hair cut so now with what 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.080
 I'm going to do is give you a lot 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.720
 movement in these areas above and of 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.340
 the laterals and we're going to work with a 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.770
 design of a raised neck also 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.869
 if we work in proportions 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.780
 between short and long we are going to make 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.759
 the wave definitely have a design 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.830
 more fun because the cut has a 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.360
 good design any product that you 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.759
 apply either for waves either 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.619
 paralyze or I be a wax or 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.600
 simply a product that neutralizes me 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.990
 says the free zinc hair is not going to 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.990
 get better 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.750
 and I loved it and it did not really 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.520
 it has cost a lot, he recognized them a little 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.290
 centimeters really that for the change 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.600
 We have to cut in areas 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.810
 I needed there and well there's the 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.810
 result
