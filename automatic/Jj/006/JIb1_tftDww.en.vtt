00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:04.490 
I'm just removing the protective layer

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.799 
I'm just removing the protective layer
from<00:00:04.700> this<00:00:05.230> from<00:00:06.230> this<00:00:06.319> aluminium<00:00:06.529> sheet<00:00:07.809> and

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 
from this from this aluminium sheet and

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.100 
from this from this aluminium sheet and
this<00:00:08.960> is<00:00:09.110> the<00:00:09.260> bit<00:00:09.440> that<00:00:10.369> covers<00:00:10.760> up<00:00:10.910> the

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 
this is the bit that covers up the

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:18.280 
this is the bit that covers up the
transmission<00:00:12.110> tunnel<00:00:15.309> want<00:00:16.309> to<00:00:16.990> and<00:00:17.990> this<00:00:18.170> is

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.290 
transmission tunnel want to and this is

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.880 
transmission tunnel want to and this is
the<00:00:18.410> fourth<00:00:18.680> bit<00:00:19.300> that's<00:00:20.300> one<00:00:20.480> more<00:00:20.690> and<00:00:21.680> goes

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890
