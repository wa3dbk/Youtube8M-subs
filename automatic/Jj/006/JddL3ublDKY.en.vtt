00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.400
 a classic returns to a true classic 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.949
 of the 911 the license plate version with lots of 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.510
 fixed roll bar and canvas canopy 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.050
 a scheme that brings us back 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.599
 straight to 1965 year of presentation 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.400
 of the first attack that was carried out 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.650
 to meet the needs of 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.110
 American clientele that asked for more 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.420
 security for past open cars 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.820
 however, only fascination remains 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.370
 the interpretation as we shall see is ultra 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.770
 modern the roof folds into the compartment 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.899
 rear in just 19 seconds with a 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.450
 spectacular game of movements on 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.730
 rear window rises vertically the roof yes 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.129
 detaches folds in two and disappears into 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.539
 own housing built on 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.870
 chassis of four-wheeled models 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.000
 drive 911 in this version plaque 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.329
 and perhaps even more beautiful view from behind 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.979
 you want for the wheel arches widened by 44 mm 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.200
 for larger wheels and rear window 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.290
 enveloping it is truly impressive 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.030
 inside the usual 911 the position of 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.729
 driving is almost perfect with the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.650
 vertically shaped steering wheel 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.720
 the instrumentation is composed of the usual ones 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.090
 classic five elements with the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.530
 large tachometer foreground goods with 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.990
 inside also the indicator of 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.119
 gear the engine is very well known boxer 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.619
 6-cylinder naturally aspirated here in the version 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.540
 smaller by 3.4 liters of displacement 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.460
 compared to 3008 a little less copies in 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.500
 low but very strong at the top with a 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.080
 I stretch really extraordinary pulls 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.790
 up to 7,800 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.310
 I don't acer is perfectly indulged 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.310
 from the pdk dual clutch gearbox 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.810
 the plate with all-wheel drive 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.640
 made with a controlled clutch 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.390
 electronic carrying torque on the wheels 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.979
 front 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.780
 only when the rear wheels 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.220
 begin to lose grip ie 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.200
 when they start skating 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.569
 for this reason the behavior is 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.510
 very similar to that of version a 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.340
 rear-wheel drive there is only a little 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.620
 more mass weighing on the train ban 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.630
 with which you have to deal when there 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.360
 it turns into a curve to exploit them at 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.980
 maximum you need to delay braking 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.560
 bringing it all the way into the curve so 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.450
 to load the front wheels well then 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.040
 the rear is off balance that much 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.200
 that's enough to go out in light 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.900
 oversteer as they put themselves on the ground 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.180
 all 350 horses of the members of revolt 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.950
 a game of balance of the takings but 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.970
 that when he succeeds in giving great 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.340
 years behind the wheel for the 911 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.250
 license plate 4 the house declares a speed 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.380
 maximum of 280 kilometers per hour and a 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:55.260
 time to reach 100 km per hour and 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.260
 starting from a standstill of 4.8 seconds 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.130
 the years go by the technique progresses 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:06.650
 but driving the 911 always remains 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.650
 a truly special unique experience 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.560
 they may seem to me as little as six hours 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.540
 but I'm not really believe me 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.210
 especially if you run them on a track 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.850
 like this with a car but for how much 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.470
 sport is indeed ultra-sporty, however it is 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.690
 was designed to circulate 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.080
 normally on the road it is called porsche 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.600
 918 spyder the porsche more street 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.060
 powerful and fast but also without a doubt 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.170
 the most complicated and evolved one 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.170
 never been built
