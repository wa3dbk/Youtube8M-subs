00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.660
 ten man can get multi cube 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.310
 with me a line is seem for and one 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.560
 half storm is already the furrow and it must 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.210
 happen naturally one after the other 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.529
 it is demolition that means we must 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.540
 planting the trees that became is the 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.790
 pommel side plants harm my point too 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.320

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:44.079
 I am emmys to all the child 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:46.289
 or so I had something in the middle of the spawn and now 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.289
 wrong 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.110
 we are all in the middle of the tension 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.440
 I better say 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:01:00.170
 but the big question is where are everything 6 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.310
 de and oh my god you started friend 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.440
 pussy i would hear him in my back 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.059
 I am asking where are all six 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.130
 the enemies were always 3 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.420
 tiles so very must have a look 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.090
 see if I channel first boy 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.110
 first dragging in your v that is one 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.460
 drag natural hellish missiles 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.440
 that's 2 and in the lead with a sled 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.790
 plus 3 then we can also do everything on the folder 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.700
 go throw but such a ci I am in it 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.770
 team that will plant all the bombs 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.840
 i think that is so handy guys but the 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.250
 first bomb has exploded nice is that and 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.259
 if you do not let them again either 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.790
 explode because everything is round 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.500
 namely already finished 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.700
 And now the views and deepen are going 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.050
 she never succeeds she never succeeds me 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.310
 see it now 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.880
 they can never diffuse that tree 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.649
 man no no no no thunder is over 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.050
 if there are currently under number therethrough 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.619
 only 20 seconds and my team is running 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.170
 the tree 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.790
 so if we want the view they had them 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.840
 first disable 100,000 people 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.280
 before they even get to the neighborhood 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.259
 can come 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.030
 this never goes on for a whole life, yes 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.320
 with them already to me man so goes me 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.700
 never in their life fun with the 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.290
 lima are doing dynamically but the 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.520
 second bombs that also conspiracy 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.720
 tasty tasty tasty tasty tasty 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.360
 tasty tasty tasty tasty tasty 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.799
 nice nice nice smart was my 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.220
 blame not against the very best timon 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.540
 yes this is a pity so I have to be in demand 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.769
 anything i can do a kill screen if i have one 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.180
 jumped in demand 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.650
 beat five people at once for my 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.930
 round one is also just past two 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.580
 minutes so I hope 102 a little longer 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.709
 dirty takes longer anyway because she is now 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.209
 have to plant but yes this is irritating 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.709
 man mass shape that for the objects 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.150
 games and viewers to first with two 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.440
 plans deeply planned everything at the bombs 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.459
 done him tini before 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.989
 it is of course also the intention that 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.370
 you do that in demolition but i like it 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.959
 this nice because i want my series of tony 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.430
 boys okay now we have to go 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.500
 defend if there is a bomb plenter him 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.700
 Then it's time to extandit when we 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.230
 longer time so I hope they do 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.420
 can plant a tree 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.280
 But we will get rid of that automatically 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.280
 also laundry and wash you in too 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.400

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.060

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.530
 and I know you came boy and boy 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.090

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.590
 and just then just walk is bomb or 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.630

 as a plus anyway 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.819
 now I have to wait for the right one 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.360
 moment and right moment is when the bomb is 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.430
 gone off 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.380

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.300
 the other cheek and now are natural 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.500

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.320
 teammates do this 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.990
 ah it is the intention of course 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.190
 this game 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.710
 it is the intention of this time none 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.540
 cook course you think the views as you 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.530
 should view the views and that one hour as 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.780
 you have to plant 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.430
 the problem is i want polish as long as 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.740
 let you template the game 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.560
 sometime if you play well it lasted 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:35.850
 demolition games round number one 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:37.890
 about 6 minutes 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.930
 round number two like you really like that 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.740
 You can correct 8 as long as possible 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.120
 minutes 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.620
 so we already have fourteen in total 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.180
 minutes in a jar 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.040
 round number on three will also be added 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.750
 it takes approximately 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.780
 let's say four minutes have 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.360
 so just 20 to 15 minutes 5 very 20 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.590
 minutes a game of demolition but knife 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.640
 of course also still for the 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.380
 objects which of course is the intention 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.980
 is but almost no one else does except 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:03.420
 these people who were only team so this 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.100
 just very fast game windows this game 

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.720
 very quickly but a bit of a shame 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.250
 and you know it was anyway now 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.160
 luck what a your source with coast and 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.020
 I saw the carbon brushes oh lucy and the 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.580
 rest is in this house sitting still 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.600
 until the helster had been and yes then 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.290
 Of course you also don't get the kills 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.240
 so along 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.500
 half look blades I hope of course that
