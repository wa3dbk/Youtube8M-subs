 Italian alitalia has just inaugurated a

 direct service between the airport of

 after that of casablanca 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.549
 so why the city ocher and well 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.240
 simply because it does not drain 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.369

 essaouira from next September 15th 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.470
 there would be several reasons behind 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.909
 these decisions 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.219

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.640
 cost on this line paris and will serve 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.340
 so to dig this deficit 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.870
 however no confirmation nor 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.080
 antilles were officially 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.489

 African Union will present a portfolio of 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:50.000
 67 projects estimated at some 15 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.500
 billions of dollars and we go on with 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.299
 the event of the week the bank 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.450
 European Central has created the surprise 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.440
 yesterday she lowered her key rate to 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.500
 a record level 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.419
 half a percent only reaction 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.549
 immediate effect on the foreign exchange markets 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.440
 first where the European currency falls 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.760
 while on the financial markets and 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.389
 on both sides of the Atlantic 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.370
 well, there is a strong rebound in a 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:16.290
 press conference in brussels 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:21.140
 President of the BCE Mario Draghi 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.140
 guy explains this decision listen to him 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.980
 I am confident that the package of 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.320
 measures that we announced in June 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.960
 will have effects to support the demand 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.720
 but we are ready to go further 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.920
 in our policy 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.110
 the board of governors is going 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.020
 recognize these developments and in 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.490
 the framework of this mandate will use all 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.550
 instruments at his disposal for 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.260
 ensure price stability on the 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.810
 medium term submitted 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.480
 we then it's my bitch because in addition to the 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.570
 growth deflation is topical 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.490
 and also worries her the bce plans in 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:00.210
 this meaning a price increase is from to 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:03.390
 worth 0 6% in 2014 far far from 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.930
 the 2% target set by the institute 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.580
 European mission other concern that 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.680
 weigh on the European economy in 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.690
 moment it is the Russian embargo on 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.480
 food products so 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.210
 of place for xl estimates all of 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.310
 losses to five billion euros a year 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.380
 meanwhile the association of 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.990
 Moroccan exporters and you say 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.900
 always the strategy to adopt for 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.870
 to storm the huge market that 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.310
 is the Russian market 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.840
 and we end precisely with a mode of 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.810
 foreign trade the trade deficit 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:40.080
 American lightened in July he has 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.330
 reaches 40 billion dollars just 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.260
 for this month of July consequence 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.180
 evident 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.340
 or rather the obvious cause and the 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.180
 exports move faster than 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.950
 imports 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.140
 these are the cars but worthy or 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.570
 tests that clearly bring this 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.060
 performance so that's basically 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.300
 of the economic update excellent day 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.300
 to all
