 meslay-du-maine a test that 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.340
 for 7 and 8 year old trotters 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.410
 everything is well known in similar 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.090
 company here is my selection for this 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.340
 encounter I placed in the lead number 3 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.050
 your boyfriend after a series of failures this 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.730
 boarder of thierry raffegeau comes 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.900
 to show a renewed condition to 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.730
 saint brieuc where that day he has well 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.619
 finished without his driver being 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.539
 bad guys with him the horse is in phase 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.160
 ascending also know who will 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.350
 déferré hinds for the occasion 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.149
 it's always a sign of trust 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.190
 depends on a stable in good shape 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.079
 that of thierry raffegeau for the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.110
 casaque and jean yves rooses and so 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.789
 number 3 to your friend confided to damien 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.649
 good seems to me able to play the 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.750
 leading roles in this competition 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.059
 especially as the big track favor 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.579
 clearly his interests will be opposed 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.989
 the number 13 in this event is ti 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.230
 carli amo who is never safe 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.399
 of an incartade he has 22 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.440
 disqualification in seventy seven 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.489
 run races that said he proved to 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.510
 many times and that 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.250
 count with him at this level of 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.299
 competition 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.189
 know also that his last outing 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.810
 untied four feet ended 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.220
 by a success in Cordemais in a better way 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.200
 so keep it in very good rank 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.000
 just like the number 10 in this 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.590
 test c 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.730
 to be or Norman who is at best 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.170
 currently he stays on a 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.100
 convincing series of six podiums 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.670
 consecutive 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.260
 the horse will be entrusted to Eric raffin who 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.970
 can boast of having led him to 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.440
 success in a flush stream recorded 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.390
 september at vincennes in these 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.979
 conditions is hard not to 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.140
 consider him on the podium of this 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.910
 e3 race the 13th may 10 three favorite 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.830
 for the places I would have held the 15th 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.300
 october to jeff who stays on a probant 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.680
 success on the course that we 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.330
 interested a confirmation that tense 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.550
 especially since it will be again dev 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.110
 Later 11 father tobrouk number 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.130
 pay attention to him he's always at the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.330
 looking for a first win at 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.910
 vincennes but he has already made the finish 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.470
 on this course and it is confirmed at this 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.450
 level 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.740
 also know that it will be sold out of 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.380
 four for the occasion its only output 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.680
 in this way was successful the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.210
 number 5 tropics had to be who is well 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.800
 and trained early in the career in the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.020
 southeast by yannick alain briand the 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.459
 horse therefore lacks reference to 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.720
 vincennes and will start on this course 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.580
 of 2007 of the big track 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.650
 that said his second place in enghien 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.300
 in a correct lot and also his 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.820
 recent end of race at vincennes in 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.410
 the price medusa 1 test well composed 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.120
 reserved for apprentices and young people 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.380
 jockeys argues in his favor better 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.720
 so be wary for places 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.220
 also the 8th 10th rock that has better 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.750
 finished as his last indicate 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.190
 gross ranking in the quinté more than 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.570
 all the day push there they had no 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.580
 only face six years but 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.380
 also he was delayed by a fault 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.930
 at the beginning of the course and number 12 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.370
 speedy cruz in my opinion he is barred for 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.930
 the very first places but the 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.390
 horse is in shape he ran well 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.829
 lately laval in an event where 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.040
 ahead of four of his rivals 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.200
 day 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.030
 in these conditions better then the 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.760
 remember also in good rank this number 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.720
 12 speedy cruz for obtaining a 4th 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.370
 5th place 3 13 10 15 11 5 8 and 12 my 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.470
 selection for this quinté prix de 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.570
 meslay-du-maine lassus of the program 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.400
 I really like 205 victoria of the yoke 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.840
 Muslim years preserve a mare late 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.130
 of gains she now has two races 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.209
 in the legs she is close to her 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.410
 better level she was prepared in 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.730
 consequence for this race 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.049
 she finds a way she 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.470
 already knows five wins 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.120
 on the course 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.320
 interest is the race ionized my opinion 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.350
 he should not be far from the truth 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.910
 I will ask the 107 goes to duvivier who 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.390
 stays on two convincing places of 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.480

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.540
 in the fifth attention 516 at home 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.950
 May 2, the horse is free of four 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.180
 feet for the occasion his three outings 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.340
 to be four feet well both his 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.020
 second places and a brief success a 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.540
 excellent percentage of success on 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.950
 horse progress on his race of 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.960
 returned recently after six 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.000
 month of absence to vincennes here the real 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.920
 take advantage of this commitment 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.920
 516 extremely favorable to apple 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.020
 may 205 victoria of the day in angers en 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.090
 meeting 2 race e reserved for 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.290
 gallopers in the first dominique 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.640
 sepulcher with which I had the opportunity 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.530
 to maintain is confident that the blood in 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.730
 louisiana the only downside is that course 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.209
 close to ten days 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.830
 interval 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.720
 but she is irreproachable since her 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.220
 debut she was in excellent 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.090
 physical condition she knows the 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.709
 course in all she knows 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.700
 the racecourse brief as many assets that 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.410
 plead in his favor 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.900
 the state of the land will not put any 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.700
 problem the 103 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.620
 your kids who ran well lately 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.900
 who ended well on the account of mans 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.879
 in the wake of our favorite should 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.269
 to be at his main opponent the 101 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:21.400
 louisiana the 103 your guys 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:25.180
 then guy the new and confide with 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.340
 the 502 here again the horse is at 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.870
 better the heavy terrain he appreciates and 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.130
 in these conditions I can not see what 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.440
 could prevent him from fighting for the 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.910
 success in his races at his fingertips the 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.210
 500 sailing of our very candidates 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.680
 seriously to victory the 501 val at 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.590
 the state that remains on a victory to 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.139
 saint brieuc 2 will try to worry him the 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.570
 502 and the 501 finally alain blow and he 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.100
 presents the 702 thunder king task val 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.570
 who did not miss his debut alone 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.000
 obstacle since they had imposed themselves 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.639
 on the hurdles of saint brieuc at the beginning 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.110
 of months here is know that this set on 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.120
 should be able to confirm to the statements of 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.770
 his entourage, however, he will be asked the 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.720
 704 in this test 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.400
 it's a secret of the woods that started well 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.750
 at nantes ranking second is this so 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.580
 for public first steps it's 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.349
 encouraging and the 701 also 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.000
 hurricane chris who is no longer confirmed t 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.020
 two precedents cited in the discipline 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.240
 and then should be able to also 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.599
 finished on the podium of this race 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.789
 702 704 and 701 but three favorites for 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:21.849
