awesome within black ops 2 we got the
introduction<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.620> weapons<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.130> KSG

introduction of weapons like the KSG

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.270 
introduction of weapons like the KSG
which<00:00:36.329> was<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> single<00:00:36.960> slug<00:00:37.230> shotgun<00:00:37.920> which

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
which was a single slug shotgun which

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.260 
which was a single slug shotgun which
was<00:00:38.430> something<00:00:38.700> we've<00:00:38.820> never<00:00:38.940> seen<00:00:39.210> before

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
was something we've never seen before

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.270 
was something we've never seen before
within<00:00:39.719> Call<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:39.989> Duty<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.800> within<00:00:40.920> ghosts

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
within Call of Duty and within ghosts

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.920 
within Call of Duty and within ghosts
we've<00:00:41.460> got<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.790> weapon<00:00:42.239> which<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.750> something

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
we've got this weapon which is something

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.720 
we've got this weapon which is something
very<00:00:43.079> very<00:00:43.469> different<00:00:43.680> again<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.430> anything

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
very very different again to anything

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.040 
very very different again to anything
we've<00:00:44.850> seen<00:00:44.879> before<00:00:45.149> with<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.510> multiplayer

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
we've seen before with in multiplayer

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.470 
we've seen before with in multiplayer
this<00:00:46.440> weapon<00:00:46.770> has<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.100> built-in<00:00:47.579> laser<00:00:48.120> sight

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
this weapon has a built-in laser sight

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.150 
this weapon has a built-in laser sight
attachment<00:00:49.020> which<00:00:49.140> means<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> hipfire

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
attachment which means that the hipfire

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.130 
attachment which means that the hipfire
spread<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.610> little<00:00:50.789> bit<00:00:50.879> closer<00:00:51.180> which<00:00:51.870> is

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
spread is a little bit closer which is

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.189 
spread is a little bit closer which is
definitely<00:00:52.910> awesome<00:00:53.910> because<00:00:54.329> without<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.780> it

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
definitely awesome because without it it

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.779 
definitely awesome because without it it
would<00:00:55.379> be<00:00:55.559> even<00:00:55.800> harder<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.340> use<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.610> weapon

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
would be even harder to use this weapon

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.299 
would be even harder to use this weapon
because<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.300> cannot<00:00:57.629> fully<00:00:58.050> aim<00:00:58.530> down<00:00:58.949> sights

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
because you cannot fully aim down sights

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.560 
because you cannot fully aim down sights
for<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.579> weapon<00:00:59.940> you're<00:01:00.030> always<00:01:00.239> going<00:01:00.539> to

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
for this weapon you're always going to

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.360 
for this weapon you're always going to
be<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.719> hipfire<00:01:01.140> mode<00:01:01.350> if<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.859> press<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.190> zoom

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
be in hipfire mode if you press the zoom

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.680 
be in hipfire mode if you press the zoom
in<00:01:02.520> button<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.940> your<00:01:03.030> controller<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.600> will

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
in button on your controller it will

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.119 
in button on your controller it will
make<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.989> hipfire<00:01:04.350> spread<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.799> little<00:01:04.979> bit

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
make the hipfire spread a little bit

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.219 
make the hipfire spread a little bit
more<00:01:05.430> compact<00:01:05.850> which<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.510> definitely<00:01:06.930> helpful

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
more compact which is definitely helpful

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.020 
more compact which is definitely helpful
but<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.590> weapon<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.010> all<00:01:08.159> about<00:01:08.369> close-range

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
but this weapon is all about close-range

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.359 
but this weapon is all about close-range
combat<00:01:09.180> even<00:01:09.869> though<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.049> an<00:01:10.140> LMG<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.770> very

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
combat even though it's an LMG is very

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.030 
combat even though it's an LMG is very
very<00:01:11.640> unique<00:01:12.240> very<00:01:12.720> very<00:01:12.930> different<00:01:13.320> now<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.680> go

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
very unique very very different now I go

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.249 
very unique very very different now I go
for<00:01:14.220> some<00:01:14.369> longer<00:01:14.729> range<00:01:14.909> shots<00:01:15.180> like<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.689> see

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
for some longer range shots like you see

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.320 
for some longer range shots like you see
here<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.950> does<00:01:17.220> work<00:01:17.460> out<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.060> time

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
here and it does work out but the time

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.390 
here and it does work out but the time
it<00:01:18.450> takes<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.780> kill<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.200> person<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.740> far

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
it takes to kill that person is far

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.280 
it takes to kill that person is far
longer<00:01:20.700> than<00:01:20.880> if<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.119> were<00:01:21.180> using<00:01:21.390> even<00:01:22.080> a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
longer than if you were using even a

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.289 
longer than if you were using even a
submachine<00:01:22.830> gun<00:01:23.040> or<00:01:23.280> assault<00:01:23.549> rifle<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.180> you

definitely worked out very well meant

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.530 
definitely worked out very well meant
that<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.850> enemies<00:02:21.090> didn't<00:02:21.240> know<00:02:21.300> exactly

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
that the enemies didn't know exactly

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.540 
that the enemies didn't know exactly
where<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.260> was<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.710> did<00:02:22.860> go<00:02:22.980> for<00:02:23.190> some<00:02:23.340> longer

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
where I was I did go for some longer

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.400 
where I was I did go for some longer
range<00:02:23.790> kills<00:02:24.030> as<00:02:24.210> you<00:02:24.300> can<00:02:24.420> see<00:02:24.570> there<00:02:24.870> but<00:02:25.320> as

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
range kills as you can see there but as

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.500 
range kills as you can see there but as
I<00:02:25.500> said<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.830> time<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.310> kill<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.820> lot<00:02:27.330> longer

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
I said the time to kill is a lot longer

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.390 
I said the time to kill is a lot longer
than<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.870> would<00:02:27.960> be<00:02:28.200> with<00:02:28.680> another<00:02:28.890> weapon<00:02:29.310> it

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
than it would be with another weapon it

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.160 
than it would be with another weapon it
was<00:02:29.460> aiming<00:02:29.730> down<00:02:29.850> sight<00:02:30.150> so<00:02:30.480> if<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.780> person's

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
was aiming down sight so if the person's

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.510 
was aiming down sight so if the person's
looking<00:02:31.410> at<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.560> directly<00:02:31.740> you're<00:02:32.190> probably

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
looking at you directly you're probably

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.090 
looking at you directly you're probably
gonna<00:02:32.820> lose<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.120> gunfight<00:02:33.870> as<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.710> said<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:34.950> is

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
gonna lose that gunfight as I said it is

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.130 
gonna lose that gunfight as I said it is
an<00:02:35.190> LMG<00:02:35.610> doesn't<00:02:36.150> really<00:02:36.270> play<00:02:36.450> like<00:02:36.690> an<00:02:36.810> LMG

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
an LMG doesn't really play like an LMG

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.200 
an LMG doesn't really play like an LMG
however<00:02:37.500> as<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.770> go<00:02:37.920> for<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.160> very<00:02:38.550> very<00:02:38.730> long

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
however as I go for a very very long

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.540 
however as I go for a very very long
range<00:02:39.420> kill<00:02:39.750> here<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.830> actually<00:02:40.950> has<00:02:41.520> a

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
range kill here it actually has a

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.460 
range kill here it actually has a
greater<00:02:42.090> mobility<00:02:42.390> than<00:02:42.930> any<00:02:43.050> of<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.260> other

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
greater mobility than any of you other

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.920 
greater mobility than any of you other
LMG<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.160> you're<00:02:44.250> gonna<00:02:44.340> move<00:02:44.490> a<00:02:44.550> lot<00:02:44.820> quicker

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
LMG so you're gonna move a lot quicker

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.850 
LMG so you're gonna move a lot quicker
when<00:02:45.930> you're<00:02:46.050> sprinting<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.560> running<00:02:46.770> around

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
when you're sprinting and running around

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.340 
when you're sprinting and running around
the<00:02:47.010> map<00:02:47.310> which<00:02:47.490> is<00:02:47.550> definitely<00:02:47.870> useful<00:02:48.870> since

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
the map which is definitely useful since

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.600 
the map which is definitely useful since
you<00:02:49.470> want<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.800> be<00:02:49.860> getting<00:02:49.950> up<00:02:50.190> in<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.370> enemies

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
you want to be getting up in the enemies

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.040 
you want to be getting up in the enemies
faces<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.120> getting<00:02:51.330> as<00:02:51.390> close<00:02:51.660> as<00:02:51.990> possible

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
faces and getting as close as possible

the map I'm playing on here is called

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.170 
the map I'm playing on here is called
flooded<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.230> is<00:02:55.800> literally<00:02:56.280> flooded<00:02:56.820> areas

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
flooded and is literally flooded areas

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.250 
flooded and is literally flooded areas
of<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.360> maps<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.630> gotta<00:02:57.780> be<00:02:57.870> careful<00:02:57.990> don't

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
of the maps you gotta be careful don't

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.600 
of the maps you gotta be careful don't
fall<00:02:58.380> in<00:02:58.680> them<00:02:58.800> because<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.070> literally<00:02:59.370> will

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
fall in them because you literally will

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.700 
fall in them because you literally will
drown<00:03:00.060> but<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:00.870> worked<00:03:01.020> quite<00:03:01.170> well<00:03:01.290> for<00:03:01.470> this

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
drown but it worked quite well for this
