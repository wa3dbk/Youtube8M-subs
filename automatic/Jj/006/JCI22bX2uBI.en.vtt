00:01:10.294 --> 00:01:29.669

 See him appear, Jesus, our Lord, He brings all his people back into his arms. 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:18.775
 Be ye therefore the people of the Lord, glad and kind, and say continually Christ conquers! 

00:02:18.945 --> 00:02:38.671
 You be the glory, risen Lord, You be the victory, now and always more.

00:03:40.873 --> 00:04:03.489
 You be the glory, risen Lord, You be the victory, now and always more.
