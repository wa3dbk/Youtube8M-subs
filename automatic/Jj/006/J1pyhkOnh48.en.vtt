00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.000
 My job was to prove to the soldiers that war was possible 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 I rejected it 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.000
 The government became more brutal during the war 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.500
 I was suddenly sent to jail or shot as a traitor. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.400
 I landed at Frank Fort 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.700
 My name is Vielke 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.400
 I am 36 years old and I am from Ethiopia 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.000
 The person who interviewed me asked me to tell everything, according to the al-Ahzabubiyya 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 And indeed, I have done and judged everything according to the ecclesiastical rizmana 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.800
 Suddenly he interrupts me and asks me to tell everything again, but according to the European princes. 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.800
 They want us to deliberately harass refugees in order to get in your way. 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.000
 Four men, one of them squeezed my head 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.300
 And the others pulled my hands away from his body so it was very painful 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.100
 After that I saw the feet. We were in the plane. 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.100
 I pushed the men away from me. 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.100
 After that they pulled my feet away. Signed on the ground. 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:43.100
 After that I pressed two on my feet and the others on my head. The place in the plane was very tight 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.900
 I said, I do not want to fly! 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.200
 I wanted to show them, I do not let anyone beat me easily.
