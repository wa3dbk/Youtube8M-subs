kind of ends up looking like a
french-braid<00:00:14.130> when<00:00:14.340> you're<00:00:14.460> done<00:00:15.170> but<00:00:16.170> it's

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360 
just done with two sections you start

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.330 
just done with two sections you start
with<00:00:18.480> one<00:00:18.720> section<00:00:19.110> in<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.500> front<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.160> it's

with one section in the front and it's

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.920 
with one section in the front and it's
not<00:00:20.520> very<00:00:20.760> thick<00:00:21.060> there's<00:00:21.420> not<00:00:21.570> very<00:00:21.600> much

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
not very thick there's not very much

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.750 
not very thick there's not very much
hair<00:00:22.170> there<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.619> then<00:00:22.770> take<00:00:22.950> another<00:00:23.100> section

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
hair there and then take another section

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.890 
hair there and then take another section
directly<00:00:24.330> behind<00:00:24.510> it

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
directly behind it

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.140 
directly behind it
and<00:00:25.990> go<00:00:26.529> all<00:00:26.560> the<00:00:26.770> way<00:00:26.920> down<00:00:27.279> to<00:00:27.490> the<00:00:27.609> bottom<00:00:27.760> so

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
and go all the way down to the bottom so

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.339 
and go all the way down to the bottom so
that<00:00:28.300> you're<00:00:28.390> not<00:00:28.510> leaving<00:00:28.720> any<00:00:29.020> hair

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
that you're not leaving any hair

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.800 
that you're not leaving any hair
underneath<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:31.090> then<00:00:31.210> you're<00:00:31.360> going<00:00:31.449> to<00:00:31.509> tie

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
underneath and then you're going to tie

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.799 
underneath and then you're going to tie
these<00:00:31.869> two<00:00:32.410> into<00:00:32.950> a<00:00:32.980> half<00:00:33.550> of<00:00:33.760> a<00:00:33.850> knot<00:00:34.059> just<00:00:34.480> by

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
these two into a half of a knot just by

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.229 
these two into a half of a knot just by
crossing<00:00:35.079> them<00:00:35.559> and<00:00:35.920> then<00:00:36.280> bringing<00:00:36.790> one<00:00:37.030> and

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
crossing them and then bringing one and

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.720 
crossing them and then bringing one and
up<00:00:37.450> through<00:00:37.660> the<00:00:37.750> middle<00:00:38.050> and<00:00:38.610> tightening<00:00:39.610> it

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
up through the middle and tightening it

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.299 
up through the middle and tightening it
down<00:00:39.760> and<00:00:40.440> then<00:00:41.440> you're<00:00:41.620> going<00:00:41.800> to<00:00:41.890> take<00:00:42.100> these

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
down and then you're going to take these

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.020 
down and then you're going to take these
two<00:00:42.610> pieces<00:00:42.930> into<00:00:43.930> one<00:00:44.140> hand<00:00:44.410> and<00:00:44.820> then<00:00:45.820> grab

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
two pieces into one hand and then grab

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.990 
two pieces into one hand and then grab
another<00:00:46.360> section<00:00:47.019> behind

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
another section behind

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.620 
another section behind
and<00:00:49.750> then<00:00:50.740> tie<00:00:51.010> it<00:00:51.190> in<00:00:51.400> the<00:00:51.790> same<00:00:52.060> way<00:00:52.330> just

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
and then tie it in the same way just

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:59.270 
and then tie it in the same way just
making<00:00:53.020> a<00:00:53.110> half<00:00:53.320> of<00:00:53.470> a<00:00:53.560> knot

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.180 

and<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.880> just<00:01:00.060> keep<00:01:00.300> going<00:01:00.690> back<00:01:00.900> and<00:01:01.410> you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
and you just keep going back and you

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.210 
and you just keep going back and you
don't<00:01:02.370> want<00:01:02.610> it<00:01:02.700> super<00:01:03.120> tight<00:01:03.769> leave<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.920> kind

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
don't want it super tight leave it kind

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.920 
don't want it super tight leave it kind
of<00:01:05.370> loose<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.270> not<00:01:06.450> right<00:01:06.750> up

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
of loose so that it's not right up

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.640 
of loose so that it's not right up
against<00:01:07.320> her<00:01:07.440> head

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.380 

and<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.980> think<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.370> parade<00:01:11.730> is<00:01:11.910> actually

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
and I think this parade is actually

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:25.120 
and I think this parade is actually
easier<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.780> make<00:01:13.170> with<00:01:13.500> dry<00:01:14.430> hair

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.010 

I've<00:01:25.580> already<00:01:25.790> made<00:01:26.120> a<00:01:26.180> braid<00:01:26.480> on<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.840> other

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
I've already made a braid on the other

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.960 
I've already made a braid on the other
side<00:01:27.380> I'm<00:01:27.620> just<00:01:27.770> going<00:01:27.860> to<00:01:28.100> join<00:01:28.490> them<00:01:28.729> in<00:01:28.880> the

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
side I'm just going to join them in the

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.200 
side I'm just going to join them in the
middle<00:01:29.770> if<00:01:30.770> you<00:01:30.950> have<00:01:31.159> longer<00:01:31.430> hair<00:01:31.610> you<00:01:32.000> could

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
middle if you have longer hair you could

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.450 
middle if you have longer hair you could
probably<00:01:32.390> do<00:01:32.840> this<00:01:33.050> all<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.860> way<00:01:33.979> around<00:01:34.340> her

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
probably do this all the way around her

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.080 
probably do this all the way around her
head<00:01:34.670> just<00:01:34.700> one<00:01:35.240> single<00:01:35.479> braid

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.029 

I<00:01:38.179> start<00:01:38.899> running<00:01:39.049> out<00:01:39.320> of<00:01:39.350> hair<00:01:39.619> with<00:01:39.859> hers

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
I start running out of hair with hers

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.789 
I start running out of hair with hers
because<00:01:40.399> it's<00:01:40.670> not<00:01:40.820> quite<00:01:41.090> long<00:01:41.240> enough<00:01:41.799> so

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
because it's not quite long enough so

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.279 
because it's not quite long enough so
when<00:01:43.070> you<00:01:43.189> get<00:01:43.369> to<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.670> middle<00:01:43.960> you<00:01:44.960> can<00:01:45.109> just

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
when you get to the middle you can just

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:56.300 
when you get to the middle you can just
tie<00:01:45.500> those<00:01:45.710> together<00:01:46.990> with<00:01:47.990> an<00:01:48.109> elastic

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.369 

you
