00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 tonino totoro or as we know it 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.730
 my neighbor totoro is a film from the 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.550
 in 1988 she stayed in the studio and 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.790
 script from me says the whole is 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.010
 meanwhile already 25 years old one 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.560
 can still say that it is the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.260
 flair has not lost even after 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.939
 not bring that 25 years because of that 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.849
 I'll give you the whole thing today 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.680
 family cokes have moved to the country there 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.349
 the mother is a little bit sick 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.200
 hospital is and father and mine 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.360
 Daughters satsuki and just me 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.890
 have decided to move there and 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.570
 live country 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.370
 roÃŸleben and then the mother the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.350
 peaceful and your stay like that 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.020
 guaranteed to buy an old house 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.730
 or just a pretty big tree with 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.160
 a bit of forest would have to do it around 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.180
 first to go in the house see may and 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.309
 sax key the first little guy's puck that 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.230
 should be or start because mail goes in 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.020
 she then meets the forest and fans exactly 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.120
 on totoro does not know meanwhile 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.159
 even the trademark so to speak of 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.170
 studio ghibli has become on the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.689
 Most film on it and is so to speak 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.220
 the logo of the animation studio but how 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.479
 Totoro said this is great 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.210
 probably similar beings that 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.369
 totally fleshy is in principle really 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.290
 very nice and sweet in general 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.060
 These little squirrel can be 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.680
 but also the big one very much 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.750
 different things so to 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.880
 For example, you can bus with the cats 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.549
 summon or he plays for example 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.439
 at night on his flute any 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.630
 All of the songs are wonderful too 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.670
 sound totally was a relatively early 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.490
 work the studio ghibli and was why 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.229
 but I would rather risk it 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.150
 That's what the whole studio is about 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.160
 probably the times also 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.110
 broadcasted at the same time as well 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.730
 the last fireflies got her through 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.920
 the good decision should issue 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.720
 because my neighbor totoro was a right one 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.130
 good financial success and is 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.650
 therefore one of the so to speak 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.660
 bli preparer as it is today 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.180
 From animations it is for today 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.770
 conditions, of course, not anymore 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.630
 bombastic is already clear that one may 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.970
 Of course not the man of the movies 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.400
 25 years old not if you are today 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.710
 he still looks at her top 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.530
 from there, although I kept simple 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.959
 my relationship of 1988 was that 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.700
 really bombastic I experienced 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.300
 that film to germany yet 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.650
 always relatively late the first few years 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.390
 2001 I can do music quite differently 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.580
 somehow not completely understand though 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.530
 well i mean i'm glad he was 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.930
 at all there is as far as I know he is 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.640
 2013 blu-ray came out 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.590
 I do not have them yet 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.240
 have only the normal dvd with me around 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.920
 are but if it the case, and I 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.600
 I recommend you to see them 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.580
 in any case the blu-ray which 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.709
 or take a music technically 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.730
 the whole thing really beautiful as well 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.970
 I probably know myself 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.700
 eh under the spoken one said 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.870
 review the mainstream inferior to that 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.820
 means you probably just hear that 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.450
 background and by the way she will be 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.980
 probably the same again 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.050
 description is the whole thing 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.360
 really very nicely done and that 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.739
 george I hope you had 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.110
 correctly pronounced I am not 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.000
 so big there really is an absolute 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.360
 masterpiece I personally think so 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.769
 wonderful as you get here this normal 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.160
 still partially connect the everyday world 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.160
 could 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.560
 and I think it just came out so well 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.600
 I have over there now follow the 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.490
 Review again has to say the must 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.020
 feelings are generally just calm 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.340
 I must say that again and again 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.260
 Look again and my neighbor totoro 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.360
 just is not an exception 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.220
 something for the ear is what I see 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.410
 I think that's what I thought 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.020
 in the passive recommend conclusion my neighbor 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.440
 totoro is an absolute anime classic 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.720
 from the year 1988 says of me 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.420
 made that animations while in the 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.970
 compared to today bit simple but 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.370
 already sometimes she looked old 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.560
 because of her 25-year history 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.209
 still good 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.920
 the story itself is really nice 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.580
 tells and is in principle something for the heart 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.470
 is where you can say you're not 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.020
 Anime fans, however, watch them anyway 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.700
 is at it you like is not alone 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.350
 just because of the animations or story 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.110
 but also simply the ingenious 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.959
 music if you are anime fans and mine 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.090
 have not seen neighbor totoro so very 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.950
 do not know then shame on now 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.049
 please just go in the corner and 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.510
 does not he cry this classic? 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.220
 knew missed extras and for all 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.020
 the ones you've ever seen 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.640
 have and want to watch again 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.590
 nobody just does it 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.640
 wrong before any narrow 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.530
 Watch TV in 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.380
 is only for the thousandth time the 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.240
 my neighbor totoro dvd blu ray in the 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.860
 player and so of course how 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.000
 always everything is said there is and remains 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.680
 my opinion if you do not 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.270
 the mass does not like our own we 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.270
 see it at least as the citigroup
