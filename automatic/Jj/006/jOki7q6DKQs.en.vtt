hey guys so we were about to begin day
two<00:00:03.090> of<00:00:03.659> my<00:00:03.990> electric<00:00:04.470> vehicle<00:00:04.950> conversion

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
two of my electric vehicle conversion

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:21.920 
two of my electric vehicle conversion
project<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.600> here's<00:00:06.810> what<00:00:06.990> we<00:00:07.080> have<00:00:07.259> so<00:00:07.529> far

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.089 

don't<00:00:22.930> worry<00:00:23.080> about<00:00:23.170> all<00:00:23.349> these<00:00:23.529> red<00:00:23.890> pieces

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
don't worry about all these red pieces

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:25.859 
don't worry about all these red pieces
down<00:00:24.520> here<00:00:24.820> that's<00:00:25.090> just<00:00:25.210> the<00:00:25.449> parts<00:00:25.689> to<00:00:25.810> our

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
down here that's just the parts to our

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.510 
down here that's just the parts to our
engine<00:00:26.199> hoist<00:00:26.410> which<00:00:26.830> are<00:00:26.980> going<00:00:27.130> to<00:00:27.220> assemble

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
engine hoist which are going to assemble

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.060 
engine hoist which are going to assemble
right<00:00:27.880> now<00:00:28.060> and<00:00:28.869> finally<00:00:29.380> we<00:00:30.099> have<00:00:30.460> one

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
right now and finally we have one

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.560 
right now and finally we have one
completed<00:00:33.070> engine<00:00:33.460> hoist<00:00:33.610> the<00:00:34.210> only<00:00:34.329> reason

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
completed engine hoist the only reason

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.930 
completed engine hoist the only reason
it's<00:00:34.690> up<00:00:34.809> on<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.890> ramps<00:00:36.339> like<00:00:36.489> that<00:00:36.699> is

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
it's up on the ramps like that is

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.280 
it's up on the ramps like that is
because<00:00:37.180> I<00:00:37.239> had<00:00:37.360> to<00:00:37.420> tighten<00:00:37.629> the<00:00:37.839> bolts<00:00:38.140> in

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
because I had to tighten the bolts in

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.150 
because I had to tighten the bolts in
the<00:00:38.410> rear<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:38.949> it's<00:00:40.260> kind<00:00:41.260> of<00:00:41.379> hard<00:00:41.620> to<00:00:41.680> do<00:00:41.920> all

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
the rear and it's kind of hard to do all

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.600 
the rear and it's kind of hard to do all
it's<00:00:42.339> fully<00:00:42.670> on<00:00:42.850> the<00:00:43.000> ground<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:44.500> now<00:00:44.890> even

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
it's fully on the ground so now even

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.729 
it's fully on the ground so now even
though<00:00:45.940> that<00:00:46.180> my<00:00:46.360> engine<00:00:46.900> hoist<00:00:47.079> is<00:00:47.320> complete

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
though that my engine hoist is complete

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.799 
though that my engine hoist is complete
I<00:00:47.769> won't<00:00:48.100> be<00:00:48.190> using<00:00:48.400> it<00:00:48.670> straightaway<00:00:49.300> because

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
I won't be using it straightaway because

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.139 
I won't be using it straightaway because
there<00:00:50.230> still<00:00:50.350> plenty<00:00:51.040> to<00:00:51.190> do<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.699> engine<00:00:51.969> bay

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
there still plenty to do the engine bay

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.450 
there still plenty to do the engine bay
in<00:00:52.210> terms<00:00:52.449> of<00:00:52.890> prepping<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:54.010> engine<00:00:54.280> for

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
in terms of prepping the engine for

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.060 
in terms of prepping the engine for
removal<00:00:54.969> and<00:00:55.120> as<00:00:56.110> well<00:00:56.320> I'd<00:00:56.440> like<00:00:56.590> to<00:00:56.649> take<00:00:56.860> out

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
removal and as well I'd like to take out

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.400 
removal and as well I'd like to take out
all<00:00:58.000> the<00:00:58.180> things<00:00:58.210> in<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:58.780> back<00:00:58.930> -<00:00:59.170> like<00:00:59.289> the

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
we got the vehicle up in the air

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.710 
we got the vehicle up in the air
supported<00:01:08.050> by<00:01:08.170> jack<00:01:08.500> stands<00:01:08.860> I<00:01:09.340> can<00:01:10.119> begin<00:01:10.240> to

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
supported by jack stands I can begin to

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.389 
supported by jack stands I can begin to
work<00:01:11.729> taking<00:01:12.729> this<00:01:12.970> whole<00:01:13.710> exhaust<00:01:14.710> assembly

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
work taking this whole exhaust assembly

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.810 
work taking this whole exhaust assembly
out<00:01:15.429> I<00:01:16.060> don't<00:01:16.810> know<00:01:16.869> how<00:01:17.050> well<00:01:17.229> you<00:01:17.350> can<00:01:17.500> see

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
out I don't know how well you can see

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.430 
out I don't know how well you can see
these<00:01:18.820> bolts<00:01:19.270> are<00:01:19.390> so<00:01:19.600> rusty<00:01:20.110> I<00:01:20.140> don't<00:01:20.350> know

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
these bolts are so rusty I don't know

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.560 
these bolts are so rusty I don't know
how<00:01:20.619> they're<00:01:20.800> gonna<00:01:20.860> come<00:01:21.160> off<00:01:21.340> a<00:01:21.700> little<00:01:22.300> with

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
how they're gonna come off a little with

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.010 
how they're gonna come off a little with
an<00:01:22.690> impact<00:01:23.080> but<00:01:23.679> it<00:01:24.429> seemed<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.759> be<00:01:24.789> like

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
an impact but it seemed to be like

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.320 
an impact but it seemed to be like
almost<00:01:26.020> fused<00:01:26.649> to<00:01:26.979> the<00:01:27.069> flange<00:01:27.399> here<00:01:27.819> so<00:01:28.300> I

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
almost fused to the flange here so I

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.779 
almost fused to the flange here so I
don't<00:01:28.420> know<00:01:28.509> how<00:01:28.660> well<00:01:28.840> that's<00:01:28.929> gonna<00:01:29.170> work

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
don't know how well that's gonna work

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.999 
don't know how well that's gonna work
the<00:01:30.789> second<00:01:31.179> thought<00:01:31.390> is<00:01:31.750> bolts<00:01:32.349> are<00:01:32.530> frickin

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
the second thought is bolts are frickin

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.999 
the second thought is bolts are frickin
impossible<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.910> get<00:01:34.060> off<00:01:34.090> so<00:01:34.840> I'm<00:01:35.679> gonna<00:01:35.800> have

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
impossible to get off so I'm gonna have

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.279 
impossible to get off so I'm gonna have
to<00:01:36.190> use<00:01:36.489> an<00:01:37.030> angle<00:01:37.300> grinder<00:01:37.479> which<00:01:37.989> I<00:01:38.140> don't

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
to use an angle grinder which I don't

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.740 
to use an angle grinder which I don't
actually<00:01:38.440> own<00:01:38.830> I<00:01:39.099> tried<00:01:39.399> using<00:01:39.550> a<00:01:39.729> dremel<00:01:39.940> that

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
actually own I tried using a dremel that

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.479 
actually own I tried using a dremel that
just<00:01:40.929> wasn't<00:01:41.080> gonna<00:01:41.229> cut<00:01:41.530> it<00:01:41.679> so<00:01:42.220> am<00:01:42.310> I<00:01:42.369> gonna

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:42.489 
just wasn't gonna cut it so am I gonna

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:44.669 
just wasn't gonna cut it so am I gonna
have<00:01:42.610> to<00:01:42.670> go<00:01:42.759> by<00:01:42.910> an<00:01:43.060> angle<00:01:43.300> grinder<00:01:43.479> I<00:01:43.899> don't

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
have to go by an angle grinder I don't

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:46.139 
have to go by an angle grinder I don't
want<00:01:44.800> to<00:01:44.860> do<00:01:44.920> that<00:01:45.039> right<00:01:45.099> now<00:01:45.369> so<00:01:45.640> in<00:01:46.090> the

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
want to do that right now so in the

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.779 
want to do that right now so in the
meantime<00:01:46.330> I'm<00:01:47.020> gonna<00:01:47.170> work<00:01:47.380> on<00:01:47.610> taking<00:01:48.610> off

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
meantime I'm gonna work on taking off

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.059 
meantime I'm gonna work on taking off
this<00:01:49.420> gas<00:01:49.690> tank<00:01:50.050> hopefully<00:01:50.770> that<00:01:50.890> will<00:01:50.950> come

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
this gas tank hopefully that will come

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.070 
this gas tank hopefully that will come
out<00:01:51.190> a<00:01:51.250> little<00:01:51.550> bit<00:01:51.640> easier<00:01:52.000> along<00:01:52.840> with<00:01:52.989> all

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
out a little bit easier along with all

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.830 
out a little bit easier along with all
the<00:01:53.170> fuel<00:01:53.410> lines<00:01:53.819> I'm<00:01:54.819> having<00:01:55.209> a<00:01:55.300> hell<00:01:55.569> of<00:01:55.599> a

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
the fuel lines I'm having a hell of a

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.469 
the fuel lines I'm having a hell of a
time<00:01:56.050> trying<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.709> get<00:01:56.860> this<00:01:57.130> fuel<00:01:58.090> filler<00:01:58.360> neck

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
time trying to get this fuel filler neck

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.070 
time trying to get this fuel filler neck
to<00:01:58.899> separate<00:01:59.380> from<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.770> gas<00:01:59.950> tank<00:02:00.369> here<00:02:01.080> it

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
to separate from the gas tank here it

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.169 
to separate from the gas tank here it
should<00:02:02.410> just<00:02:02.560> be<00:02:02.709> a<00:02:02.860> rubber<00:02:03.280> hose<00:02:03.610> holding<00:02:04.090> it

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
should just be a rubber hose holding it

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:05.969 
should just be a rubber hose holding it
on<00:02:04.270> with<00:02:04.390> a<00:02:04.450> couple<00:02:04.569> of<00:02:04.690> clamps<00:02:04.959> I<00:02:05.349> only<00:02:05.800> did

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
on with a couple of clamps I only did

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.490 
on with a couple of clamps I only did
the<00:02:06.069> clamps<00:02:06.489> closest<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.509> actual<00:02:07.959> fuel<00:02:08.229> tank

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
the clamps closest the actual fuel tank

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.710 
the clamps closest the actual fuel tank
and<00:02:08.739> I'm<00:02:09.340> pulling<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.030> pulling<00:02:10.179> and<00:02:10.479> can't

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
and I'm pulling and pulling and can't

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.630 
and I'm pulling and pulling and can't
seem<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:10.929> get<00:02:11.080> it<00:02:11.200> off<00:02:11.349> so<00:02:12.190> I'm<00:02:12.370> actually<00:02:12.459> just

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
seem to get it off so I'm actually just

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.729 
seem to get it off so I'm actually just
gonna<00:02:12.819> cut<00:02:13.209> through<00:02:13.450> with<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.840> clamps<00:02:14.290> with<00:02:14.680> a

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
gonna cut through with the clamps with a

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.979 
gonna cut through with the clamps with a
hacksaw<00:02:15.190> I'm<00:02:16.030> gonna<00:02:16.150> try<00:02:16.270> to<00:02:16.300> be<00:02:16.480> very<00:02:16.660> very

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
hacksaw I'm gonna try to be very very

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.790 
hacksaw I'm gonna try to be very very
careful<00:02:17.280> not<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.360> get<00:02:19.360> any<00:02:19.420> rubber<00:02:20.230> bits<00:02:20.530> into

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
careful not to get any rubber bits into

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.559 
careful not to get any rubber bits into
the<00:02:20.980> fuel<00:02:21.280> because<00:02:21.879> even<00:02:22.120> though<00:02:22.180> there<00:02:22.480> isn't

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
the fuel because even though there isn't

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.000 
the fuel because even though there isn't
a<00:02:22.660> lot<00:02:22.810> of<00:02:22.840> fuel<00:02:23.110> left<00:02:23.170> in<00:02:23.440> here<00:02:23.650> I'd<00:02:23.830> still

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
a lot of fuel left in here I'd still

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.580 
a lot of fuel left in here I'd still
like<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.370> use<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.819> in<00:02:25.000> my<00:02:25.180> car<00:02:25.450> works<00:02:26.319> like<00:02:26.560> a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
like to use it in my car works like a

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.399 
like to use it in my car works like a
charm<00:02:26.920> as<00:02:27.519> you<00:02:27.730> can<00:02:27.909> see<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:28.150> finally<00:02:28.750> get<00:02:29.170> the

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
charm as you can see I finally get the

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.250 
charm as you can see I finally get the
freakin<00:02:30.040> fuel<00:02:30.400> tank<00:02:30.700> out<00:02:30.849> of<00:02:31.000> this<00:02:31.120> thing<00:02:31.390> took

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
freakin fuel tank out of this thing took

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.350 
freakin fuel tank out of this thing took
a<00:02:32.409> lot<00:02:32.650> longer

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
a lot longer

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.990 
a lot longer
thought<00:02:33.630> would<00:02:33.990> most<00:02:34.260> because<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.860> this<00:02:35.670> one

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
thought would most because of this one

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.720 
thought would most because of this one
bolt<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.690> don't<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.020> can<00:02:37.050> even<00:02:37.260> see<00:02:37.730> threatened

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
bolt I don't you can even see threatened

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.440 
bolt I don't you can even see threatened
there's<00:02:38.970> little<00:02:39.450> dark<00:02:40.790> there's<00:02:41.790> one<00:02:42.060> bolt<00:02:42.360> in

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
there's little dark there's one bolt in

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.160 
there's little dark there's one bolt in
there<00:02:42.660> that's<00:02:43.440> blocked<00:02:43.860> by<00:02:44.550> this<00:02:44.610> line<00:02:45.360> right

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
there that's blocked by this line right

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.340 
there that's blocked by this line right
over<00:02:46.230> here<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:47.390> so<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.480> can't<00:02:48.690> really<00:02:48.750> you

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
over here and so you can't really you

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.320 
over here and so you can't really you
know<00:02:49.440> get<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.680> ratchet<00:02:50.370> on<00:02:50.460> or<00:02:50.700> an<00:02:50.790> impact<00:02:51.060> or

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
know get a ratchet on or an impact or

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.570 
know get a ratchet on or an impact or
anything<00:02:51.600> but<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.590> has<00:02:52.710> to<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.280> know<00:02:53.370> at<00:02:53.490> least

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
anything but it has to you know at least

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.300 
anything but it has to you know at least
be<00:02:53.790> very<00:02:54.030> almost<00:02:54.870> pretty<00:02:55.200> much<00:02:55.290> out<00:02:55.560> in<00:02:56.130> order

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
be very almost pretty much out in order

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.000 
be very almost pretty much out in order
to<00:02:56.370> get<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:56.550> fuel<00:02:56.790> tank<00:02:57.030> out<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.290> had<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.740> use

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
to get the fuel tank out so I had to use

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.520 
to get the fuel tank out so I had to use
just<00:02:59.459> three<00:02:59.760> of<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.970> wrench<00:03:00.240> but<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.380> don't

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
just three of the wrench but I don't

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.960 
just three of the wrench but I don't
have<00:03:01.740> leverage<00:03:01.890> in<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.190> wrench<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.670> had<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.850> get

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
have leverage in the wrench I had to get

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.300 
have leverage in the wrench I had to get
a<00:03:03.000> pipe<00:03:03.330> so<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:03.900> didn't<00:03:04.170> really<00:03:04.590> know<00:03:05.070> that<00:03:05.100> I

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
a pipe so I didn't really know that I

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.860 
a pipe so I didn't really know that I
had<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.490> pipe<00:03:05.820> laying<00:03:06.060> around<00:03:06.270> I<00:03:06.630> ended<00:03:06.810> up

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
had a pipe laying around I ended up

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.290 
had a pipe laying around I ended up
taking<00:03:07.050> it<00:03:07.230> up<00:03:07.320> a<00:03:07.350> basement<00:03:07.890> ceiling<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.550> if

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
taking it up a basement ceiling and if

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.640 
taking it up a basement ceiling and if
you<00:03:09.390> think<00:03:09.540> that's<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.750> joke<00:03:09.780> I'll<00:03:10.350> tell<00:03:10.560> you

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
you think that's a joke I'll tell you

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.260 
you think that's a joke I'll tell you
right<00:03:10.680> now<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:11.100> isn't<00:03:11.250> I<00:03:11.610> actually<00:03:11.820> did<00:03:12.120> take

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
right now it isn't I actually did take

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.000 
right now it isn't I actually did take
it<00:03:12.390> out<00:03:12.510> of<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.660> basement<00:03:12.810> ceiling<00:03:14.300> and<00:03:15.709> I<00:03:16.709> was

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
it out of the basement ceiling and I was

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.199 
it out of the basement ceiling and I was
able<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.220> get<00:03:17.370> rid<00:03:17.459> of<00:03:17.550> this<00:03:17.640> bracket<00:03:18.000> right

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
able to get rid of this bracket right

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.170 
able to get rid of this bracket right
here<00:03:18.500> but<00:03:19.500> now<00:03:19.620> I'm<00:03:19.739> just<00:03:19.890> having<00:03:20.180> stupid

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
here but now I'm just having stupid

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.560 
here but now I'm just having stupid
problems<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.050> what<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.070> mean<00:03:23.190> by<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.550> is<00:03:23.880> I've

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
problems and what I mean by that is I've

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.510 
problems and what I mean by that is I've
got<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.810> fuel<00:03:25.110> tank<00:03:25.350> right<00:03:25.739> here<00:03:25.770> it's<00:03:26.250> on<00:03:26.370> the

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
got the fuel tank right here it's on the

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.960 
got the fuel tank right here it's on the
ground<00:03:26.840> except<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:28.470> can't<00:03:29.430> pull<00:03:29.670> it<00:03:29.700> out

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
ground except I can't pull it out

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.120 
ground except I can't pull it out
because<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:31.050> hits<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.350> differential<00:03:31.980> right

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
because it hits the differential right

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.970 
because it hits the differential right
there<00:03:32.459> so<00:03:33.420> after<00:03:33.870> all<00:03:34.080> this<00:03:34.230> I<00:03:34.380> got<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.530> jack<00:03:34.800> up

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
there so after all this I got a jack up

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.610 
there so after all this I got a jack up
the<00:03:35.100> differential<00:03:35.520> again<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.320> try<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.380> sneak

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
the differential again and try to sneak

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.380 
the differential again and try to sneak
it<00:03:37.769> out<00:03:37.950> unfortunately<00:03:38.670> my<00:03:38.790> jack<00:03:39.090> doesn't

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
it out unfortunately my jack doesn't

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.780 
it out unfortunately my jack doesn't
really<00:03:39.660> jack<00:03:39.930> up<00:03:40.140> all<00:03:40.380> that<00:03:40.530> high<00:03:40.769> this<00:03:41.700> is

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
really jack up all that high this is

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.000 
really jack up all that high this is
about<00:03:41.970> as<00:03:42.120> high<00:03:42.299> as<00:03:42.360> I<00:03:42.570> could<00:03:42.630> get<00:03:42.930> it

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
about as high as I could get it

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.650 
about as high as I could get it
you<00:03:44.519> know<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.730> jack<00:03:44.940> stands<00:03:45.239> and<00:03:45.360> go<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.540> little

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
you know the jack stands and go a little

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.300 
you know the jack stands and go a little
higher<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:46.110> came<00:03:46.290> with<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.650> jack<00:03:46.920> so<00:03:47.280> I

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
higher and it came with the jack so I

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.140 
higher and it came with the jack so I
really<00:03:47.580> don't<00:03:47.670> know<00:03:47.820> what<00:03:47.970> they<00:03:48.090> were

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
really don't know what they were

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.259 
really don't know what they were
thinking<00:03:48.410> but<00:03:49.410> anyway<00:03:50.010> I'll<00:03:50.549> check<00:03:51.060> out<00:03:51.180> the

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
thinking but anyway I'll check out the

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.600 
thinking but anyway I'll check out the
differential<00:03:51.750> again<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.830> get<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.220> tank<00:03:53.459> out

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
differential again and get the tank out

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.750 
differential again and get the tank out
of<00:03:53.640> here<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.180> then<00:03:54.959> it's<00:03:55.110> time<00:03:55.320> to<00:03:55.739> move<00:03:55.890> on<00:03:56.160> to

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
of here and then it's time to move on to

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.670 
of here and then it's time to move on to
something<00:03:57.750> else<00:03:57.810> I'm<00:03:58.049> not<00:03:58.170> quite<00:03:58.320> sure<00:03:58.350> what

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
something else I'm not quite sure what

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.009 
something else I'm not quite sure what
yet<00:03:58.860> I<00:03:59.130> decide<00:03:59.700> what<00:03:59.790> I'm<00:03:59.850> gonna<00:03:59.940> do<00:04:00.209> next<00:04:00.390> I'm

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
yet I decide what I'm gonna do next I'm

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.440 
yet I decide what I'm gonna do next I'm
gonna<00:04:01.200> take<00:04:01.410> out<00:04:01.590> this<00:04:01.860> thing<00:04:02.180> no<00:04:03.180> not<00:04:03.360> the

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
gonna take out this thing no not the

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.670 
gonna take out this thing no not the
screwdriver<00:04:03.870> thing<00:04:04.290> underneath<00:04:04.530> the

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
screwdriver thing underneath the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.370 
screwdriver thing underneath the
screwdriver<00:04:05.160> I'm<00:04:06.090> not<00:04:06.269> entirely<00:04:06.690> sure<00:04:06.900> what

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
screwdriver I'm not entirely sure what

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.229 
screwdriver I'm not entirely sure what
it<00:04:07.470> is<00:04:07.500> actually<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.430> think<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:08.970> might<00:04:09.120> be<00:04:09.150> a

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
it is actually I think it might be a

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.150 
it is actually I think it might be a
charcoal<00:04:09.690> canister<00:04:10.049> cuz<00:04:10.470> looks<00:04:10.709> very<00:04:10.890> similar

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
charcoal canister cuz looks very similar

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.240 
charcoal canister cuz looks very similar
to<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.400> charcoal<00:04:11.820> canister<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.450> my<00:04:12.540> Corolla

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
to the charcoal canister in my Corolla

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.949 
to the charcoal canister in my Corolla
all<00:04:14.250> I<00:04:14.310> know<00:04:14.459> is<00:04:14.760> it<00:04:14.880> has<00:04:15.030> fuel<00:04:15.390> lines<00:04:15.570> going<00:04:15.840> to

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
all I know is it has fuel lines going to

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.710 
all I know is it has fuel lines going to
it<00:04:16.290> and<00:04:16.640> that<00:04:17.640> pretty<00:04:17.820> much<00:04:17.910> guarantees<00:04:18.359> they

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
it and that pretty much guarantees they

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.360 
it and that pretty much guarantees they
don't<00:04:18.870> need<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.200> I'm<00:04:19.739> also<00:04:19.890> gonna<00:04:20.040> take<00:04:20.220> out

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
don't need it I'm also gonna take out

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.870 
don't need it I'm also gonna take out
anything<00:04:20.580> else<00:04:20.790> back<00:04:21.359> here<00:04:21.720> that<00:04:22.880> carries

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
anything else back here that carries

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.420 
anything else back here that carries
fuel<00:04:24.240> or<00:04:24.720> power<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:25.620> fuel<00:04:25.890> or<00:04:26.040> anything<00:04:26.190> like

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
fuel or power to fuel or anything like

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.880 
fuel or power to fuel or anything like
that<00:04:26.490> and<00:04:29.180> I'll<00:04:30.180> be<00:04:30.300> my<00:04:30.390> next<00:04:30.570> step<00:04:30.770> to<00:04:31.770> do

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
that and I'll be my next step to do

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.710 
that and I'll be my next step to do
something<00:04:32.370> weird<00:04:32.790> I<00:04:32.940> found<00:04:33.300> this<00:04:33.510> little

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
something weird I found this little

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.390 
something weird I found this little
thing<00:04:34.080> that<00:04:34.110> just<00:04:34.350> sort<00:04:34.560> of<00:04:34.680> dangling<00:04:35.040> there

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
thing that just sort of dangling there

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.909 
thing that just sort of dangling there
it<00:04:36.210> came<00:04:36.450> off<00:04:36.600> here<00:04:37.050> just<00:04:37.320> sort<00:04:37.470> of<00:04:37.530> rotted

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
it came off here just sort of rotted

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.010 
it came off here just sort of rotted
away<00:04:38.040> and<00:04:38.400> I<00:04:38.460> actually<00:04:38.610> have<00:04:38.880> no<00:04:39.150> idea<00:04:39.180> what<00:04:39.870> it

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
away and I actually have no idea what it

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.920 
away and I actually have no idea what it
is<00:04:40.050> and<00:04:40.650> what<00:04:40.740> it's<00:04:40.890> supposed<00:04:41.160> to<00:04:41.250> do

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
is and what it's supposed to do

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.900 
is and what it's supposed to do
I<00:04:42.020> don't<00:04:42.560> know<00:04:42.620> whether<00:04:42.800> it's<00:04:43.009> even<00:04:43.160> necessary

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
I don't know whether it's even necessary

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.890 
I don't know whether it's even necessary
an<00:04:44.210> electric<00:04:44.840> car<00:04:46.030> so<00:04:47.030> I'll<00:04:47.180> leave<00:04:47.360> it<00:04:47.419> intact

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
an electric car so I'll leave it intact

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.950 
an electric car so I'll leave it intact
for<00:04:48.560> now<00:04:48.759> but<00:04:49.759> I'm<00:04:50.000> not<00:04:50.120> to<00:04:50.240> find<00:04:50.419> better<00:04:50.750> way

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
for now but I'm not to find better way

00:04:50.960 --> 00:05:10.230 
for now but I'm not to find better way
to<00:04:51.020> mount<00:04:51.229> it<00:04:51.410> obviously

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.879 

so<00:05:11.240> here's<00:05:11.449> just<00:05:11.539> a<00:05:11.839> quick<00:05:11.990> update<00:05:12.439> I<00:05:12.469> got<00:05:12.770> the

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
so here's just a quick update I got the

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.939 
so here's just a quick update I got the
fuel<00:05:13.159> lines<00:05:13.399> out<00:05:13.759> all<00:05:14.270> right<00:05:14.419> here<00:05:14.779> and<00:05:14.949> of

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:15.949 
fuel lines out all right here and of

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:17.169 
fuel lines out all right here and of
course<00:05:16.009> you<00:05:16.249> got<00:05:16.399> the<00:05:16.429> gas<00:05:16.639> tanks<00:05:17.029> sitting

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:17.179 
course you got the gas tanks sitting

00:05:17.179 --> 00:05:19.869 
course you got the gas tanks sitting
right<00:05:17.419> here<00:05:17.599> I<00:05:17.629> still<00:05:17.869> got<00:05:18.139> the<00:05:18.349> yield<00:05:19.309> gas<00:05:19.610> in

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:19.879 
right here I still got the yield gas in

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:21.879 
right here I still got the yield gas in
it<00:05:20.059> because<00:05:20.719> I<00:05:20.779> want<00:05:20.959> to<00:05:21.020> actually<00:05:21.379> transfer

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
it because I want to actually transfer

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.719 
it because I want to actually transfer
it<00:05:22.039> into<00:05:22.789> my<00:05:23.240> car<00:05:24.020> which<00:05:24.379> you<00:05:24.589> probably<00:05:25.099> can't

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
it into my car which you probably can't

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:27.999 
it into my car which you probably can't
really<00:05:26.119> see<00:05:26.300> on<00:05:26.419> the<00:05:26.539> street<00:05:26.809> over<00:05:26.959> there<00:05:27.080> you

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
really see on the street over there you

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:31.089 
really see on the street over there you
know<00:05:28.129> figure<00:05:28.610> three<00:05:29.089> gasps<00:05:29.300> okay<00:05:30.199> I'll<00:05:30.889> take

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
know figure three gasps okay I'll take

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:31.529 
know figure three gasps okay I'll take
it

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
it

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:34.209 
it
now<00:05:32.539> at<00:05:32.689> this<00:05:32.809> point<00:05:33.139> I've<00:05:33.469> done<00:05:33.529> pretty<00:05:34.099> much

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
now at this point I've done pretty much

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:36.549 
now at this point I've done pretty much
all<00:05:34.639> I<00:05:34.699> can<00:05:35.149> in<00:05:35.629> terms<00:05:35.839> of<00:05:35.959> the<00:05:36.050> back<00:05:36.229> end

00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:36.559 
all I can in terms of the back end

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:38.409 
all I can in terms of the back end
without<00:05:37.219> having<00:05:37.550> an<00:05:37.639> angle<00:05:37.879> grinder<00:05:37.999> since<00:05:38.360> I

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
without having an angle grinder since I

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.989 
without having an angle grinder since I
can<00:05:38.659> take<00:05:38.990> out<00:05:39.139> the<00:05:39.289> exhaust<00:05:39.789> so<00:05:40.789> I'm<00:05:40.849> gonna

00:05:40.989 --> 00:05:40.999 
can take out the exhaust so I'm gonna

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:43.839 
can take out the exhaust so I'm gonna
focus<00:05:41.209> on<00:05:41.479> next<00:05:41.749> is<00:05:42.169> actually<00:05:43.099> prepping<00:05:43.610> the

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
focus on next is actually prepping the

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:47.949 
focus on next is actually prepping the
engine<00:05:44.209> for<00:05:44.539> a<00:05:44.629> removal<00:05:45.189> so<00:05:46.189> it's<00:05:46.939> a<00:05:47.180> kind<00:05:47.839> of<00:05:47.869> a

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:47.959 
engine for a removal so it's a kind of a

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:50.049 
engine for a removal so it's a kind of a
daunting<00:05:48.169> task<00:05:48.439> I'm<00:05:49.249> not<00:05:49.369> really<00:05:49.520> sure<00:05:49.819> where

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:50.059 
daunting task I'm not really sure where

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:52.239 
daunting task I'm not really sure where
to<00:05:50.089> start<00:05:50.599> but<00:05:51.349> I<00:05:51.439> figure<00:05:51.680> I<00:05:51.709> probably<00:05:51.919> start

00:05:52.239 --> 00:05:52.249 
to start but I figure I probably start

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:55.659 
to start but I figure I probably start
with<00:05:52.430> draining<00:05:52.909> fluids<00:05:53.330> and<00:05:53.919> then<00:05:54.919> go<00:05:55.309> with

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
with draining fluids and then go with

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.230 
with draining fluids and then go with
the<00:05:55.939> the<00:05:56.270> radiator<00:05:56.659> and<00:05:57.879> that's<00:05:58.879> kind<00:05:59.089> of<00:05:59.119> the

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
the the radiator and that's kind of the

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.329 
the the radiator and that's kind of the
way<00:05:59.360> anyway<00:05:59.569> and<00:05:59.930> then<00:06:00.050> go<00:06:00.709> over<00:06:00.830> the<00:06:00.919> battery

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:01.339 
way anyway and then go over the battery

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:03.730 
way anyway and then go over the battery
battery<00:06:01.819> definitely<00:06:02.240> first<00:06:02.419> then<00:06:03.199> fluids

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
battery definitely first then fluids

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.179 
battery definitely first then fluids
then<00:06:04.099> radiator<00:06:04.639> and<00:06:05.379> you<00:06:06.379> know<00:06:06.469> we're

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:07.189 
then radiator and you know we're

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:08.980 
then radiator and you know we're
probably<00:06:07.309> back<00:06:07.639> from<00:06:07.849> there<00:06:08.089> and<00:06:08.419> see<00:06:08.839> what

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
probably back from there and see what

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.759 
probably back from there and see what
happens<00:06:10.959> so<00:06:11.959> now<00:06:12.110> let's<00:06:12.319> see<00:06:12.439> what's<00:06:12.589> in<00:06:12.680> this

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:12.769 
happens so now let's see what's in this

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:27.189 
happens so now let's see what's in this
oil<00:06:12.919> pan<00:06:22.749> well<00:06:23.749> there<00:06:24.740> she<00:06:25.039> goes<00:06:26.169> there<00:06:27.169> she

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 
oil pan well there she goes there she

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:31.449 
oil pan well there she goes there she
goes<00:06:28.959> yeah<00:06:29.959> it's<00:06:30.409> gonna<00:06:30.589> help<00:06:30.800> over<00:06:31.099> the<00:06:31.219> drain

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:31.459 
goes yeah it's gonna help over the drain

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:34.569 
goes yeah it's gonna help over the drain
bolt<00:06:32.019> yeah<00:06:33.079> well<00:06:33.499> I'm<00:06:33.860> so<00:06:34.099> glad<00:06:34.129> I<00:06:34.369> won't<00:06:34.490> ever

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:34.579 
bolt yeah well I'm so glad I won't ever

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:39.100 
bolt yeah well I'm so glad I won't ever
have<00:06:34.729> to<00:06:34.789> do<00:06:34.939> that<00:06:34.969> again<00:06:37.209> well<00:06:38.209> I<00:06:38.240> was<00:06:38.719> gonna

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
have to do that again well I was gonna

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.129 
have to do that again well I was gonna
go<00:06:39.439> drain<00:06:40.249> all<00:06:40.399> the<00:06:40.430> coolant<00:06:40.849> now<00:06:41.029> but<00:06:41.930> as<00:06:42.110> you

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:42.139 
go drain all the coolant now but as you

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:45.069 
go drain all the coolant now but as you
can<00:06:42.409> see<00:06:42.469> the<00:06:43.430> kind<00:06:44.360> of<00:06:44.449> a<00:06:44.539> lot<00:06:44.659> of<00:06:44.779> oil<00:06:44.930> in

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:45.079 
can see the kind of a lot of oil in

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:46.839 
can see the kind of a lot of oil in
there<00:06:45.259> so<00:06:46.039> the<00:06:46.129> cooling<00:06:46.399> won't<00:06:46.550> actually<00:06:46.639> fit

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:46.849 
there so the cooling won't actually fit

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:49.269 
there so the cooling won't actually fit
in<00:06:47.119> this<00:06:47.240> pan<00:06:47.509> so<00:06:47.539> I<00:06:47.809> got<00:06:47.990> to<00:06:48.110> go<00:06:48.259> take<00:06:49.099> it<00:06:49.189> to

00:06:49.269 --> 00:06:49.279 
in this pan so I got to go take it to

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:51.459 
in this pan so I got to go take it to
the<00:06:49.369> auto<00:06:49.490> parts<00:06:49.610> store<00:06:49.909> tomorrow<00:06:50.209> and<00:06:50.539> get

00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:51.469 
the auto parts store tomorrow and get

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:54.219 
the auto parts store tomorrow and get
them<00:06:51.589> to<00:06:51.709> drain<00:06:51.979> it<00:06:52.159> and<00:06:52.839> then<00:06:53.839> I<00:06:53.869> can<00:06:54.050> do<00:06:54.139> the

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:54.229 
them to drain it and then I can do the

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:57.159 
them to drain it and then I can do the
coolant<00:06:54.589> but<00:06:55.209> that<00:06:56.209> doesn't<00:06:56.449> mean<00:06:56.569> I<00:06:56.899> can't

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:57.169 
coolant but that doesn't mean I can't

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:58.989 
coolant but that doesn't mean I can't
start<00:06:57.409> taking<00:06:57.649> apart<00:06:57.919> the<00:06:58.069> top<00:06:58.279> end<00:06:58.519> up<00:06:58.729> here

00:06:58.989 --> 00:06:58.999 
start taking apart the top end up here

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:01.480 
start taking apart the top end up here
with<00:06:59.180> all<00:06:59.719> this<00:07:00.019> you<00:07:00.769> know<00:07:00.889> air<00:07:01.129> intake

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.490 
with all this you know air intake

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.659 
with all this you know air intake
ducting<00:07:02.029> and<00:07:02.059> such<00:07:02.409> so<00:07:03.409> that's<00:07:03.800> what<00:07:04.009> I'll<00:07:04.159> get

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:04.669 
ducting and such so that's what I'll get

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:07.689 
ducting and such so that's what I'll get
to<00:07:04.789> doing<00:07:05.259> so<00:07:06.259> I<00:07:06.289> got<00:07:06.469> some<00:07:06.740> more<00:07:06.919> plastic<00:07:07.219> bits

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:07.699 
to doing so I got some more plastic bits

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:10.689 
to doing so I got some more plastic bits
that<00:07:07.819> won't<00:07:07.999> be<00:07:08.089> needing<00:07:08.419> but<00:07:09.349> I<00:07:09.889> will<00:07:10.550> be

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:10.699 
that won't be needing but I will be

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:13.449 
that won't be needing but I will be
needing<00:07:10.879> that<00:07:11.029> and<00:07:11.709> quite<00:07:12.709> a<00:07:12.769> lot<00:07:12.949> more<00:07:13.189> than

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:13.459 
needing that and quite a lot more than

00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:16.359 
needing that and quite a lot more than
actually<00:07:14.199> well<00:07:15.199> this<00:07:15.229> is<00:07:15.469> kind<00:07:15.680> of<00:07:15.740> scary<00:07:15.860> I

00:07:16.359 --> 00:07:16.369 
actually well this is kind of scary I

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:19.179 
actually well this is kind of scary I
wanted<00:07:16.909> to<00:07:16.969> keep<00:07:17.149> the<00:07:17.389> AC<00:07:17.479> compressor<00:07:18.079> and<00:07:18.559> the

00:07:19.179 --> 00:07:19.189 
wanted to keep the AC compressor and the

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:21.790 
wanted to keep the AC compressor and the
alternator<00:07:19.759> so<00:07:20.120> I<00:07:20.149> had<00:07:20.269> to<00:07:20.360> take<00:07:20.539> off<00:07:20.779> the<00:07:21.649> belt

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:21.800 
alternator so I had to take off the belt

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.490 
alternator so I had to take off the belt

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.030 
tensioner
I<00:07:22.530> hope<00:07:23.340> you<00:07:23.430> can<00:07:23.580> see<00:07:23.760> down<00:07:23.940> in<00:07:24.150> there

apparently see I didn't know much about
belt<00:07:27.660> tensioners<00:07:28.050> apparently<00:07:28.500> is<00:07:28.560> a<00:07:28.620> big

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 
belt tensioners apparently is a big
