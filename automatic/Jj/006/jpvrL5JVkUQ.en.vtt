critical for muscle growth right so you

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.550 
critical for muscle growth right so you

there no no the abrasion amino acids
aren't<00:01:53.100> pre<00:01:53.310> Jim<00:01:53.840> because<00:01:54.840> they're<00:01:54.990> used<00:01:55.200> for

so<00:02:04.680> what<00:02:05.640> do<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.909> need<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.299> do<00:02:06.479> post-workout

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
so what do you need to do post-workout

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.219 
so what do you need to do post-workout
you<00:02:08.310> need<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.489> protein<00:02:08.940> shake<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.080> always

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
you need a protein shake and I always

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.059 
you need a protein shake and I always
recommend

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069

I<00:02:21.030> recommend<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:22.140> way<00:02:22.829> casein<00:02:23.340> blend<00:02:23.609> we<00:02:23.819> used

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:23.969 
I recommend a way casein blend we used

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:25.880 
I recommend a way casein blend we used

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
to think the way was you know it is the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.289 
to think the way was you know it is the
most<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.219> ABAB<00:02:26.459> because<00:02:26.700> really<00:02:26.879> spikes

most in ABAB because really spikes

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
you add case into that way it keeps that

punty that come that you can find look
up<00:04:23.410> beating<00:04:24.090> betaine<00:04:25.090> is<00:04:25.450> is<00:04:26.790> the<00:04:27.790> hottest

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
up beating betaine is is the hottest

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.330 
up beating betaine is is the hottest
sound<00:04:28.870> well<00:04:29.140> it's<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.650> hottest<00:04:29.830> supplement

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
sound well it's the hottest supplement

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.950 
sound well it's the hottest supplement
right<00:04:30.400> now<00:04:30.550> but<00:04:30.730> it's<00:04:30.850> very<00:04:31.180> hot<00:04:31.510> something

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
right now but it's very hot something

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.690 
right now but it's very hot something
because<00:04:32.230> we're<00:04:32.560> finding<00:04:32.800> out<00:04:33.010> so<00:04:33.250> much<00:04:33.400> about

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
because we're finding out so much about

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.460 
because we're finding out so much about
it<00:04:33.850> I've<00:04:33.940> been<00:04:33.970> recommending<00:04:34.360> beating<00:04:35.260> for

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
it I've been recommending beating for

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.990 
it I've been recommending beating for
quite<00:04:35.710> a<00:04:35.740> while<00:04:35.980> because<00:04:36.310> of<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.640> research

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
quite a while because of the research

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.960 
quite a while because of the research
that's<00:04:37.570> been<00:04:37.810> done<00:04:37.870> showing<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:39.460> enhances

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
that's been done showing it enhances

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.480 
that's been done showing it enhances
muscle<00:04:40.260> strength<00:04:41.260> power<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:41.950> now<00:04:42.100> we're

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
muscle strength power and now we're

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.800 
muscle strength power and now we're
seeing<00:04:42.670> muscle<00:04:43.060> growth<00:04:43.210> and<00:04:43.540> I've<00:04:43.660> been

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
seeing muscle growth and I've been

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.330 
seeing muscle growth and I've been
seeing<00:04:44.080> this<00:04:44.200> in<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.410> gym<00:04:44.650> and<00:04:44.800> thousands

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
seeing this in the gym and thousands

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.610 
seeing this in the gym and thousands
thousands<00:04:46.180> of<00:04:46.300> people<00:04:46.660> are<00:04:47.170> getting<00:04:47.500> results

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
thousands of people are getting results

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.380 
thousands of people are getting results
with<00:04:47.980> beacon<00:04:48.430> so<00:04:48.610> make<00:04:48.790> sure<00:04:48.820> you<00:04:49.090> get<00:04:49.210> your

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
with beacon so make sure you get your

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.200 
with beacon so make sure you get your
beat<00:04:49.570> gain<00:04:50.040> post-workout<00:04:51.040> and<00:04:51.310> then<00:04:51.670> there's

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
beat gain post-workout and then there's

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.590 
beat gain post-workout and then there's
also<00:04:52.390> in<00:04:52.750> post<00:04:52.990> gym<00:04:53.940> dextrose<00:04:54.970> but<00:04:55.270> what<00:04:55.450> I've

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
also in post gym dextrose but what I've

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.530 
also in post gym dextrose but what I've
got<00:04:55.870> is<00:04:56.230> I've<00:04:56.500> got<00:04:56.860> the<00:04:57.430> active<00:04:57.850> ingredients

was<00:05:59.979> also<00:06:00.220> gonna<00:06:00.370> enhance<00:06:00.640> their<00:06:01.030> uptake<00:06:01.450> as

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
was also gonna enhance their uptake as

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.740 
was also gonna enhance their uptake as
well<00:06:02.200> you<00:06:03.130> want<00:06:03.280> to<00:06:03.400> get<00:06:03.550> that<00:06:03.700> and<00:06:04.150> then<00:06:04.419> also

well you want to get that and then also

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.150 
well you want to get that and then also
you<00:06:04.990> want<00:06:05.229> to<00:06:05.260> replenish<00:06:05.530> the<00:06:05.890> muscle
