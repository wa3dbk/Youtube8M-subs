touch in it right here so what I do is I

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.180 
touch in it right here so what I do is I
just<00:04:21.530> take<00:04:21.799> big<00:04:22.070> sections<00:04:22.669> it

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190

like this and that helps me keep the
curls<00:04:28.040> like<00:04:29.040> that<00:04:29.340> instead<00:04:29.700> of<00:04:29.910> them<00:04:30.030> getting

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210

I'll curl it together but I don't curl
it<00:05:46.050> all<00:05:46.260> the<00:05:46.710> way<00:05:46.830> through<00:05:46.860> a<00:05:47.460> curl<00:05:48.000> like<00:05:48.270> from

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
it all the way through a curl like from

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.780 
it all the way through a curl like from
the<00:05:48.930> root<00:05:49.169> so<00:05:49.710> probably<00:05:50.010> like<00:05:50.130> half<00:05:50.490> of<00:05:50.700> the

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
the root so probably like half of the

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.300 
the root so probably like half of the
hair<00:05:51.000> so<00:05:51.810> it<00:05:51.960> still<00:05:52.200> has<00:05:52.230> the<00:05:52.680> natural<00:05:52.860> curl

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
hair so it still has the natural curl

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.310 
hair so it still has the natural curl
pattern<00:05:53.730> at<00:05:53.880> the<00:05:53.910> ends<00:05:54.300> of<00:05:54.390> the<00:05:54.450> hair<00:05:54.660> so<00:05:54.990> good

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
pattern at the ends of the hair so good

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.090 
pattern at the ends of the hair so good
and<00:05:55.650> easier<00:05:56.070> so<00:05:56.970> yeah<00:05:57.150> so<00:05:57.570> I<00:05:58.169> think<00:05:58.680> that's<00:05:58.950> all

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
and easier so yeah so I think that's all

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.740 
and easier so yeah so I think that's all
about<00:05:59.130> it<00:05:59.460> so<00:05:59.820> far<00:06:00.060> it's<00:06:00.180> what<00:06:00.330> they<00:06:00.419> come<00:06:00.600> and

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
about it so far it's what they come and

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.020 
about it so far it's what they come and
show<00:06:00.870> you<00:06:00.930> guys<00:06:01.200> this<00:06:01.860> hair<00:06:02.190> I<00:06:02.430> really<00:06:02.790> really
