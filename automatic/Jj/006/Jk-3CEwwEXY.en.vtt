00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.420 

ok<00:01:14.610> now<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.420> stretch<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.259> awkward<00:01:16.920> which

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
ok now if this stretch is awkward which

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.219 
ok now if this stretch is awkward which
I<00:01:17.610> assume<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.360> will<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.540> especially<00:01:18.930> if<00:01:19.140> you

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
I assume it will be especially if you

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.380 
I assume it will be especially if you
haven't<00:01:19.439> been<00:01:19.500> playing<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.890> long<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.390> really

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
haven't been playing that long I really

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.999 
haven't been playing that long I really
use<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.689> chord<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> lot<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.290> like<00:01:22.470> more<00:01:22.710> jazzy

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.310 
use this chord a lot in like more jazzy
stuff<00:01:23.400> but<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.119> could<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.299> play<00:01:25.080> that

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
stuff but you could just play that

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.850 
stuff but you could just play that
because<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.220> D<00:01:26.430> string<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.240> there
