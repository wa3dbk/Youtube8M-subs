00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
three-fourths of the game okay so we're

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.900 
three-fourths of the game okay so we're
taking<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.599> pretty<00:00:27.750> big<00:00:27.869> beating<00:00:28.410> right<00:00:28.680> now<00:00:28.910> we

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
taking a pretty big beating right now we

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.100 
taking a pretty big beating right now we
have<00:00:30.179> only<00:00:30.390> 78<00:00:30.990> points<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.650> they<00:00:31.710> have<00:00:31.800> 122

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
have only 78 points and they have 122

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.690 
have only 78 points and they have 122
which<00:00:34.110> means<00:00:34.410> we're<00:00:34.739> really<00:00:35.130> getting<00:00:35.430> our

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
which means we're really getting our

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.819

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
black ops in my opinion you know you can

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.380 
black ops in my opinion you know you can
be<00:02:13.720> aggressive<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:15.610> don't<00:02:15.820> have<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.030> be<00:02:16.150> as

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
be aggressive you don't have to be as

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.450 
be aggressive you don't have to be as
like<00:02:17.050> a<00:02:17.110> defensive<00:02:17.770> and<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.100> don't<00:02:18.250> have<00:02:18.310> to

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
like a defensive and you don't have to

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.730 
like a defensive and you don't have to
hold<00:02:18.670> back<00:02:18.790> like<00:02:19.600> you<00:02:19.750> would<00:02:19.870> have<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.260> win<00:02:20.560> if

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740

you<00:02:20.770> add<00:02:21.010> like<00:02:21.190> l96a1<00:02:22.110> but<00:02:23.110> you<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.590> only<00:02:23.890> bad

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
you add like l96a1 but you the only bad

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.280 
you add like l96a1 but you the only bad
thing<00:02:24.100> is<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.580> can't<00:02:24.880> be<00:02:25.060> as<00:02:25.240> offensive<00:02:25.840> as

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
thing is you can't be as offensive as

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
rifles really that's the most offensive
