No<00:03:14.209> may<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.239> ask<00:03:15.540> what's<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.110> point<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:17.100> doing

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
No may I ask what's the point of doing

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.210 
No may I ask what's the point of doing
it<00:03:18.180> all<00:03:18.329> in<00:03:18.510> one<00:03:18.720> continuous<00:03:19.620> take<00:03:19.890> off<00:03:20.010> doing

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
it all in one continuous take off doing

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.860 
it all in one continuous take off doing
some<00:03:20.340> research<00:03:20.459> yesterday<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.359> it<00:03:21.630> said

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
some research yesterday and it said

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.840 
some research yesterday and it said
because<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.380> audience<00:03:22.709> feel<00:03:23.160> like<00:03:23.430> they're

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
because the audience feel like they're

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.300 
because the audience feel like they're
more<00:03:24.260> part<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.410> it<00:03:25.530> because<00:03:25.650> they<00:03:25.890> live<00:03:26.070> every

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
more part of it because they live every

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.160 
more part of it because they live every
minute<00:03:26.700> with<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:26.910> is<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.359> is<00:03:27.570> that<00:03:27.600> right<00:03:28.019> I

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
minute with you is that is that right I

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.680 
minute with you is that is that right I
guess<00:03:28.350> because<00:03:28.560> whether<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.880> concept<00:03:30.359> is<00:03:30.480> if

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
guess because whether the concept is if

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.930 
guess because whether the concept is if
it's<00:03:30.870> done<00:03:31.109> in<00:03:31.260> real<00:03:31.500> time<00:03:31.890> then<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:32.609> sort<00:03:32.850> of

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
it's done in real time then you sort of

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.610 
it's done in real time then you sort of
feel<00:03:33.090> like<00:03:33.299> you're<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.600> sixth<00:03:33.989> person<00:03:34.230> in<00:03:34.530> the

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
feel like you're the sixth person in the

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.770 
feel like you're the sixth person in the
house<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:35.489> it's<00:03:35.609> kind<00:03:35.850> of<00:03:35.880> happening<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.570> you

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
house and it's kind of happening to you

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.400 
house and it's kind of happening to you
as<00:03:37.079> you<00:03:38.070> watch<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.310> you're<00:03:38.700> sort<00:03:38.880> of<00:03:39.019> as<00:03:40.019> it

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
as you watch it you're sort of as it

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.430 
as you watch it you're sort of as it
