00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
is very good indeed to Fabregas that's

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.699 
is very good indeed to Fabregas that's
got<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.000> be<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.120> foul<00:03:18.359> surely<00:03:18.900> it's<00:03:19.109> a<00:03:19.200> free<00:03:19.470> kick

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
got to be a foul surely it's a free kick

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.569 
got to be a foul surely it's a free kick
for<00:03:19.859> Chelsea<00:03:21.109> just<00:03:22.109> before<00:03:22.470> half-time<00:03:22.680> Oscar

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
for Chelsea just before half-time Oscar

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.460 
for Chelsea just before half-time Oscar
is<00:03:23.760> going<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.120> take<00:03:24.299> it<00:03:24.450> quickly<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.870> think<00:03:25.140> to

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
is going to take it quickly I think to

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.150 
is going to take it quickly I think to
Diego<00:03:25.859> Costa<00:03:26.280> again<00:03:26.549> Kosta<00:03:26.970> bends<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:27.450> off

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
Diego Costa again Kosta bends it off

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.259 
Diego Costa again Kosta bends it off
would<00:03:29.160> have<00:03:29.340> been<00:03:29.459> a<00:03:29.489> first-half<00:03:30.060> hat-trick

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
would have been a first-half hat-trick

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.440 
would have been a first-half hat-trick
for<00:03:30.570> Diego<00:03:31.079> Costa<00:03:31.620> but<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.489> finish<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:33.090> just

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
for Diego Costa but the finish is just

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.349 
for Diego Costa but the finish is just
wide<00:03:33.720> of<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:34.049> target<00:03:37.640> all<00:03:38.640> right<00:03:38.820> so<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.180> soon

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
wide of the target all right so it soon

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.060 
wide of the target all right so it soon
enough<00:03:39.480> at<00:03:39.720> halftime<00:03:39.900> this<00:03:40.470> is<00:03:40.620> very<00:03:40.829> good

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
enough at halftime this is very good

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.710 
enough at halftime this is very good
indeed<00:03:41.519> we've<00:03:41.760> dominated<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.329> match<00:03:42.510> the
