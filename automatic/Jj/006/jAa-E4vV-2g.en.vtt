and<00:02:14.140> it<00:02:14.890> clearly<00:02:15.130> shows<00:02:15.490> that<00:02:15.520> it<00:02:15.820> does<00:02:15.970> go<00:02:16.210> on

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
and it clearly shows that it does go on

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.190 
and it clearly shows that it does go on
the<00:02:17.340> backside<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:19.180> flywheel<00:02:19.420> this<00:02:19.810> is<00:02:19.990> the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
the backside of the flywheel this is the

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.980 
the backside of the flywheel this is the
front<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.070> crank<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:22.120> is<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.420> backside

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
front of the crank this is the backside

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.370 
front of the crank this is the backside
of<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.620> flywheel<00:02:24.310> which<00:02:24.550> would<00:02:24.820> be<00:02:25.720> facing

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
of the flywheel which would be facing

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.110 
of the flywheel which would be facing
into<00:02:26.680> there<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.780> there<00:02:28.780> are<00:02:28.810> no<00:02:29.190> nuts<00:02:30.190> lock

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
into there and there are no nuts lock

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.220 
into there and there are no nuts lock
washers<00:02:31.750> of<00:02:31.990> any<00:02:32.140> kind<00:02:33.209> I'm<00:02:34.209> real<00:02:34.720> organized

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
washers of any kind I'm real organized

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.280 
washers of any kind I'm real organized
when<00:02:35.440> I<00:02:35.530> tear<00:02:35.770> something<00:02:36.040> apart<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:36.580> have<00:02:36.610> a<00:02:37.450> lot

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
when I tear something apart I have a lot

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.590 
when I tear something apart I have a lot
of<00:02:38.320> Ziploc<00:02:38.830> bags<00:02:39.160> I<00:02:39.550> throw<00:02:39.790> parts<00:02:40.180> into<00:02:40.570> I

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
of Ziploc bags I throw parts into I

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.290 
of Ziploc bags I throw parts into I
label<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.380> I<00:02:41.620> know<00:02:42.340> I'm<00:02:42.640> not<00:02:42.820> missing<00:02:43.180> anything

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
label it I know I'm not missing anything

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.100 
label it I know I'm not missing anything
so<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:44.110> can't<00:02:44.650> figure<00:02:44.860> out<00:02:45.510> for<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.600> life<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:46.930> me

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
so I can't figure out for the life of me

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.520 
so I can't figure out for the life of me
why<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:47.950> did<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.430> now<00:02:48.610> I<00:02:48.670> can<00:02:49.050> remedy<00:02:50.050> that<00:02:50.500> I

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
why it did that now I can remedy that I

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.699 
why it did that now I can remedy that I
mean<00:02:50.830> I<00:02:50.890> can<00:02:51.100> put<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.810> lock<00:02:52.810> washer<00:02:53.080> or<00:02:53.500> some

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
mean I can put a lock washer or some

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.650 
mean I can put a lock washer or some
kind<00:02:53.920> of<00:02:53.950> washer<00:02:54.340> on<00:02:54.489> there<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.270> take<00:02:55.480> up

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
kind of washer on there to to take up

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.199 
kind of washer on there to to take up
that<00:02:55.840> space<00:02:56.170> when<00:02:56.440> I<00:02:56.530> go<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.739> put<00:02:56.980> in<00:02:57.100> new<00:02:57.940> ones

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
that space when I go to put in new ones

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.370 
that space when I go to put in new ones
but<00:02:59.820> yeah<00:03:00.820> I<00:03:00.850> don't<00:03:01.000> know<00:03:01.209> now<00:03:01.450> two<00:03:02.080> good

things came out of this these three

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.960 
things came out of this these three
bullet<00:03:07.360> holes<00:03:07.390> here<00:03:07.780> actually<00:03:08.049> stripped<00:03:08.650> to

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
bullet holes here actually stripped to

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.759

wash<00:03:09.970> let<00:03:10.299> me<00:03:10.420> repeat<00:03:10.690> that<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:11.230> holes<00:03:11.470> aren't

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
wash let me repeat that the holes aren't

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.479 
wash let me repeat that the holes aren't

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
fact it goes in very nicely it's not

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.180 
fact it goes in very nicely it's not
messed<00:03:28.390> up<00:03:28.600> at<00:03:28.750> all<00:03:28.900> these<00:03:29.110> these<00:03:29.530> threads<00:03:29.950> in

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
messed up at all these these threads in

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.320 
messed up at all these these threads in
the<00:03:30.400> holes<00:03:30.670> are<00:03:31.090> fine<00:03:31.900> so<00:03:32.489> this<00:03:33.489> must<00:03:33.790> be<00:03:33.940> awful

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
the holes are fine so this must be awful

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.360 
the holes are fine so this must be awful
hard<00:03:34.510> in<00:03:34.780> here<00:03:34.989> and<00:03:35.230> these<00:03:35.470> bolts<00:03:35.920> even<00:03:36.250> though

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
hard in here and these bolts even though

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.180 
hard in here and these bolts even though
they<00:03:36.580> are<00:03:36.760> extremely<00:03:37.209> hard<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:38.500> chisel<00:03:38.980> and

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
they are extremely hard to chisel and

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.940 
they are extremely hard to chisel and
drill<00:03:39.489> and<00:03:39.760> everything<00:03:40.030> must<00:03:40.480> be<00:03:40.630> softer<00:03:41.260> than

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
drill and everything must be softer than

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.690 
drill and everything must be softer than
that<00:03:42.430> cast<00:03:42.760> iron<00:03:43.030> crank<00:03:44.220> that's<00:03:45.220> one<00:03:45.489> good

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
that cast iron crank that's one good

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.310 
that cast iron crank that's one good
thing<00:03:45.730> I<00:03:46.090> don't<00:03:46.299> think<00:03:46.510> I'll<00:03:46.630> have<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.930> repair

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
thing I don't think I'll have to repair

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.110 
thing I don't think I'll have to repair
these<00:03:47.530> I'll<00:03:47.860> just<00:03:48.040> have<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.340> get<00:03:48.519> new<00:03:48.700> bolts

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
these I'll just have to get new bolts

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.080 
these I'll just have to get new bolts
but<00:03:49.840> here's<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.380> dilemma<00:03:50.530> right<00:03:50.860> now<00:03:51.060> when<00:03:52.060> I

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
but here's the dilemma right now when I

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.220 
but here's the dilemma right now when I
cut<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:54.000> head<00:03:55.000> off<00:03:55.060> of<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.450> bolt<00:03:55.750> I<00:03:55.930> was<00:03:56.110> able

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
cut the head off of the bolt I was able

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.770 
cut the head off of the bolt I was able
to<00:03:56.380> get<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.620> flywheel<00:03:57.130> off<00:03:57.780> someone

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
to get the flywheel off someone

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.920 
to get the flywheel off someone
recommended<00:03:59.440> me<00:03:59.940> welding<00:04:00.940> something<00:04:01.450> to<00:04:01.690> that

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
recommended me welding something to that

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.460 
recommended me welding something to that
and<00:04:02.230> then<00:04:02.920> I<00:04:03.040> could<00:04:03.250> hit<00:04:03.760> out<00:04:04.000> with<00:04:04.900> a<00:04:04.930> hammer

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.630 

that<00:04:08.100> doesn't<00:04:08.400> sound<00:04:08.580> like<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:08.730> bad<00:04:08.970> idea<00:04:10.640> I'm

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
that doesn't sound like a bad idea I'm

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.830 
that doesn't sound like a bad idea I'm
just<00:04:12.030> worried<00:04:12.420> that<00:04:13.580> for<00:04:14.580> some<00:04:15.180> reason<00:04:15.210> if<00:04:15.690> I

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
just worried that for some reason if I

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.170 
just worried that for some reason if I
would<00:04:16.019> do<00:04:16.230> that<00:04:16.470> if<00:04:16.739> these<00:04:16.980> treads<00:04:17.489> are<00:04:17.790> okay

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
would do that if these treads are okay

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.229 
would do that if these treads are okay
in<00:04:18.329> the<00:04:18.420> hole<00:04:18.660> I<00:04:18.900> might<00:04:19.799> damage<00:04:20.130> them<00:04:20.459> I<00:04:20.730> don't

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
in the hole I might damage them I don't

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.630 
in the hole I might damage them I don't
know<00:04:21.390> I<00:04:21.630> mean<00:04:21.780> I<00:04:21.840> can<00:04:22.019> I'll<00:04:22.980> probably<00:04:23.340> have<00:04:23.610> to

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
know I mean I can I'll probably have to

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.190 
know I mean I can I'll probably have to
fix<00:04:24.000> this<00:04:24.150> is<00:04:24.360> really<00:04:24.660> bad<00:04:24.840> this<00:04:25.020> is<00:04:25.170> really

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
fix this is really bad this is really
