to properly folder pair jeans by first

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.050 
to properly folder pair jeans by first

determining what type of jeans they are

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.110 
determining what type of jeans they are
by<00:03:34.720> lining<00:03:35.079> up<00:03:35.319> the<00:03:35.379> scenes<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:36.040> by<00:03:36.760> actually

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
by lining up the scenes and by actually

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.089 
by lining up the scenes and by actually
showing<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.540> 14<00:03:37.810> technique<00:03:38.110> so<00:03:38.799> hopefully<00:03:39.069> i

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
showing the 14 technique so hopefully i

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.180 
showing the 14 technique so hopefully i
only<00:03:39.310> use<00:03:39.459> this<00:03:39.579> in<00:03:39.760> your<00:03:39.849> everyday<00:03:40.090> life
