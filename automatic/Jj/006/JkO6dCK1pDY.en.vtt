here<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.470> only<00:00:07.710> shot<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.220> cold<00:00:08.429> start<00:00:08.700> we

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
here the only shot of a cold start we

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.740 
here the only shot of a cold start we
have<00:00:08.940> you'll<00:00:09.150> see<00:00:09.269> it's<00:00:09.389> in<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.480> garage

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
have you'll see it's in the garage

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.080 
have you'll see it's in the garage
is<00:00:10.019> that<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.590> cycle<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.340> injectors<00:00:11.790> three

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
is that I cycle the injectors three

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.430 
is that I cycle the injectors three
times<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.480> can<00:00:12.599> count<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.840> lights<00:00:13.019> coming<00:00:13.259> on

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
times you can count the lights coming on

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.609 
times you can count the lights coming on
and<00:00:13.710> I'm<00:00:14.490> not<00:00:14.759> sure<00:00:15.000> why<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.719> helps<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.080> start<00:00:16.410> a

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
and I'm not sure why it helps it start a

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.040 
and I'm not sure why it helps it start a
lot<00:00:16.949> smoother<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.640> doesn't<00:00:17.940> need<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.240> but<00:00:18.779> it's

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
lot smoother it doesn't need it but it's

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.779 
lot smoother it doesn't need it but it's
a<00:00:19.140> lot<00:00:19.260> better<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:20.220> don't<00:00:20.340> know<00:00:20.520> if<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:20.760> is

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
a lot better and I don't know if this is

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.250 
a lot better and I don't know if this is
all<00:00:20.939> during<00:00:21.359> goes<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:21.660> age<00:00:21.869> I've<00:00:22.140> only

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260

driven<00:00:22.439> one<00:00:22.769> other<00:00:22.920> one<00:00:23.130> but<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.910> drove<00:00:24.420> that

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
driven one other one but I drove that

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.320

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.840 
sold but it is was in three did very
distinct<00:00:37.860> generations<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:38.670> tell<00:00:38.760> them

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
distinct generations you can tell them

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.610 
distinct generations you can tell them
apart<00:00:38.969> super<00:00:39.420> easily<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> first

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
apart super easily this is a first

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.500 
apart super easily this is a first
generation<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.430> know<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.640> looks<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.149> lot

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
generation and you know it looks a lot

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.410 
generation and you know it looks a lot
like<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:43.079> similar<00:00:43.739> year<00:00:43.980> Dodge<00:00:44.309> Dakota<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
like a similar year Dodge Dakota the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.510 
like a similar year Dodge Dakota the
front<00:00:45.690> end<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.110> identical<00:00:46.739> obviously<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
front end is identical obviously the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.100 
front end is identical obviously the
back<00:00:47.670> isn't<00:00:47.879> because<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.239> an<00:00:48.329> SUV<00:00:48.480> but<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
back isn't because it's an SUV but the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.560 
back isn't because it's an SUV but the
styling<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.770> pretty<00:00:50.460> much<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.789> same<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.210> then

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
styling is pretty much the same and then

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.180 
styling is pretty much the same and then
the<00:00:51.780> second<00:00:52.170> generation<00:00:52.440> which<00:00:52.800> started<00:00:53.100> in

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
the second generation which started in

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.689 
the second generation which started in
2004<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> lot<00:00:54.809> like<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.289> mid<00:00:55.559> 2000s<00:00:56.430> Ram

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
2004 was a lot like the mid 2000s Ram

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.580 
2004 was a lot like the mid 2000s Ram
trucks<00:00:57.180> which<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.960> not<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.289> trucks

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
trucks which it's not that the trucks

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.069 
trucks which it's not that the trucks
don't<00:00:58.800> look<00:00:58.949> good<00:00:59.129> it's<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.239> look<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.840> at

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
don't look good it's that the look in at

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.930 
don't look good it's that the look in at
least<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.379> my<00:01:01.530> opinion<00:01:01.649> did<00:01:02.070> not<00:01:02.309> translate

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
least in my opinion did not translate

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.210 
least in my opinion did not translate
over<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.809> Durango<00:01:04.140> very<00:01:04.320> well<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:05.040> was

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
over to the Durango very well it was

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.670 
over to the Durango very well it was
just<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.700> don't<00:01:06.570> know<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:06.869> some<00:01:07.439> about<00:01:07.619> that

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
just I don't know but some about that

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.440 
just I don't know but some about that
car<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.369> hideous<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.970> then<00:01:09.210> there<00:01:09.330> was

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
car it's just hideous and then there was

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.789

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
so you could look up how big it is and

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.190 
so you could look up how big it is and
you'd<00:02:05.579> find<00:02:05.759> out<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.119> has<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.450> 8<00:02:06.630> cubic<00:02:06.960> feet<00:02:07.140> of

CRX we tested but that's not really a

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
front in the back and they're heated and

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.240 
front in the back and they're heated and
power<00:04:38.360> so<00:04:38.780> they're<00:04:38.900> very<00:04:38.930> adjustable<00:04:39.320> and<00:04:39.800> the

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
power so they're very adjustable and the

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.710 
power so they're very adjustable and the
heat<00:04:40.400> up<00:04:40.520> pretty<00:04:40.760> quickly<00:04:41.030> and<00:04:41.390> there's<00:04:41.570> two

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
heat up pretty quickly and there's two

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.290 
heat up pretty quickly and there's two
settings<00:04:42.110> for<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:42.620> heat<00:04:42.800> but<00:04:43.460> I<00:04:43.700> don't<00:04:44.120> think

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
settings for the heat but I don't think

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.120 
settings for the heat but I don't think
the<00:04:44.510> lower<00:04:44.990> setting<00:04:45.470> has<00:04:45.560> ever<00:04:45.740> been<00:04:45.920> turned

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
the lower setting has ever been turned

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.640 
the lower setting has ever been turned
on<00:04:46.310> because<00:04:46.580> if<00:04:46.850> it's<00:04:47.030> that<00:04:47.240> cold<00:04:47.540> well<00:04:48.290> just

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650
