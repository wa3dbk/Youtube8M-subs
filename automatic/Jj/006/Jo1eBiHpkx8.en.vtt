assuming<00:02:03.320> that<00:02:03.440> brings<00:02:03.620> a<00:02:03.710> lot<00:02:03.800> of<00:02:03.860> confidence

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
assuming that brings a lot of confidence

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.370 
assuming that brings a lot of confidence
to<00:02:04.460> play<00:02:04.640> as<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.880> player<00:02:05.090> with<00:02:05.990> him<00:02:06.170> and

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
to play as the player with him and

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.800 
to play as the player with him and
around<00:02:06.620> him<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.130> he's<00:02:07.970> certainly<00:02:08.269> a<00:02:08.360> guy<00:02:08.569> that

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
around him so he's certainly a guy that

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.419 
around him so he's certainly a guy that
I<00:02:08.959> think<00:02:09.289> all<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.560> fans<00:02:09.769> that<00:02:09.920> I<00:02:10.039> just<00:02:10.250> said

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
I think all the fans that I just said

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.750 
I think all the fans that I just said
