00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.770
 Lately it's like I am 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.910
 but at the bottom of the barrel scratch something 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.830
 bad games are concerned 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.570
 Well, at least these games too 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.759
 partly for that I almost 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.330
 again on triple a title woman is yes 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.570
 also something 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.490
 this time it's about dust softship eworld 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.510
 a game which is just like that 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.210
 can describe 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.050
 The game is being developed on java 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.130
 see what it is and give it power 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:31.619
 should say something amazingly precise 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.940
 of paul a minecraft sound is natural 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.550
 what we still lack 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.700
 There are in the official steam trailer 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.110
 a nasal smiley gives the logo looks 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.660
 after my amateurish cultivation 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.440
 now much more appealing and it costs 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.360
 eight euros 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.250
 No worthwhile investment so much 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.750
 force already in advance shit like 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.700
 competent this developer too 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.860
 come over mark the title is there 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.320
 still the appendage beta completely without 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.940
 alexis in white on the target page or 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.649
 a note on what features yet 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.600
 are missing or which will follow 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.829
 but as professional as at 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.129
 the type of into the bore is 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.210
 maybe asking too much 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.930
 Let's start the game and go 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.090
 directly into the setting 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.060
 why is I ever expect there 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.530
 love you so scarce game times 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.270
 just restart and now off in the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.049
 attitude around us the extensive 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.549
 shadow options copyright 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.159
 1996 to 2014 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.080
 Whether that's his age is the first task 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.030
 there is a map in a certain 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.710
 Generate size to let something loud 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.070
 play for just an hour 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.070
 can last exciting 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.520
 then tried the normal size 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.320
 So finally in the world of minecraft 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.210
 arrived with tutorial 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.920
 I immediately welcomed the walls 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.810
 need to leave the world again 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.729
 but at least you start directly with 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.799
 Tool only real with again 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.470
 repeated wood textures and hands the 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.149
 anything but healthy looking knock 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.560
 So we on wood or dirt something 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.509
 at the same time, better and worse 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.670
 looks like in the template the 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.740
 beautiful ascii display presents though 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.179
 the state of the folded material star 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.459
 we have enough 0 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.720
 the collected wood we met around us 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.370
 a horrible inventory and 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.920
 crafting menu the first weapon together 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.840
 a stock a stock you can by the way 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.799
 also cram build a bigger fight 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.019
 is as it should be no but 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:30.560
 Congratulations a bunch of dirt and 0 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.750
 entertainment beautiful 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.280
 So off to the wilderness to explore 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.500
 what we find everything 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.760
 but do not expect them too much 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.799
 then the world at certain points 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.299
 from time to time to recharge the needs 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.980
 It would almost be alright that 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.840
 not every few hundred meters happen 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.930
 one would have to partially against invisible 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.859
 walls run for several seconds and 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.859
 that again and again 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:03.290
 goes through something then arise the 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.450
 Abnormal anomalies but a lot 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.010
 is more interesting than anything 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.170
 others what exists in this game 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.640
 the same thing happens in caves though 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.760
 So you look for an exit and 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.430
 Suddenly, this almost disappears 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.470
 Creepy also the water can be 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.940
 research to avoid drowning 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.880
 But you should protect yourself first 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.750
 a diving suit forces 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.330
 Sorry that 's her 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.340
 fits her double play but I am 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.410
 no, there you just under water 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.320
 one and the water level is over 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.150
 you underwater, so to speak 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.310
 That's the way they have rapture 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.350
 bioshock built and everyone else thought 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.270
 that would have been complicated construction project 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.830
 according to steam description, there are also 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.970
 I am not yet an opponent 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.830
 sure if the developer so easy 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.080
 only the frame rate means which constant 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.450
 between 10 and 15 pictures per second 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.130
 sticks a playable frame rate is 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.020
 anyway completely overrated 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.230
 the less pictures you get from this game 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.730
 per second must see the better 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.520
 but no, there are actually adversaries 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.140
 as well as plush I am almost in two colors 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.970
 be disgusting the type could animate 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.530
 but also crocodiles in the water 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.489
 climb each other or frogs 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.080
 which nobody needs to climb 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.790
 the fighting system is everything you need 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.500
 knows about light years ahead 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.270
 Do you always find it stupid that you 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.130
 can hit with blows and it 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.380
 is reasonably comprehensible if one 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.820
 opponents you met this problem became 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.760
 fixed here finally 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.290
 a big praise to developers i wanted 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.090
 I always froze with pinata 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.740
 knock while absolutely terrible 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.350
 sounddesign my ears to bleed 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.910
 but what should i expect 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.470
 the water sound effects were 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.330
 probably made in the bathtub 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.350
 what also the continuous microphone 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.820
 would explain 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.000
 the rest can not be better 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.000
 his 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.080
 The fight is so terribly lucky 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.470
 you are in front of a small club of stone 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.570
 every danger sure luck had such a thing 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.850
 in combination with HP regeneration and 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.080
 enemies of which one almost perfectly away 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.030
 could run if the game is not 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.490
 overloading would not speak straight 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.580
 for this supposed survival part of the 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.960
 play on the other side nothing 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.970
 speaks for this game 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.450
 it just does not offer anything 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.700
 Qualitative except maybe the point 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.890
 differed in the help menu hello and 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.840
 welcome to goodbye 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.660
 not fun to play 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.070
 ever we were there or so we fly 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.830
 still a bit through the area 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:31.420
 watch the great surroundings and 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:33.070
 fly to the wall of the world a real one 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.780
 good game you have to give 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.730
 and if you do not want to believe me 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.030
 Just look in the games below 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:42.810
 game info.de xt to there always real 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.810
 cool game 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.740
 I have to turn it over for a short time sorry for that 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.470
 such jokes are none 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.910
 can think of and just happen and 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.490
 the great thing is this is a text file 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.840
 if you then make version 2.3 are 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.350
 fixed most bugs 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.350
 or 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.639
 I did not have fun with this 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.419
 singleplayer adventure just wanted to be like this 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.639
 have said 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:13.650
 how is it possible worse than that 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:16.680
 to be alpha version of the template 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.400
 and who asked or still for 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.090
 eight euros 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.699
 Hopefully nobody will feel the future 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.949
 even ask for more 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:28.229
 and still has two positive rating 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:30.180
 because it is still ne beta although it 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:32.280
 the game has been around since september and us 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.300
 still gives not a single plot 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:39.510
 hippie dust softship the world is 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.960
 ridiculously bad I have a now 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.960
 Apple
