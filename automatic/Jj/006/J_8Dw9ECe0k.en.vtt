could use a wood burner and burn the
letters<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.729> because<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.149> was

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
letters in but because this was

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
some glitter I decided to just use a

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.870 
some glitter I decided to just use a
natural-looking<00:02:03.840> white<00:02:04.439> paint<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.159> write

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
the letters on top of each now of course

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.100 
the letters on top of each now of course
you<00:02:08.039> could<00:02:08.220> do<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:08.399> more<00:02:09.179> fancily<00:02:09.660> than<00:02:09.929> I

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
you could do this more fancily than I

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.869 
you could do this more fancily than I
have<00:02:10.349> done<00:02:10.379> but<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:10.890> just<00:02:11.280> sort<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.489> went<00:02:11.610> over

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
have done but I just sort of went over

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.550 
have done but I just sort of went over
it<00:02:12.030> now<00:02:12.480> I'm<00:02:12.540> going<00:02:12.840> over<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.140> again

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
it now I'm going over it again

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.320 
it now I'm going over it again
a<00:02:13.590> second<00:02:14.069> time<00:02:14.250> just<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.670> fill<00:02:14.880> in<00:02:14.970> any<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.209> the

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
a second time just to fill in any of the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.910 
a second time just to fill in any of the
gaps<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.810> make<00:02:15.870> sure<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.230> really<00:02:16.620> is<00:02:16.739> quite

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
gaps and make sure it really is quite

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.070 
gaps and make sure it really is quite
bowled<00:02:17.340> against<00:02:18.120> it

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
bowled against it

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.080 
bowled against it
but<00:02:19.410> that's<00:02:19.739> totally<00:02:20.010> optional<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.849> as<00:02:20.970> you

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
but that's totally optional and as you

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.490 
but that's totally optional and as you
can<00:02:21.239> see<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.480> didn't<00:02:21.660> make<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.780> huge<00:02:22.020> difference

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
can see it didn't make a huge difference

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.990 
can see it didn't make a huge difference
but<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.770> made<00:02:22.890> some<00:02:23.099> of<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.250> letters<00:02:23.520> just<00:02:23.700> pop

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
but it made some of the letters just pop

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.870 
but it made some of the letters just pop
just<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.450> little<00:02:24.690> bit<00:02:24.780> more<00:02:25.459> let<00:02:26.459> those<00:02:26.640> dry

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
just a little bit more let those dry

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.750 
just a little bit more let those dry
then<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:28.170> can<00:02:28.290> add<00:02:28.470> glitter<00:02:28.860> if<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.459> choose

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
then you can add glitter if you choose

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.699 
then you can add glitter if you choose
again<00:02:30.209> this<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.569> totally<00:02:30.930> optional<00:02:31.080> but<00:02:31.500> I

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
again this is totally optional but I

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.650 
again this is totally optional but I
always<00:02:32.190> love<00:02:32.519> an<00:02:32.700> extra<00:02:33.120> little<00:02:33.269> bit<00:02:33.390> of

glitter<00:02:34.110> on<00:02:34.260> things<00:02:34.800> so<00:02:35.069> I'm<00:02:35.220> just<00:02:35.430> going<00:02:35.640> to

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
glitter on things so I'm just going to

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.699 
glitter on things so I'm just going to
take<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.000> paintbrush<00:02:36.360> run<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.170> little<00:02:37.500> bit<00:02:37.620> of

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
take a paintbrush run a little bit of

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.589 
take a paintbrush run a little bit of
glitter<00:02:37.890> over<00:02:38.099> top<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:39.060> white<00:02:39.239> letters

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
glitter over top of the white letters

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.420 
glitter over top of the white letters
now<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.170> can<00:02:40.380> see<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.680> second<00:02:41.069> layer<00:02:41.190> was

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
now you can see the second layer was

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.460 
now you can see the second layer was
still<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.640> little<00:02:41.970> bit<00:02:42.209> wet<00:02:42.450> here<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:42.989> would

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
still a little bit wet here so I would

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.680 
still a little bit wet here so I would
recommend<00:02:43.980> if<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.280> were<00:02:44.430> doing<00:02:44.550> this<00:02:44.819> or<00:02:45.060> if<00:02:45.540> I

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
recommend if you were doing this or if I

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.180 
recommend if you were doing this or if I
were<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.959> do<00:02:46.049> this<00:02:46.140> again<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.650> would<00:02:46.830> let<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.040> dry

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
were to do this again I would let it dry

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.340 
were to do this again I would let it dry
completely<00:02:47.250> but<00:02:48.239> they<00:02:48.330> did<00:02:48.480> not<00:02:48.630> turn<00:02:48.900> out<00:02:49.080> too

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
completely but they did not turn out too

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.410 
completely but they did not turn out too
shabby<00:02:49.680> so<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.519> can<00:02:50.730> see<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:51.000> just<00:02:51.030> adds<00:02:51.299> a

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
shabby so you can see it just adds a

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.020 
shabby so you can see it just adds a
little<00:02:51.569> bit<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.810> sparkle<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.680> letters<00:02:53.030> so

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
little bit of sparkle to the letters so

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.940 
little bit of sparkle to the letters so
here<00:02:54.209> they<00:02:54.360> are<00:02:54.390> completely<00:02:55.200> dry<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.500> let<00:02:55.830> them

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
here they are completely dry I let them

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.150 
here they are completely dry I let them
sit<00:02:56.430> overnight<00:02:56.700> actually<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.620> now<00:02:58.620> I'm<00:02:58.920> going

simple hoop I'm going to start with the
last<00:03:32.940> letter<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.510> make<00:03:33.660> sure<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:34.109> it<00:03:34.290> all

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
last letter to make sure that it all

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.530 
last letter to make sure that it all
sort<00:03:34.859> of<00:03:35.329> flows<00:03:36.329> evenly<00:03:37.019> along<00:03:37.380> my<00:03:37.650> string<00:03:38.160> and

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
sort of flows evenly along my string and

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.490 
sort of flows evenly along my string and
this<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:39.720> what<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:39.930> looked<00:03:40.079> like<00:03:40.109> when<00:03:40.290> it<00:03:40.410> was

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
this is what it looked like when it was

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.259 
this is what it looked like when it was
finished<00:03:40.680> just<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:41.130> simple<00:03:41.549> knot<00:03:41.730> through<00:03:42.239> I

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
finished just a simple knot through I

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.879 
finished just a simple knot through I
think<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.750> looks<00:03:42.930> really<00:03:42.989> cute<00:03:43.500> with<00:03:43.709> this

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
think it looks really cute with this

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.039 
think it looks really cute with this
sort<00:03:44.100> of<00:03:44.160> string<00:03:44.549> again<00:03:45.299> I<00:03:45.569> was<00:03:45.690> trying<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.930> go

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
sort of string again I was trying to go

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.750 
sort of string again I was trying to go
for<00:03:46.260> a<00:03:46.290> more<00:03:46.440> natural<00:03:46.470> looking<00:03:47.100> decoration

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
for a more natural looking decoration

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.729 
for a more natural looking decoration
and<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:47.970> think<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.389> it<00:03:48.480> kind<00:03:48.720> of<00:03:48.810> suited<00:03:49.590> that

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
and I think that it kind of suited that

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.129 
and I think that it kind of suited that
then<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:50.609> just<00:03:50.690> finish<00:03:51.690> off<00:03:51.840> all<00:03:52.019> your

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.390 
then you just finish off all your
letters<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.470> you<00:03:52.709> can<00:03:52.859> hang<00:03:53.069> them<00:03:53.220> wherever

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
letters and you can hang them wherever

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.099 
letters and you can hang them wherever
you<00:03:53.549> want<00:03:53.790> so<00:03:53.970> I'm<00:03:54.150> having<00:03:54.329> Steve<00:03:54.720> hang<00:03:54.959> them
