00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
Sally's it has about three rows of teeth

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.780 
Sally's it has about three rows of teeth
and<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:11.370> back<00:00:11.610> homes<00:00:11.910> pretty<00:00:12.360> well<00:00:13.070> so<00:00:14.070> he<00:00:14.639> just

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
and it back homes pretty well so he just

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.210 
and it back homes pretty well so he just
started<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.450> top<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.619> just<00:00:16.650> work<00:00:17.010> your<00:00:17.039> way

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
started the top and just work your way

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.260 
started the top and just work your way
down<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:18.109> was<00:00:19.109> once<00:00:19.320> told<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:20.270> normally

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
down I was once told that you normally

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.519 
down I was once told that you normally
don't<00:00:21.720> want<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.350> back<00:00:22.650> home<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.220> same<00:00:23.430> spot

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
don't want to back home in the same spot

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.200 
don't want to back home in the same spot
because<00:00:25.529> then<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.859> just<00:00:25.890> bunches<00:00:26.460> off<00:00:26.609> up<00:00:26.880> all

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
because then it just bunches off up all

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.950 
because then it just bunches off up all
at<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.480> top<00:00:27.800> but<00:00:28.800> um<00:00:29.090> usually<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.119> just<00:00:30.359> go

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
at the top but um usually I just go

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.319 
at the top but um usually I just go
crazy<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.279> beginning<00:00:32.640> just<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.969> get<00:00:33.180> it

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
crazy in the beginning just to get it

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.930 
crazy in the beginning just to get it
nice<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.570> tangled<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.710> then<00:00:35.399> from<00:00:35.700> there

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
nice and tangled and then from there

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.110 
nice and tangled and then from there
once<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.420> get<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:37.230> know<00:00:37.350> if<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.649> desired

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
once I get it you know if the desired

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.160

it now it's very important that you
don't<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:48.920> uneven<00:00:49.920> sections<00:00:50.579> from<00:00:51.059> within

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
don't have uneven sections from within

don't have uneven sections from within
this<00:00:51.629> new<00:00:51.930> dread<00:00:52.260> because<00:00:53.039> say<00:00:53.489> for<00:00:53.760> example

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
this new dread because say for example

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.650 
this new dread because say for example
you<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.520> this<00:00:56.520> part<00:00:56.789> right<00:00:56.969> here<00:00:57.300> super

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
you have this this part right here super

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.500 
you have this this part right here super
puffy<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.500> then<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:59.309> part<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.850> like

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
puffy and then this part is like

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.020 
puffy and then this part is like
obviously<00:01:00.780> thinner<00:01:01.410> it's<00:01:02.100> gonna<00:01:02.280> happen<00:01:02.520> when

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
obviously thinner it's gonna happen when

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.080 
obviously thinner it's gonna happen when
you<00:01:03.329> start<00:01:03.500> twisting<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.650> dread<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.909> it

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
you start twisting the dread is that it

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.420 
you start twisting the dread is that it
starts<00:01:06.540> bunching<00:01:06.990> up<00:01:07.140> weird<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:08.189> you're<00:01:08.310> gonna

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
starts bunching up weird so you're gonna

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.039 
starts bunching up weird so you're gonna
get<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:09.000> an<00:01:09.150> uneven<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:11.100> know<00:01:11.780> dread<00:01:12.780> that

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
get with an uneven you know dread that

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.530 
get with an uneven you know dread that
doesn't<00:01:13.380> look<00:01:13.590> as<00:01:13.770> nice<00:01:14.670> as<00:01:14.939> you'd<00:01:15.119> like<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.509> to

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
doesn't look as nice as you'd like it to

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.740 
doesn't look as nice as you'd like it to
unless<00:01:16.439> that's<00:01:16.619> what<00:01:16.770> you're<00:01:16.950> going<00:01:17.189> for

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
unless that's what you're going for

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.170 
unless that's what you're going for
but<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:18.930> basically<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:19.740> pulled<00:01:20.340> out<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
but so basically you just pulled out the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.570 
but so basically you just pulled out the
hair<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.840> get<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.020> nice<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.650> even<00:01:23.009> all<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.430> way

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
hair to get it nice and even all the way

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.480 
hair to get it nice and even all the way
down<00:01:24.049> and<00:01:25.049> keep<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.560> combing<00:01:26.009> until<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.340> get

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
down and keep that combing until you get

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.700 
down and keep that combing until you get
it<00:01:26.610> tangled<00:01:26.909> if<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.689> don't<00:01:27.869> get<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.290> back<00:01:28.439> home

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710

Dena the dreads not gonna hold so it's

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:43.330 
Dena the dreads not gonna hold so it's
very<00:01:31.950> important<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.509> this

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.310 

so<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.060> said<00:01:45.240> what<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.780> do<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.110> just

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
so like I said what I like to do is just

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
way down the dread you're probably not

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.160 
way down the dread you're probably not
gonna<00:01:53.399> be<00:01:53.640> able<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.909> see<00:01:54.119> what<00:01:54.600> I'm<00:01:54.720> doing<00:01:55.049> on

gonna be able to see what I'm doing on
the<00:01:55.920> far<00:01:56.189> end<00:01:56.369> because<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.299> doesn't<00:01:57.689> reach<00:01:59.750> now

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
the far end because it doesn't reach now

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.510 
the far end because it doesn't reach now
the<00:02:00.810> method<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.500> I'm<00:02:01.619> going<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.920> be<00:02:02.070> using

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
the method that I'm going to be using

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.319 
the method that I'm going to be using
here<00:02:02.789> is<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.720> steam<00:02:04.170> method<00:02:04.729> normally<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.759> use

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
here is the steam method normally I use

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.160 
here is the steam method normally I use
a<00:02:06.659> shark<00:02:07.439> or<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> scrunchie<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.910> go<00:02:09.690> through<00:02:09.929> so

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
a shark or a scrunchie I go through so

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.160 
a shark or a scrunchie I go through so
many<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.530> them<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.700> basically<00:02:12.450> tried<00:02:12.989> them

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
many of them that I basically tried them

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.550

all

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.590 
all
but<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.220> really<00:02:14.489> like<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.790> shark<00:02:15.360> in<00:02:15.510> the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
but I really like the shark in the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.820 
but I really like the shark in the
scoochie<00:02:16.970> steamers<00:02:18.230> because<00:02:19.230> they<00:02:19.500> allow<00:02:19.769> you

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.660 
scoochie steamers because they allow you
to<00:02:20.010> control<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.970> steam<00:02:21.739> so<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:23.400> one<00:02:23.519> I'm

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
to control the steam so the one I'm

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:54.650 
to control the steam so the one I'm
using<00:02:23.850> right<00:02:24.000> now<00:02:52.220> but<00:02:53.220> anyway<00:02:53.519> so<00:02:54.329> that's<00:02:54.510> the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
using right now but anyway so that's the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.509 
using right now but anyway so that's the
method<00:02:54.840> I'm<00:02:55.140> going<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.739> do<00:02:55.920> right<00:02:56.160> now<00:02:56.359> um<00:02:57.359> you

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
method I'm going to do right now um you

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.750 
method I'm going to do right now um you
can<00:02:59.519> do<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.840> different<00:03:01.590> boiling<00:03:02.340> methods

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
can do the different boiling methods

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.970 
can do the different boiling methods
like<00:03:02.970> for<00:03:03.150> example<00:03:03.600> another<00:03:04.319> one<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:04.709> pretty

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
like for example another one is pretty

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.789 
like for example another one is pretty
simple<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.640> do<00:03:05.940> is<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:07.040> is<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:09.620> tea<00:03:10.620> kettle

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
simple to do is the is the tea kettle

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.140 
simple to do is the is the tea kettle
method<00:03:11.280> just<00:03:11.910> basically<00:03:12.329> what<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.870> do<00:03:13.049> is<00:03:13.410> you

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
method just basically what you do is you

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.759 
method just basically what you do is you
go<00:03:15.150> through<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.450> same<00:03:15.630> process<00:03:15.959> but<00:03:16.620> rather

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
go through the same process but rather

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.530 
go through the same process but rather
than<00:03:17.160> you<00:03:17.519> know<00:03:17.579> it's<00:03:17.790> being<00:03:18.000> on<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.359> floor

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
than you know it's being on the floor

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.640 
than you know it's being on the floor
with<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.840> towel<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:20.100> have<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.730> tea<00:03:21.660> kettle<00:03:21.900> that

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
with a towel you have a tea kettle that

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.590 
with a towel you have a tea kettle that
you<00:03:22.769> just<00:03:22.980> pour<00:03:23.310> over<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.760> dread<00:03:24.120> in<00:03:24.989> there

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
you just pour over the dread in there

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.950 
you just pour over the dread in there
seeing<00:03:25.780> once<00:03:26.260> you're<00:03:26.410> ready<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.800> fill<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.370> up

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
seeing once you're ready to fill it up

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.770 
seeing once you're ready to fill it up
now<00:03:28.960> for<00:03:29.020> those<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:30.300> consistency<00:03:31.300> of<00:03:31.330> the

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
now for those the consistency of the

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.980 
now for those the consistency of the
drug<00:03:32.020> will<00:03:32.350> be<00:03:32.940> different<00:03:33.940> than<00:03:34.240> with<00:03:34.630> a<00:03:34.660> steam

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
drug will be different than with a steam

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.230 
drug will be different than with a steam
with<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.830> steamer<00:03:36.370> your<00:03:36.760> dreads<00:03:37.000> are<00:03:37.120> gonna

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
with the steamer your dreads are gonna

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.690 
with the steamer your dreads are gonna
come<00:03:37.450> out<00:03:37.570> tighter<00:03:37.960> and<00:03:38.260> smoother<00:03:38.770> now<00:03:39.550> with

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
come out tighter and smoother now with

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.660 
come out tighter and smoother now with
the<00:03:39.790> tea<00:03:39.970> kettle<00:03:40.150> method<00:03:40.720> they're<00:03:40.930> gonna<00:03:41.020> be

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
the tea kettle method they're gonna be

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.770 
the tea kettle method they're gonna be
they're<00:03:42.670> gonna<00:03:42.730> be<00:03:42.850> fluffier<00:03:43.330> but<00:03:43.630> they're

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
they're gonna be fluffier but they're

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.570 
they're gonna be fluffier but they're
not<00:03:43.930> gonna<00:03:44.050> be<00:03:44.230> as<00:03:44.260> smooth<00:03:44.620> you<00:03:45.310> don't<00:03:45.460> have<00:03:45.550> a

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
not gonna be as smooth you don't have a

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.910 
not gonna be as smooth you don't have a
lot<00:03:45.760> of<00:03:45.850> loose<00:03:46.090> hairs<00:03:46.360> so<00:03:47.170> what<00:03:47.350> you<00:03:47.440> can<00:03:47.650> do

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
lot of loose hairs so what you can do

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.790 
lot of loose hairs so what you can do
with<00:03:48.880> that<00:03:49.060> tea<00:03:49.330> kettle<00:03:49.630> method<00:03:50.110> is<00:03:50.410> use<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.400> a

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
with that tea kettle method is use a a

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.640 
with that tea kettle method is use a a
straightener<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:55.540> smooth<00:03:55.990> it<00:03:56.200> out<00:03:56.320> once

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
straightener to smooth it out once

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:08.740 
straightener to smooth it out once
you've<00:03:56.920> completed<00:03:57.400> that

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.950 

okay<00:04:09.620> so<00:04:09.680> I<00:04:10.370> don't<00:04:10.550> quite<00:04:10.970> have<00:04:11.270> this<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:11.810> way

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
okay so I don't quite have this the way

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.380 
okay so I don't quite have this the way
I<00:04:11.990> want<00:04:12.350> it<00:04:12.530> but<00:04:12.770> I<00:04:13.040> guess<00:04:13.700> it's<00:04:13.910> good<00:04:14.090> enough

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
I want it but I guess it's good enough

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.580 
I want it but I guess it's good enough
for<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.900> examples<00:04:15.500> sake<00:04:17.079> and<00:04:18.079> so<00:04:18.230> we'll<00:04:18.410> go

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
for the examples sake and so we'll go

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.000 
for the examples sake and so we'll go
ahead<00:04:18.620> and<00:04:19.130> steep<00:04:19.820> it
