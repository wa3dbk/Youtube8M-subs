00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.640 
really spent a lot of time in the studio
to<00:02:32.329> look<00:02:32.629> like<00:02:32.870> that<00:02:33.049> it<00:02:33.260> doesn't<00:02:33.409> come

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
to look like that it doesn't come

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.360 
to look like that it doesn't come
naturally<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.870> yeah<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:35.900> think<00:02:36.220> they<00:02:37.220> have<00:02:37.310> a

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
naturally and yeah I think they have a

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.500 
naturally and yeah I think they have a
good<00:02:37.519> chance<00:02:37.579> all<00:02:38.090> right<00:02:38.209> let's<00:02:38.359> talk<00:02:38.420> about

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
good chance all right let's talk about

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.410 
good chance all right let's talk about
Ryker<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:40.430> don't<00:02:40.970> know<00:02:41.030> if<00:02:41.090> youth<00:02:41.269> is

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
Ryker I don't know if youth is

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.670 
Ryker I don't know if youth is
everything<00:02:41.750> but<00:02:41.870> he's<00:02:41.959> so<00:02:42.109> young<00:02:42.379> does<00:02:42.650> that

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
everything but he's so young does that

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.890 
everything but he's so young does that
give<00:02:42.950> him<00:02:43.010> an<00:02:43.280> extra<00:02:43.549> capability<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.329> think<00:02:44.780> the

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
give him an extra capability I think the

contemporary dance and semi final week

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
was I think the best contemporary acts

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.520 
was I think the best contemporary acts
in<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.370> show<00:03:07.549> because<00:03:07.819> he<00:03:07.879> couldn't<00:03:08.150> really

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
in the show because he couldn't really

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.849 
in the show because he couldn't really
tell<00:03:09.730> that<00:03:10.730> there<00:03:10.939> was<00:03:11.060> a<00:03:11.090> celebrity<00:03:11.859> involved

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
tell that there was a celebrity involved

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.050 
tell that there was a celebrity involved
in<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.040> dance<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:13.430> looked<00:03:13.700> like<00:03:13.909> the

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
in the dance it looked like the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.839 
in the dance it looked like the
supersuit<00:03:14.450> dancers<00:03:15.079> dancing<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:15.920> it<00:03:16.699> was

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
supersuit dancers dancing and it was

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.030 
supersuit dancers dancing and it was
very<00:03:17.239> hard<00:03:17.510> routine<00:03:17.810> very<00:03:18.230> high<00:03:18.530> level<00:03:18.829> and

guy and being double amputee and doing
live<00:03:37.250> performances<00:03:37.730> I<00:03:38.629> think<00:03:39.049> is<00:03:39.169> terrifying

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680

live performances I think is terrifying
and<00:03:39.859> the<00:03:39.949> thing<00:03:40.370> is<00:03:40.489> about<00:03:40.699> his<00:03:40.970> double

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
and the thing is about his double

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.539 
and the thing is about his double
amputee<00:03:41.690> is<00:03:41.750> that<00:03:41.959> his<00:03:42.440> empathy<00:03:42.799> above<00:03:43.310> the

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
amputee is that his empathy above the

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:44.949 
amputee is that his empathy above the
knee<00:03:43.699> which<00:03:44.000> is<00:03:44.120> very<00:03:44.329> different<00:03:44.659> like<00:03:44.750> any
