00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
get that working but in any way getting

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.480 
get that working but in any way getting
the<00:01:06.180> dev<00:01:06.630> test<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.200> an<00:01:07.439> editable<00:01:07.799> state<00:01:08.250> is

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the dev test to an editable state is

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.000 
the dev test to an editable state is
actually<00:01:09.060> quite<00:01:09.630> easy<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.530> first<00:01:10.740> step

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
actually quite easy so the first step

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.399 
actually quite easy so the first step
that<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.250> need<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.670> do<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.810> go<00:01:12.990> into<00:01:13.260> your

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
that you need to do is to go into your

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.399 
that you need to do is to go into your
editor<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.040> create<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.700> new<00:01:15.000> map<00:01:15.240> 1024<00:01:16.200> by<00:01:16.380> 1024

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
editor and create a new map 1024 by 1024

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.160 
editor and create a new map 1024 by 1024
size<00:01:17.340> which<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> same<00:01:18.390> as<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.720> dev<00:01:18.869> test

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
size which is the same as the dev test

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.929 
size which is the same as the dev test
make<00:01:19.380> sure<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.340> size<00:01:20.610> good

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
make sure that it is that size good

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.520 
make sure that it is that size good
because<00:01:21.360> if<00:01:21.479> it's<00:01:21.630> bigger<00:01:21.840> or<00:01:22.110> smaller

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
because if it's bigger or smaller

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.770 
because if it's bigger or smaller
it<00:01:22.979> won't<00:01:23.280> work<00:01:23.369> it'll<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:24.060> mess<00:01:24.299> up<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.720> it

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
it won't work it'll just mess up and it

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.260 
it won't work it'll just mess up and it
won't<00:01:24.900> even<00:01:25.020> load<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.369> we're<00:01:26.880> gonna<00:01:27.000> call

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
won't even load and so we're gonna call

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.609 
won't even load and so we're gonna call
it<00:01:27.479> dev<00:01:28.140> test<00:01:28.439> edit<00:01:29.159> or<00:01:29.369> dev<00:01:30.360> test<00:01:30.689> something

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
it dev test edit or dev test something

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.710 
it dev test edit or dev test something
just<00:01:32.430> make<00:01:32.549> sure<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:33.119> something<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.570> you

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
just make sure it's something that you

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.780 
just make sure it's something that you
can<00:01:34.079> know<00:01:34.320> where<00:01:35.040> it's<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.400> dev<00:01:35.579> test

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
can know where it's the dev test

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.359 
can know where it's the dev test
editable<00:01:36.329> version<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.740> let's<00:01:37.770> just<00:01:38.159> call<00:01:38.340> it

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
editable version so let's just call it

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.749 
editable version so let's just call it
dev<00:01:38.850> test<00:01:41.720> fancy<00:01:42.720> sure<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.890> will<00:01:44.070> add<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.430> over

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
dev test fancy sure it will add it over

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.940 
dev test fancy sure it will add it over

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
that level.dat file and within this file

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.949 
that level.dat file and within this file
it<00:03:18.599> basically<00:03:19.470> tells<00:03:19.919> the<00:03:20.489> game<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.569> this

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
it basically tells the game that this

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.249 
it basically tells the game that this
level<00:03:22.259> is<00:03:22.530> locked<00:03:23.189> and<00:03:23.489> so<00:03:24.239> by<00:03:24.750> putting<00:03:24.989> in

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:25.259 
level is locked and so by putting in

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:26.990 
level is locked and so by putting in
everything<00:03:25.799> else<00:03:25.979> in<00:03:26.189> the<00:03:26.310> dev<00:03:26.489> test<00:03:26.729> map

except<00:03:27.509> for<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.810> file<00:03:28.079> that<00:03:28.290> tells<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.889> it's

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
except for the file that tells that it's

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.119 
except for the file that tells that it's
locked<00:03:29.879> it<00:03:30.239> basically<00:03:31.019> makes<00:03:31.319> it<00:03:31.590> unlocked

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
locked it basically makes it unlocked

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.879 
locked it basically makes it unlocked
but<00:03:32.519> still<00:03:32.939> has<00:03:33.239> all<00:03:33.689> the<00:03:33.900> content<00:03:34.409> in<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.739> so

but still has all the content in it so

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.499 
but still has all the content in it so
now<00:03:35.069> that<00:03:35.310> we've<00:03:35.430> got<00:03:35.639> everything<00:03:35.669> copied

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:36.509 
now that we've got everything copied

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:38.809 
now that we've got everything copied
over<00:03:36.750> we're<00:03:37.379> pretty<00:03:37.590> much<00:03:37.799> good<00:03:38.129> to<00:03:38.159> go<00:03:38.340> just

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
over we're pretty much good to go just

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:39.740 
over we're pretty much good to go just
make<00:03:38.909> sure<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.209> you<00:03:39.299> don't<00:03:39.479> mess<00:03:39.720> up

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750

make sure that you don't mess up
anything<00:03:40.439> in<00:03:40.560> this<00:03:40.650> dev<00:03:40.919> test<00:03:41.099> world<00:03:41.400> because

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
anything in this dev test world because

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.429 
anything in this dev test world because
if<00:03:41.819> you<00:03:41.939> do<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.419> won't<00:03:42.599> be<00:03:42.750> able<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:42.989> load<00:03:43.229> the

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:43.439 
if you do you won't be able to load the

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:45.800 
if you do you won't be able to load the
editor<00:03:43.799> because<00:03:44.189> you<00:03:44.549> need<00:03:44.759> at<00:03:45.060> least<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.659> dev

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
editor because you need at least the dev

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.140 
editor because you need at least the dev
test<00:03:46.109> map<00:03:46.379> in<00:03:46.620> order<00:03:47.009> for<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.549> game<00:03:47.729> to<00:03:47.970> work

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
test map in order for the game to work

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.879 
test map in order for the game to work
so<00:03:48.449> if<00:03:48.599> you<00:03:48.720> like<00:03:49.169> accidentally<00:03:49.650> mess

so if you like accidentally mess
something<00:03:50.159> up<00:03:50.430> you're<00:03:50.939> gonna<00:03:51.030> have<00:03:51.299> to<00:03:51.449> revert

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
something up you're gonna have to revert

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.110 
something up you're gonna have to revert
back<00:03:52.109> into<00:03:52.829> two<00:03:52.979> point<00:03:53.220> two<00:03:53.370> point<00:03:53.579> five<00:03:53.759> and

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
back into two point two point five and

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.929 
back into two point two point five and
then<00:03:54.540> go<00:03:54.750> back<00:03:54.989> into<00:03:55.229> 3.0<00:03:55.859> and<00:03:56.069> it<00:03:56.189> should<00:03:56.430> fix

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:56.939 
then go back into 3.0 and it should fix

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.119 
then go back into 3.0 and it should fix
everything<00:03:57.329> so<00:03:58.049> now<00:03:58.199> we<00:03:58.259> can<00:03:58.590> restart

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
everything so now we can restart

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.689 
everything so now we can restart
unturned<00:03:59.879> and<00:04:00.469> now<00:04:01.469> we<00:04:01.530> go<00:04:01.709> into<00:04:01.859> workshop<00:04:02.370> and

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
unturned and now we go into workshop and

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
ask the creator of the map first because

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.369 
ask the creator of the map first because
you<00:05:03.520> don't<00:05:03.550> want<00:05:03.909> to<00:05:04.150> like<00:05:04.509> mess<00:05:04.840> around<00:05:05.020> with
