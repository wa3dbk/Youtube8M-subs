00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:38.440 

I'm<00:01:25.680> afraid<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.160> lift<00:01:26.370> it<00:01:26.520> off<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.760> ground

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:53.450 

fudge<00:01:39.980> and<00:01:40.980> there's<00:01:41.220> first<00:01:41.550> crash<00:01:41.790> oh<00:01:52.280> good<00:01:53.280> no

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
fudge and there's first crash oh good no

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.360 
fudge and there's first crash oh good no
damage<00:01:53.790> done

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
damage done

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.060 
damage done
just<00:01:56.370> these<00:01:56.490> prevent<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:58.140> ground<00:01:58.440> is<00:01:58.680> really

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
just these prevent the ground is really

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:31.190 
just these prevent the ground is really
soft<00:02:00.200> even<00:02:01.200> that's<00:02:01.500> freezing<00:02:02.070> out

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.089 

so<00:02:32.200> what<00:02:32.859> I<00:02:32.890> thought<00:02:33.219> was<00:02:33.849> to<00:02:34.180> be<00:02:34.299> a<00:02:34.329> safe<00:02:34.659> crash

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
so what I thought was to be a safe crash

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.640 
so what I thought was to be a safe crash
ended<00:02:36.099> up<00:02:36.189> in<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.459> mixing<00:02:36.879> arm<00:02:37.060> broke<00:02:37.650> right

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
ended up in the mixing arm broke right

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.910 
ended up in the mixing arm broke right
here<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:39.599> want<00:02:40.599> you<00:02:40.689> to<00:02:40.840> see<00:02:41.019> but<00:02:41.200> this<00:02:41.590> piece

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
here I want you to see but this piece

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.539 
here I want you to see but this piece
right<00:02:42.519> here<00:02:42.579> this<00:02:43.000> is<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.209> mixing<00:02:43.569> arm<00:02:44.489> this<00:02:45.489> is

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
right here this is a mixing arm this is

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.610 
right here this is a mixing arm this is
supposed<00:02:45.939> to<00:02:46.030> connect<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.629> this<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:47.049> make<00:02:47.230> the

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
supposed to connect to this to make the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.309 
supposed to connect to this to make the
blade<00:02:47.859> spin<00:02:48.250> like<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.579> and<00:02:48.969> the<00:02:49.870> mixing<00:02:50.170> arm

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
blade spin like that and the mixing arm

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.319 
blade spin like that and the mixing arm
goes<00:02:50.500> up<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.680> down<00:02:50.849> like<00:02:51.849> if<00:02:51.939> I<00:02:52.030> spin<00:02:52.299> it

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
goes up and down like if I spin it

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.559 
goes up and down like if I spin it
around<00:02:52.510> on<00:02:52.840> this<00:02:52.989> side<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:55.000> can<00:02:55.120> see<00:02:55.150> it's

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
around on this side you can see it's

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.649 
around on this side you can see it's
connected<00:02:56.139> right<00:02:56.319> there<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.970> helps<00:02:58.389> to

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
connected right there and it helps to

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.140 
connected right there and it helps to
bleep<00:02:58.870> turn<00:02:59.109> in<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.379> out<00:02:59.760> the<00:03:00.760> other<00:03:00.790> blade

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
bleep turn in and out the other blade

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.379 
bleep turn in and out the other blade
just<00:03:01.419> stays<00:03:02.379> there<00:03:02.650> instead<00:03:03.069> of<00:03:03.129> moving<00:03:03.700> with

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
just stays there instead of moving with

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:10.379 
just stays there instead of moving with
the<00:03:04.540> blade<00:03:04.889> with<00:03:05.889> the<00:03:06.629> other<00:03:07.629> one<00:03:08.310> so<00:03:09.389> I'm

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
the blade with the other one so I'm

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:14.759 
the blade with the other one so I'm
gonna<00:03:10.659> buy<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:12.400> new<00:03:12.569> mixing<00:03:13.569> arm<00:03:13.870> go<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.590> new

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
gonna buy a new mixing arm go to new

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.009 
gonna buy a new mixing arm go to new
mixing<00:03:15.069> arms<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:16.150> I'm<00:03:16.239> gonna<00:03:16.359> upgrade<00:03:16.599> to

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
mixing arms and I'm gonna upgrade to

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.300 
mixing arms and I'm gonna upgrade to
either<00:03:17.409> carbon<00:03:17.829> fiber<00:03:18.010> or<00:03:18.129> metal<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:20.230> that<00:03:20.560> was

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.159 
either carbon fiber or metal so that was
my<00:03:21.400> first<00:03:21.609> crash<00:03:21.909> it<00:03:22.239> it<00:03:22.510> wasn't<00:03:22.900> trimmed

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.610 
upgrade the mixing arms to metal oh man
that<00:03:33.549> might<00:03:34.030> get<00:03:34.239> a<00:03:34.299> metal<00:03:34.599> fly<00:03:35.079> bar<00:03:35.319> or<00:03:35.560> a

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
that might get a metal fly bar or a

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.409 
that might get a metal fly bar or a
carbon<00:03:36.069> fiber<00:03:36.400> fly<00:03:36.760> bar<00:03:38.639> so<00:03:39.639> in<00:03:39.970> some<00:03:40.209> cases

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
carbon fiber fly bar so in some cases

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.890 
carbon fiber fly bar so in some cases
this<00:03:40.629> crash<00:03:40.930> is<00:03:41.109> good<00:03:41.290> but<00:03:41.739> in<00:03:41.859> other<00:03:41.979> cases<00:03:42.250> I

stay right there has wrecked it stuck
and<00:03:55.780> get<00:03:55.989> some<00:03:56.139> jams<00:03:56.379> and<00:03:56.620> jams<00:03:56.889> these<00:03:57.099> wings

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
and get some jams and jams these wings

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.030 
and get some jams and jams these wings
from<00:03:57.519> going<00:03:57.729> down<00:03:57.879> are<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.419> blades<00:03:59.040> but

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
from going down are the blades but

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.569 
from going down are the blades but

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
anyway the closest hobby shop is 45

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:04.699 
anyway the closest hobby shop is 45
minutes<00:04:03.879> away

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
minutes away

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:11.849 
minutes away
