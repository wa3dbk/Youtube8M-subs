00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 we found traveling through the localities 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.859
 what a regular job we know 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.260
 us and arriving at the town of 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.420
 maisonnave a few meters 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.410
 we find an accident where 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.869
 a truck had left on the shoulder 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.490
 had ended up crashing on some 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.880
 plants 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.890
 and later a car that was 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.599
 totally destroyed 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:35.809
 It was hard to recognize that it was good 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:38.010
 Unfortunately the car people already 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:42.650
 I found in all lifeless 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.200
 the people in the truck was a driver 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.790
 and two more women than apparently in 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.160
 the daughters were with lessons 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:56.840
 but out of danger so 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:00.380
 We saw there and already there were people who 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.990
 circulated on the route where I was already 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.870
 obviously attending the girls there 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.660
 until firefighters arrived and 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.970
 theoretical police and the police in my area 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.800
 from marjah you arrived practically 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.140
 minutes after the 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.960
 accident apparently yes because 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.030
 there were still few people and still not 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.880
 were neither the firemen nor ambulance nor 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.410
 police anything after we had 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.300
 come to us and they started to arrive 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.550
 a terrible experience was with your 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.040
 partner in this case pablo muÃ±oz and them 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.860
 touched I say an experience that never 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.100
 they would have imagined not the truth that very 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.100
 ugly 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.880
 what was seen 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.180
 the good car was totally 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.830
 destroyed and 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.570
 and people were hard to recognize 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.690
 in a very ugly image that 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.740
 it's not nice to see if you find that 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.090
 shape 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.950
 you talked to the police that 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.460
 I was there in the place I imagine the 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.130
 despair of not knowing what to do and if 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.250
 the good police were more than 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.140
 nothing also with little information because 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.990
 they came after us here to 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.600
 times like they wanted to collect 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.110
 information to see what has 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.900
 happened for what is said are going to go 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.000
 from other people who were apparently 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.260
 the car 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.520
 he spun on the route and good and 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.850
 was impacted by the truck 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.660
 is what they commented there after 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.220
 single 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:42.380
 the police will determine how it was 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.380
 well the accident
