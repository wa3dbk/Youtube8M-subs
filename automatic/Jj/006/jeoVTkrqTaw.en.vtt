this<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.700> thought<00:01:23.850> yet<00:01:24.030> stick<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.420> new<00:01:24.540> card

and<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.380> really<00:01:25.619> true<00:01:25.950> with<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.189> phase

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
and that is really true with the phase

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.310 
and that is really true with the phase
channel<00:01:26.850> itself<00:01:27.509> we<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.080> stick<00:01:28.290> with

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
channel itself we have to stick with

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.830 
channel itself we have to stick with

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
like I was still bored of this game I

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.320 
like I was still bored of this game I
can't<00:04:29.039> really<00:04:29.160> say<00:04:29.460> because<00:04:29.849> it<00:04:29.970> was<00:04:30.090> just

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
can't really say because it was just

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.580 
can't really say because it was just
that<00:04:30.419> one<00:04:30.629> day<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:30.930> I<00:04:30.990> thought<00:04:31.169> maybe<00:04:31.379> it's

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
that one day and I thought maybe it's

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.860 
that one day and I thought maybe it's
cuz<00:04:31.710> I<00:04:31.800> played<00:04:32.069> you<00:04:32.729> know<00:04:32.759> for<00:04:33.030> like<00:04:33.150> quite<00:04:33.840> a

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
few hours to rank up and then I play

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.760 
few hours to rank up and then I play
like<00:04:36.270> I<00:04:36.479> don't<00:04:36.539> know<00:04:36.750> maybe<00:04:36.930> 10<00:04:37.229> games<00:04:37.470> with<00:04:37.710> a

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770

like I don't know maybe 10 games with a
sniper<00:04:37.949> after<00:04:38.490> so<00:04:39.150> maybe<00:04:39.449> it's<00:04:39.900> just<00:04:40.169> cuz<00:04:40.289> I

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:40.319 
sniper after so maybe it's just cuz I

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:41.839 
sniper after so maybe it's just cuz I
played<00:04:40.590> quite<00:04:40.770> a<00:04:40.889> lot<00:04:41.069> that<00:04:41.220> day<00:04:41.400> because<00:04:41.639> and

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
maybe I'm still bored and I thought this

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.149 
maybe I'm still bored and I thought this
