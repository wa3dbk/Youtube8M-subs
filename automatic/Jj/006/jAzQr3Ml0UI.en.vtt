now is what the girls are doing is

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.689 
now is what the girls are doing is
they're<00:00:37.750> cutting<00:00:38.110> up<00:00:38.260> out<00:00:38.440> of<00:00:38.620> a<00:00:38.890> phone<00:00:39.370> and

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
they're cutting up out of a phone and

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.799 
they're cutting up out of a phone and
l200<00:00:40.629> a<00:00:41.070> mock-up<00:00:42.070> or<00:00:42.489> a<00:00:42.580> really<00:00:43.300> elaborate

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
garbage bag test of raptor and i call it

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:48.240 
garbage bag test of raptor and i call it
garbage<00:00:46.989> bag<00:00:47.320> test<00:00:47.589> because<00:00:47.800> it<00:00:47.920> dates<00:00:48.129> back

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
garbage bag test because it dates back

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.540 
garbage bag test because it dates back
to<00:00:48.460> when<00:00:48.790> we<00:00:48.970> did<00:00:49.180> aliens<00:00:49.720> for<00:00:50.290> Jim<00:00:50.500> Cameron<00:00:51.010> we

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
to when we did aliens for Jim Cameron we

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.790 
to when we did aliens for Jim Cameron we
can<00:00:51.879> we<00:00:52.300> actually<00:00:52.780> constructed<00:00:53.440> a<00:00:53.559> queen

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
can we actually constructed a queen

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.549 
can we actually constructed a queen
alien<00:00:54.309> full-sized<00:00:55.059> out<00:00:55.479> of<00:00:55.659> garbage<00:00:56.019> bags<00:00:56.290> and

alien full-sized out of garbage bags and

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.549 
alien full-sized out of garbage bags and
foam<00:00:56.830> core<00:00:57.129> similar<00:00:57.610> to<00:00:57.790> this<00:00:57.989> but<00:00:58.989> to<00:00:59.170> prove

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
foam core similar to this but to prove

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.130 
foam core similar to this but to prove
that<00:00:59.920> proof<00:01:00.820> of<00:01:00.970> concept<00:01:01.420> and<00:01:01.510> what<00:01:01.989> we're

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
that proof of concept and what we're

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.960 
that proof of concept and what we're
doing<00:01:02.170> right<00:01:02.620> here<00:01:02.680> is<00:01:03.040> the<00:01:03.250> same<00:01:03.489> thing<00:01:03.729> it's

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
doing right here is the same thing it's

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.930 
doing right here is the same thing it's
just<00:01:04.180> a<00:01:04.390> little<00:01:04.780> bit<00:01:04.900> more<00:01:05.080> elaborate<00:01:05.560> version

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
just a little bit more elaborate version

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.670 
just a little bit more elaborate version
and<00:01:07.920> if<00:01:08.920> you<00:01:09.280> frame<00:01:10.000> out<00:01:10.390> this<00:01:10.900> figure<00:01:11.320> from

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
and if you frame out this figure from

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.620 
and if you frame out this figure from
about<00:01:12.010> the<00:01:12.130> knees<00:01:12.340> down<00:01:12.700> you<00:01:13.000> can<00:01:13.180> kind<00:01:13.390> of<00:01:13.450> see

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
about the knees down you can kind of see

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.960 
about the knees down you can kind of see
how<00:01:13.810> it<00:01:13.900> was<00:01:14.020> going<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.260> be<00:01:14.409> used<00:01:14.740> and<00:01:15.220> in<00:01:15.820> the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
how it was going to be used and in the

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.450 
how it was going to be used and in the
film<00:01:16.270> there's<00:01:17.080> a<00:01:17.229> there's<00:01:17.649> there's<00:01:18.009> several

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
film there's a there's there's several

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.639 
film there's a there's there's several
scenes<00:01:18.700> where<00:01:19.030> it's<00:01:19.180> used<00:01:19.450> there<00:01:19.930> there's<00:01:20.530> two

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
scenes where it's used there there's two

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.249 
scenes where it's used there there's two
of<00:01:20.979> them<00:01:21.100> walking<00:01:21.460> in<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:21.850> kitchen<00:01:22.240> and<00:01:22.390> we

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
of them walking in the kitchen and we

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:24.510 
of them walking in the kitchen and we
did<00:01:23.439> exactly<00:01:23.649> what<00:01:24.130> we're<00:01:24.250> talking<00:01:24.399> about

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
did exactly what we're talking about

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.620 
did exactly what we're talking about
framing<00:01:25.119> it<00:01:25.210> out<00:01:25.329> from<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.840> knees<00:01:26.680> down

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.840 

here's<00:01:32.630> some<00:01:33.170> tests<00:01:33.560> of<00:01:33.649> it<00:01:33.799> running<00:01:34.130> so<00:01:34.310> it's

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
here's some tests of it running so it's

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:44.020 
here's some tests of it running so it's
very<00:01:35.119> organic<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.079> it<00:01:36.229> was<00:01:36.320> very<00:01:36.500> mobile<00:01:43.030> so

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
very organic and it was very mobile so

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.880 
very organic and it was very mobile so
it<00:01:44.390> was<00:01:44.539> trying<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.079> figure<00:01:45.320> out<00:01:45.350> all<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:45.860> ways

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
it was trying to figure out all the ways

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.669 
it was trying to figure out all the ways
to<00:01:46.039> make<00:01:46.280> this<00:01:46.670> stuff<00:01:46.939> work<00:01:47.270> right<00:01:48.200> now<00:01:48.380> you're

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
to make this stuff work right now you're

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.529 
to make this stuff work right now you're
looking<00:01:48.830> at<00:01:49.070> a<00:01:49.130> kind<00:01:49.549> of<00:01:49.640> an<00:01:49.729> elaborate<00:01:50.240> test

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
looking at a kind of an elaborate test

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.740 
looking at a kind of an elaborate test
of<00:01:50.869> a<00:01:51.409> neck<00:01:51.710> mechanism<00:01:52.610> that<00:01:52.850> Stan<00:01:53.210> had<00:01:53.509> come

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
of a neck mechanism that Stan had come

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.200 
of a neck mechanism that Stan had come
up<00:01:53.929> with<00:01:54.110> it<00:01:54.439> was<00:01:54.560> very<00:01:54.770> clever<00:01:55.159> you<00:01:55.909> can<00:01:55.970> see

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
up with it was very clever you can see

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.969 
up with it was very clever you can see
Stan's<00:01:56.539> kind<00:01:56.840> of<00:01:56.929> working<00:01:57.500> on<00:01:57.880> with<00:01:58.880> me<00:01:59.979> part

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
Stan's kind of working on with me part

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.389 
Stan's kind of working on with me part
of<00:02:01.130> this<00:02:01.280> chicken<00:02:01.909> head<00:02:02.709> bird-like<00:02:03.709> movement

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
of this chicken head bird-like movement

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.120 
of this chicken head bird-like movement
and<00:02:04.600> inside<00:02:05.600> of<00:02:05.630> it<00:02:06.140> I<00:02:06.319> actually<00:02:06.500> had<00:02:06.830> rods

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
and inside of it I actually had rods

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.779 
and inside of it I actually had rods
that<00:02:07.429> controlled<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.209> basic<00:02:08.569> head<00:02:08.810> move<00:02:09.140> and

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
that controlled the basic head move and

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.050 
that controlled the basic head move and
tilt<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:11.180> in<00:02:11.420> turn<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:12.110> so<00:02:12.709> all<00:02:13.459> of<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:13.850> was

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
tilt and in turn and so all of this was

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.270 
tilt and in turn and so all of this was
being<00:02:14.299> refined<00:02:14.780> during<00:02:15.319> this<00:02:15.470> process<00:02:15.739> and

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
being refined during this process and

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.570 
being refined during this process and
the<00:02:17.030> idea<00:02:17.569> was<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.319> eyes<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.280> jaw

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
the idea was that the eyes and the jaw

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.890 
the idea was that the eyes and the jaw
and<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.239> arms<00:02:20.660> on<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:21.080> would<00:02:21.980> end<00:02:22.190> up<00:02:22.370> being

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
and the arms on it would end up being

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.699 
and the arms on it would end up being
radio-controlled<00:02:23.900> but<00:02:24.019> here's<00:02:24.230> the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.630 
doing is trying to work out the range of
moment<00:02:36.079> and<00:02:36.280> Stan's<00:02:37.280> doing<00:02:37.670> other<00:02:37.820> things
