00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.070
 steam lie like 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.300
 I first want to make a steam knife 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:20.509
 make and out of the freezer 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:25.119
 What kind of camera I got is not worn 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:26.719
 suitable cut shu cut under the knife 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.390
 everywhere ashley 

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:34.640
 him you are in different directions in general, I decided 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:40.989
 do here and so cut out of them for out 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.989
 stainless steel knife itself so with a handle 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.940
 so processed 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.399
 I found such a copper tube 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:02.230
 of course a little thick wall 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:10.850
 her 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:14.030
 wall thick work so here I want 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.500
 it is direct to get and so and for one for a look 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:21.380
 under the handle on the handle I will do 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.990
 wooden lugs corpses will be 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.729
 pass and the handle itself will come out 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:32.300
 Here I can leave the back of such 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:41.720
 you can finish more in this brass 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:50.390
 I'll put the phone in here 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:54.340
 such here make a cut under the straw 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.340
 Shipunova to put came in pillow 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.170
 on the one hand about here and so he 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.170
 will come 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:13.440
 I hide the wooden covers 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:17.370
 here is a thickish pipe of course I have 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:23.980
 it would be thinner to be better and 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:26.950
 Take it easy Well, now I still 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.410
 I will correct here about the tube itself 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.519
 will do 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:41.590
 I think the sole will understand to the very 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:46.110
 ours so I soldered the phone to 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:51.790
 very well and so the knife turned 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:56.950
 cleared out here already all this 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.170
 the tube of the court under the handle right now 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:05.400
 do 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:11.440
 wooden principle you are ready 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:13.170
 the only thing that was necessary was probably all 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.540
 still make wider 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.980
 with 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.920
 he himself has a knife 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.390
 30 millimeters had to do it 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:28.099
 40 millimeters that's right here this 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:32.480
 cutting edge was more eager for 5 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:38.769
 millimeters on each side over this on 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:42.049
 the wave was wider to do while I leave so 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:46.420
 if you try it will work 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:55.040
 leave if there is no hell knife he cut out 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:59.450
 wider like this now do lining 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:05.900
 principle of trial will be long 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:11.930
 so I completed the knife steam knife like this 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:18.650
 that looks like a knife blade with reverse 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:23.260
 hook sides go in there 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:27.490
 pen they go here 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:34.820
 the back of the handle itself 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:38.240
 year is a toy I got these here so 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:44.410
 Here he looks now left to experience 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.410
 him as he will show in the work
