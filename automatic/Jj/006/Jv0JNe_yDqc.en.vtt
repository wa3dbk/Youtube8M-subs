that I think I see the field really well
able<00:04:11.980> to<00:04:12.099> react<00:04:12.400> to<00:04:12.579> the<00:04:12.669> ball<00:04:12.849> and<00:04:12.879> able<00:04:13.150> to

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
have good instincts and so it's

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.420 
have good instincts and so it's
something<00:04:14.709> that<00:04:14.829> I'm<00:04:14.889> still<00:04:15.129> trying<00:04:15.400> to
