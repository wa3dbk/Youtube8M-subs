00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.680
 in this video there are two tips for you 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.550
 that may be the key that is missing for 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:18.300
 the success of some people 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.880
 the first is the next never leave 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.300
 to eat breakfast and always eat protein in 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.420
 breakfast I'm sure you 've already 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.540
 heard before breakfast is the most 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.329
 important of the day when you wake up 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.800
 even if you're not hungry you have a 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.410
 body that is starving for 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.480
 nutrients and calories 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.239
 especially proteins because the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.780
 proteins because the protein 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.789
 regulates the metabolism accelerates it 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.329
 while you sleep, your body slows down 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.760
 metabolism to conserve energy 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:57.530
 when you wake up you need protein 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.829
 to activate your metabolism back 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.870
 and the second one is the following 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.190
 never drink any type of liquid 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.280
 with your meals 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.760
 because because you have the enzymes 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.180
 in the mouth and in the esophagus these enzymes 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.760
 they are strong and powerful serve for pre 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.550
 digest food and break down the 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.650
 before they reach your stomach but 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.370
 if you are drinking something with food 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.790
 just dilute the strength of your enzymes 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.100
 happens after these foods go down to 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.550
 the stomach without actually being pre 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.730
 digested they act like bombs there 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.800
 down in the stomach sure ever 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.020
 have you asked yourself why do you have 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.050
 indigestion or stomach pain after 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.500
 to eat just drink something ten minutes 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:53.630
 before and after meals that's 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.119
 good but not with meals 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.159
 after you visit the link under 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.329
 this video you will discover more 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.940
