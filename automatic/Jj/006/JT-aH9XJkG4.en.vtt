aspect<00:05:58.880> to<00:05:58.970> the<00:05:59.060> game<00:05:59.240> but<00:05:59.360> there's<00:05:59.570> also<00:05:59.720> you

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
aspect to the game but there's also you

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.840 
aspect to the game but there's also you
can<00:06:00.440> mitigate<00:06:00.560> that<00:06:00.919> some<00:06:01.160> by<00:06:01.310> deciding<00:06:01.729> what

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850 
can mitigate that some by deciding what

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.940 
can mitigate that some by deciding what
to<00:06:01.970> buy<00:06:02.000> from<00:06:02.300> the<00:06:02.419> middle<00:06:02.690> and<00:06:02.900> I<00:06:03.380> can<00:06:03.590> see<00:06:03.770> how

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
to buy from the middle and I can see how

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.980 
to buy from the middle and I can see how
this<00:06:04.190> really<00:06:04.460> could<00:06:04.610> be<00:06:04.640> you<00:06:05.270> know<00:06:05.330> even<00:06:05.690> added

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
this really could be you know even added

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.540 
this really could be you know even added
to<00:06:06.110> with<00:06:06.289> adding<00:06:06.590> more<00:06:06.770> creatures<00:06:07.250> and<00:06:07.400> more

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550
