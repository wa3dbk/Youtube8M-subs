00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.999
 welcome to the commitment theme 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:16.999
 everything is politics 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.319
 since a few days 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:25.189
 in this line the seville 2006 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.439
 all varieties of pear and according to the authorities the second 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.409
 why 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.390
 it is not framed but it makes them worse 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.120
 that's why they are linear 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.340
 in the previous video we had a fraction but only one if I was afraid of 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.290
 number three but here are two different denominators three titles 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.420
 what we do or with whom we multiply 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.450
 for 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.530
 can eliminate the two denominators because target main time 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.530
 eliminate the denominators so that it is clear 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.670
 then we take two denominators in this case are two and three 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.370
 2013 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.370
 and we do what we commonly call 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.329
 cm 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:14.540
 not divine 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.290
 then we take half 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.320
 a company from the commune on Friday of the month 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.140
 cd barcelona with whom we are going to multiply 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.820
 let's multiply it says here 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.280
 we must forget s is here 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.679
 on the previous occasion I did it 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:35.800
 together 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.770
 this is another way of doing it with medel they are involved 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.390
 ante guaranteed 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.340
 but we hope to duplicate with all this 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.320
 everything is ready for us to know 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.510
 that we are going to arrive with the whole member 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.499
 the whole left part of equality so 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:58.150
 six for a half 6 for 1 6 I stayed until saved ismael 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.230
 but 6-3 19 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.230
 to three 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.280
 remains 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.280
 those from here like 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.519
 this is an image 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.290
 I'm dizzy that is multiplying with him it's like this image was 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.779
 one variable 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:19.619
 we agree 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:23.439
 Now this file is 663 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:26.639
 2 x 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:30.249
 it's not that I'm always going to give in that way there will be that the pre who led then 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:33.309
 it becomes where the media present 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:36.639
 in question of this the physio nothing else 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.729
 since 3 we go well with him 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:42.139
 Ivan Vidal The question is 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.139
 because this cd multiplied as a medium 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.099
 but not with what is inside 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.369
 remember that it is in parentheses 10 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:53.369
 a factor 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:55.979
 Thus 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:57.639
 if you tell me 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.589
 sadness and had to multiply that's why inside 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:02.599
 I tell you yes 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.090
 I could have done it if they had more 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.069
 - multiplication person 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.570
 how is a multiplication 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.509
 only multiplied by him 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:13.419
 but he stayed the same because this is like it was 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:15.909
 a one variable 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.200
 although of two things inside by image to the 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.179
 money market 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.179
 as a dean we admire 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:26.489
 from the day after and we can do 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.479
 at this moment we will already 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.819
 three for that that undoubtedly 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.199
 ee 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:35.699
 plus three times four these 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.659
 and this is equal to all 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.889
 since we do not have faith 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.319
 Not only are voices of the teques for k 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.099
 3 ellis 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:47.550
 - two 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.469
 ll 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:51.369
 it's the same that he goes there 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:54.369
 and it stays as negative -2 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:04:00.309
 Now, if we wanted to shoot for her, there's no problem 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:04.049
 xo the variable can be anywhere, the point is that sometimes 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.909
 accustoms capon to the path left side but that others claim 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.579
 good 3-2 x is uneven 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.009
 x 

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:17.930
 positive because positive but different rts by the sign of mayÃ¡vez 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.279
 is equal to at least 2 

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:24.349
 and we have finished 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.180
 It is easy 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.009
 easy to make equations with fractions easy because in the end it is not 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.240
 do no shrinkage equation because from this space we eliminate them 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.499
 it is not that they eliminate them or simply weighs them to show something different 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.449
 so that we can occupy them as whole 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.219
 that easy 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:48.389
 and so fast 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.389
 but I think you hear this in some trade 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:55.839
 until the view back but then he remembered again always writing 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:00.319
 in this project 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.759
 always watch this video over and over again that is very easy to math 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.189
 let her from chile 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:10.589
 and he loves you 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:12.619
 you have to love her and now until the iss
