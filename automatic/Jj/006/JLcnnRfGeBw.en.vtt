00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.250
 hello guys and girls that are me 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.050
 watching today I bring you a new video in 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.440
 which I will talk to you only in the comparison 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.929
 graph between gta 5 and gta san andreas 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.820
 well we all know that in the past 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.740
 years the graphics have taken a leap 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.890
 quite big especially with the play 3 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.150
 children as mythical and as powerful as in 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.410
 his day san andreas 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.240
 today it looks like a rubble 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.310
 and who does not deserve or be a 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.370
 video game because they are flat objects 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.710
 pretty bad facts 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.500
 and if you compare it with the latest 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.420
 catches of gta 5 vos 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.520
 we do not have words sincerely 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.890
 let's remember with other eyes of the san 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.530
 andreas but over time they do 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.920
 a lot of damage in this gallery of images 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.780
 that I will be putting and I will make a 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.390
 comparative with the images of the next 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.730
 rockstar game trying to imitate the 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.239
 same positions and locations the 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.309
 obvious result jumps both 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.050
 the view and even many people from 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.210
 here those catches belong to a 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.430
 game of the current generation of 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.820
 you control it is that it is a pass 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.890
 well now I put a photo in that 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.250
 you see then up from now up to the 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:22.750
 left you have the bikes that 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:26.440
 will come out in the game and the bikes from before 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.920
 if we can see then the sand and the rocks 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.790
 from the sides then 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.280
 they are totally different things to the 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.140
 Now rocks are looking for a 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:44.070
 texture what before was like a drawing 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.070
 also on the tennis court the same the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.830
 floor looks painted and in the other already 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.760
 everything has more texture the trees all 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.940
 it's very bad very very very currado 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:01.270
 good photo change now from above to 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.270
 left as a super car 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.539
 the brightness effects are perfect the 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.910
 road texture the smoke 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.490
 phenomenal 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.610
 and on the other side because how old 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:21.150
 what is a square car to know after 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.940
 the bike that also more of the same is 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.640
 super good and change the photo the 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.120
 parachute 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.970
 as I said before in the photo of the 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.180
 race of the bikes because the texture of 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.380
 the rock is what I'm most interested in seeing 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:43.580
 because it changes a lot very much 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.860
 and the water has a color or a color 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.730
 plus 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:53.370
 more than water before it was like 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:56.280
 the breasts in a winter puddle do not 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.069
 then the plane that we see below 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.890
 It is also very improved I hope that you 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.890
 have liked to leave the trailer here below 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.709
 done this because I think the gta 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.959
 it is a very mythical game of the play 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.049
 that has been on all platforms 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:18.099
 it seems to me I have had some the 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:20.200
 truth is that it is very very good and good 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.310
 there are many people who like second in 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.340
 make trolls 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.410
 the truth is that it's really worth it and 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.870
 see you in the next video I hope 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.870
 I have subscribed to you
