00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.669
 number 102 it falls with a bit of one 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.560
 get started 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.090

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.710

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.270
 back when I find the ass 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.600
 ok people I found the comment 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.250
 which so yes it found under 2 bus 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.840
 so what the team at that could speak 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.629
 and people whatever 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.949
 the 10 what has become is fiorentina 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.410
 mr d 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.789
 dj let you can now pronounce exactly 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.710
 thank you for posting your comment 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.629
 just won we we go viewer 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.129
 in 10 we will start emote once 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.449
 Sounds like a fun challenge I think 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.089
 they do have separate shirts don't have much 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.500
 teams have that kind of color shirt and they 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.180
 They have also found quite a few players 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.560
 and they are a bit less 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.480
 become past years so we can 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.909
 also build you up and also 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.230
 So yes I will start the contraction is 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.250
 to fiorentino 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.330
 and the first few games will 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.850
 probably all right away 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.660
 passing by is boys till later and 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.660
 then I'll see you again soon 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.830
 yo people there we are then we learn to go 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.550
 actually amigurumi should start with 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.170
 violin their tina the winning team of the 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.760
 come and i just picked you see 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.650
 ie me some settings 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.900
 yes pass or that I have set 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.060
 play at legendary five minutes each 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.350
 half I often have on 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.880
 I also have legendary plays 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.210
 while picture as I was playing just because 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.800
 I sometimes got so frustrated with up 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.600
 legendary play it happens so 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.010
 lots of bullshit now and then 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.780
 level that long you have there but I go 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.430
 to start throwing just try on 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.140
 on legendary I also just think that 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.940
 can handle because only occasionally a little 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.630
 can handle the bullshit despite me 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.580
 sometimes that is not even possible so yes we 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.290
 we have to pick is a few players you 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.090
 I don't see georgios getting samaras 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.250
 you think why do you keep learning 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.090
 yes mediocre striker of 70 year cars 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.730
 I would explain everything to you 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.340
 it is almost two meters long 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.720
 and he has 90 gear I mean the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.430
 are enough strikers that have 9 votes 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.620
 they are not nearly two meters tall me 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.210
 wants Peter Kraus almost two meters long 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.910
 imprimÃ© songs also last quite a long time 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.660
 mean samaras measuring almost two meters 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.860
 acceleration 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.200
 and you should not be able to play such players 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.090
 I can walk behind by accident and me 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.190
 so get it as one of the 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.800
 most strikers together jovic and 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.260
 guiseppe rossi and like i chose this well 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.120
 to fire 10 has the relatively benign 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.980
 good selection and here I have it 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.450
 for a moment I just had samaras too 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.640
 he also scores maryse immediately she is 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.170
 the goal in the first practice match 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.790
 So the ball gets played 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.050
 just on the opponent said help dribbles 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.240
 a number of players fairly easy 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.140
 see him beyond and then in that was 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.700
 the 2 0 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.650
 they could still return to a two in one 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.630
 ethical minute but entrea does not help 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.610
 more we win with two one by goal 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.830
 of samaras in guiseppe rossi and i have 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.590
 so good feeling that someone will be more 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.180
 plays really bizarre good you about tits 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.890
 also really good he and then 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.210
 likes and choose rossi that is right behind 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.170
 clearance have also provided a farmer 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.520
 to learn 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.140
 aquilani you also have a whole one 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.090
 shitload to players sitting on the couch 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.330
 which are also of a high level and 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.340
 yes they are all such good players 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.570
 in it almost explains so we 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.180
 are going to have a nice season 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.470
 if you were still a number of people 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.209
 I really have to buy 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.620
 leave them in the comments you can at 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.810
 leave every episode which 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.580
 space I can get the or must go then 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.230
 I know in advance that I was allowed one 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.010
 pair for episodes for walk on the 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.540
 rest 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.070
 so if you are still interested in one 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.489
 certain games or play that I need 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.050
 get it 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.690
 leave it would see if I 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.970
 can try to catch up for the rest and 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.530
 score the 0 in the year the 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.090
 second how people stand by cell through the wego 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.980
 and the two dog that comes again from the 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.959
 At the start of the summer , pay attention to the 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.780
 wrong assumption of the keeper and there was 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.940
 so also quite easily scored 2 0 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.160
 we then get a penalty against me 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.810
 didn't quite understand what I could do 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.940
 seeing is that I don't happen very much 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.950
 really a tackle and then you get one 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.860
 pantyhose against this is utilized and year class 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.110
 only he made two one in the 77th minute 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.820
 but in the end we are going to make the profit 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.950
 couple comes here comes a bizarre beautiful 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.320
 goal a nice barca fits in between 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.150
 and summer was back at it at the end 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.310
 people am wrong with chocolate 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.410
 bottom can rolling flat against the wire 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.300
 was really a nice goal of the whole 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.050
 good match from him he scored two 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.150
 turn over t 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.740
 she made the first and therefore remains three 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.569
 one we grab can't say three 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.639
 points of tackle a nice win one 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.050
 nice morals boost so take it 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.060
 to bring the following with Jan 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.259
 names or a practice match 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.819
 Normally I am not always the person 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.620
 who shows the exhibition games 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:43.180
 In this case, let them do just see 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.639
 bit like introducing the team and 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.080
 see how well yes we are going to play 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.970
 so again you see there we play 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.039
 at legendary five minutes per half 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.169
 and we score pretty much sure 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:56.229
 legendary level and in the competition 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.360
 against fund me the proof was yes me 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.530
 don't know exactly the Neem in paris 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.909
 yes i don't know the name anymore 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.770
 impression that plays and italy ' in this 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:05.319
 is a French team but you saw it again 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.099
 summer as short weather he is well up for years 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.389
 drove 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.830
 iso constant was good for goal again 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.120
 this kiss discount did not score this one 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.069
 learn borava 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.960
 pay attention and they have it easy 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:15.190
 the rebound ball that is released by the 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.659
 keeper 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.219
 animal summer was again with a shot and 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:19.719
 now score that again 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:22.090
 neten's minute he makes another one 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.319
 goal and certainly for the people who just 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.599
 want to start a manager and look for it 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:27.310
 are mediocre to a yes media 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:30.400
 peak hour is not too expensive I guess 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.020
 Samaras anyway because it is a whole 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.240
 long striker a very fast striker one 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.560
 good finishes and definitely an asset to that 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.590
 in your team especially if you have a cheap one 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.240
 striker is looking for he already scores quite often 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.110
 for us 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.699
 but then we will see in the 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.500
 competition how it goes where you go there 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.969
 do only once at the end of the 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.740
 competition come quickly to 4 reasoning 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:49.569
 but I still bring Fred in one 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.449
 of the other purchases a very young one 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.340
 brazilian with that care also statistics 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.199
 it is a bit more expensive than summer was 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.819
 proved but certainly something for one 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:00.340
 investment in the future he makes there 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:02.440
 five more one and so win with fine 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.000
 the rest was sta so this was 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.080
 hopefully the first episode again 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.830
 I liked it and I liked it a bit 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.629
 of course a like behind if you have the 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.219
 liked the video and follow us on twitter 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:13.120
 and facebook those links are also in the 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:14.199
 Description 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.969
 I thank you for looking and me 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.969
