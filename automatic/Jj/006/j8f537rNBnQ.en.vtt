of the water I'd like to see it a bit

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.570 
of the water I'd like to see it a bit
lower<00:02:17.959> than<00:02:18.140> X<00:02:18.350> it<00:02:18.530> means<00:02:18.620> sums<00:02:18.980> it's<00:02:19.430> not

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
lower than X it means sums it's not

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
a cold day today I think we just need to

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.699 
a cold day today I think we just need to
keep<00:02:23.030> our<00:02:23.209> eye<00:02:23.240> on<00:02:23.330> this<00:02:23.630> bed<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.260> we<00:02:24.410> keep<00:02:24.560> an

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
keep our eye on this bed so we keep an

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.340 
keep our eye on this bed so we keep an
eye<00:02:24.800> on<00:02:24.830> all<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.040> beds<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.640> that's<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.239> no<00:02:27.110> no

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
eye on all the beds and that's it no no

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.570 
eye on all the beds and that's it no no
these<00:02:27.530> beds<00:02:27.800> might<00:02:27.980> all<00:02:28.100> look<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.310> same<00:02:28.340> to

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
these beds might all look the same to

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.250 
these beds might all look the same to
you<00:02:28.820> but<00:02:29.000> everyone's<00:02:29.390> different<00:02:29.510> different

stage<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.500> growth<00:02:30.830> different<00:02:31.280> flow<00:02:31.430> of<00:02:31.550> water

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
stage of growth different flow of water

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.550 
stage of growth different flow of water
we<00:02:32.270> need<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.480> check<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.810> top<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:33.170> bottom<00:02:33.410> end

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
we need to check the top and bottom end

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:50.710 
we need to check the top and bottom end
of<00:02:33.680> all<00:02:33.830> of<00:02:33.860> them<00:02:34.160> now<00:02:35.110> okay

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.080 

Steve<00:02:50.990> have<00:02:51.440> done<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.710> every<00:02:52.280> bed<00:02:52.430> checks<00:02:52.760> top

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
Steve have done it every bed checks top

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.970 
Steve have done it every bed checks top
and<00:02:53.330> bottom<00:02:53.990> plugs<00:02:54.350> enough<00:02:54.560> there<00:02:54.740> to<00:02:54.890> keep

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
and bottom plugs enough there to keep

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.890 
and bottom plugs enough there to keep
you<00:02:55.100> busy<00:02:55.190> for<00:02:55.430> at<00:02:55.490> least<00:02:55.580> a<00:02:55.730> week<00:02:55.850> well<00:02:56.390> I<00:02:56.420> wish

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
you busy for at least a week well I wish

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.660 
you busy for at least a week well I wish
you<00:02:57.050> was<00:02:57.170> Howie<00:02:57.470> but<00:02:57.770> things<00:02:58.160> change<00:02:58.460> quickly

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
you was Howie but things change quickly

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.490 
you was Howie but things change quickly
here<00:02:59.150> you<00:02:59.330> know<00:02:59.450> this<00:02:59.630> bed<00:02:59.810> we<00:02:59.930> tested<00:03:00.320> first

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
here you know this bed we tested first

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.470 
here you know this bed we tested first
of<00:03:00.740> all<00:03:00.860> yeah<00:03:01.130> it<00:03:01.220> was<00:03:01.310> bad<00:03:01.460> point<00:03:01.790> for<00:03:02.030> let's

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
of all yeah it was bad point for let's

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.630 
of all yeah it was bad point for let's
try<00:03:02.690> it<00:03:02.750> again<00:03:02.840> now

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.660 

I<00:03:06.750> don't<00:03:07.750> I<00:03:07.930> don't<00:03:08.170> believe<00:03:08.440> it<00:03:08.920> it's<00:03:09.250> over<00:03:09.580> it

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
I don't I don't believe it it's over it

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.630 
I don't I don't believe it it's over it
went<00:03:10.210> fine<00:03:10.560> well<00:03:11.560> it's<00:03:11.800> not<00:03:11.920> surprising<00:03:12.130> it's

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
went fine well it's not surprising it's

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.370 
went fine well it's not surprising it's
turned<00:03:12.880> colder<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.540> crops<00:03:13.780> taking<00:03:14.110> up<00:03:14.170> less

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
turned colder the crops taking up less

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.230 
turned colder the crops taking up less
fertilizer<00:03:14.920> now<00:03:15.280> we've<00:03:15.880> got<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.030> problem

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
fertilizer now we've got a problem

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.880 
fertilizer now we've got a problem
developing<00:03:16.720> in<00:03:17.200> this<00:03:17.319> bed<00:03:17.500> we'll<00:03:17.709> have<00:03:17.800> to

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
developing in this bed we'll have to

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.040 
developing in this bed we'll have to
make<00:03:18.010> some<00:03:18.069> changes<00:03:18.700> but<00:03:18.910> does<00:03:19.690> that<00:03:19.810> mean<00:03:19.959> I

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
make some changes but does that mean I

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.360 
make some changes but does that mean I
now<00:03:20.170> have<00:03:20.350> to<00:03:20.440> test<00:03:20.680> all<00:03:20.800> these<00:03:20.980> beds<00:03:21.190> again

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
now have to test all these beds again

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.980 
now have to test all these beds again
but<00:03:21.940> if<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.120> wasn't<00:03:22.240> for<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.540> fact<00:03:22.750> we've<00:03:22.870> done

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
but if it wasn't for the fact we've done

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.660 
but if it wasn't for the fact we've done
a<00:03:23.020> lot<00:03:23.140> of<00:03:23.170> tests<00:03:23.560> in<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.770> past<00:03:24.010> then<00:03:24.310> yes<00:03:24.490> you

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
a lot of tests in the past then yes you

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.520 
a lot of tests in the past then yes you
would<00:03:24.850> as<00:03:25.240> it<00:03:25.420> is<00:03:25.510> we<00:03:25.690> can<00:03:25.810> take<00:03:25.990> these<00:03:26.110> results

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
would as it is we can take these results

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.500 
would as it is we can take these results
back<00:03:26.740> into<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.040> laboratory<00:03:27.360> compare<00:03:28.360> them

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
back into the laboratory compare them

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.910 
back into the laboratory compare them
with<00:03:28.600> a<00:03:28.630> test<00:03:28.900> we've<00:03:29.050> done<00:03:29.170> in<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.350> past<00:03:29.530> and

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
with a test we've done in the past and

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.680 
with a test we've done in the past and
we<00:03:29.980> can<00:03:30.100> adjust<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.610> flows<00:03:30.880> based<00:03:31.330> on<00:03:31.570> that

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
we can adjust the flows based on that

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:47.170 
we can adjust the flows based on that
evidence

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.760 

so<00:03:48.180> all<00:03:48.300> those<00:03:48.480> lovely<00:03:48.810> bits<00:03:49.140> of<00:03:49.290> watercress

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
so all those lovely bits of watercress

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.590 
so all those lovely bits of watercress
they're<00:03:50.070> all<00:03:50.190> down<00:03:50.460> to<00:03:50.730> measurement<00:03:51.300> fat

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
they're all down to measurement fat

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.470 
they're all down to measurement fat
