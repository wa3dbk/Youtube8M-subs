and<00:02:09.349> then<00:02:09.679> what<00:02:09.890> if<00:02:10.039> i<00:02:10.429> was<00:02:10.519> going<00:02:10.670> to

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
and then what if i was going to

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.649 
and then what if i was going to
Barcelona<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:12.650> we<00:02:13.280> can<00:02:13.430> see<00:02:13.610> charts<00:02:14.090> or<00:02:14.330> maps

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
Barcelona so we can see charts or maps

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.440 
Barcelona so we can see charts or maps
look<00:02:15.349> at<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.560> charts<00:02:16.010> it's<00:02:17.000> not<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.239> pop

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
look at the charts it's not the pop

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.229 
look at the charts it's not the pop
charts<00:02:17.810> people<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.980> weather<00:02:19.129> charts<00:02:19.549> and

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
charts people to the weather charts and

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.759 
charts people to the weather charts and
again<00:02:20.659> you<00:02:20.810> get<00:02:20.930> different<00:02:21.049> options<00:02:21.500> for<00:02:21.590> the

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
again you get different options for the

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.410 
again you get different options for the
time<00:02:21.980> period<00:02:22.010> on<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:22.519> top<00:02:22.819> there<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.030> was<00:02:23.209> still

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
time period on the top there I was still

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.619 
time period on the top there I was still
with<00:02:23.540> Lou<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.049> I<00:02:24.110> got<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.349> 48<00:02:24.739> hour<00:02:24.890> for<00:02:25.190> now<00:02:25.629> so

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
with Lou and I got to 48 hour for now so

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.180 
with Lou and I got to 48 hour for now so
we<00:02:26.720> got<00:02:26.840> a<00:02:26.870> 48<00:02:27.230> hour<00:02:27.349> trial<00:02:27.680> on<00:02:27.799> the<00:02:27.890> bottom

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
we got a 48 hour trial on the bottom

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.100 
we got a 48 hour trial on the bottom
dialogue<00:02:28.519> and<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:28.730> can<00:02:28.849> see<00:02:31.209> so<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.269> go<00:02:32.329> to<00:02:32.390> 27

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
dialogue and you can see so you go to 27

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.649 
dialogue and you can see so you go to 27

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
think I can swipe the icon soir there

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.960 
think I can swipe the icon soir there
and<00:02:53.209> change<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:54.440> London<00:02:54.920> or<00:02:55.540> Washington

get<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.000> seven<00:02:59.540> day<00:02:59.750> and<00:02:59.989> it<00:03:00.049> gives<00:03:00.230> me<00:03:00.349> the

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
get a seven day and it gives me the

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.089 
get a seven day and it gives me the
whole<00:03:00.760> seven<00:03:01.760> days<00:03:02.060> on<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:02.450> bottom<00:03:02.840> there<00:03:03.099> so

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
whole seven days on the bottom there so

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.059 
whole seven days on the bottom there so
a<00:03:04.129> chance<00:03:04.459> of<00:03:04.609> rain<00:03:04.670> as<00:03:05.090> well<00:03:05.239> look<00:03:05.859> getting<00:03:06.859> in

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
a chance of rain as well look getting in

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.970 
a chance of rain as well look getting in
there<00:03:07.280> there<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.870> just<00:03:09.319> then<00:03:09.620> it's<00:03:09.650> quite<00:03:09.950> a

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
there there so just then it's quite a

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.599 
there there so just then it's quite a
seesaw<00:03:10.400> well<00:03:10.670> presented<00:03:11.410> we<00:03:12.410> can<00:03:12.650> then<00:03:12.919> how<00:03:13.459> do

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
seesaw well presented we can then how do

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.050 
seesaw well presented we can then how do
we<00:03:13.790> then<00:03:13.940> do<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.299> I'm<00:03:14.540> back<00:03:15.169> I<00:03:15.410> think<00:03:15.880> so<00:03:16.880> then

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
we then do it I'm back I think so then

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.620 
we then do it I'm back I think so then
back<00:03:17.269> on<00:03:17.419> the<00:03:17.510> main<00:03:17.750> main<00:03:18.680> sort<00:03:19.069> of<00:03:19.160> screen<00:03:19.630> and

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
back on the main main sort of screen and

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.400 
back on the main main sort of screen and
we're<00:03:20.810> going<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.049> go<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.230> maps<00:03:23.230> now<00:03:24.230> they're<00:03:24.379> a

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
we're going to go to maps now they're a

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.650 
we're going to go to maps now they're a
bit<00:03:24.590> odd<00:03:24.680> in<00:03:24.859> that<00:03:25.120> it's<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.180> little<00:03:26.209> bit<00:03:26.419> on<00:03:26.540> how

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
bit odd in that it's a little bit on how

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.180 
bit odd in that it's a little bit on how
its<00:03:26.810> laid<00:03:26.959> out<00:03:27.019> so<00:03:27.530> you<00:03:27.620> get<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:27.859> options

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
its laid out so you get the options

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.170 
its laid out so you get the options
along<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.459> bottom<00:03:28.609> of<00:03:28.819> what<00:03:28.970> might<00:03:29.150> be

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
along the bottom of what might be

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.849 
along the bottom of what might be
looking<00:03:29.569> at<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:29.840> then<00:03:29.930> kind<00:03:30.109> of<00:03:30.169> a<00:03:30.290> slightly

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
looking at and then kind of a slightly

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.619 
looking at and then kind of a slightly
squashed<00:03:31.310> looking<00:03:31.930> map<00:03:32.930> just<00:03:33.590> there<00:03:34.510> if<00:03:35.510> you

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
squashed looking map just there if you

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.509 
squashed looking map just there if you
look<00:03:35.810> at<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.079> i<00:03:36.230> can<00:03:36.500> i<00:03:36.709> can<00:03:36.829> either<00:03:37.040> okay<00:03:37.459> the

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
look at the i can i can either okay the

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.059 
look at the i can i can either okay the
slide<00:03:37.940> them<00:03:38.269> i<00:03:38.980> can<00:03:39.980> tap<00:03:41.709> satellite<00:03:42.709> view<00:03:42.739> for

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
slide them i can tap satellite view for

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.409 
slide them i can tap satellite view for
the<00:03:43.099> cloud<00:03:43.400> that's<00:03:43.579> quite<00:03:43.910> a<00:03:43.940> useful<00:03:44.120> one<00:03:44.359> I

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
the cloud that's quite a useful one I

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.960 
the cloud that's quite a useful one I
think<00:03:44.919> where<00:03:45.919> do<00:03:45.980> we<00:03:46.069> see<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.549> time<00:03:46.760> up

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
think where do we see the to the time up

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.780 
think where do we see the to the time up
there<00:03:50.739> so<00:03:51.739> you<00:03:51.829> can<00:03:52.040> see<00:03:52.220> whether<00:03:52.400> what<00:03:52.699> the

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
there so you can see whether what the

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:53.860 
there so you can see whether what the
clouds<00:03:52.970> been<00:03:53.120> doing<00:03:53.299> gives<00:03:53.449> you<00:03:53.540> a<00:03:53.569> rough<00:03:53.690> idea

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
clouds been doing gives you a rough idea

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.780 
clouds been doing gives you a rough idea
I<00:03:54.319> suppose<00:03:54.680> of<00:03:54.859> what<00:03:55.160> happened<00:03:55.549> through<00:03:55.699> the

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
I suppose of what happened through the

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.720 
I suppose of what happened through the
day<00:03:57.639> current<00:03:58.639> conditions<00:04:00.730> minimum
