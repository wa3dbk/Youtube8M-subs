 because he was in the middle of the known world 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.260

 the paradise of the bible 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:20.239
 Attention is drawn to a historical fact 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:23.019
 where the Teutons wandered 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.339
 while they called him pious memory of their Nordic homeland 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:29.560
 the citizens flow and settlements 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.989
 like today 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.359
 with native name 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.039
 Newfoundland 9 Braunschweig Neukölln new Berlin 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:41.839
 so you can find the name last year or truly a 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:43.000
 in Germany 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 France Poland Greece India 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.729
 a core team 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:50.929
 that is Germans one 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:52.249
 in Persia 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:56.019
 every field and mountains in Asia Minor and Atlantis 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:58.859
 and so on 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.429
 Edlinger gives a lot of examples in his book Baldur and Bible 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:07.119
 and also the chair in his book that Orvana is lying 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:10.569
 and still glory downfall 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.439
 it is possible that the Teutons sometimes like their most beautiful settlements 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.779
 home to serve paradise same Barça 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.059
 Farmland to the Danes 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:24.809
 that had been equal to farmers 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:26.980
 can be found in the river name 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.599
 Baradar 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.879
 at Damascus 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.729
 Go here for questions from Ben Gurion 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:36.729
 the discovery of paradise 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:40.419
 So-called Paradise, there have been several 

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:44.679
 show and show you the evergreen garden of paradise 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.169
 on the long hair 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.489
 been sold from abroad and wafers 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.669
 the oldest may well have been the break of the emigrant brand in Germany 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.869
 we were 4 1 from when turning in his work 

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:01.869
 the discovery of paradise written 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:06.849
 Starting from there also the paradise is sign with the Germanic migrant and 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.849
 Autobooms are in the whole world 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:13.440
 the Teutons brought the colored rattles 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.200
 these are people similar people not just culture 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.200
 but as the trouble says her language 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.090
 the oldest culture language in the world is unique 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.909
 why Germanic 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:28.909
 all languages ​​have borrowed from her 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:32.340
 It therefore can not be surprising 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.159
 when we are in the former settlement areas of Germanic tribes 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:39.610
 Nordic-sounding names and louder sounds, however 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.439
 what is the rain assumption of a Duke Germanic race and language 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:45.490
 Has 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.360
 it is also natural 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.129
 that the emigrants of their ancient customs and traditions 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:53.779
 transplant into the new home 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:58.540
 Lena Atlantis also find the Arsenal Kings of the Holy Mountains 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.250
 and only old Germanic cult customs, which of course many see 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.850
 become 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.020
 from which each patient has been distorted into vile 

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:12.420
 the immigrated Nordic area 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.460
 multiplied only by the many fruits in this giant garden 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:20.800
 14 gates were forbidden to them 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.800
 why the Tyroleans without shyness themselves species 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.610
 they are not originally with the blood of the animals 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:32.179
 while the Niederrad they equal the dark peoples of the animals of the 

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:33.999
 Feldes lived there 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:36.999
 and often not much less than predators 

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:42.610
 Again and again the outstanding Arian of ancient history becomes the 

00:05:42.609 --> 00:05:44.009
 Grazer reports 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.009
 that live meatless and only from fruits 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:52.539
 Robert Springer apparently has a very large and magnificent work for her 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:54.389
 delivered 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.080
 Robert Springer's book for Car Porn 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.610
 Cultural history of humanity in the light of the war was lost in Chile 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:02.550
 Hanover 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.860
 in pain and Sennfeld 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.030
 He is living with the increasing mix with the animals on Atlantis 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.029
 People 

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:14.119
 and with that created by the icing in distress 

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:17.159
 The meat was also eaten at the areas 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.050
 Atlantis Fergie in the writings of the ancient called Isle of the Blessed 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.800
 the immigrants also called it fall this year 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.689
 from Igor the first mother 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:31.800
 the surrounding mountains Heesen 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.559
 as can be seen from the figures per year 

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:36.789
 the IGA mountains 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:41.550
 then the mythologies of the ancient culture peoples predominantly with the knee Darfeld 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.770
 to keep oneself busy 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.999
 on which in the main the first culture period of the area took place 

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:50.339
 so are the old ones the singer 

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:52.669
 who are drawn to the game of the field 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:54.550
 probably short 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.460
 Elgar has not been named 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.120
 the name nieder is still preserved in German geographical name
