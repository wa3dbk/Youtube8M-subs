00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
okay so using the key trend I went for

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
okay so using the key trend I went for
the<00:03:53.570> safe<00:03:54.570> surf<00:03:54.810> which<00:03:55.050> is<00:03:55.200> fine<00:03:55.790> didn't<00:03:56.790> want

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
the safe surf which is fine didn't want

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.540 
the safe surf which is fine didn't want
to<00:03:56.970> predict<00:03:57.330> and<00:03:57.770> it's<00:03:58.770> great<00:03:58.950> britain<00:03:59.370> said

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
to predict and it's great britain said

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.700 
to predict and it's great britain said
so<00:03:59.670> he<00:03:59.940> after<00:04:00.300> this<00:04:00.750> match<00:04:00.960> told<00:04:01.260> me<00:04:01.380> he<00:04:01.530> says

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
so he after this match told me he says

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.790 
so he after this match told me he says
it<00:04:01.830> was<00:04:01.920> carved<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.550> I<00:04:03.440> guess<00:04:04.440> it<00:04:04.650> doesn't

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
it was carved and I guess it doesn't

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.100 
it was carved and I guess it doesn't
have<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.010> punch<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.670> if<00:04:05.820> it<00:04:05.940> does<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.240> guess<00:04:06.720> he

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
have a punch and if it does I guess he

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.110 
have a punch and if it does I guess he
may<00:04:07.620> predict<00:04:08.040> me<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.220> switch<00:04:08.520> fearing<00:04:09.030> the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
may predict me a switch fearing the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.590 
may predict me a switch fearing the
bullet<00:04:09.330> punch<00:04:10.760> and<00:04:11.760> he<00:04:12.000> was<00:04:12.090> in<00:04:12.150> his<00:04:12.270> pursuit

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
bullet punch and he was in his pursuit

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.240 
bullet punch and he was in his pursuit
which<00:04:12.990> is<00:04:13.110> why<00:04:13.200> I<00:04:13.230> assume<00:04:13.500> he<00:04:13.620> was<00:04:13.710> gonna<00:04:13.860> do<00:04:14.040> so

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
which is why I assume he was gonna do so

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.289 
which is why I assume he was gonna do so
I<00:04:14.280> didn't<00:04:14.490> switch<00:04:14.640> in<00:04:14.850> the<00:04:15.000> first<00:04:15.240> place<00:04:17.299> so

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
I didn't switch in the first place so

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.090 
I didn't switch in the first place so
yeah<00:04:18.480> he<00:04:18.720> goes<00:04:18.870> forth<00:04:19.230> on<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.650> ball<00:04:19.770> here<00:04:19.920> I

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
yeah he goes forth on the ball here I

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.380 
yeah he goes forth on the ball here I
think<00:04:20.370> I<00:04:20.489> could<00:04:20.549> live<00:04:20.730> in<00:04:20.880> Massie's<00:04:21.180> life

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
think I could live in Massie's life

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.600 
think I could live in Massie's life
formed<00:04:21.780> arm<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:23.420> he<00:04:24.420> isn't<00:04:24.540> so<00:04:25.410> I<00:04:25.470> take<00:04:26.190> a<00:04:26.250> good

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
formed arm and he isn't so I take a good

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.520 
formed arm and he isn't so I take a good
chunk<00:04:26.940> out<00:04:27.210> of<00:04:27.270> him<00:04:27.540> with<00:04:27.720> surf<00:04:27.990> just<00:04:28.290> in<00:04:28.350> case

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
chunk out of him with surf just in case

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.480 
chunk out of him with surf just in case
he<00:04:28.560> felt<00:04:28.860> like<00:04:28.950> switching<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:30.690> go<00:04:30.900> for<00:04:31.230> the

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.620 

though<00:04:35.490> he<00:04:35.790> goes<00:04:35.880> first<00:04:36.120> honorable<00:04:36.420> here<00:04:36.570> we

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
though he goes first honorable here we

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.590 
though he goes first honorable here we
go<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:36.750> Snorlax<00:04:37.260> I<00:04:37.500> staying<00:04:38.330> he<00:04:39.330> stays<00:04:39.570> in
