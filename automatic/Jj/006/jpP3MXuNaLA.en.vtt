00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.150
 here is what gave my sabarat leg 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.910
 so she stayed to push two 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.130
 hours 1h30 2h as I you 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.929
 explained it and so she doubled 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.920
 volume 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.600
 no now I'm going to mold and I 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.740
 go the mold three ways to 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.660
 to know a debate or discussion 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.350
 cap stopper because they have the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.350
 shape of a champagne cork 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.030
 so I'm going to cry 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.489
 first of all my work plan this 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.489
 dough is a little bit sticky people do not 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:46.730
 not hesitate to cry well and I will 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:48.920
 empty my paw on the worktop and 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.550
 I always use a horn 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:56.809
 it's much more convenient and there is no 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.809
 loss of goods 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:11.610
 so I flour well legs I look 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.610
 all the gas she has stored 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.460
 and I'm forming a ball 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:31.310
 so now I'm going to divide it 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.619
 must fill the mold to the third or even to 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.869
 cards her height think she's going 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.390
 push if you put too much she goes 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:43.610
 too much push and the edges of the donations for 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:50.330
 the babouche mussels have I take a 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:51.189
 little ball of dough that I shape well 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.210
 wave 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.210
 I do not add a little bit anyway 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.799
 I flour but must if it sticks 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:11.319
 here I form a ball wii has no 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:16.900
 figure that the surface is very smooth and 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:23.019
 ja lay in the bottom and I cup it from 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:24.790
 uniform way in the bottom here 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.950
 I use ice cream exo balls that are 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.330
 in composite materials that does not require 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.330
 no previous greasing 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:46.790
 for baba mussels I take a 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.629
 little bit of dough 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.459
 you see I'm using horn 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:54.829
 also like a knife in allows 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:57.709
 of well sliced ​​my paw and divide 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:03.379
 my stick in small pieces 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:07.739
 I form a ball that I like positioned 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:10.409
 in the middle and I simply support 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:14.489
 way to the stall is uniformly in the 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:18.209
 mold to make pardons sprouts 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.949
 dibaba equal the ideal is to weigh 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.049
 if you put in winning the step in 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.819
 ain for doing odd jobs 5 g 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.680
 like that you will really have babas 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.260
 of identical size 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.859
 there I do it a little freehand 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.340
 so I have babas a little more 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:39.449
 wholesale an other shop and for the 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.599
 savarin I will take the rest of 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.599
 pasta 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.390
 and that I flour one last time that 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.900
 I put in bubbles way to slide well 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.900
 once again on the surface 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:03.170
 I think about the work plan and I 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.750
 point with my finger in the center then there 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:11.060
 it's important to aim for 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:13.510
 a crown of identical diameter and 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.510
 I spread 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:28.919
 it only remains to come to drop my 

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:32.300
 dough in the savarin mold and has 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.300
 make him marry the bottom of the mold 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.590
 like this here no I put my mussels 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:41.330
 still warm for the latest shoot 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.220
 before cooking 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.740
 you have to count I think a little 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.289
 hour it is necessary that the dough arrives flush 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.530
 the smart mold and messing at this level 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.610
 there is stuffed at 180 ° during 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.389
 25 minutes 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.639
 so we find ourselves just now our 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.050
 beats savannah finished pushing us 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.180
 let's go cooking then you 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.729
 see I really stopped when 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.169
 the dough comes flush with the mold for 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.430
 baba molds it's a little bit 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.319
 different since they are not very high 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.970
 it is necessary that the dough exceeds a 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:14.849
 little bit but do not go further 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.440
 and for plugs 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.060
 the dough is almost up to it's going 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.330
 stop there so with regards to the 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.270
 so obviously grows before cooking 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.490
 we will spend the gilding gilding 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.130
 it is egg yolk diluted in a 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.469
 tablespoon of water so a spoon 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.990
 water for 1 egg yolk 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:37.139
 that a little bit with a fork 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.699
 Gently brush is applied without 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.389
 press too much to avoid dropping 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:41.389
 the dough of course 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:49.449
 no I bake his preparations to 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:52.690
 180 degrees in a preheated oven well 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:56.020
 sure and we are right after 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:59.680
 cooking north about 25 minutes a 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:02.789
 right now which we know are 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.340
 out of the oven they fled they 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:07.600
 adopted a beautiful golden color 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.550

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.850
 oven 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.400
 and now remains only at the 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.110
 unmold and finished of course the 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.270
 not preparing this because this cake 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.520
 do not eat like that so it takes 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.280
 their baby must prepare a syrup 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.320
 of 2010 pages that will be fine 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:30.610
