00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.160
 hey people what gives 10 hits 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.929
 Welcome to this short video 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.700
 today there is no ordinary 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.160
 format they otherwise from my 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.750
 channels knows but a fixes 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.340
 Information video in which I give you 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.189
 Just take a look at my new let's play 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.019
 channel for us hd-video spelling 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.859
 of course wants to draw attention now 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.900
 you probably ask 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.240
 What is one to offer that no 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.130
 short on last start number 15 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.540
 what most people probably do now 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.969
 ask why question why 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.730
 I have 415 own fifa channel I have 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.219
 easy for things like this just 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.480
 wipro pat and and the stuff i do 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.040
 just not on my main channel 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.750
 I can bring and I can do that on everyone 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.340
 case uncut upload and so we will 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.789
 I think a lot of fun together 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.250
 to have 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.460
 call of duty advanced 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.500
 makes absolutely new and ingenious plays 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.120
 I have a lot of fun I have to admit 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.600
 I'm not necessarily the best call of 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.489
 Duty has recognized the black ops 2016 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.939
 I think now in advanced warfighter 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.530
 I have 13 academies but in total 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.090
 the deck always goes in anyway 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.220
 order it is perhaps not synonymous 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.170
 so much a matter of gameplays also Stubert to 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.130
 the entertainment you can me 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.570
 maybe a little bit too 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.950
 watching me get better and 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.840
 Maybe I'll be friends 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.580
 together for a roadshow comment 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.530
 or other the lead price of fifa 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.210
 some call of duty on the water 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.290
 can start there and many have 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.200
 they are already playing on one 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.540
 facebook page wanted the first 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.229
 right let's play should he should then 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.509
 to your game 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.280
 sunset overdrive gm i have the game 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.869
 about days since three have one already 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.030
 a little bit of the job is a lot of fun for me 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.439
 is a bit like infamous just yet 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.420
 a bit more colorful a bit 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.340
 wacky who is a trailer for 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.860
 the white has definitely looked 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.850
 what I'm talking about, maybe 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.770
 still with facebook 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.930
 we have to look at that anyway 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.299
 The whole thing happens to you 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.640
 Suffering is the start of a right one 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.840
 let's play that too we just have to 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.570
 wait and see 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.310
 my gta friends, of course, too 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.710
 should not go out empty on the channel 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.450
 there's an online let's play for gta 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.489
 5 where I just take a bit 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.410
 like i shit online games bohlen 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.870
 friend now just racers or 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.319
 death matches player but only 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.870
 on 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.090
 nextgen console than on the xbox of 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.280
 There the game is supposed to come two weeks 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.099
 then out sometime the whole thing should be 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.420
 definitely start 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.760
 Conference play friends I could play 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.739
 Forza horizon 2 I think so 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.590
 quite the best racing game that 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.060
 currently on the market is graphic 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.709
 Super gameplays can be over there 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.840
 actually complain about nothing 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.280
 As I said , everything I pay attention to 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.419
 Now just say , play is 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.609
 proposals and they do not have to 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:43.139
 inevitably on the channel comes through it 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.269
 naturally also on your opinion excited 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:46.950
 It is the same with league of legends 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.810
 this is actually a game in the 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.340
 community is always a lot of money 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.859
 because of that still uncertain about that 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.209
 can deliver currently plays anyway 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.919
 not so much but if i do it again 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.540
 more games and only in the forest can it 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.370
 that in any case give then there 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.629
 there are many more stars that we 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.389
 just try so high 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.040
 if, for example, really horny games 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.419
 can come out that my piece far 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.250
 always test how it arrives with you 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:11.400
 and we can of course let's play 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.879
 from current and new players 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.949
 do 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.389
 the upload guess my other his 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:17.250
 Of course, channels are not under 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.930
 this new channel will suffer 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.909
 continue at least every other day 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.019
 something from my gta and on one 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.060
 provide tv channel 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.889
 looks like I said at the let's 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.079
 play channel over and subscribe 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:30.180
 nothing more to miss to go straight to 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.310
 Kanal at the same time just looks at the top 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.449
 in the video description and in this 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.250
 video I'll think I'm the one 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:37.560
 Just turn off rating there 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.049
 is not a regular video and therefore 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.009
 the rating is a bit weird 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.900
 would fail 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:44.069
 Let's just say it like that 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.319
 Hope you let us know then on a let's go 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.319
 play cellar again out people and
