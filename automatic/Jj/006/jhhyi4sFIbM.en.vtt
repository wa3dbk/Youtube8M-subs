00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.770
 good to all the people of youtube in this 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:11.100
 case I'm going to make a video of the 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:14.430
 beringer vm x 1000 usb 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.030
 this video I'm doing because in 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.030
 Youtube 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.610
 do not appear many videos of what 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.260
 regarding this brand 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.120
 this is the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.120
 there it is 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.820
 behringer vm x 1000 usb 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:41.390
 good in this case this good he 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.170
 the purpose of the video is that it also 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.699
 me when I bought this mixer 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.969
 I was a bit complicated 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:53.329
 collection and the type of well to know 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.280
 how do I know how to work with him with him 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.900
 with the usb input that is here from this 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.930
 that side is it seems to me 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.030
 well I made a mistake at the beginning 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.070
 I was the amplifier I was 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.930
 connecting in the outputs here of the 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.260
 record 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.760
 to see if it appears there is 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.850
 let's forgive the quality I do not have 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.470
 lighting also my camera is very 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.470
 of poor quality good he 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.359
 what I did was change the connection in 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:31.189
 place to put it here in record mode what 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:33.170
 I went to the main mode in mind and then I 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.240
 I made the connection 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.049
 the advantage of this mixer I think that 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:43.090
 Well, many already know it is the tickets 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.829
 as for subwoofer and for the media 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.820
 here are the other connections the 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.420
 other entries 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.220
 that would be also 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.140
 here come the line 1 line 23 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.920
 this case I am using lines is 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.140
 where it says line 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.290
 the fire can use it as for a 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:08.200
 this 12 turntables or our new ones 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.880
 ok in this case that's how it was all 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.000
 this 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.310
 I repeat this I had to change it to the world 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.710
 mail so the microphone can sound 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.730
 if you connect in the mode of 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.990
 new record will not add the microphone 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.990
 so what I did was change it to 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:30.380
 menu that was what I did 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:34.280
 ok these we are that this is for the 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.280
 amplifier here are for the the 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.670
 subwoofer and that would be a bass and two 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.670
 media 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.340
 because once connected Yet even now 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.190
 they would have what would be access to 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.170
 only mic would lack the xl 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.620
 repair them the microphone that would be the 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.790
 line 1 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.790
 and online 2 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.740
 and then, well, nothing simply because 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.140
 to explain how some 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.970
 how is the operation of the brand 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.180
 behringer, in fact, it did come out very 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.800
 well it 's a very good brand I liked it 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.570
 a lot and then 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.780
 what else but it seems that that is 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.970
 any questions please all needs 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.250
 a comment anything I'm going to 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.990
 try to answer all the 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.830
 comments here on youtube 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:35.240
 and as good as any doubt 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:38.480
 here we are hope I have served you and 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:42.610
 Well, you know, I'm using the 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.260
 usb usb input for the virtual dj 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.750
 for the virtual dj it's very easy to 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.030
 configuration of this post right now 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.070
 I have loss I do not have the one to download to 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.050
 the computer but already in the next 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.950
 video then I'll show you how I do not 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.950
 I have configured 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:05.060
 and another thing I forgot to mention that 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:07.640
 I have been using the virtual dj 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.630
 here where is the 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.120
 to see that there it is 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:17.330
 is on channel one I'm not using 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.620
 as the ibex I saw as the usb then what 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.470
 which means that this line I am 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.650
 using me for the virtual dj 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.470
 but I could not configure it to use 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.830
 the two cymbals of the virtual dj 1 in 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.210
 this side and on channel 2 that's what 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.390
 I have not been able to estimate if it has been done to me 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.740
 a little complicated what I have done is 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.130
 what he was doing is that the 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.480
 virtual dj I'm driving it both 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.500
 I'm driving with a single 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.820
 channel also there is any 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.310
 recommendation that you can give me for 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.830
 to be able to configure the virtual dj to 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.570
 both for the two channels or for 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.160
 use a cymbal of this channel one and 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.980
 came second dish for channel two 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.620
 I would appreciate it a lot and well 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.200
 here we are any doubt I am not a 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.430
 expert me here in the audio and 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.640
 connection I hope 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.660
 we make the good attempt for any 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.660
 I'm waiting for your comments 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.169
 well anything, here we are 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.169
