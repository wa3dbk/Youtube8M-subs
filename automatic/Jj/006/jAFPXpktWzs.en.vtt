00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.080
 incredible or incredible 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.840
 truman has connected thousands of wagons in 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.340
 his 10-year career but today his 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.410
 routine is about to change 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.420
 I was on one of the wagons and 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.820
 I was advancing on the rails to connect it 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.030
 with another wagon he was standing on it 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.740
 when he suddenly loses his balance 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.700
 surprisingly truman falls on his feet without 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.560
 no scratch 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.320
 but now he faces his worst 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.330
 nightmare a 20-ton wagon is 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.270
 toward him and there is no way 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.910
 stop it 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.670
 I barely had enough time to 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.800
 be able to stand up and the mechanism of 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.790
 coupling that is what connects each one 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.010
 of the wagons 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.079
 hit me in the chest 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.999
 and in that moment 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.999
 I could not let go and 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.990
 of course this was dragging me 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.489
 by the ways at that time was that I 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.200
 I turned to see how much space 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.750
 was how much was the distance 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.400
 there was between the wagon and I started 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.370
 run backwards as fast as 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.830
 I could and I let go but I could not 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.440
 truman is dragged under the wheel 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.420
 of the train which passed over the just 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.310
 below the waist leaving a part 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.920
 of his body trapped in the mechanism of 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.950
 front he hit me very hard 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.590
 did it hurt 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.420
 and made me get up a little and there 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.610
 it was when I took the cen and I held on 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.259
 hit with overwhelming force the 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.190
 lower body of truman was 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.980
 partially be nothing 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.620
 finally the wagons were coupled and 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.480
 I started editing things as help help 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.640
 I felt a little panic and then when 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.850
 everything stopped I tried to understand that 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.050
 it happened is a scene worse than any 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.110
 horror movie 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.480
 truman was dragged over 22 meters and 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.490
 he was trapped under the train and the part 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.450
 lower body is twisted 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.450
 between the brakes 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.780
 despite the terrible pain truman 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.660
 somehow he manages to return 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.600
 I was lying there and I realized 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.290
 that I could use my cell phone 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.569
 truman dials the emergency number 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.060
 the paramedics brought a man 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.030
 hit by a train and the first thing that 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.250
 I thought was that I would have to declare his 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.460
 death 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.940
 but taking in cannes is still alive just 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.920
 he has lost more than 50% of his blood and 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.260
 has injuries that would scare even a 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.630
 veteran as Dr. Smith was 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.790
 party in half in all the years 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.230
 that I have worked in the emergency department 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.560
 had seen anyone with that kind of 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.240
 injury or less that could survive 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.700
 the pelvis of truman is completely 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.709
 shattered his left leg is 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.360
 hanging alone from a piece of skin and its 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.420
 right leg is no longer 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.580
 in a part of his abdominal wall there was 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.920
 just a layer of skin that separated the 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.230
 outer world of its intra content 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.370
 abdominal so to speak so what 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.920
 some people would call bowels and if 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.190
 would have been torn would have been 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.960
 bad because we would have 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.090
 I had to deal with an area 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.250
 contaminated producing a serious 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.410
 infection since his body was full 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.990
 of pollutants by the time we finish 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.430
 the operation at first I thought that 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.800
 had taken part of what 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.050
 we would find in a wooden warehouse 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.840
 and gravel because there was a lot of grass 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:35.300
 gravel and wood embedded throughout the 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.410
 area of ​​the wound which was huge 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.690
 Y 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.180
 the fact that his chest did not result 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.880
 wounded also favored in his 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.210
 prognosis since he could breathe and 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.130
 he could feed himself through his tube 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.680
 digestive truman is subjected to a 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.220
 emergency surgery nobody believes that 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.220
 resist 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.650
 in the first operation we remove all the 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.200
 mutilated tissue including all the bone 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.170
 and the tissue attached to it 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.480
 so this and this should be seen 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.940
 same so we removed the same 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.980
 amount of bone on this side the pelvis 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.209
 human is a structure 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.639
 exceptionally strong I can take your 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:20.090
 Pelvis put her on the floor and jump 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:22.310
 over it without breaking the well of 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.040
 strong is the pelvis and for a 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.330
 person support all this damage and that 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.340
 also be alive is amazing is 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.850
 extraordinary during the next six 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.330
 weeks 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.880
 Truman undergoes 22 surgeries plus 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.600
 doctors describe their recovery as 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.130
 nothing less than a miracle most of 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.919
 the times someone with this kind of 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.080
 injury would not be seen by a doctor but 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.820
 that I would die in the place all I know 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.820
 is that I should be dead 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.660
 but 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.889
 despite all the bad things that happened 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.889
 I managed to survive
