looks like they b-flat minor half two
minutes<00:02:28.080> actually<00:02:28.170> it's<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.650> beef<00:02:28.800> laughter

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
minutes actually it's a beef laughter

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.980 
minutes actually it's a beef laughter
minutes<00:02:29.310> there<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.520> go<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.850> just<00:02:30.209> looked<00:02:30.390> at<00:02:30.510> so

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
minutes there you go I just looked at so

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:37.780 
minutes there you go I just looked at so
you<00:02:31.050> have<00:02:31.230> an<00:02:31.350> e<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.770> flat<00:02:32.370> B<00:02:32.850> flat<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:34.850> D<00:02:35.850> flat

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
you have an e a flat B flat and a D flat

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.340

so<00:02:39.410> B<00:02:40.410> flat<00:02:40.680> half<00:02:40.980> diminished<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:42.209> flat<00:02:43.140> major

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
so B flat half diminished a flat major

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.699 
so B flat half diminished a flat major
over<00:02:43.530> C<00:02:45.140> that's<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.230> B<00:02:46.380> flat<00:02:46.500> half<00:02:46.650> diminished

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
over C that's the B flat half diminished

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.620 
over C that's the B flat half diminished
again<00:02:47.310> but<00:02:47.550> this<00:02:47.760> time<00:02:47.819> because<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.569> the

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.250 
again but this time because of the
different<00:02:48.989> basis<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.680> D<00:02:50.040> flat<00:02:50.340> minor<00:02:51.270> 13<00:02:51.870> but

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
different basis is D flat minor 13 but

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.229 
different basis is D flat minor 13 but
we're<00:02:52.500> not<00:02:52.620> going<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.769> split<00:02:53.010> hairs<00:02:53.239> same
