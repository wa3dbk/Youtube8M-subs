00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.890
 They are very good and well, the day of 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.400
 today I bring you a top 5 channels of 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.999
 minecraft these channels in which we have 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.519
 influenced a lot since they have good 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:19.029
 influenced a lot because they invited us to 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:23.089
 play this game with your videos 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:25.400
 related to motorcycles because textures of 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:28.640
 laugh - grabbing anything 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.070
 true and good attention 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.190
 I had made a top previously of 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.420
 very good minecraft channels too 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.360
 that leave us description so that what 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.820
 see also and well these channels are 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.290
 of 10,000 subscribers up these 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.210
 channels that show below 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.980
 I put them in the previous one because I did not 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.720
 I found separately if there were 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.780
 found I would not have put them because 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.629
 the video would be much longer than 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.339
 is because it lasts 10 minutes but good 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.449
 I will not make them longer either 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.449
 this video and we will continue 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.860
 ah 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.860
 the cans with kicks 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.610
 and good people appointment we start in the 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:23.540
 position number 5 we have a ruiz bacon 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.960
 this channel uploads videos of what I do not like 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.220
 parodies expectations are age 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.840
 The videos are really good 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.630
 I really recommend them a lot 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.330
 his first video that came up was one of the 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.360
 that in parody but as a type 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.920
 Survival and he could say good because 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.900
 if you want to have a fun time 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.930
 their videos is that they are very, very 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.460
 good the truth are highly recommended 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.160
 does not have much time that began to climb 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.760
 videos like last year in the middle of 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.380
 last year but the truth is that they are 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.300
 very good is growing very 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.910
 quickly does not have much like a month 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.160
 I had seven thousand subscribers in the video 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.870
 previous that I did there had seven thousand 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.030
 but I did not put on because it makes you weak and 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.000
 as you know it is 10,000 up but 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.679
 now has 12 thousand 738 subscribers 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.310
 the air goes away and well then if not 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.310

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:21.280

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.660
 well, in this channel you will find 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.700
 a variety of maps of parkour mod 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.880
 the basics of any channel 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.640
 minecraft but you know that any 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.950
 channel has some difference the 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.650
 another one has some expressions 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.870
 different others with other others because 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.360
 It has started since much longer 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.140
 before a few years before others because 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.310
 They throw a lot of editing and well, nothing 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.800
 there's nothing more to say this channel its 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.780
 first video was one of how to duplicate 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.660
 diamonds or how to duplicate things is 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.330
 a basic and maximum trick that almost 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.519
 most know that putt of minecraft and 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.680
 Well, there's nothing more to say 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.510
 we go with the next channel 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.650

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:33.349

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:40.700
 a survivor series started like this 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.859
 basically as if it were I do not know that the 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.730
 ppc a world normally a series of 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:49.049
 Surf just as it has no more mystery 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:54.390
 and well, this channel also goes up 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.390
 maps I think I already said maps 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.209
 Hunger Games' series mods 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:06.069

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.579
 to add and that kind of thing and good 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.490
 there's nothing more to say with this 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:14.610
 channel 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.010
 to see there is nothing more to say good 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.510
 so let's go with the next video and I 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.510
 I say channel forgiveness 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:32.660
 and good people if you are in the position 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:40.400
 number two we have minecraft universe 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:42.590
 in this channel has 68 thousand 447 if 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.340
 I'm not more but I do not write well 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.970
 but good to see in this channel are going to 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:54.890
 find minimum peace or maps maps of 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:58.970
 adventures or paco olmos news and so 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:02.420
 from that type it was already clear in the 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:08.089
 his first video that uploaded this channel was 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:12.269
 one in a way but serious for the 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:16.079
 8.1 9.0 I do not remember very well but 

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:17.579
 well this is the way it went and so 

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:19.469
 There's nothing more to say, either, 

00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:21.869
 be so long this video lasts about 56 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:26.189
 minutes and well let's go to the next one and 

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:29.279
 last they have been asking next and 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:33.329
 good people if we are in the 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:37.019
 placed number 1 in the previous video that 

00:05:33.329 --> 00:05:38.489
 they told me that this channel was missing and yes 

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:40.739
 the truth is that I missed it has 

00:05:38.489 --> 00:05:43.169
 enough subscribers to whom I was 

00:05:40.739 --> 00:05:46.590
 putting forward forgetting but 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:48.990
 I did not remember or it did not appear I do not know 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.240
 I did not remember by the way if I knew that 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.930
 there was this channel but I did not remember 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:06:02.550
 that moment but good is the channel of 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:05.370
 droid gamer but it has 103 thousand 596 no 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.560
 is that it has already increased to 5 thousand or more since 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:12.029
 these channels are increasing every time 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:14.699
 faster but good in this channel that 

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:20.039
 is what they raise they raise the games of the 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:22.289
 hungry ' maps very little or if it went up but 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:24.949

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.949
 one has already gone up 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.990

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:35.020
 anything towards a channel 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.750
 who has his thing must have something that 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:40.090
 You'll like people either began 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.470

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.090
 you know tell me in the comments 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.240

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:49.870

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:53.320
 Well here ends the top thanks for 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:57.070

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:03.010

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.490
