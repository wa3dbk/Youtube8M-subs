handle just so that it's got a nice grip

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.260 
handle just so that it's got a nice grip
to<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.219> and<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:51.739> you<00:00:52.739> reduce<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.730> width<00:00:54.120> of

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
to it and that you reduce the width of

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.170 
to it and that you reduce the width of
the<00:00:54.420> handle<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:56.370> arrow<00:00:56.699> doesn't

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
the handle so that the arrow doesn't

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.279

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
have to do go around as much handle so

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.170 
have to do go around as much handle so

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.949 
because what we're going to do is
actually<00:02:46.440> press<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.760> belly<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.299> back<00:02:48.569> sides

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
actually press the belly and back sides

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.729 
actually press the belly and back sides
of<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.379> bow<00:02:49.560> onto<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:51.150> see<00:02:51.359> it<00:02:51.620> we're<00:02:52.620> also

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
of the bow onto the see it we're also

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.379 
of the bow onto the see it we're also
want<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.069> take<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.400> time<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.760> make<00:02:54.150> sure<00:02:54.299> that

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
want to take this time to make sure that

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.900 
want to take this time to make sure that
the<00:02:54.510> CA<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:54.930> on<00:02:55.079> straight<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.739> it's<00:02:56.400> lining<00:02:56.670> up

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
the CA is on straight and it's lining up

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.210 
the CA is on straight and it's lining up
with<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.180> rest<00:02:57.359> of<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.569> book

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:14.839 

so<00:03:02.220> just<00:03:02.519> take<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:03.319> the<00:03:04.319> towel<00:03:05.000> flex<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:13.849> and

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
so just take it the towel flex it and

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.400 
so just take it the towel flex it and
then<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.450> also<00:03:15.599> want<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:16.019> press

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
then you also want to press

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:25.700 
then you also want to press
the<00:03:18.280> back<00:03:18.580> in<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.000> belly<00:03:19.860> against<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:22.600> sea<00:03:22.840> it

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.720 

doesn't<00:03:26.710> have<00:03:26.800> to<00:03:26.890> be<00:03:27.010> perfect<00:03:27.490> right<00:03:27.700> now

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
doesn't have to be perfect right now

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.910 
doesn't have to be perfect right now
because<00:03:28.620> when<00:03:29.620> we<00:03:29.860> ride<00:03:30.460> away<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.420> PBC<00:03:32.050> and<00:03:32.680> we

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
because when we ride away the PBC and we

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.780 
because when we ride away the PBC and we
glue<00:03:33.280> this<00:03:33.490> together<00:03:33.940> then<00:03:34.810> we'll<00:03:34.960> have<00:03:35.790> it'll

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
glue this together then we'll have it'll

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.970 
glue this together then we'll have it'll
be<00:03:36.880> a<00:03:36.910> little<00:03:37.120> easier<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.660> work<00:03:37.810> with<00:03:37.870> once<00:03:38.860> we

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
be a little easier to work with once we

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:51.300 
be a little easier to work with once we
get<00:03:39.100> it<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.310> that<00:03:39.430> point<00:03:48.930> alright<00:03:50.160> so<00:03:51.160> now<00:03:51.280> that

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
get it to that point alright so now that

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.770 
get it to that point alright so now that
it's<00:03:51.580> like<00:03:51.760> that<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:53.260> next<00:03:53.530> step<00:03:53.740> is<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:54.780> cut

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
it's like that the next step is to cut

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.150 
it's like that the next step is to cut
this<00:03:55.900> away<00:03:56.170> so<00:03:56.200> first<00:03:56.560> I'm<00:03:56.710> going<00:03:56.830> to<00:03:56.920> do<00:03:57.040> the

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
this away so first I'm going to do the

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.580 
this away so first I'm going to do the
other<00:03:57.340> side<00:03:57.640> and<00:03:58.090> then<00:03:58.840> we're<00:03:59.110> gonna<00:03:59.230> start

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
other side and then we're gonna start

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.950 
other side and then we're gonna start
cutting<00:04:00.370> these<00:04:00.610> away<00:04:00.940> and<00:04:01.330> lining<00:04:01.720> everything

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
cutting these away and lining everything

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.850 
cutting these away and lining everything
up<00:04:02.640> okay<00:04:03.640> so<00:04:04.150> now<00:04:04.300> that<00:04:04.510> you've<00:04:04.660> got<00:04:04.930> both

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
up okay so now that you've got both

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.030 
up okay so now that you've got both
seals<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:06.610> will<00:04:06.700> pretty<00:04:06.880> much<00:04:06.970> line<00:04:07.420> up<00:04:08.040> so

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
seals and will pretty much line up so

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.620 
seals and will pretty much line up so
we're<00:04:09.190> gonna<00:04:09.280> do<00:04:09.550> is<00:04:09.760> we're<00:04:09.940> going<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.240> grind

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
we're gonna do is we're going to grind

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.160 
we're gonna do is we're going to grind
away<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.110> outside<00:04:11.890> of<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.880> pipe<00:04:13.090> on<00:04:13.870> both

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
away the outside of the pipe on both

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
away the outside of the pipe on both
sides<00:04:14.530> what<00:04:14.980> we're<00:04:15.190> basically<00:04:15.550> doing<00:04:16.180> is<00:04:17.190> just

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
sides what we're basically doing is just

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.500 
sides what we're basically doing is just
take<00:04:18.610> you<00:04:18.760> away<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.090> outside<00:04:19.660> edges<00:04:21.450> now<00:04:22.450> we

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
take you away the outside edges now we

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.970 
take you away the outside edges now we
don't<00:04:22.720> want<00:04:22.900> to<00:04:22.990> bring<00:04:23.110> this<00:04:23.290> all<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:23.830> way

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
don't want to bring this all the way

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.850 
don't want to bring this all the way
down<00:04:24.010> to<00:04:24.670> the<00:04:24.790> level<00:04:24.970> of<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.330> wood<00:04:26.290> because

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
down to the level of the wood because

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.110 
down to the level of the wood because
what<00:04:27.100> we're<00:04:27.220> going<00:04:27.340> to<00:04:27.370> be<00:04:27.520> doing<00:04:27.640> is<00:04:27.880> once

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
what we're going to be doing is once

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.310 
what we're going to be doing is once
these<00:04:28.780> two<00:04:29.140> sides<00:04:29.440> are<00:04:29.680> free<00:04:30.690> we're<00:04:31.690> going<00:04:32.050> to

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
these two sides are free we're going to

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.920 
these two sides are free we're going to
reheat<00:04:33.130> them<00:04:33.310> up<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:33.640> move<00:04:34.480> them<00:04:34.660> out<00:04:34.810> of<00:04:34.840> the

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
reheat them up and move them out of the

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.630 
reheat them up and move them out of the
way<00:04:35.170> so<00:04:35.230> we<00:04:35.560> could<00:04:35.680> get<00:04:35.800> some<00:04:35.860> glue<00:04:36.220> in<00:04:36.400> here

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
way so we could get some glue in here

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.600 
way so we could get some glue in here
and<00:04:37.240> then<00:04:37.360> we're<00:04:37.510> going<00:04:37.720> to<00:04:38.280> push<00:04:39.280> everything

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
and then we're going to push everything

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.910 
and then we're going to push everything
together<00:04:39.850> and<00:04:40.240> clamp<00:04:40.540> it<00:04:40.720> and<00:04:41.290> wrap<00:04:41.500> it<00:04:41.740> and

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
together and clamp it and wrap it and

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.760 
together and clamp it and wrap it and
keep<00:04:42.100> it<00:04:42.690> all<00:04:43.690> together<00:04:43.960> so<00:04:44.410> that<00:04:44.440> it<00:04:44.680> will

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
keep it all together so that it will

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.670 
keep it all together so that it will
laminate<00:04:45.280> nicely<00:04:45.730> once<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.300> glue<00:04:46.480> sets<00:04:46.840> then

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
laminate nicely once the glue sets then

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.160 
laminate nicely once the glue sets then
we<00:04:47.860> can<00:04:48.070> go<00:04:48.220> and<00:04:48.610> grind<00:04:49.420> everything<00:04:49.720> flush

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
we can go and grind everything flush

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.540 
we can go and grind everything flush
until<00:04:50.860> then<00:04:51.280> you<00:04:52.210> want<00:04:52.510> some<00:04:53.250> space<00:04:54.250> on<00:04:54.430> the

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
until then you want some space on the

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.940 
until then you want some space on the
outsides<00:04:54.970> we<00:04:55.120> just<00:04:55.270> need<00:04:55.420> to<00:04:55.570> separate<00:04:56.140> the

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
outsides we just need to separate the

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.700 
outsides we just need to separate the
back<00:04:57.400> in<00:04:57.640> the<00:04:57.730> belly<00:04:57.970> so<00:04:58.570> that<00:04:58.840> we<00:04:59.380> can<00:04:59.560> work

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
back in the belly so that we can work

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.950 
back in the belly so that we can work
with<00:04:59.740> them<00:05:00.070> so<00:05:00.940> I'm<00:05:01.030> going<00:05:01.330> to<00:05:01.450> grind<00:05:01.660> this

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
with them so I'm going to grind this

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.240 
with them so I'm going to grind this
real<00:05:02.200> quick<00:05:02.440> I'm<00:05:02.650> going<00:05:02.800> to<00:05:02.890> show<00:05:03.010> you<00:05:03.100> what

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:01.689 
can apply our glue let it sit so here we

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:02.959 
can apply our glue let it sit so here we
go

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:02.969

that this will they fairly flush with

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:18.659 
that this will they fairly flush with
the<00:06:16.990> pipe<00:06:17.319> will<00:06:17.529> they<00:06:17.649> fairly<00:06:17.949> flush<00:06:18.279> with<00:06:18.520> the

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
the pipe will they fairly flush with the

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:21.510 
the pipe will they fairly flush with the
wood<00:06:18.849> what<00:06:19.749> I'm<00:06:19.839> gonna<00:06:19.959> do<00:06:20.169> now<00:06:20.379> is<00:06:20.709> I'm<00:06:21.339> going

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
wood what I'm gonna do now is I'm going

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.179 
wood what I'm gonna do now is I'm going
to<00:06:21.580> go<00:06:21.759> ahead<00:06:21.879> and<00:06:22.180> grind<00:06:22.419> all<00:06:23.050> of<00:06:23.349> this<00:06:23.529> down

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:24.189 
to go ahead and grind all of this down

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:26.790 
to go ahead and grind all of this down
to<00:06:24.430> the<00:06:24.550> wood<00:06:25.199> and<00:06:26.199> then<00:06:26.349> we're<00:06:26.529> going<00:06:26.740> to

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
to the wood and then we're going to

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.509 
to the wood and then we're going to
apply<00:06:27.009> our<00:06:27.219> glue<00:06:28.680> one<00:06:29.680> thing<00:06:29.860> to<00:06:29.979> mention<00:06:30.159> is

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:30.519 
apply our glue one thing to mention is

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:34.129 
apply our glue one thing to mention is
that<00:06:31.709> grinding<00:06:32.709> if<00:06:32.919> you're<00:06:33.099> using<00:06:33.490> a<00:06:33.699> grinder

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 
that grinding if you're using a grinder

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:39.299 
that grinding if you're using a grinder
releases<00:06:35.139> more<00:06:35.529> I<00:06:37.289> guess<00:06:38.289> more<00:06:38.559> fumes<00:06:38.979> from

00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:39.309 
releases more I guess more fumes from

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:41.699 
releases more I guess more fumes from
the<00:06:39.430> PVC<00:06:39.819> than<00:06:40.240> heating<00:06:40.539> gentle<00:06:41.499> heating

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:41.709 
the PVC than heating gentle heating

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:43.889 
the PVC than heating gentle heating
doesn't<00:06:42.129> burn<00:06:42.279> the<00:06:42.309> pipe<00:06:42.669> but<00:06:43.389> the<00:06:43.479> friction

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:43.899 
doesn't burn the pipe but the friction

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:47.489 
doesn't burn the pipe but the friction
caused<00:06:44.199> by<00:06:44.939> grinding<00:06:45.939> the<00:06:46.300> pipe<00:06:46.539> actually

00:06:47.489 --> 00:06:47.499 
caused by grinding the pipe actually

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:49.619 
caused by grinding the pipe actually
burns<00:06:48.370> the<00:06:48.519> pipe<00:06:48.729> and<00:06:48.909> releases<00:06:49.300> a<00:06:49.330> lot<00:06:49.599> of

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:49.629 
burns the pipe and releases a lot of

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:51.629 
burns the pipe and releases a lot of
that<00:06:49.869> so<00:06:50.169> you<00:06:50.830> do<00:06:50.979> want<00:06:51.189> to<00:06:51.249> wear<00:06:51.399> a<00:06:51.430> respirator

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:51.639 
that so you do want to wear a respirator

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:54.779 
that so you do want to wear a respirator
when<00:06:52.240> you're<00:06:52.389> grinding<00:06:52.569> this<00:06:53.550> you<00:06:54.550> want<00:06:54.729> to

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:54.789 
when you're grinding this you want to

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.219 
when you're grinding this you want to
make<00:06:54.849> sure<00:06:54.969> that<00:06:55.360> your<00:06:55.539> respirator<00:06:56.050> is

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:56.229 
make sure that your respirator is

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:59.070 
make sure that your respirator is
approved<00:06:56.589> for<00:06:56.830> organic<00:06:57.490> vapors<00:06:58.269> you<00:06:58.809> want<00:06:58.990> to

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 
approved for organic vapors you want to

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.549 
approved for organic vapors you want to
be<00:06:59.169> out<00:06:59.379> in<00:06:59.740> a<00:07:00.009> well-ventilated<00:07:00.249> area<00:07:01.089> so<00:07:01.559> I'm

00:07:02.549 --> 00:07:02.559 
be out in a well-ventilated area so I'm

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:04.259 
be out in a well-ventilated area so I'm
gonna<00:07:02.740> grind<00:07:03.099> this<00:07:03.399> I'll<00:07:03.819> show<00:07:04.029> you<00:07:04.089> what<00:07:04.240> that

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:04.269 
gonna grind this I'll show you what that

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:05.489 
gonna grind this I'll show you what that
looks<00:07:04.569> like<00:07:04.659> and<00:07:04.959> then<00:07:05.080> we're<00:07:05.199> going<00:07:05.319> to<00:07:05.409> glue

00:07:05.489 --> 00:07:05.499 
looks like and then we're going to glue

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:07.680 
looks like and then we're going to glue
it
