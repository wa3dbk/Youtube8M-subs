00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.700
 the comparisons are usually odious 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.070
 however for some reason almost 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.350
 intrinsic whenever any game 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.019
 of karting no matter the franchise 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.690
 company or quality is compared to 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:45.059
 mario kart and to a certain extent is 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.879
 understandable neighborhood car was the creator of 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.370
 a genre a genre called karting and 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.790
 many try to adopt some with 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.949
 success and others thereby doing 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.199
 in compulsive buyer states 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.269
 sonicwall stars racing was acquired in 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.390
 one of the many playstation stops 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.430
 store at a price of 10 dollars a 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.229
 true bargain if we consider the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.300
 hours of fun that has made me spend 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.240
 this game developed by the company 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.159
 digital juice in conjunction with sega in the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.439
 year 2012 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.479
 the truth is that this game has everything 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.969
 to make a party game a 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.640
 variety of characters a large number of 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:26.649
 Considering the possibility of modification of 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.259
 our vehicles according to the stadium 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.359
 require it and a fairly stable line 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.399
 it is true that this title takes great 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:35.409
 inspiration from another karting game 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.530
 but this one will manage to come off in the 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.780
 rest mainly because of the cool 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.390
 I ask a question 4 mario titles 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.700
 kart there and how many years already 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.640
 repetition the market has certain 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.420
 they are and many years too 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.879
 experimenting in these last decades 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.250
 his racing title caught the attention 

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:56.250
 for something and that something is called charisma 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.060
 it's not that mario kart does not have it but 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.030
 what we tried this title is 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.800
 perfect as the years go by 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.690
 adding one or another character and some 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.130
 how many mechanical field that is 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.660
 cover the sun with a finger 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.700
 Mario faces but questioned the kind of 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.770
 gameplay of this style for something follows 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.750
 in effect until today but are and 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.060
 I find it much more striking 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.400
 Speed sensation is amazing and 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.440
 is very well implemented when you go to 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.239
 the maximum speed in the vast majority 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.340
 of the cases you have a lot of control 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.569
 on the vehicle this added to the great 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.400
 detail of the transformations of 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.890
 vehicles and scenarios make a 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.150
 very colorful experience both at the level of 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.150
 gameplay as visually 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.980
 however the game also has its 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.200
 failures is not to forget that sometimes the 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.250
 game was moving and some characters from 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.280
 that big can be a bit 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.410
 unknown to certain people by 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.930
 example about 40% of the characters 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.700
 they were unknown to me but a great 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.020
 most of me ended up liking and 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.290
 Wanting to play their respective 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:02.090
 titles is the case of ayai and friends the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.090
 which are from my favorite runners 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.470
 the music is simply great all 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.659
 work of the great Richard since one of the 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.099
 greatest composers of that gas with 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:14.319
 just say that up to the friends theme 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.319
 I like it but out of this remix is 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.620
 like that of actor vernon space harrier or 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.569
 hydrate from shinobi are memorable to 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.730
 Although they are the same they are racing 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.040
 for the whole family the movistar and is 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.730
 very difficult at the time of writing this 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.849
 video I have 165 stars out of the 200 that 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.079
 I need to launch the next level 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.359
 Not to mention that I still have one 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.310
 character to unlock even though 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.900
 I've been with the title for three months now 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.660
 when I sit down to enjoy a while 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.610
 the ps3 storni that is the first option 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.680
 special mention for the challenge called 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.420
 traffic attack that reminds me 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.820
 pretty the classic style of the games 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.290
 of races where you must advance and 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.190
 dodge all the cars in a while 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.190
 determined 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.120
 now the big question is tony austral 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:10.050
 racing transformer better than mario falling 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.270
 under my point of view yes and I repeat for 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.220
 those of extending pillars under my point 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.590
 sight even though as a game of 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.690
 casting is not perfect other times what 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.940
 have the best objects have something 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.460
 that for me is much more faithful 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.530
 advice since boy been a fan of the 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.390
 company and for a long time 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.760
 dreamed of a game where Ã¡lex click and 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.620
 sonic you were points and that they 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.990
 Now they were running down a track 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.850
 based on after burner one of my 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.340
 favorite arcade titles is 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.129
 simply great and worth even more 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.020
 that the 10 dollars that you spend 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:44.610
 have the opportunity to get it already 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.580
 be for the old consoles 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.469
 generation or for 6 do it over 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.849
 all in the last option since having 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:53.209
 a series of extra characters 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.209
 exclusive 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.909
 that has been my humble opinion I hope 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.979
 read your comments about this great 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:03.120
 ask a big greeting to all and we 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.120
 we see for the next
