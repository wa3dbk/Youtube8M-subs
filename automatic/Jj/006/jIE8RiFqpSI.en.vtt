shields<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.860> charge<00:02:17.220> would<00:02:17.700> hit<00:02:18.360> them<00:02:18.540> for

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
shields the charge would hit them for

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.690 
shields the charge would hit them for
8500<00:02:20.069> damage<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:21.560> since<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.950> melee<00:02:23.370> attack

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
8500 damage and since the melee attack

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.550 
8500 damage and since the melee attack
and<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.150> charge<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.720> on<00:02:24.870> different<00:02:25.200> cool<00:02:25.380> down

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
and the charge is on different cool down

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.130 
and the charge is on different cool down
you<00:02:26.100> could<00:02:26.310> charge<00:02:26.640> them<00:02:26.730> for<00:02:27.120> 8500<00:02:27.930> and

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
you could charge them for 8500 and

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.470 
you could charge them for 8500 and
another<00:02:29.390> 3200<00:02:30.390> right<00:02:30.780> away<00:02:31.049> at<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.380> same<00:02:31.560> time

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
another 3200 right away at the same time

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.339 
another 3200 right away at the same time
once<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.260> do<00:02:34.319> charge<00:02:34.739> it<00:02:35.010> almost<00:02:35.220> like<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:36.349> go

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
once I do charge it almost like the go

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.740 
once I do charge it almost like the go
past<00:02:37.650> them<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.580> I<00:02:38.610> just<00:02:38.970> turn<00:02:39.299> around<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.690> a

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
past them so I just turn around in a

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.440 
past them so I just turn around in a
circle<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:40.349> define<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.220> melee<00:02:41.670> range<00:02:41.879> again<00:02:42.239> or

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
circle and define a melee range again or

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.030 
circle and define a melee range again or
if<00:02:42.659> I<00:02:42.810> bit

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
if I bit

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.569 
if I bit
range<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:45.060> range<00:02:45.299> that<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:46.170> cast<00:02:46.530> shoemaker<00:02:47.400> and

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
range to range that I cast shoemaker and

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.700 
range to range that I cast shoemaker and
continue<00:02:48.150> on<00:02:48.299> bashing<00:02:48.540> them<00:02:48.870> in

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
continue on bashing them in

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.290 
continue on bashing them in
and<00:02:50.920> that's<00:02:51.550> pretty<00:02:51.760> much<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.060> entire

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
and that's pretty much the entire

00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:00.160 
and that's pretty much the entire
strategy

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.790 

now<00:03:00.500> if<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:00.770> see<00:03:00.980> here<00:03:01.220> in<00:03:01.370> this<00:03:01.580> video

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
now if you see here in this video

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.970 
now if you see here in this video
I<00:03:02.890> am<00:03:03.580> NOT<00:03:03.820> gonna<00:03:04.030> heal<00:03:04.390> even<00:03:04.660> once<00:03:05.260> throughout

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
I am NOT gonna heal even once throughout

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.970 
I am NOT gonna heal even once throughout
the<00:03:06.220> entire<00:03:07.440> quest<00:03:08.440> so<00:03:09.060> for<00:03:10.200> fighting<00:03:11.200> just

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
the entire quest so for fighting just

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.000 
the entire quest so for fighting just
just<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.000> be<00:03:13.120> valiant<00:03:13.720> and<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.710> four

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
just to be valiant and the four

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.610 
just to be valiant and the four
champions<00:03:15.870> not<00:03:16.870> once<00:03:17.110> will<00:03:17.290> I<00:03:17.350> heal

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
champions not once will I heal

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.670 
champions not once will I heal
because<00:03:19.400> it's<00:03:20.000> just<00:03:20.150> that<00:03:20.510> easy<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.140> you

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
because it's just that easy and you

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.070 
because it's just that easy and you
probably<00:03:22.250> could<00:03:22.700> heal<00:03:22.909> running<00:03:23.390> from<00:03:23.540> enemy

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
probably could heal running from enemy

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.930 
probably could heal running from enemy
to<00:03:24.200> enemy<00:03:24.349> but<00:03:24.799> I'm<00:03:25.280> just<00:03:25.519> going<00:03:25.700> to<00:03:25.730> show<00:03:25.790> you

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
to enemy but I'm just going to show you

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.509 
to enemy but I'm just going to show you
how<00:03:26.209> easy<00:03:26.569> it<00:03:27.230> could<00:03:27.319> be<00:03:27.530> once<00:03:28.040> you've<00:03:28.250> gotten

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
how easy it could be once you've gotten

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:41.230 
how easy it could be once you've gotten
used<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.790> it

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.720 

now<00:03:41.780> was<00:03:42.020> a<00:03:42.050> champion<00:03:42.680> also<00:03:43.040> on<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.340> time

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
now was a champion also on a time

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.410 
now was a champion also on a time
yourself<00:03:44.030> so<00:03:45.020> that<00:03:45.230> once<00:03:46.220> you<00:03:46.340> use<00:03:46.790> shield

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
yourself so that once you use shield

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.840 
yourself so that once you use shield
bigger<00:03:47.690> you<00:03:48.380> want<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.710> right<00:03:48.950> away<00:03:49.250> a<00:03:49.460> vacuum

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
bigger you want to right away a vacuum

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.450 
bigger you want to right away a vacuum
alien<00:03:50.150> rage<00:03:50.330> and<00:03:50.690> as<00:03:51.230> soon<00:03:51.650> as<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:52.040> cooldown

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
alien rage and as soon as the cooldown

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.480 
alien rage and as soon as the cooldown
lose<00:03:52.670> up<00:03:52.910> then<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:53.960> limited<00:03:54.380> range<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:54.920> use

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
lose up then a limited range and use

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.520 
lose up then a limited range and use
charge<00:03:55.940> because<00:03:56.810> that'll<00:03:57.110> take<00:03:57.230> a<00:03:57.260> lot<00:03:57.380> of

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
charge because that'll take a lot of

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.380 
charge because that'll take a lot of
damage

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
damage

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.580 
damage
the<00:03:58.780> reason<00:03:59.170> for<00:03:59.380> this<00:03:59.950> is<00:04:00.400> because

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
the reason for this is because

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.410 
the reason for this is because
you<00:04:01.680> take<00:04:01.920> too<00:04:02.129> long<00:04:02.280> then<00:04:02.670> they'll<00:04:02.940> just<00:04:03.150> cast

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
you take too long then they'll just cast

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.020 
you take too long then they'll just cast
another<00:04:03.810> shield<00:04:04.440> onto<00:04:04.830> them<00:04:05.129> and<00:04:05.280> that<00:04:05.910> will

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
another shield onto them and that will

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.170 
another shield onto them and that will
decrease<00:04:06.420> your<00:04:06.450> damage<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.489> so<00:04:08.489> that's<00:04:08.670> not

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
decrease your damage and so that's not

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:16.650 
decrease your damage and so that's not
what<00:04:09.390> you<00:04:09.510> want

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.449 

your<00:04:17.230> fingers<00:04:17.620> might<00:04:17.830> hurt<00:04:18.010> a<00:04:18.040> little<00:04:18.190> bit

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
your fingers might hurt a little bit

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.800 
your fingers might hurt a little bit
after<00:04:18.640> this<00:04:18.940> if<00:04:19.180> you're<00:04:19.300> not<00:04:19.420> used<00:04:19.660> to<00:04:19.750> it

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
after this if you're not used to it

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.410 
after this if you're not used to it
because<00:04:20.050> you<00:04:20.830> see<00:04:21.070> at<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.250> bottom<00:04:21.519> left<00:04:21.880> I'm

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
because you see at the bottom left I'm

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.260 
because you see at the bottom left I'm
just<00:04:23.230> completely<00:04:24.040> spanning<00:04:24.670> number<00:04:24.910> one<00:04:25.090> and

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
just completely spanning number one and

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.730 
just completely spanning number one and
two<00:04:25.390> because<00:04:25.810> they're<00:04:26.140> on<00:04:26.350> different

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
two because they're on different

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.710 
two because they're on different
cooldowns<00:04:27.340> and<00:04:27.610> I'm<00:04:27.700> just<00:04:27.910> constantly<00:04:28.300> doing

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
cooldowns and I'm just constantly doing

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.140 
cooldowns and I'm just constantly doing
damage<00:04:29.050> whether<00:04:29.830> they<00:04:30.100> have<00:04:30.280> shields<00:04:30.760> up<00:04:30.880> or

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
damage whether they have shields up or

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:40.970 
damage whether they have shields up or
not

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.890

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.439 
killing three of the Valiants I run over
and<00:04:58.080> fight<00:04:58.289> the<00:04:58.470> Alliance<00:04:58.979> champions<00:04:59.639> just

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
and fight the Alliance champions just

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.040 
and fight the Alliance champions just
because<00:05:01.310> you<00:05:02.310> can't<00:05:02.580> fight<00:05:02.849> the<00:05:03.509> same<00:05:03.719> once

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
because you can't fight the same once

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.470 
because you can't fight the same once
over<00:05:04.919> again<00:05:05.159> in<00:05:05.550> an<00:05:05.699> hour

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
over again in an hour

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.900 
over again in an hour
this<00:05:08.020> way<00:05:08.230> they're<00:05:08.560> all<00:05:08.770> pretty<00:05:09.130> much<00:05:09.250> compact

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
this way they're all pretty much compact

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.880 
this way they're all pretty much compact
right<00:05:10.180> close<00:05:10.420> to<00:05:10.450> each<00:05:10.720> other<00:05:10.840> and<00:05:11.170> I<00:05:11.590> can<00:05:11.770> just

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
right close to each other and I can just

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.400 
right close to each other and I can just
run<00:05:12.130> straight<00:05:12.370> from<00:05:12.730> one<00:05:12.940> side<00:05:13.270> to<00:05:13.510> another<00:05:13.600> to

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
run straight from one side to another to

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.520 
run straight from one side to another to
another<00:05:14.440> and<00:05:15.660> basically<00:05:16.660> complete<00:05:17.170> the<00:05:17.290> quest

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
another and basically complete the quest

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:34.270 
another and basically complete the quest
in<00:05:17.740> a<00:05:17.800> very<00:05:17.980> short<00:05:18.070> amount<00:05:18.310> of<00:05:18.550> time

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.430 

so<00:05:34.850> as<00:05:34.970> you<00:05:35.090> see<00:05:35.270> whenever<00:05:35.540> they<00:05:35.900> charge<00:05:36.230> me<00:05:36.410> or

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
so as you see whenever they charge me or

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.640 
so as you see whenever they charge me or
she'll<00:05:36.770> break<00:05:36.980> me<00:05:37.190> then<00:05:37.730> I<00:05:37.910> always<00:05:38.500> put<00:05:39.500> up

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
she'll break me then I always put up

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.000 
she'll break me then I always put up
shields<00:05:40.040> again<00:05:40.430> and<00:05:40.990> there<00:05:41.990> you<00:05:42.080> go<00:05:42.139> it's

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
shields again and there you go it's

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.890 
shields again and there you go it's
completed<00:05:43.490> I<00:05:43.760> finished<00:05:44.690> the<00:05:44.870> entire

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
completed I finished the entire

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.640 
completed I finished the entire
two<00:05:47.050> quests<00:05:47.410> in<00:05:47.790> under<00:05:48.790> six<00:05:49.419> minutes

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.740 

about<00:05:51.949> five<00:05:52.220> and<00:05:52.430> a<00:05:52.490> half

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.470 

and<00:05:54.840> so<00:05:55.470> this<00:05:55.620> is<00:05:55.770> very<00:05:55.980> simple<00:05:56.700> and<00:05:56.910> easy<00:05:57.120> if
