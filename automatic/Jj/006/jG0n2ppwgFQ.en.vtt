00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:18.480
 this year the knight and went to check spectators if we 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.599
 thank you that participates and send your question only criticizes your suggestion 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:23.779
 to the program 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.409
 we always remember that the program is made for you 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:31.059
 and much more along with you these doubts that we receive these 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:31.980
 suggestions 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.110
 are all optimized by the production of the whole team 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.110
 to put together a better program for another bursting the dwarf on earth 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.740
 alive 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.410
 and each time with more partners more sponsors more interested people 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.630
 then participating in the brazil course what really is the official media of the 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.620
 horse 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.470
 asked question of lopes of costa rica mato grosso do sul 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.660
 I would like to know about who in the river of horses a very cool question because 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.300
 It's a subject that we always talk about, we discuss so many 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.450
 nature of the horse 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.400
 the nature of a horse, it is determined by several factors that 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.120
 the horses half are already born with it and then it can change 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.380
 easily according to the life that was in the bid there is a confusion 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.850
 very large and what people do in between is the people the genetic load of a 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.280
 horse the lineage of a horse then we listen sometimes speak are alias 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.130
 of Brazilian horse 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.890
 the piece is a horse line 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.200
 it's the hottest more if it's much colder at last 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.660
 with this mess with the moon 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.640
 this story of handling and upper only in the horse's handle as a whole 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.200
 and that you never have a 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.980
 an evil intention for nothing 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.730
 but it turns out that this same horse that is cool I gave an example that can 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.120
 get a horse a boring horse that can bite fall 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.280
 it can get hot when you ride a horse that it can say to scare 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.509
 just that you put things to him that are not horses means how 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.429
 when manners and flaking totally wrong 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:16.429
 That 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.460
 a lot of ration that your corolla gets too much energy in it because it is 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.470
 the horse is only to know if the horse very price if you do not work touched the 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.370
 bell to have a routine can be that in the end his to ride and him 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.889
 had to be hot 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:37.939
 and this is not immune if it adds a behavior change 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:42.090
 in relation to lineages we know that performace is that people know that 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:44.099
 the competitions 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.350
 were encouraged to find their favorite lineages 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.819
 his daughter 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.959
 rooster noise person rodrigo jumps well not all jump well are children of one 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.159
 three-time world champion but not all are so well 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:01.260
 but without this means there is a good genetics there and consequently 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.879
 has a quality of those blood which does not mean that it has a jury 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:10.349
 the nature he determined by what you put into his life plus one 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.369
 bit of this genetic load but a little bit of that undue 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:18.719
 of the horse and then when we talk about debts it's worth going into that year 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:19.779
 in this aspect 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:24.339
 each horse is well-behaved of his nature that has his 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:29.219
 personality does not help us to standardize the way to deal with the 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.389
 horses people going very uncertain and training in brussels at world level 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.249
 good pain of horses are treated absolutely in faith and in the same way 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:39.710
 The treaty that I'm saying is not the deal of action 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.280
 but they are managed life scheme always the same for everyone does not help 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.800
 if so each horse has to be considered as undue as well as 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.910
 other people I can play with this person I can not play with another 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.959
 Rich person, I do not like much, it's a joke. 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.389
 nephew of horse consider 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.029
 management aspects 

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:00.109
 the dog is that the life of that horse 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:05.159
 consider a little bit of lineages that there are more loaded trips rather 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.679
 warmer strains 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:11.629
 and consider in the individuality of each horse of his work each horse is 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.909
 a story to tell legal if you have any questions please contact 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.959
 we at www with university of the horse both with effect br 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.210
 So I have to take advantage of this, I was already in the lead, but Brazil 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.289
 the official horse network
