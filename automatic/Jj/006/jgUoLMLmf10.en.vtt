so i'm just gonna start right now the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.870 
so i'm just gonna start right now the
bell<00:00:21.060> 27<00:00:21.650> obviously<00:00:22.650> did<00:00:22.859> get<00:00:23.039> nerfed<00:00:23.340> we<00:00:23.730> were

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
bell 27 obviously did get nerfed we were

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.700 
bell 27 obviously did get nerfed we were
all<00:00:24.060> expecting<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.840> recoil<00:00:25.410> went<00:00:25.590> up

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
all expecting that the recoil went up

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.589 
all expecting that the recoil went up
higher<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.939> know<00:00:27.029> what<00:00:27.150> if<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.420> don't

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
higher and you know what if you don't

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.140 
higher and you know what if you don't
use<00:00:27.750> for<00:00:28.019> grip<00:00:28.199> you're<00:00:28.380> kind<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.710> screwed

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
use for grip you're kind of screwed

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.339 
use for grip you're kind of screwed
because<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.390> really<00:00:30.660> tough<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.869> control<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
because it's really tough to control the

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.770 
because it's really tough to control the
recoil<00:00:31.529> now<00:00:31.920> if<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.759> do<00:00:32.940> use<00:00:33.120> for<00:00:33.390> grip<00:00:33.570> it's

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
recoil now if you do use for grip it's

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
recoil now if you do use for grip it's
more<00:00:34.020> like<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.559> bow<00:00:34.860> pre<00:00:35.520> patch<00:00:35.960> but<00:00:36.960> like

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
more like the bow pre patch but like

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.069 
more like the bow pre patch but like
with<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> bit<00:00:38.399> more<00:00:38.579> recoil<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.210> no<00:00:39.660> forgive

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
with a bit more recoil and no forgive

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.959 
with a bit more recoil and no forgive
attached<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.860> know<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.489> that's<00:00:41.790> that's

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
attached to it you know so that's that's

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.700 
attached to it you know so that's that's
kind<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.239> what<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.480> like<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.989> for<00:00:43.290> grip<00:00:43.469> so

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
kind of what it's like with for grip so

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.500

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
this is a big one I'm gonna go out on

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.109 
this is a big one I'm gonna go out on
the<00:01:25.890> limit<00:01:26.130> with<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.369> one<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:26.939> say

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
that I think that the SMGs got an a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.990 
that I think that the SMGs got an a
range<00:01:30.540> buff<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.070> really<00:01:32.070> do<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.250> tried<00:01:32.729> them<00:01:32.909> out

range buff I really do I tried them out

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.990 
range buff I really do I tried them out
I<00:01:33.240> tried<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.780> MP<00:01:34.110> 11<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.310> KF<00:01:35.700> I've<00:01:35.850> tried

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
I tried the MP 11 the the KF I've tried

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.999 
I tried the MP 11 the the KF I've tried
all<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.180> them<00:01:36.360> except<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> am<00:01:37.020> or<00:01:37.170> nine<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.590> I

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
all of them except the am or nine and I

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.160 
all of them except the am or nine and I
noticed<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.549> big<00:01:38.820> difference<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> MP<00:01:39.840> 11

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
noticed a big difference in the MP 11

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.050 
noticed a big difference in the MP 11
mostly<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> know<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.310> didn't<00:01:41.549> really<00:01:41.579> use<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
mostly I know I didn't really use the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.630 
mostly I know I didn't really use the
SNP's<00:01:42.570> as<00:01:42.689> much<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.200> didn't<00:01:43.770> notice<00:01:43.890> some

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
SNP's as much I didn't notice some

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.280 
SNP's as much I didn't notice some
differences<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> KF<00:01:45.600> five<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
differences in the KF five and the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.380 
differences in the KF five and the
essence<00:01:46.770> six<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> didn't<00:01:47.549> notice<00:01:47.640> much<00:01:48.180> in

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
essence six but I didn't notice much in

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.999 
essence six but I didn't notice much in
the<00:01:48.479> ASM<00:01:48.840> one<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.170> hope<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:49.530> not<00:01:49.649> i<00:01:49.710> really

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
the ASM one I hope it's not i really

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.350 
the ASM one I hope it's not i really
hope<00:01:50.130> it's<00:01:50.250> not<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.430> placebo<00:01:50.909> effect<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.240> i

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
hope it's not the placebo effect is i

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.550 
hope it's not the placebo effect is i
don't<00:01:51.390> want<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.659> sound<00:01:51.750> stupid<00:01:51.990> right<00:01:52.290> now<00:01:52.320> cuz

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
don't want to sound stupid right now cuz

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.170 
don't want to sound stupid right now cuz

the patch notes they have not been

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.330 
the patch notes they have not been
released<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.689> i'm<00:01:55.079> tryna<00:01:55.649> i'm<00:01:55.920> trying<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.250> know

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
released so i'm tryna i'm trying to know

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.459

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
like tell you guys what i've noticed

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.160 
like tell you guys what i've noticed
what<00:01:58.799> i've<00:01:58.920> seen<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.479> actually<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.540> really<00:02:01.049> do

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
what i've seen so actually I really do

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.749 
what i've seen so actually I really do
believe<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.740> SNP's<00:02:02.159> gotta<00:02:02.369> buff<00:02:02.579> and

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
believe that the SNP's gotta buff and

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.690 
believe that the SNP's gotta buff and
that's<00:02:02.939> what<00:02:03.210> we've<00:02:03.390> all<00:02:03.630> been<00:02:03.659> waiting<00:02:04.020> for

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
that's what we've all been waiting for

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.639 
that's what we've all been waiting for
hopefully<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.180> case<00:02:06.360> now<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.079> don't

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
hopefully that is the case now I don't

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.839 
hopefully that is the case now I don't
want<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.829> talk<00:02:07.920> about<00:02:07.979> lag<00:02:08.340> because<00:02:08.459> I'm<00:02:08.670> not

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
want to talk about lag because I'm not

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.820 
want to talk about lag because I'm not
too<00:02:09.030> sure<00:02:09.330> about<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.720> we<00:02:10.319> had<00:02:10.530> some

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
too sure about it we had some

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.550 
too sure about it we had some
speculation<00:02:11.520> about<00:02:11.760> them<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.599> know

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
speculation about them you know

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.710 
speculation about them you know
fixing<00:02:13.920> matchmaking<00:02:14.400> up<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.760> bit<00:02:14.940> 4-ranked

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
fixing matchmaking up a bit 4-ranked

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.880 
fixing matchmaking up a bit 4-ranked
play<00:02:15.959> but<00:02:16.200> we<00:02:16.319> didn't<00:02:16.530> know<00:02:16.650> if<00:02:16.739> it<00:02:16.830> was

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
play but we didn't know if it was

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.380 
play but we didn't know if it was
actually<00:02:17.250> gonna<00:02:17.370> implement<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.910> into<00:02:18.120> like

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
actually gonna implement it into like

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.780 
actually gonna implement it into like
the<00:02:18.599> regular<00:02:19.050> type<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.069> playlist<00:02:20.459> like<00:02:20.610> the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
the regular type of playlist like the

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.880 
the regular type of playlist like the
regular<00:02:21.030> public<00:02:21.360> matches<00:02:21.660> so<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.590> know

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
regular public matches so you know

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.170 
regular public matches so you know
hopefully<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.520> case<00:02:23.640> hopefully<00:02:23.910> it

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
hopefully that is the case hopefully it

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.780 
hopefully that is the case hopefully it
did<00:02:24.360> get<00:02:24.510> fixed<00:02:25.020> then<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.650> didn't<00:02:26.370> notice<00:02:26.489> much

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
did get fixed then I didn't notice much

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.089 
did get fixed then I didn't notice much
of<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:27.060> change<00:02:27.420> but<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.140> did<00:02:28.319> notice<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.620> once

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
of a change but I did notice that once

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.070 
of a change but I did notice that once
you<00:02:29.400> once<00:02:29.880> you're<00:02:30.180> loading<00:02:30.510> up<00:02:30.599> for<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.870> game

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
you once you're loading up for the game

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.500 
you once you're loading up for the game
though<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:32.310> bar<00:02:32.519> actually<00:02:32.730> goes<00:02:33.090> all<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.330> way

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
though the bar actually goes all the way

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
though the bar actually goes all the way
through<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.750> end<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:33.959> instead<00:02:34.319> of<00:02:34.349> like

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
through the end of instead of like

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.040 
through the end of instead of like
stopping<00:02:35.099> like<00:02:35.880> forty-five<00:02:36.510> percent<00:02:36.660> through

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
stopping like forty-five percent through

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.800 
stopping like forty-five percent through
so<00:02:37.890> i<00:02:37.920> don't<00:02:38.519> know<00:02:38.580> i<00:02:38.610> think<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.450> did<00:02:39.599> that

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
so i don't know i think it did that

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.240 
so i don't know i think it did that
before<00:02:39.930> in<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.230> previous<00:02:40.349> patches<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.099> then

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
before in the previous patches and then

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.580 
before in the previous patches and then
went<00:02:41.489> back<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.670> its<00:02:41.940> old<00:02:42.120> ways<00:02:42.239> so<00:02:43.080> hopefully

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
went back to its old ways so hopefully

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.930 
went back to its old ways so hopefully
that's<00:02:43.739> not<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.010> case<00:02:44.160> for<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:44.489> then<00:02:44.790> maybe

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
that's not the case for this then maybe

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.250 
that's not the case for this then maybe
that's<00:02:45.180> me<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.390> means<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:45.959> it's<00:02:46.110> actually

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
that's me that means that it's actually

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.530 
that's me that means that it's actually
like<00:02:46.680> working<00:02:47.430> i<00:02:47.700> don't<00:02:48.209> know<00:02:48.269> well<00:02:48.420> that's

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
like working i don't know well that's

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.090 
like working i don't know well that's
something<00:02:48.690> i<00:02:48.900> noticed<00:02:48.959> something<00:02:49.769> else<00:02:49.890> that

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
something i noticed something else that

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.740 
something i noticed something else that
i<00:02:50.130> actually<00:02:50.370> notice<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:51.030> that<00:02:51.060> there<00:02:51.660> was

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
i actually notice is that there was

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.390 
i actually notice is that there was
actually<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.110> problem<00:02:52.590> with<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.890> dual<00:02:53.100> wield

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
actually a problem with the dual wield

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.390 
actually a problem with the dual wield
weapons<00:02:53.489> not<00:02:54.140> being<00:02:55.140> able<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.440> like<00:02:55.650> i<00:02:55.920> apply

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
weapons not being able to like i apply

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.490 
weapons not being able to like i apply
your<00:02:56.580> camels<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.150> think<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.810> only<00:02:57.989> notices<00:02:58.349> on

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
your camels I I think I only notices on

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.830 
your camels I I think I only notices on
the<00:02:58.530> Atlas<00:02:59.010> 45<00:02:59.459> so<00:02:59.819> I<00:03:00.030> tried<00:03:00.540> putting<00:03:00.690> my

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
the Atlas 45 so I tried putting my

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
how i feel about this regarding like I

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.910 
how i feel about this regarding like I
don't<00:03:45.870> think<00:03:46.139> that<00:03:46.290> they<00:03:46.380> should<00:03:46.410> have<00:03:46.680> really

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
don't think that they should have really

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.390 
don't think that they should have really
optimized<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.700> caps<00:03:47.970> that<00:03:48.329> much<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:49.400> the

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
optimized the caps that much and the

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.500 
optimized the caps that much and the
kills<00:03:50.609> as<00:03:50.730> well<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:50.940> think<00:03:51.060> they<00:03:51.269> should<00:03:51.420> have

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
kills as well I think they should have

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.319 
kills as well I think they should have
just<00:03:51.660> made<00:03:51.989> it<00:03:52.139> a<00:03:52.200> 25<00:03:52.650> point<00:03:53.250> bonus<00:03:53.519> cuz<00:03:54.209> i

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
just made it a 25 point bonus cuz i

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.270 
just made it a 25 point bonus cuz i
think<00:03:54.569> that<00:03:54.720> 50<00:03:55.200> is<00:03:55.260> just<00:03:55.500> too<00:03:55.620> much<00:03:55.739> i<00:03:55.920> played

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
think that 50 is just too much i played

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.699 
think that 50 is just too much i played
just<00:03:56.489> one<00:03:56.819> game<00:03:57.000> of<00:03:57.150> domination<00:03:57.750> i<00:03:57.930> played

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
something like that so uh so yeah I

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.129 
something like that so uh so yeah I
couldn't<00:04:49.030> get<00:04:49.120> into<00:04:49.300> a<00:04:49.330> lobby<00:04:49.539> on<00:04:49.690> hard<00:04:49.870> point

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
couldn't get into a lobby on hard point

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.600 
couldn't get into a lobby on hard point
so<00:04:50.410> I<00:04:50.680> only<00:04:50.860> noticed<00:04:51.100> it<00:04:51.370> on<00:04:51.430> domination

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610

another<00:04:54.610> two<00:04:54.820> things<00:04:55.120> and<00:04:55.330> I<00:04:55.419> think<00:04:55.780> I<00:04:56.050> think

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
another two things and I think I think

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.230 
another two things and I think I think
this<00:04:56.590> is<00:04:56.650> safe<00:04:56.949> from<00:04:57.130> what<00:04:57.220> I<00:04:57.370> personally

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
this is safe from what I personally

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.020 
this is safe from what I personally
noticed<00:04:58.570> myself<00:04:58.720> um<00:04:59.340> now<00:05:00.340> when<00:05:00.639> you<00:05:00.729> unlock
