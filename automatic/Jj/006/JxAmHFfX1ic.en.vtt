before<00:00:20.350> you<00:00:20.439> place<00:00:20.680> any<00:00:20.860> lights<00:00:21.250> you're<00:00:21.430> gonna

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
before you place any lights you're gonna

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.130 
before you place any lights you're gonna
want<00:00:21.850> to<00:00:21.910> set<00:00:22.119> up<00:00:22.270> the<00:00:22.390> environment<00:00:22.540> lighting

want to set up the environment lighting
it's<00:00:23.860> a<00:00:23.980> good<00:00:24.160> idea<00:00:24.340> before<00:00:24.789> you<00:00:25.210> open<00:00:25.539> the

settings to look at the Sun lights

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.080 
settings to look at the Sun lights
should<00:00:47.559> be<00:00:47.680> considered<00:00:48.160> your<00:00:48.340> main<00:00:48.579> source<00:00:48.940> of

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090

bright intensity while a night track

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:11.400 
bright intensity while a night track
should<00:01:09.430> have<00:01:09.580> a<00:01:09.610> darker<00:01:10.149> cooler<00:01:10.570> color<00:01:10.840> with<00:01:11.380> a

ambient light is a fairly flat looking
light<00:01:32.500> that<00:01:32.740> does<00:01:32.920> not<00:01:33.100> cast<00:01:33.490> shadows

on<00:01:37.030> its<00:01:37.210> own<00:01:37.450> so<00:01:37.840> use<00:01:38.049> the<00:01:38.229> ambient<00:01:38.560> lights<00:01:38.920> to

on its own so use the ambient lights to

support your sun or moon light not to

support your sun or moon light not to
replace<00:01:41.619> it<00:01:41.860> so<00:01:42.400> that's<00:01:42.580> it<00:01:42.790> for<00:01:42.939> actual

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
replace it so that's it for actual

it in this in place lights I found that

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.659 
it in this in place lights I found that
the<00:02:50.319> point<00:02:50.650> light<00:02:50.859> is<00:02:51.099> great<00:02:51.340> for<00:02:51.609> this

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:51.669 
the point light is great for this

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:55.679 
the point light is great for this

shadows is also a great way to add

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.729 
shadows is also a great way to add
visual<00:02:57.909> interest<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.599> lighting<00:02:58.989> if<00:02:59.169> you<00:02:59.560> have

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
given object already has two or three

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.339 
given object already has two or three
environment<00:03:31.060> lights<00:03:31.239> hitting<00:03:31.569> it<00:03:31.689> and<00:03:31.840> some

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
environment lights hitting it and some

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.280 
environment lights hitting it and some
effects<00:03:32.680> like<00:03:32.919> fire<00:03:33.189> also<00:03:33.579> emit<00:03:34.150> light<00:03:34.329> if<00:03:34.629> you

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
effects like fire also emit light if you

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.319 
effects like fire also emit light if you
start<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:35.680> see<00:03:35.859> light<00:03:36.099> blocks<00:03:36.430> try<00:03:37.150> reducing

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
start to see light blocks try reducing

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:43.450 
start to see light blocks try reducing
the<00:03:37.780> number<00:03:38.079> of<00:03:38.109> lights

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.920 

reducing<00:03:44.460> the<00:03:44.580> light<00:03:44.760> range<00:03:47.240> or<00:03:48.240> moving<00:03:48.780> them

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
reducing the light range or moving them

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.360 
reducing the light range or moving them
farther<00:03:49.170> apart<00:03:49.320> so<00:03:49.800> that<00:03:49.980> they<00:03:50.130> don't

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
farther apart so that they don't

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.270 
farther apart so that they don't
interact<00:03:50.700> as<00:03:51.060> much
