these into place like so and that's us

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.160 
these into place like so and that's us
if<00:01:00.039> we<00:01:00.219> spin<00:01:00.430> it<00:01:00.460> around<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:01.719> can<00:01:01.870> see<00:01:02.019> that

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
can also see there is more fabric at the

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.140 
can also see there is more fabric at the
bottom<00:01:19.689> for<00:01:19.810> another<00:01:20.020> shelf<00:01:20.290> if<00:01:20.439> we<00:01:20.590> need<00:01:21.150> so

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
bottom for another shelf if we need so

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.230 
bottom for another shelf if we need so
the<00:01:22.240> top<00:01:22.420> section<00:01:22.810> all<00:01:23.110> we<00:01:23.259> do<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:24.430> just<00:01:25.060> take

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
the top section all we do is just take

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.260 
the top section all we do is just take
the<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.530> frames<00:01:26.770> here<00:01:27.040> and<00:01:27.729> when<00:01:28.030> we<00:01:28.060> look

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
the the frames here and when we look

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.179 
the the frames here and when we look
closely<00:01:28.509> at<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:29.350> top<00:01:29.500> here<00:01:29.770> we<00:01:29.920> can<00:01:30.040> see<00:01:30.159> that

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
closely at the top here we can see that

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:31.980 
closely at the top here we can see that
there's<00:01:30.460> a<00:01:30.490> couple<00:01:30.759> of<00:01:30.820> holes<00:01:31.000> just<00:01:31.270> in<00:01:31.899> the

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
there's a couple of holes just in the

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.870 
there's a couple of holes just in the
top<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.439> they<00:01:32.560> correspond<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.579> grippers

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
top and they correspond to the grippers

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.690 
top and they correspond to the grippers
on<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.810> frame<00:01:35.049> you<00:01:35.290> just<00:01:36.280> pop<00:01:36.399> them<00:01:36.520> into

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
on the frame you just pop them into

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.490 
on the frame you just pop them into
place<00:01:37.000> like<00:01:37.630> so<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:39.189> pop<00:01:39.399> that<00:01:39.549> one<00:01:39.670> in<00:01:40.409> if<00:01:41.409> we

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
place like so just pop that one in if we

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.940 
place like so just pop that one in if we
do<00:01:41.619> that<00:01:41.740> on<00:01:41.890> both<00:01:42.009> sides<00:01:42.340> that<00:01:43.140> gives<00:01:44.140> you<00:01:44.320> the

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
do that on both sides that gives you the

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:52.560 
do that on both sides that gives you the
edges<00:01:45.310> of<00:01:45.549> your<00:01:46.200> tabletop<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:52.030> think<00:01:52.329> that

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
edges of your tabletop just think that

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.650 
edges of your tabletop just think that
pop<00:01:53.409> that<00:01:53.439> into<00:01:53.710> place<00:01:54.009> just<00:01:54.549> yeah

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
pop that into place just yeah

and what we have there's a section which

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.990 
and what we have there's a section which
is<00:02:00.690> six<00:02:00.900> in<00:02:01.260> between<00:02:01.590> here<00:02:01.800> at<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.730> end<00:02:02.850> we

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
is six in between here at the end we

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.380 
is six in between here at the end we
have<00:02:03.150> these<00:02:03.740> black<00:02:04.740> box<00:02:05.010> here<00:02:05.250> let's<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.700> fit
