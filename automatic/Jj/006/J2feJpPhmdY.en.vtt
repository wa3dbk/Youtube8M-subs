00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.280
 you have done more for a very long time 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.040
 You can create it in the etap of course 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.740
 and the simplest things with a few 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.170
 few steps back to basics 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.510
 AllgÃ¤u make-up inspired by one 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.760
 my very last series on the new 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.740
 black you know maybe i love you 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.230
 the series is incredibly happy at last 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.660
 next you third season everything ran 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.970
 I only finally create and because of that 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.859
 Let's do a real basic make-up today 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.020
 So stay tuned for the two 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.790
 tutorials so first of all I show 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.800
 you now super easy a long 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.750
 we can do that and we need it 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.690
 plus charcoal tablets you get in 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.399
 the pharmacy and are not so 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.289
 expensive ones look like coal though 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.460
 you should get capsules then even 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.780
 even better then you pour the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.280
 I just have one here 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:00.750
 tablet and they have to go now 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:03.690
 crush violate the right thing is to 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.409
 really cool was shaved when he was in me 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.280
 force 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.500
 then you can just do yoga or 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.229
 olive oil in vÃ¶hl still go in then 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.090
 is there such a pasta or dive again 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.460
 Just give your a little brush in 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.930
 some water then just the coal 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.630
 press and then something on the hand back 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.580
 to paint as appropriate when it is too wet 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.670
 then simply add more coal 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.540
 am now quite normal to some 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.890
 would matter 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.110
 I often want to deep down 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.760
 yes, before that a bit of a woman 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.020
 but have not had here in front and I 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:45.680
 can you also equal to the others yet 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:47.960
 do it with it and you 're done 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.119
 See, it 's really good 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.590
 a survival kit is already for 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.200
 half finished now we still do 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.550
 a lip gloss as a basis for the 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.550
 lipgloss namely a bit of batteries 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.420
 then Schlecker wants because I enter 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.890
 a little bit of honey that sounds good 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.410
 Land is good for the care and 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.209
 Of course you are great you can 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.640
 slim down without being scared off and 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.650
 Now it's twice the army again 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.160
 and I give it a bit 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.060
 add cinnamon powder that's for the color 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.560
 Of course , rain does too 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.530
 First line for the color you can 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.019
 also cocoa vanilla with friendly or 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.320
 red beet powder jokes more thoroughly 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.760
 or turmeric and, if you like, yours 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.200
 spices always see through that now 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.110
 miss something 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.540
 by the way, the cool patient is there 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.040
 so a bit of a popping effect and 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.280
 you even puffed up so much 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.560
 suffered 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.390
 Now you can fill that in eg one 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.610
 contact in the containers that's great 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.510
 practically with the paper of a page 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:00.100
 yours with blockbusters in it side 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.100
 you can easily apply one from now on 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:14.600
 she hatches herself with lip gloss katar 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.950
 and the youtube survival kit is ready 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.770
 and they can even in the deepest 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.630
 Survive Jungle Flash has you 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.670
 has made a bit of fun a lot to me 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.780
 fun made both the little things 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.160
 make 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.110
 and yes you can do it a bit 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.020
 Spice up that's just so very very special 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.820
 basic all can still oils and 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.180
 enter colors and is really nice 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.560
 make yes , just a cool idea 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.530
 maybe a bit creative too 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.240
 will sometimes be so natural 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.190
 to make it yourself because it is up 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.630
 any case possible and it dries out 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.090
 I 'm really excited 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.980
