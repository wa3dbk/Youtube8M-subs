cashes<00:00:33.719> today<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.920> new<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.219> using

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
cashes today so this is a new one using

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.090 
cashes today so this is a new one using
the<00:00:35.820> flip<00:00:36.270> camera<00:00:36.540> while<00:00:37.469> I'm<00:00:37.590> biking<00:00:37.950> which

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
the flip camera while I'm biking which

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.880 
the flip camera while I'm biking which
probably<00:00:38.340> isn't<00:00:38.550> exactly<00:00:38.969> safe<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:39.739> I'm<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.860> a

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
probably isn't exactly safe but I'm on a

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.260 
probably isn't exactly safe but I'm on a
side<00:00:41.160> block<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.809> guess<00:00:42.809> also<00:00:43.850> also<00:00:44.850> one<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
side block I guess also also one of the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.670 
side block I guess also also one of the
reason<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.629> I'm<00:00:45.750> biking<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.230> because<00:00:46.469> during

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
reason is I'm biking is because during

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.520 
reason is I'm biking is because during
Moga<00:00:47.390> during<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.510> competition<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.140> believe<00:00:49.379> I

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
Moga during the competition I believe I

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.150 
Moga during the competition I believe I
really<00:00:50.149> injured<00:00:51.149> my<00:00:51.300> foot<00:00:51.770> and<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.829> think<00:00:53.070> I

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
really injured my foot and I think I

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.459 
really injured my foot and I think I
have<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.309> stress<00:00:53.610> fracture<00:00:53.940> because<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:55.289> two

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
have a stress fracture because it's two

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.229 
have a stress fracture because it's two
weeks<00:00:55.590> now<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.219> still<00:00:56.730> doesn't<00:00:57.000> feel<00:00:57.120> any

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.069 
weeks now and I still doesn't feel any
better<00:00:57.559> so<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.680> still<00:00:58.890> sweet<00:00:59.129> though<00:01:00.079> biking

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
better so it's still sweet though biking

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.649 
better so it's still sweet though biking
doesn't<00:01:01.410> really<00:01:02.809> affect<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.899> too<00:01:04.080> much<00:01:05.659> I'm

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
break fake like I was messing with my

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.999 
break fake like I was messing with my
bike<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:38.939> bench<00:01:39.540> but<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.900> just<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.439> just

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
bike to the bench but I just I just

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.530 
bike to the bench but I just I just
didn't<00:01:41.430> think<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.670> was<00:01:41.759> worth<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.329> guess

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
didn't think it was worth it so I guess

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.120 
didn't think it was worth it so I guess
I'll<00:01:42.689> come<00:01:42.960> back<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.380> off<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.770> next<00:01:43.890> one

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
beacon right here and see if we can find

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.960 
beacon right here and see if we can find
this<00:01:58.500> thing

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
this thing

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.360 
this thing

today<00:02:02.580> I<00:02:03.800> second<00:02:04.800> one<00:02:04.890> here<00:02:05.130> i<00:02:05.160> dnf'd<00:02:05.670> it

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
today I second one here i dnf'd it

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.790 
today I second one here i dnf'd it
zeroing<00:02:06.750> out<00:02:06.840> all<00:02:07.080> over<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.440> sign<00:02:07.770> right

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
zeroing out all over this sign right

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.230 
zeroing out all over this sign right
here<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.650> and<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.310> can't<00:02:11.490> find<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.790> anywhere

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
here and I and I can't find it anywhere

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.350 
here and I and I can't find it anywhere
so<00:02:12.810> guess<00:02:13.680> I'll<00:02:13.890> move<00:02:14.010> on<00:02:14.220> strike<00:02:14.610> two<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.060> I

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
so guess I'll move on strike two and I

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.170 
so guess I'll move on strike two and I
stopped<00:02:15.660> number<00:02:16.020> three<00:02:16.320> boy<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.280> think<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.700> bit

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
stopped number three boy I think I bit

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.490 
stopped number three boy I think I bit
off<00:02:18.240> a<00:02:18.390> little<00:02:18.600> bit<00:02:18.810> more<00:02:18.870> than<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.260> could<00:02:19.290> chew

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
off a little bit more than I could chew

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.520 
off a little bit more than I could chew
this<00:02:20.220> is<00:02:20.370> becoming<00:02:21.270> quite<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.630> ride

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
this is becoming quite a ride

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.840 
this is becoming quite a ride
I<00:02:22.560> don't<00:02:23.070> know<00:02:23.130> how<00:02:23.250> far<00:02:23.520> I've<00:02:23.610> gone<00:02:23.790> I

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
I don't know how far I've gone I

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.690 
I don't know how far I've gone I
probably<00:02:24.570> over<00:02:24.900> 10<00:02:25.080> 10<00:02:25.530> 12<00:02:25.800> miles<00:02:26.040> already<00:02:26.340> but

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
probably over 10 10 12 miles already but

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.000 
probably over 10 10 12 miles already but
I'm<00:02:27.540> grounding<00:02:28.050> out<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.380> think<00:02:28.470> right<00:02:28.890> about

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
I'm grounding out I think right about

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.760 
I'm grounding out I think right about
here<00:02:29.460> so<00:02:29.850> let's<00:02:30.690> hope<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:31.020> one<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.350> found<00:02:31.530> in

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
here so let's hope this one is found in

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.910 
here so let's hope this one is found in
his<00:02:31.860> easy<00:02:32.070> one<00:02:32.570> could<00:02:33.570> be<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.720> skirt<00:02:34.050> lifter

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.390 

there<00:02:37.920> we<00:02:38.040> have<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.430> we<00:02:38.820> actually<00:02:39.150> found<00:02:39.360> one

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
there we have it we actually found one

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.170 
there we have it we actually found one
probably<00:02:41.400> have<00:02:41.490> been<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.610> little<00:02:41.820> easier<00:02:42.060> to

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
probably have been a little easier to

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.560 
probably have been a little easier to
drive<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.600> I'll<00:02:43.560> get<00:02:43.680> him<00:02:43.860> back<00:02:44.040> home<00:02:44.310> hi<00:02:44.940> big<00:02:45.210> I

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.850 
bike and and I got in a crash but you
know<00:04:12.540> I<00:04:12.569> was<00:04:12.900> thinking<00:04:12.960> I<00:04:13.230> was<00:04:13.319> really

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
know I was thinking I was really

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.070 
know I was thinking I was really
invisible<00:04:14.490> when<00:04:14.700> I<00:04:14.730> found<00:04:15.360> that<00:04:15.450> cash<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:16.049> I

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
invisible when I found that cash and I

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.600 
invisible when I found that cash and I
guess<00:04:16.290> I<00:04:16.440> was<00:04:16.560> a<00:04:16.590> little<00:04:16.830> bit<00:04:16.950> too<00:04:17.130> invisible

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:17.610 
guess I was a little bit too invisible

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.900 
guess I was a little bit too invisible
because<00:04:17.760> that<00:04:18.030> car<00:04:18.269> didn't<00:04:18.600> see<00:04:18.750> me
