there's a horrible blind spot in it no
matter<00:00:36.059> how<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.800> you<00:00:37.800> know<00:00:38.540> try<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.950> adjust<00:00:40.950> it

matter how you you know try to adjust it

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.110 
matter how you you know try to adjust it
I<00:00:41.960> got<00:00:42.960> done<00:00:43.440> get<00:00:43.649> it

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
I got done get it

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.670 
I got done get it
horrible<00:00:45.120> blind<00:00:45.360> spot<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:46.110> can<00:00:46.260> see<00:00:46.410> fire

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
horrible blind spot you can see fire

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.029 
horrible blind spot you can see fire
through<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> complex<00:00:48.110> top<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.440> just<00:00:49.739> I

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
through the complex top this is just I

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.369 
through the complex top this is just I
think<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.390> angle<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.870> how<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
think because of the angle of how the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.160 
think because of the angle of how the
bus<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.949> slanted<00:00:53.520> it's<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:54.930> an

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
bus is slanted it's like it's like an

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.229 
bus is slanted it's like it's like an
angle<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.800> think<00:00:56.190> that's<00:00:56.340> what<00:00:56.520> causes<00:00:56.730> it

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
angle I think that's what causes it

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.240 
angle I think that's what causes it
because<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.780> right<00:00:57.960> side<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.800> left<00:00:58.980> side

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
because on the right side the left side

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.389 
because on the right side the left side
you<00:00:59.430> can<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.579> perfectly<00:01:01.070> but<00:01:02.070> then<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
you can see perfectly but then the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.490 
you can see perfectly but then the
bottom<00:01:02.760> convex<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.570> terrible<00:01:04.140> height<00:01:04.290> it's

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
bottom convex is terrible height it's

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.859 
bottom convex is terrible height it's
like<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:04.860> pointed<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:06.450> there's<00:01:06.600> no<00:01:06.720> way

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
like it's pointed up and there's no way

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.620 
like it's pointed up and there's no way
to<00:01:06.930> get<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.290> pointed<00:01:07.470> back<00:01:07.799> down<00:01:08.390> like<00:01:09.390> how<00:01:09.570> it

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
to get it pointed back down like how it

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.800 
to get it pointed back down like how it
is<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.200> side

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
is on that side

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.680 
is on that side
yes<00:01:12.380> I<00:01:12.680> feel<00:01:13.310> about<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:13.640> whole<00:01:13.729> situation<00:01:14.030> but
