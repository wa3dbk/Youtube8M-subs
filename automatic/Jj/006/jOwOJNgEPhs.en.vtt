00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.160
 nothing at all 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:21.619
 the idea is to convey the concerns we are seeing many professionals from 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.380
 health 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.670
 to use communication tools that bring us closer to the 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.189
 patients in their co-workers 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.960
 the same aliaga a great power can be done many things left and it's not going 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.110
 you can change 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.480
 and there's a little resistance on the other hand we're trying 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.030
 to beautify it and help our partners to win 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.940
 because we do not see that it was not exactly possible that here it will go well 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.220
 mckinley cumming real change 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.070
 both the healthcare regions and the expert patients care that all 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.380
 it's going very fast and we're changing things 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.070
 we fall short by actually changing the sanitary world there is a lot 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.860
 digital illiteracy still 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.250
 there is a lot of resistance 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.860
 things have been done one way for a long time and change that chip 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.820
 they also stayed simple 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.860
 you have to try you have to go for small steps and that is the invitation 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.790
 that we want to format a doctor's hard drive costs many years 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.030
 many years of career one and another match for 3d injuries while 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.460
 thirteen 13 t 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.640
 it is more affirms young person like any young 4 teenager handles 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.090
 social networks with incredible warm water a person already with the form as the minutes 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.150
 He has more resistance because he has never done it 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.800
 and you do not see a priori a utility there are no fears of reluctance 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.770
 but that's probably going to change 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.070
 and bush is changing at the level of contagion in terms of professionals 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.090
 Older people see how it is 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.360
 can be useful or can you tell me if well 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.050
 the use of possible tools that every Arab world uses a stethoscope a 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.690
 mobile phone will also use a tool then 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.960
 in sanidad operate health 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.940
 There is a small group of dowry spies that we are trying to work on. 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.840
 use things that have not been for years 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.830
 we are discovering nothing that is such and at the patient level the same every time 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.149
 homologs a super social group of patients 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.229
 but it is a minority this is going to go more on the internet since the searches of 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:16.989
 health in google are the second percent a ranking 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.049
 because people people have concerns if they want to know more about their 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.809
 health whoever is more about the disease 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.199
 he is not there yet 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:29.139
 more and more tools last add their concrete social networks this will come 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.169
 to be able to connect with other colleagues to work in a virtual group 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:38.189
 with my people who are outside my scope for me is a mint 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:42.649
 very powerful not at the level of exclusion of doubts of a question just 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:43.689
 problems 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.689
 % and ibm 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:51.290
 that virtual group concept for me is important because it helps us get out of 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.639
 our consultations of the three areas 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.459
 in these comfort zones 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.039
 Each person is used to each professional to work 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:02.039
 knowledge and tools with people 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.420
 the in the network allows you to connect with other people leave your area 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:10.749
 that end a small risk pipeline of xico tarres letter meet people but has 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:14.119
 a great reward because it connects with people very good people who are 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:16.389
 working efficient leading lines in 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.329
 and solve hofmann's doubts 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.989
 a jeep of art new ideas and you tell yourself that you're back that is level 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:22.789
 professional 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:25.619
 the level of libya patients 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:28.459
 this year, mip, I'm trying to try 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.269
 implement 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.079
 a consultation project that simply means 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.269
 communicate with my patients outside the face-to-face consultation in a communication 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.299
 non-synchronous signal asintra out of time 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.400
 percents block allows us to hang content by ccoo 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.510
 hanging information for my patients that in consultation does not give me time 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.209
 baskets 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.089
 twitter allows me up to parts also imposes min 5 real information was 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:57.809
 consulted the cold young man and and this has happened I have a room and now I come 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:02.549
 and the only correct on the other hand something so elementary that used to buy 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.859
 pt plane ticket and what he did with my patients so that they can 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:09.959
 Mexico demands analytical information is filtered and detention and harassment 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:12.779
 they are simple tools that are there 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:17.680
 rallies a kid in this health system there is a prd frequent 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.409
 activates and puts use of sanitary system as it is there pointed out 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:26.080
 because poking the patient can not get their needs 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.460
 anses that in the consultation I think that that is wrong is not efficient is very expensive 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.720
 and it would be necessary to look for ways howard to make min the bureaucracy because the forum of the 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:37.249
 query 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:40.819
 the recipes of the success of the consultation and that the technology 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.229
 it's not an alan k that can get us 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.520
 information as the three as a medication say that the dosage one 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.120
 quantity 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.960
 if we fall short we do not arrive and if we go to side effects 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.210
 I have every week 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.360
 very frequent people who got into google and comes very nervous 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.819
 because they find too much information 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:04.840
 the future will come from the hand of emc health professions that dare 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.270
 so the information already produce the own training to generate content 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.800
 generate personal health content 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.830
 to which a patient a citizen can access with confidence 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.490
 min yes 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.050
 a person 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.819
 he met his family doctor and he knows that his public doctor information 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:25.420
 digitally will have greater credibility 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.240
 that an unknown page 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.889
 Even I understand a medium-term future for the short 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.520
 monsalvo frames four pioneers there is little work develops 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.990
 these stoppages min 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.730
 doctors that we paphos in these ways because it is an effort this is not 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.330
 they ratify it and they do not reward it is a job more 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.939
 and we have 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:48.159
 the work levels very full but I do not think that the over exigency of three 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:49.490
 they have to bet on it 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.770
 more open more more flexible than allow 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.479
 an access information of Spain min percent and that was true that the 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:05:59.699
 sanitary system 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.099
 in the next power and above all noted the professionals with 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:04.490
 enough knowledge 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.639
 as for what min was to expand to the citizenry a simple way there is no 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:09.340
 what to ride 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.860
 great things with a patrick pullover 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.130
 I believe that the much to be done is a bit behind in relation to 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:17.270
 company data 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.540
 and I think it involves tools not all at once but it's good and testing because 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.350
 everyone has to tackle before at home 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.389
 to try digital tools ideas are useful 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:29.610
 and leave the patients as well an invitation 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.139
 to bet quality information said look for personal information 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:38.039
 of doctors to discern health meanings that right now and debris 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:39.800
 excellent husband surplus 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.499
 to which you can access twitter 

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:44.599
 nothing 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:46.339
 nothing
