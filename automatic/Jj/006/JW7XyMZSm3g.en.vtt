00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
sport bike and I find the right

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.500 
sport bike and I find the right
opportunity<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:51.990> jumped<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.910> so<00:01:53.910> it's

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
opportunity and I jumped on it so it's

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.900 
opportunity and I jumped on it so it's
good<00:01:54.750> looking<00:01:55.340> that<00:01:56.340> was<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.550> number<00:01:56.760> one

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
good looking that was the number one

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.870 
good looking that was the number one
obviously<00:01:57.479> number<00:01:57.690> two<00:01:58.070> was<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.670> power

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
obviously number two was the the power

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.219 
obviously number two was the the power
difference<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:02.430> power<00:02:02.670> on<00:02:02.910> this<00:02:03.030> thing<00:02:03.300> 600

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
difference the power on this thing 600

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.910 
difference the power on this thing 600
4-cylinder<00:02:05.390> is<00:02:06.390> amazingly<00:02:07.200> different<00:02:07.500> check

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920

good<00:02:29.790> indicator<00:02:30.270> um<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:32.280> difference<00:02:32.640> on<00:02:32.760> the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
good indicator um the difference on the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.170 
good indicator um the difference on the
650<00:02:33.330> on<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:35.580> engine<00:02:36.030> is

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
650 on this is that the engine is

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.060 
650 on this is that the engine is
basically<00:02:36.570> flipped<00:02:36.930> upside<00:02:37.290> down<00:02:37.470> for<00:02:37.709> 650

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
basically flipped upside down for 650

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.580 
basically flipped upside down for 650

this<00:03:10.590> bike<00:03:10.850> I<00:03:11.850> was<00:03:12.209> very<00:03:12.390> surprised<00:03:12.810> because

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
this bike I was very surprised because

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.110 
this bike I was very surprised because
I've<00:03:13.650> only<00:03:13.830> written<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.280> super<00:03:14.730> sport<00:03:14.940> bike

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
I've only written a super sport bike

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.479 
I've only written a super sport bike
maybe<00:03:15.360> for<00:03:16.049> five<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.830> ten<00:03:17.010> minutes<00:03:17.310> when<00:03:17.430> my

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
maybe for five to ten minutes when my

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.420 
maybe for five to ten minutes when my
friend<00:03:17.760> let<00:03:17.850> me<00:03:17.910> ride<00:03:18.060> his<00:03:18.239> in<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.390> parking<00:03:18.750> lot

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
friend let me ride his in a parking lot

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.070 
friend let me ride his in a parking lot
for<00:03:20.430> just<00:03:20.580> a<00:03:20.730> short<00:03:20.970> while<00:03:21.150> this<00:03:22.019> um

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
for just a short while this um

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.930 
for just a short while this um
we<00:03:23.800> really<00:03:24.010> threw<00:03:24.220> me<00:03:24.370> off<00:03:24.400> you<00:03:24.790> know<00:03:24.910> I

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
we really threw me off you know I

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.210 
we really threw me off you know I
actually<00:03:25.180> stalled<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.840> few<00:03:26.020> times<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.980> first

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
actually stalled a few times the first

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.040 
actually stalled a few times the first
day<00:03:27.340> I<00:03:27.370> bought<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:27.700> bike<00:03:27.910> because<00:03:28.720> I<00:03:28.930> was

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
day I bought the bike because I was

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.750 
day I bought the bike because I was
expecting<00:03:29.500> all<00:03:29.620> kinds<00:03:29.950> of<00:03:30.010> torque<00:03:30.280> down<00:03:30.430> here

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
expecting all kinds of torque down here

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.250 
expecting all kinds of torque down here
and<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.120> torque<00:03:31.420> is<00:03:31.540> usually<00:03:31.900> right<00:03:32.170> around

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
and the torque is usually right around

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.160 
and the torque is usually right around
here<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:34.180> get<00:03:34.330> you<00:03:34.420> in<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:34.660> out<00:03:34.720> of<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.900> spots

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
here to get you in and out of the spots

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.510 
here to get you in and out of the spots
quickly<00:03:36.990> just<00:03:37.990> to<00:03:38.110> move<00:03:38.260> out<00:03:38.440> slowly<00:03:38.860> as<00:03:39.130> a

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
quickly just to move out slowly as a

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.790 
quickly just to move out slowly as a
regular<00:03:40.030> traffic<00:03:40.510> pace<00:03:40.870> you're<00:03:41.260> looking<00:03:41.680> at

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
regular traffic pace you're looking at

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.530 
regular traffic pace you're looking at
about<00:03:41.890> three<00:03:42.460> and<00:03:42.520> a<00:03:42.580> half<00:03:42.760> or<00:03:43.090> four<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.510> a

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
about three and a half or four and a

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.320 
about three and a half or four and a
half<00:03:43.710> over<00:03:44.710> there<00:03:44.920> with<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.370> other<00:03:45.460> bike<00:03:45.670> 650

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
half over there with the other bike 650

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.390 
half over there with the other bike 650
I<00:03:46.540> was<00:03:47.230> doing<00:03:47.410> about<00:03:47.590> one<00:03:47.740> and<00:03:47.830> a<00:03:47.890> half<00:03:48.070> two<00:03:48.370> and

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
I was doing about one and a half two and

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.430 
I was doing about one and a half two and
a<00:03:48.550> half<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:49.540> it'll<00:03:49.990> give<00:03:50.140> you<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.260> same

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
a half and it'll give you the same

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.950 
a half and it'll give you the same
amount<00:03:50.620> of<00:03:50.740> torque<00:03:51.120> now<00:03:52.120> once<00:03:52.390> you<00:03:52.510> reach<00:03:52.720> the

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
amount of torque now once you reach the

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.040 
amount of torque now once you reach the
happy<00:03:53.260> zone<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:54.100> green<00:03:54.460> zone<00:03:54.790> here<00:03:55.060> you're

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
happy zone the green zone here you're

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.010 
happy zone the green zone here you're
gone<00:03:56.260> I<00:03:56.590> mean<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.490> torque<00:03:57.790> will<00:03:58.030> you<00:03:58.810> know<00:03:58.900> if

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
gone I mean the torque will you know if

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.210 
gone I mean the torque will you know if
you're<00:03:59.140> not<00:03:59.170> ready<00:03:59.500> for<00:03:59.590> it's<00:03:59.860> going<00:03:59.950> to<00:04:00.040> shift

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
you're not ready for it's going to shift

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.490 
you're not ready for it's going to shift
you<00:04:00.370> back<00:04:00.520> on<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.760> bike<00:04:01.020> without<00:04:02.020> you<00:04:02.260> knowing

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
you back on the bike without you knowing

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.110 
you back on the bike without you knowing
it<00:04:02.560> you<00:04:02.680> know<00:04:02.800> before<00:04:03.790> you<00:04:03.820> know<00:04:03.910> what

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
it you know before you know what

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.930 
it you know before you know what
happened<00:04:04.480> and<00:04:05.260> so<00:04:06.210> it<00:04:07.210> is<00:04:07.450> really<00:04:07.810> really<00:04:08.080> cool

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
happened and so it is really really cool

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.530 
happened and so it is really really cool
clip-ons<00:04:09.940> were<00:04:10.180> quite<00:04:10.930> a<00:04:11.200> different<00:04:11.650> story<00:04:12.540> as

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
clip-ons were quite a different story as

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.540 
clip-ons were quite a different story as
you<00:04:13.750> can<00:04:13.900> see<00:04:14.050> here<00:04:14.380> those<00:04:14.920> clip-ons<00:04:15.370> go

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
you can see here those clip-ons go

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.120 
you can see here those clip-ons go
straight<00:04:15.940> down<00:04:17.010> so<00:04:18.010> you<00:04:18.070> can<00:04:18.220> see<00:04:18.370> that<00:04:18.610> and

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
straight down so you can see that and

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.280 
straight down so you can see that and
it's<00:04:21.130> totally<00:04:21.430> different<00:04:21.580> from<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.290> 650r

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
it's totally different from the 650r

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.350 
it's totally different from the 650r
which<00:04:23.680> will<00:04:24.400> come<00:04:24.580> straight<00:04:24.730> out<00:04:24.940> right<00:04:25.240> about

that the the pluses of the 650 over this
one<00:05:03.250> is<00:05:03.430> obviously<00:05:04.120> the<00:05:04.330> ergonomics<00:05:04.900> although

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
one is obviously the ergonomics although

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.260 
one is obviously the ergonomics although
it<00:05:05.980> doesn't<00:05:06.160> look<00:05:06.310> as<00:05:06.700> cool<00:05:06.730> when<00:05:07.150> you're

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270

really like it I enjoy it and so they

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.270

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
both have pros and cons I think it's

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.230 
both have pros and cons I think it's
kind<00:05:21.460> of<00:05:21.490> an<00:05:21.610> equal<00:05:21.910> trade<00:05:22.120> out<00:05:23.940> looks<00:05:24.940> and

kind of an equal trade out looks and

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.010 
kind of an equal trade out looks and
power<00:05:25.780> wise<00:05:26.790> way<00:05:27.790> better<00:05:28.030> than<00:05:28.210> the<00:05:28.360> 650<00:05:28.840> our

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
power wise way better than the 650 our
