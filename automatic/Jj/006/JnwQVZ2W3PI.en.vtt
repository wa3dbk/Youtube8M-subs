00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:17.230
 directly from the site

 by jabra however puntocom direkt ash 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.429
 to the Italian site 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.390
 the model he ordered are the jabra 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:28.419
 faq wireless sport closed very well 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:35.309
 I must say let's not do any damage to 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:37.949
 ruin the paper card paper button 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.600
 previously after so much paper 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.600
 finally what interests us 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.719
 our headphones 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.719
 here they are 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:53.559
 these are the jabra sports wireless 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.870
 nice package also I have to say 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.120
 very well sealed you have also seen the 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.899
 value it is important that they arrived at 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.929
 destination 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.330
 will be the sandri is one thing I have 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.280
 purchased within two days are 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.880
 arrive is a very pleasant thing to 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.740
 more 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.420
 buying from the site there was the 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.040
 possibility of receiving a coupon e 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.230
 registering for the newsletter 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.150
 this coupon allowed to break down the 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.900
 shipping cost of approx 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.420
 7 so they were 99 euros plus 7 shipping 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.390
 in the coupon series that Hong Kong's 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.120
 welcome 71 shipping become 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.770
 may now see if I can 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:37.000
 open it so this is how expensive 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:43.860
 also because the front camera 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.860
 then it is simply enough to pull 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.400
 these are the earphones 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:00.790
 they really abounded with scotch and 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:03.670
 whatever else it seems that if you now feel like 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.060
 plastic even if a plastic yes 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.930
 remember but it is not elastic see here there is 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.030
 a card indicating the ok 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.790
 practically indicates the fact that 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.380
 must be worn on the right arm e 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.300
 as close as possible 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.850
 of the headset for example we should 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.860
 use it in your left pocket says that 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.530
 theoretically it should not work 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.260
 it will be my concern to verify it I had read 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.350
 and heard of this thing I will verify 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.690
 and I assume this is the hole for the 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.940
 microphone the left earpiece does not have 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.470
 nothing special 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.330
 they seem to be filled with the road 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.210
 have all the functions therefore that 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.000
 we have a key with fm inscriptions 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.910
 we have more or less a key that 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.450
 should be response bar play 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.340
 breaks and another hole that should 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.100
 be the second microphone for noise 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.350
 very very light environmental must say 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.700
 very very light pleasing also to the 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:06.520
 feel are they are really well done 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.770
 let's see if I find here is the forum 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.900
 for charging 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.670
 exact so we have a 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.620
 normal micro usb 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.470
 let's go on to see what it is 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.890
 in the packaging but visibly there is the 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:24.160
 java charger that to itself a lot 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.040
 the scotch to all creates not few 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.360
 difficulty to my hands ok 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.630
 I would like to avoid making an explosion of 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:39.330
 content but I did it 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:42.430
 I did not do damage charger 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:46.989
 classic micro usb 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:49.150
 we have all the grommets to adapt 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.330
 earphones to our ear shape 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.790
 in short, very curious with this 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.720
 bow species are worth trying 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.720
 we'll see 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:06.510
 this must be the armband 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:09.450
 for marco to wait this is a band 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.570
 from the arm where the can be inserted 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.060
 our smartphone then 00 with iphone and 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.640
 he thought he would buy one anyway 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.620
 lateral case for later use 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.950
 put to get software 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.630
 however be able to see from the classical 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.250
 clear plastic in front of some 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.920
 information on speed and 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.520
 whatever else I try to take between 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:35.160
 the iphone 4 and we see the size down 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.980
 and visibly perfect indeed I would say 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.010
 this seems almost tailor-made 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.590
 I accept it is elastic so it can be 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.220
 output quietly even with iphone 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.660
 4 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.850
 actually with any other 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.860
 mobile device 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.890
 we immediately make another check for 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.590
 size maybe we use something with 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.710
 size more generous info in galaxy s 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.720
 it is slightly larger than 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.530
 iphone as both width and as 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.180
 height and in this case ai tra 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:10.320
 quietly stays out 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.950
 just a small part but thanks to 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.860
 elastic cettina we challenge without problems 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:21.090
 here it is our beautiful door 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:23.430
 telephone hug ok we park here 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.640
 also this and other we find ok a little 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.170
 of healthy reading committed tag 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.700
 yellow red card of why to use 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.820
 during a football match there 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:36.300
 absolutely yes the written in 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:40.410
 Japanese Korean Arabic also one 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:43.170
 phone call was it was very important to me 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.670
 They threw the protections how do ok 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.730
 of the stations there 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.650
 interest but endomondo sports player 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.960
 here it is this yes that interests us 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.280
 practically our regular one 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.410
 because in short that after this from 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.890
 video of you run to buy it too 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.639
 because and for laner this will already have the 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.280
 our jabra 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.900
 we talk by default with this one 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.360
 application called endomondo 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.219
 sports rake endomondo sports tracker 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.990
 I've tried it both on iphone and on 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:13.270
 I don't like android 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.150
 a very bad voice honestly there is a 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.460
 glocal feedback that speaks and says in 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.159
 substance but also when I respect 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:24.009
 to other software I usually use 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:26.469
 used plus the pluses because anyway 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:28.270
 sometimes it's nice to even do some 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:30.370
 race with someone who uses it then is 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.169
 a continuous stimulus to continue 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.870
 in short, to compete to run but not me 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:35.560
 I don't even like that much of 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.020
 far away 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.659
 definitely more complete runkeeper more 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:43.180
 practical high recommend me adidas 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:45.639
 micoach absolutely true to say fall 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.879
 this is what we say to the interface 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:51.879
 If I press the small button, or at least 

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:55.060
 so recidivist if first during the race 

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:56.919
 the cassino can only be right earphone 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.349
 should give me info info 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:01.060
 relative to abu distance speed 

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:03.189
 we will try we will prove outwardly that 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.460
 also works with other programs 

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:07.870
 of training among those who performed 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.000
 perfect after this fool with mine 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.159
 English for Macaronic e 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.110
 especially hyper ignoring hi everything 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:16.110
 here I will tell you how it goes if it goes well 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.339
 jabra sport seems to have hoped there has been 

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:24.029
 helpful my review 

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:24.029
 bye Bye
