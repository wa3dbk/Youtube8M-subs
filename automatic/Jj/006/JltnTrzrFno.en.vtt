people in the past I would say that

people<00:00:27.150> bring<00:00:27.300> up<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.510> fact<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.869> they're<00:00:28.080> on

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
people bring up the fact that they're on

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.410 
people bring up the fact that they're on
whey<00:00:28.560> protein<00:00:29.039> or<00:00:29.189> taking<00:00:29.580> away<00:00:29.699> protein<00:00:30.179> in

whatever<00:00:33.149> their<00:00:33.300> fitness<00:00:33.630> goals<00:00:33.870> are<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
whatever their fitness goals are and the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.020 
whatever their fitness goals are and the
problem<00:00:35.280> with<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.730> they're

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
problem with this is that they're

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.000 
problem with this is that they're
directly<00:00:36.570> linking<00:00:36.960> whey<00:00:37.140> protein<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
directly linking whey protein to the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.139 
directly linking whey protein to the
results<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.610> they're<00:00:38.790> trying<00:00:38.969> to

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
results that they're trying to

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.150 
results that they're trying to
accomplish<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.320> if<00:00:40.469> someone's<00:00:40.800> trying<00:00:40.980> to

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
accomplish so if someone's trying to

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.740 
accomplish so if someone's trying to
build<00:00:41.370> muscle<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.000> they<00:00:42.329> go<00:00:42.450> out<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.600> buy

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
build muscle and they go out and buy

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.200 
build muscle and they go out and buy
whey<00:00:43.079> protein<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.890> take<00:00:44.070> one<00:00:44.399> protein<00:00:44.850> scoop

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
whey protein and take one protein scoop

taking<00:01:16.110> Tier<00:01:16.380> one<00:01:16.470> if<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.950> saw<00:01:17.159> my<00:01:17.340> video<00:01:17.520> from

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
taking Tier one if you saw my video from

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.030 
taking Tier one if you saw my video from
last<00:01:18.030> week<00:01:18.570> but<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.290> lot<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.470> people<00:01:19.619> ask<00:01:19.860> well

why<00:01:20.159> don't<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.340> take<00:01:20.520> whey<00:01:20.729> protein<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.420> it's

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
why don't you take whey protein and it's

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.719 
why don't you take whey protein and it's
not<00:01:22.200> necessarily<00:01:22.560> they<00:01:22.799> don't<00:01:23.040> use<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.549> it's

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
not necessarily they don't use it it's

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.429 
not necessarily they don't use it it's
the<00:01:23.970> fact<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.420> don't<00:01:24.630> really<00:01:24.810> consider<00:01:25.020> it

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the fact that I don't really consider it

the fact that I don't really consider it
a<00:01:25.500> supplement<00:01:26.070> what<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.820> my<00:01:26.970> mind<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.479> a

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
a supplement what it is in my mind is a

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.749 
a supplement what it is in my mind is a
food<00:01:27.840> source<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.439> what<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.250> look<00:01:29.430> at<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
food source and what I look at is the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.520 
food source and what I look at is the
nutritional<00:01:30.299> label<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.290> does

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
nutritional label on it so it does

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.620 
nutritional label on it so it does
provide<00:01:31.710> protein<00:01:32.369> while<00:01:32.939> providing<00:01:33.450> little

huge role in that however if you're

of protein your diet without adding in
other<00:02:07.450> macronutrients<00:02:08.320> it's<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.530> great<00:02:08.770> way<00:02:08.920> to

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
other macronutrients it's a great way to

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.430 
other macronutrients it's a great way to
do<00:02:09.280> that<00:02:09.520> but<00:02:10.149> as<00:02:10.300> is<00:02:10.479> standard<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:11.140> as<00:02:11.230> our

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
do that but as is standard and as our

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.290 
do that but as is standard and as our
most<00:02:11.650> supplements<00:02:12.190> are<00:02:12.340> out<00:02:12.460> there<00:02:12.730> they<00:02:13.240> can

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
most supplements are out there they can

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.320 
most supplements are out there they can
be<00:02:13.510> beneficial<00:02:14.350> but<00:02:14.860> they<00:02:15.310> are<00:02:15.460> not<00:02:15.670> necessary

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
be beneficial but they are not necessary

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.180 
be beneficial but they are not necessary
so<00:02:16.810> if<00:02:16.960> you're<00:02:17.110> getting<00:02:17.380> plenty<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.710> protein

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
so if you're getting plenty of protein

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.700 
so if you're getting plenty of protein
in<00:02:18.430> your<00:02:18.580> normal<00:02:18.940> diet<00:02:19.120> as<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.720> whey<00:02:20.230> protein

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
in your normal diet as is whey protein

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.890 
in your normal diet as is whey protein
probably<00:02:21.130> isn't<00:02:21.430> necessary<00:02:21.880> for<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.360> however

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
probably isn't necessary for you however

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.510 
probably isn't necessary for you however
if<00:02:23.350> you're<00:02:23.560> looking<00:02:23.650> for<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:23.980> quick<00:02:24.280> and

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
if you're looking for a quick and

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.490 
if you're looking for a quick and
convenient<00:02:24.970> way<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.330> get<00:02:25.750> in<00:02:25.900> protein<00:02:26.350> without

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
convenient way to get in protein without

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.050 
convenient way to get in protein without
adding<00:02:26.980> other<00:02:27.100> things<00:02:27.220> as<00:02:27.580> mentioned<00:02:27.940> already

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
adding other things as mentioned already

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.820 
adding other things as mentioned already
then<00:02:28.780> maybe<00:02:28.990> it<00:02:29.170> is<00:02:29.290> something<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.680> need<00:02:29.800> to

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
then maybe it is something you need to

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.280 
then maybe it is something you need to

look into either way training still
takes<00:02:32.530> precedence<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.250> then<00:02:33.580> diet<00:02:33.820> plays<00:02:34.090> a

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
takes precedence and then diet plays a

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.510

secondary<00:02:34.630> role<00:02:34.840> as<00:02:34.960> well<00:02:35.140> together<00:02:35.950> they're

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
secondary role as well together they're
