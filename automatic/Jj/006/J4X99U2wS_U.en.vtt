whole<00:04:39.620> job<00:04:39.830> is<00:04:40.040> putting<00:04:40.190> it<00:04:40.400> back<00:04:40.580> in

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
whole job is putting it back in

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.480 
whole job is putting it back in
especially<00:04:41.720> with<00:04:41.810> one<00:04:41.960> person<00:04:42.229> using<00:04:44.410> ramps

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
especially with one person using ramps

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.740 
especially with one person using ramps
was<00:04:46.490> a<00:04:46.520> threaded<00:04:46.910> thunderstorm

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.670 

like<00:04:50.750> I<00:04:50.810> said<00:04:51.020> the<00:04:51.140> hardest<00:04:51.440> part<00:04:51.620> is

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
like I said the hardest part is

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.430 
like I said the hardest part is
targeting<00:04:52.040> that<00:04:52.130> back<00:04:52.280> in<00:04:52.520> you<00:04:53.120> know<00:04:53.440> through

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
targeting that back in you know through

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.380 
targeting that back in you know through
one<00:04:54.650> person<00:04:54.890> and<00:04:55.610> you're<00:04:55.760> doing<00:04:55.970> it<00:04:56.180> running

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
one person and you're doing it running

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.540 
one person and you're doing it running
ramps<00:04:56.990> and<00:04:57.740> kind<00:04:57.950> of<00:04:57.979> balance<00:04:58.130> that<00:04:58.310> heavy

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
ramps and kind of balance that heavy

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.010 
ramps and kind of balance that heavy
tank<00:04:58.820> and<00:04:59.000> then<00:04:59.090> having<00:04:59.479> it<00:04:59.570> half<00:04:59.720> way<00:04:59.900> in

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
tank and then having it half way in

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.130 
tank and then having it half way in
there<00:05:00.200> and<00:05:00.229> cooking<00:05:00.860> those<00:05:00.979> hoses<00:05:01.220> back<00:05:01.460> up

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
there and cooking those hoses back up

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.870 
there and cooking those hoses back up
one<00:05:03.140> thing<00:05:03.229> I<00:05:03.320> suggest<00:05:03.470> is<00:05:03.860> well<00:05:04.550> somebody's

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
you're taking it out just to cut the

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.390 
you're taking it out just to cut the
lines<00:05:09.050> cuz<00:05:09.800> you're<00:05:09.890> gonna<00:05:09.950> replace<00:05:10.190> them

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
anyway might not be a bad idea so having

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.600 
anyway might not be a bad idea so having
to<00:05:12.350> push<00:05:12.890> them<00:05:13.040> through<00:05:13.070> or<00:05:13.340> something<00:05:13.490> like

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
to push them through or something like

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.550 
to push them through or something like
that

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
that

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:26.629 
that
well<00:05:15.560> that's<00:05:16.100> it

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.879

looks like if you just go from straight
from<00:05:53.389> the<00:05:53.480> tank<00:05:54.400> small<00:05:55.400> on<00:05:55.880> both<00:05:56.090> sides<00:05:56.919> looks

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
from the tank small on both sides looks

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:01.710 
from the tank small on both sides looks
a<00:05:57.980> little<00:05:58.100> better

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.980 

well<00:06:02.720> the<00:06:02.930> tanks<00:06:03.230> back<00:06:03.440> in<00:06:03.710> again<00:06:04.750> at<00:06:05.750> the<00:06:05.870> new

well the tanks back in again at the new
two<00:06:06.110> crossover<00:06:06.560> pipe<00:06:06.770> and<00:06:07.520> I<00:06:07.610> didn't<00:06:07.790> notice

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
two crossover pipe and I didn't notice

two crossover pipe and I didn't notice
what<00:06:08.180> happened<00:06:08.419> was<00:06:08.510> uh<00:06:08.540> this<00:06:08.960> overflow<00:06:09.200> tube

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
what happened was uh this overflow tube

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.750 
what happened was uh this overflow tube
one<00:06:09.889> of<00:06:10.010> the<00:06:10.400> top<00:06:10.700> of<00:06:10.910> that<00:06:11.380> was<00:06:12.380> the<00:06:12.680> there's<00:06:13.639> a

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
one of the top of that was the there's a

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.520 
one of the top of that was the there's a
connector<00:06:14.090> on<00:06:14.150> the<00:06:14.270> top<00:06:14.479> and<00:06:14.810> had<00:06:14.990> fallen<00:06:15.229> off

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530

and<00:06:15.979> it<00:06:16.220> was<00:06:16.310> dirt<00:06:16.460> inside<00:06:16.790> so<00:06:17.120> I<00:06:17.150> can

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
and it was dirt inside so I can

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:18.909 
and it was dirt inside so I can
guarantee<00:06:17.810> there<00:06:18.050> were<00:06:18.110> fumes<00:06:18.410> coming<00:06:18.650> out<00:06:18.770> of

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
guarantee there were fumes coming out of

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.360 
guarantee there were fumes coming out of
there<00:06:19.040> so<00:06:19.280> that<00:06:19.310> was<00:06:19.520> him<00:06:19.790> back<00:06:20.030> up<00:06:20.210> again<00:06:21.370> now
