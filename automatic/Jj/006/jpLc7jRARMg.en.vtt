00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello you do n't want anything special 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.130
 tell me more about alcatel watches 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.799
 one touch which unlike many 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.480
 few other products work with ios 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.490
 This category can boast 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.860
 with similar opportunities first look I 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.080
 did the congress of 2015 and now I offer 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.490
 get to know them more went to 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.890
 exact discounts to all subscribers from 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.539
 partner and store apple and just.ru what 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.119
 of you generally represent smart watches 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.529
 let's say a sample of 2015 first 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.630
 the queue is a device that can 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.910
 display notifications they have already passed 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.800
 a certain stage of evolution remember the first gear 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.120
 which I also surveyed on the channel they 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.340
 were very strange there at least 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.290
 there was a camera and a stupid docking station for 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.610
 charging such a solution are found and 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.350
 sports bracelets but they need 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.270
 charge not so often therefore not 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.460
 critical although I was already lost 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.050
 cap and this is a problem but something about 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.120
 on iq philbin unfortunately he is no longer 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.610
 produced can be charged directly 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.960
 through yusb and this damn convenient it 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.670
 I looked at how they go 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.079
 manufacturers thought it is impossible 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.660
 make the same simple solution 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.699
 charger in the straps guys from alcatel 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.170
 as if they heard my prayers from one 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.120
 side induction charging sounds 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.860
 proudly with another modern smart watch 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.650
 have such small batteries that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.119
 charge them whenever possible 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.830
 great opportunity case swan then what 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.409
 it may be easier to charge always with you 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.420
 stuck in the powerbank and drove by the words 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.060
 valka hotel is fully charged for 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.439
 one o'clock and in the active mode installation 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.420
 work three or four days what 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.030
 Agree by modern standards in general 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.650
 not bad violence from 2015 hours showed 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.780
 working with android what am i 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.790
 showed himself on the channel but now 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.250
 there is already almost complete and 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.950
 ios application looks pretty 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.960
 all that is necessary can, especially since the clock 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.700
 The latest data will be available in 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.460
 Russia at the end of April and will cost 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.380
 about 9000 rubles, especially if you keep 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.140
 in mind that apple watch will start 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.750
 From 25 it is clear that here is not the coolest 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.610
 iron is clear that this is alcatel but for 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.130
 9000 they can show notifications 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.659
 what else is necessary besides jokes 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.820
 pretty enough diameter 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.729
 42 mm dial design 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.950
 very similar to moto 360 which everyone 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.840
 for some reason wildly like assembling built 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.240
 on alcatel's own system in this 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.920
 there are pros and cons of works and no cons 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.020
 so many applications but all basic 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.550
 features that you 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.440
 want to get from smart watches here 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.630
 there are all kinds of notice 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.610
 control camera release and so on 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.160
 Do not go anywhere and heart rate sensors 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.320
 gyro accelerometer electronic compass 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.390
 the height of the meter is enough to 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.670
 monitor your livelihoods except 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.190
 This watch is equipped with a choice of motor 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.960
 nfc and have heat and moisture protection 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.210
 ip67 standard 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.430
 what happens on one side of the scale 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.220
 nice design super comfortable charging 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.740
 adequate price smart job opportunities 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.680
 with the weight of all this, my pulse jumped 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.240
 hd 90 and on the other side of the scale alcatel and 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.340
 own platform obviously 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.800
 a huge amount of software under this watch 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.540
 absolutely not worth the wait is not interesting 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.370
 The thing on my phone was not skype and 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.230
 for good reason he was not among 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.180
 applications from which I want to receive 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.280
 notice on the clock posts like me 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.290
 put it from here like no water here 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.390
 we get an interesting thing obviously 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.400
 Alcatel one touch watch is not the best 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.220
 today is on the market if we have in 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.110
 mind work with android asus motorola lg and 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.790
 samsung lava and anyone now there only 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.410
 no google rumors 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.209
 planning to port its platform 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.250
 android and ios 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.380
 what will announce the next conference 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.150
 google ayol but this when else happens 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.459
 its here we smoothly come to understand 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.020
 that the market of smart watches under ios can 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.450
 count on one hand 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.910
 actually apple watch pebble can be 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.709
 something else is preparing for the exit and alcatel 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.480
 In the global sense, the guy is certainly not 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.160
 Apple Watch rival even considering 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.200
 which is two times cheaper than most 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.330
 affordable model but overall product 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.370
 It turned out very funny so to say 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.350
 like if you have an iphone and some 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.300
 desire to try smart watches I would 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.490
 Recommended to look at the van tach but 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.990
 need of course vilify them longer when 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.550
 they will already be on sale 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.660
