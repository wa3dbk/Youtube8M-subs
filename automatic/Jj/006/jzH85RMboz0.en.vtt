00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
at what the square

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.080 
at what the square
icons<00:02:13.720> look<00:02:14.020> like<00:02:14.350> with<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.160> labels<00:02:15.670> on<00:02:15.880> them

I<00:02:16.210> think<00:02:16.480> you'll<00:02:16.720> you'll<00:02:17.710> agree<00:02:18.040> probably

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
I think you'll you'll agree probably

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.900 
I think you'll you'll agree probably
that<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.210> labels<00:02:19.900> look<00:02:20.170> better<00:02:20.730> under<00:02:21.730> the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
that the labels look better under the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.880 
that the labels look better under the
square<00:02:22.120> icons<00:02:22.780> at<00:02:22.990> least<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.380> think<00:02:23.470> they<00:02:23.830> do

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
square icons at least I think they do

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.580 
square icons at least I think they do
and<00:02:24.310> I<00:02:24.820> prefer<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.630> know<00:02:25.750> sometimes<00:02:26.290> the

and I prefer you know sometimes the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.870 
and I prefer you know sometimes the
round<00:02:26.920> flat<00:02:27.520> icons<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:29.200> don't<00:02:29.860> like<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.100> have

round flat icons I don't like to have

the<00:02:31.060> labels<00:02:31.570> underneath<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.800> icon<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:33.550> I<00:02:33.580> had

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
the labels underneath the icon so I had

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.870 
the labels underneath the icon so I had
turned<00:02:34.150> those<00:02:34.300> off<00:02:34.510> using<00:02:34.900> springtomize<00:02:35.320> 3
