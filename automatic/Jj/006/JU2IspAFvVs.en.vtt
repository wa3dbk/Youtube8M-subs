00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
waving back at me so how would you

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.590 
waving back at me so how would you
create<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.040> simply<00:01:47.369> created<00:01:47.970> by<00:01:48.210> having

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
create it you simply created by having

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.770 
create it you simply created by having
it's<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.840> very<00:01:49.220> weird<00:01:51.979> unbalanced<00:01:53.600> formula<00:01:54.600> to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
it's a very weird unbalanced formula to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.010 
it's a very weird unbalanced formula to
create<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.619> how<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.860> create<00:01:56.159> a

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
create it so this is how you create a

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.289 
create it so this is how you create a
CCTV<00:01:58.020> which<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.860> very<00:01:59.189> strange<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.880> need<00:02:00.030> wood

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
CCTV which is very strange you need wood

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.770 
CCTV which is very strange you need wood
cobblestone<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.229> dirt<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.909> to<00:02:02.909> create<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
cobblestone and dirt and to create the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.130 
cobblestone and dirt and to create the
monitor<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:05.040> create<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.869> same

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
monitor you just create this in the same

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.070 
monitor you just create this in the same
items<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.550> I'm<00:02:08.910> guessing<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.539> still<00:02:09.929> in

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
items so I'm guessing this is still in

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.640 
items so I'm guessing this is still in
alpha<00:02:10.849> otherwise<00:02:11.849> this<00:02:12.330> is

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
alpha otherwise this is

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.360 
alpha otherwise this is
a<00:02:12.709> horrible<00:02:13.519> mod<00:02:13.849> for<00:02:15.040> imagine<00:02:16.040> if<00:02:16.159> we<00:02:16.220> can

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370
