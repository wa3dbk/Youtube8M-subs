warm<00:00:08.580> up<00:00:08.790> before<00:00:09.450> games<00:00:10.370> typically<00:00:11.370> we<00:00:11.610> do<00:00:11.759> our

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
warm up before games typically we do our

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.509 
warm up before games typically we do our
two<00:00:12.059> line<00:00:12.300> labs<00:00:12.740> which<00:00:13.740> has<00:00:13.950> some<00:00:14.160> value<00:00:14.490> I

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
two line labs which has some value I

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.860 
two line labs which has some value I
think<00:00:14.610> just<00:00:15.030> in<00:00:15.120> terms<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.450> getting<00:00:15.599> your<00:00:15.690> team

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
think just in terms of getting your team

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.130 
think just in terms of getting your team
together<00:00:16.049> getting<00:00:16.920> warmed<00:00:17.190> up<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.400> little<00:00:17.430> bit

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
together getting warmed up a little bit

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.840 
together getting warmed up a little bit
but<00:00:19.140> from<00:00:19.380> there<00:00:19.529> what<00:00:19.740> do<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.830> do<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.730> I

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
but from there what do you do and I

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.599 
but from there what do you do and I
think<00:00:20.880> my<00:00:21.240> challenge<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:21.960> would<00:00:22.350> be<00:00:22.609> what

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
think my challenge to you would be what

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.580 
think my challenge to you would be what
you<00:00:23.760> do<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.150> rest<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.689> warmup<00:00:25.109> time<00:00:25.140> does

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
you do the rest of that warmup time does

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.320 
you do the rest of that warmup time does
that<00:00:25.619> prepare<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.460> for<00:00:26.490> things<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.180> are

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
and all this is doing is taking a motion

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.929 
and all this is doing is taking a motion
concept<00:01:30.350> which<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.770> part<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.189> every<00:01:32.520> offense

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
concept which is a part of every offense

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.660 
concept which is a part of every offense
that<00:01:33.210> everybody<00:01:33.659> runs<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.890> getting<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.400> part

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
that everybody runs and getting a part

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.910 
that everybody runs and getting a part
of<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> game<00:01:36.030> into<00:01:36.270> your<00:01:36.450> warmup<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.110> again

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
of the game into your warmup and again

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.590 
of the game into your warmup and again
there's<00:01:38.100> thousands<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.880> things<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.450> do

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
there's thousands of things you can do

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.620 
there's thousands of things you can do
and<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.470> think<00:01:40.500> passing<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.400> cutting<00:01:41.790> types<00:01:42.450> of

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
and I think passing and cutting types of

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.210 
and I think passing and cutting types of
things<00:01:42.780> are<00:01:42.930> really<00:01:43.200> good<00:01:43.350> too<00:01:43.530> wakes<00:01:43.860> up<00:01:44.100> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
things are really good too wakes up the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.609 
things are really good too wakes up the
hands<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.720> really<00:01:45.899> gets<00:01:46.020> kids<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.409> think

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
hands and it really gets kids to think

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.389 
hands and it really gets kids to think
about<00:01:46.829> passing<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.549> catching<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:48.380> certainly

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
about passing and catching and certainly

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.060 
about passing and catching and certainly
last<00:01:50.399> thing<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.149> your<00:01:51.360> warm-ups<00:01:52.070> everything

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
last thing in your warm-ups everything

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.280 
last thing in your warm-ups everything
that's<00:01:53.310> done<00:01:53.549> make<00:01:54.299> sure<00:01:54.329> they<00:01:54.840> are<00:01:54.960> calling

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
that's done make sure they are calling

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.539 
that's done make sure they are calling
out<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.590> name<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.009> person<00:01:56.219> they're

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
out the name of the person they're

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.620 
out the name of the person they're
passing<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.409> why<00:01:58.409> that's<00:01:59.070> already

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
passing to why that's already

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.350 
passing to why that's already
subconsciously<00:02:00.680> building<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:02.640> value<00:02:03.149> of

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
subconsciously building the value of

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.840 
subconsciously building the value of
communication<00:02:04.140> before<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.950> tip-off<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:05.729> that

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
communication before the tip-off so that

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.930 
communication before the tip-off so that
when<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.030> game<00:02:06.210> starts<00:02:06.630> your<00:02:06.780> players<00:02:07.049> are

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
when the game starts your players are

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.110 
when the game starts your players are
live<00:02:08.940> engaged<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:10.440> really

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
live engaged and really
