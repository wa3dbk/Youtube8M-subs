00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.610
 Hello, I 'm dammert from real inc brazil 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.460
 a specialized printers company 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.010
 photo paper cartridges we are 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.090
 here at tatuí são paulo on joão avenue 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:24.869
 climactic 21 and I will introduce to you 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.510
 now that model that does not 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.940
 the continuous recharge system of the real 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.520
 inc 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:37.320
 it is ideal for anyone who prints between 500 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:41.430
 and two thousand pages per month above 2000 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:46.220
 we advise that the hp 8610 or 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.220
 86 20 having a larger reservoir 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.950
 Before I forget, I do not know how 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.380
 it is used and only then to fuel it, not 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.320
 go through this upper breath 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.850
 not the victim and the reservoir 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:07.450
 Do not leak, you can rest easy. 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.229
 I opened the largest indirect largest fifth 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.640
 around here 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:15.940
 so this is why here is ok and 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:20.560
 If you have difficulty do 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:24.759
 The strip removes the pen cap that 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.580
 it's too much on another kisser pen 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:32.110
 ambon that is already easier, sir. 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:36.190
 this part here arises here and ready the 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.490
 dog you will use this theme with 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.360
 open breaths always open ok it just 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:47.560
 will close for transportation and will not let 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.920
 Attention is to lower at least one 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.220
 centimeter of ink column that hand 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.160
 let's lower that level here because 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.990
 otherwise it will start to enter the system 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.550
 ipad vacuum and the ink will not put 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.479
 beauty cartridge 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.850
 the black ink is spicy special to 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.830
 but I bought there in real here but here 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.709
 we have three four types of ink 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.150
 so you ask for special black 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.390
 pigmented special 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.850
 the color is dye, right? 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.480
 When you go to print your photo 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.030
 select from the photo paper panel 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.730
 and will print text as paper 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.709
 normal because when you go to print 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.830
 She does not use black 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.990
 to use only the colored ones 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.319
 if you print photo paper 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.450
 photographic as plain paper is not the 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.160
 What will happen will leave will leave one 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.290
 soot on paper 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:50.740
 ok never use draft economy mode 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:55.209
 that wears the cartridge a lot 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.519
 Another tip is do not leave the reservoir in 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.019
 the top of the printer does not start dripping 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.209
 in there 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.510
 this on the side here on that support that we 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.780
 as 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.060
 camus it has to look good on the level of 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.640
 the printer 's printer base is 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.060
 on the table and stand has to stand in the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.060
 table too 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.400
 if you want to make the cartridge last 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.920
 but still looking to run a car 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.720
 cleaning every 15 days 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.890
 fortnightly you go there in the panel of 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.410
 before when you will print and click 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.240
 Ok, but a pardon forgiveness pardon 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.940
 do not click ok you click on 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.250
 ownership of the print 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.990
 program you are using 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.900
 changes a little bit of ownership 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:43.170
 printer or print options 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.700
 clicking there at the end in the window that 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.070
 opens on the right side will be there 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.350
 cyclical maintenance there and then the next 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.350
 The left side speaks deep 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.910
 do not perform this once every 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.340
 fifteen bia 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.920
 She's going to steal only one drop of 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.370
 ink on the system and will play on the 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.330
 her inner reservoir that it avoids 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:09.510
 the formation of cartridge bubbles in the 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.670
 forgive the air bubble in the cartridge and 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.250
 significantly increases the 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.160
 durability of the cartridge branches 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.140
 also talk about the cartridge warranty 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.100
 we have to limit the guarantee of the 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:25.680
 the original charge or when 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.040
 ends the original cartridge load 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.350
 The warranty for the cartridge is 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.900
 who knows this for you to continue 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.400
 printing after finishing the original load 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.330
 You have to push this button. 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.030
 stop here for eight seconds once a 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.120
 black and when the color is not finished 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.910
 eight seconds again we have to 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.090
 limit the warranty on the cartridge to 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.280
 because, unfortunately, it has 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.460
 people who do not use our 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.350
 The indications are not we talk to leave 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.460
 the open breath the person forgets 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.740
 closed 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.600
 talking not to mix with 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.790
 another place the person goes there 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.400
 stationery and buys the first ink 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.800
 that you see it is difficult to guarantee the 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.900
 cartridge is then combined with 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.410
 and printer system warranty . 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:20.520
 six months the cartridge warranty is 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:22.770
 original load only increases and 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.620
 attention to that the car is expensive is not a 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.440
 Black cartridge is on average 90 reais 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.080
 flowery 120 reais you can search in the 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.620
 kalunga no jima and tefé there the price is 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.620
 that same 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.290
 now let's talk about using this 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.660
 product 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.480
 You do not put the paper here. 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:47.530
 too much paper at once net not install 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:49.210

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.190
 What are you going to do, will not you pull here? 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.070
 I do not know, but I do not know 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:58.080
 break the printer and gear 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.080
 will become a printer 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:07.510
 then you will get the tape that goes right 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:11.290
 take the latch well you can still take the 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:14.860
 When the ear reaches the ear that pulls 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:16.330
 here and take care of the rock behind here 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.450

 closing and put it there. 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:30.490

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.410
 right on paper do not use the right damp paper 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:37.600
 make sure that the paper is loose 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:39.730
