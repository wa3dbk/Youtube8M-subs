00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
so I've made four of these and I've got

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.660 
so I've made four of these and I've got
them<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> plate<00:00:52.050> resting<00:00:52.800> that's<00:00:53.250> upside

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
them on a plate resting that's upside

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.240 
them on a plate resting that's upside
down<00:00:54.000> why<00:00:54.690> because<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.350> just<00:00:55.530> easier<00:00:56.010> then

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
down why because it's just easier then

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.459 
down why because it's just easier then
to<00:00:56.670> pull<00:00:56.940> them<00:00:57.149> away<00:00:57.270> whereas<00:00:57.989> if<00:00:58.079> it's<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.440> a

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
to pull them away whereas if it's on a

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.319 
to pull them away whereas if it's on a
plate<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> right<00:00:59.190> side<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.940> they<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.239> all

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
plate the right side it can they can all

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.450 
plate the right side it can they can all
stick<00:01:00.870> together<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.770> flip<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> other<00:01:02.219> way

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
stick together so flip it the other way

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.969 
stick together so flip it the other way
