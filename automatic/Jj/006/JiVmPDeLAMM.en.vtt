the<00:01:36.390> first<00:01:36.420> time<00:01:36.840> because<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.229> light<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.770> so

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.170 
so here's my little bit of fish
something<00:01:46.830> around<00:01:46.950> being<00:01:47.250> happy<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.940> took<00:01:48.030> me

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
something around being happy it took me

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.850 
something around being happy it took me
up<00:01:48.300> pretty<00:01:48.540> much<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:49.020> week<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.470> set<00:01:49.650> up<00:01:49.740> this

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
up pretty much a week to set up this

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.500 
up pretty much a week to set up this
tank<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.280> was<00:01:50.370> a<00:01:50.550> little<00:01:50.760> cloudy<00:01:50.940> at<00:01:51.150> first<00:01:51.360> as

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
tank it was a little cloudy at first as

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.360 
tank it was a little cloudy at first as
you<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.750> see<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:52.230> after<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> while<00:01:52.950> the

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
you can see and then after a while the

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.370 
you can see and then after a while the
filter<00:01:53.670> did<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.910> good<00:01:54.030> job<00:01:54.090> clearing<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.990> up<00:01:55.110> and

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
filter did a good job clearing it up and

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.680 
filter did a good job clearing it up and
the<00:01:56.220> plants<00:01:56.580> so<00:01:56.880> far<00:01:57.090> they're<00:01:57.300> just<00:01:57.450> growing

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
the plants so far they're just growing

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.960 
the plants so far they're just growing
out<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.110> they<00:01:58.290> don't<00:01:58.440> look<00:01:58.530> as<00:01:59.010> fancy<00:01:59.370> but<00:01:59.730> with

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
out so they don't look as fancy but with

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.880 
out so they don't look as fancy but with
time<00:02:00.270> they<00:02:00.690> will<00:02:00.870> grow<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.260> fill<00:02:01.470> up<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.650> tank

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
time they will grow and fill up the tank

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.950 
time they will grow and fill up the tank
I<00:02:02.100> really<00:02:02.700> think<00:02:02.910> this<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.180> really<00:02:03.390> pretty<00:02:03.600> but

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
I really think this is really pretty but

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.440 
I really think this is really pretty but
also<00:02:04.230> is<00:02:04.650> a<00:02:04.680> great<00:02:04.890> way<00:02:05.090> has<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.120> betta<00:02:06.390> fish

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
also is a great way has a betta fish

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.690 
also is a great way has a betta fish
because<00:02:06.870> it<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.080> so<00:02:07.590> much<00:02:07.680> less<00:02:07.920> work<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.369> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
because it is so much less work on the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.150 
because it is so much less work on the
maintenance<00:02:09.090> would<00:02:09.300> be<00:02:09.479> about<00:02:09.690> maybe<00:02:10.380> once<00:02:10.740> a

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
maintenance would be about maybe once a

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.310 
maintenance would be about maybe once a
month<00:02:11.190> or<00:02:11.880> you<00:02:12.060> know<00:02:12.150> slight<00:02:12.510> water<00:02:12.750> changes

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
month or you know slight water changes

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.320 
month or you know slight water changes
and<00:02:13.350> every<00:02:14.010> couple<00:02:14.220> months<00:02:14.430> maybe<00:02:14.730> vacuum<00:02:15.210> the

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
and every couple months maybe vacuum the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.120 
and every couple months maybe vacuum the
gravel<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.110> know<00:02:16.470> just<00:02:16.680> change<00:02:16.920> the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
gravel and you know just change the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.590 
gravel and you know just change the
filter<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:17.610> all<00:02:17.670> those<00:02:17.820> things<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.420> feed

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
filter and all those things and feed

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.150 
filter and all those things and feed
your<00:02:18.690> fish<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:18.959> you<00:02:19.470> know<00:02:19.560> that's<00:02:19.770> really<00:02:19.830> not

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
much it's a lot less work than keeping a
