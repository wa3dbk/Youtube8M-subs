00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.309
 take with them well the little maite 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.190

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.150
 smaller 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.150
 bigger 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.680
 why why 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:23.929
 the teacher April Sanchez graduated in 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.090
 last September despite the difficult 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.979
 working conditions defends its 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.990
 vocation for what I expected as 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.750
 teacher indeed if it was something that I 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.250
 I wanted to do from the beginning nothing more 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.859
 that he had not found the place up 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.929
 I found out about conafe and it was like that 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:41.000
 like everything I wanted then 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.459
 right now I would like to practice here and 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.890
 learn a lot with children and already 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:48.429
 then you can look elsewhere 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.719
 but I'm very happy to be here in a coma 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.750
 fortunately if they see children this one 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:55.909
 they like them like how they like 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.259
 we did classes like to come this 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.420
 if by them they should go to the ends 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.159
 week is a school like any 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.239
 another incision is a school like 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.149
 any other I teach it in the 

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:06.890
 same topics be all everything all normal 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.140
 nothing more simply because they do not have 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.940
 the common conditions for the norm 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.549
 which is to the playground at 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.010
 sports but we all do it here the 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.470
 campus has 48 students from first to 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.380
 sixth year everyone studies in two rooms 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.430
 one of them with dirt floor are of 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.260
 wood 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.719
 school is located in the middle of houses 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.290
 wood and canvas the only request that 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:33.079
 have these teachers is the donation of 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.750
 tarps to cover holes in the ceiling 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:39.680
 because when it rains, the rain and 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:43.780
 damages school materials on a tv 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.780
