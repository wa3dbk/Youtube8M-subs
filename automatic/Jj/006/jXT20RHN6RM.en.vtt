this<00:00:04.880> work<00:00:05.090> in<00:00:05.270> particular<00:00:05.420> is<00:00:06.050> important

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
this work in particular is important

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.740 
this work in particular is important
because<00:00:07.010> when<00:00:07.910> you<00:00:08.000> think<00:00:08.180> about<00:00:08.420> everything

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
because when you think about everything

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.600 
because when you think about everything
that's<00:00:09.020> happening<00:00:09.469> in<00:00:09.740> the<00:00:09.920> bay<00:00:10.100> this<00:00:10.430> is

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
that's happening in the bay this is

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.549 
that's happening in the bay this is
really<00:00:11.000> the<00:00:11.150> currency<00:00:11.780> the<00:00:11.930> ecological

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
really the currency the ecological

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.949 
really the currency the ecological
currency<00:00:12.980> that<00:00:13.129> matters<00:00:13.520> is<00:00:13.700> the<00:00:13.850> eggs<00:00:14.030> on<00:00:14.629> the

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:14.959 
currency that matters is the eggs on the

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:16.810 
currency that matters is the eggs on the
bay<00:00:15.110> nothing<00:00:15.530> else<00:00:15.709> really<00:00:15.860> matters<00:00:16.010> to<00:00:16.730> the

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
bay nothing else really matters to the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.120 
bay nothing else really matters to the
birds<00:00:17.289> you<00:00:18.289> know<00:00:18.380> you<00:00:18.440> can<00:00:18.619> have<00:00:18.710> shifts<00:00:19.039> in

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
birds you know you can have shifts in

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.040 
birds you know you can have shifts in
habitat<00:00:19.580> you<00:00:19.730> can<00:00:19.850> have<00:00:20.029> predation<00:00:20.780> or<00:00:20.930> you're

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
habitat you can have predation or you're

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.710 
habitat you can have predation or you're
gonna<00:00:21.140> have<00:00:21.730> gulls<00:00:22.730> you<00:00:23.210> can<00:00:23.330> have<00:00:23.480> things

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
gonna have gulls you can have things

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.570 
gonna have gulls you can have things
like<00:00:23.900> that<00:00:23.930> competitors<00:00:24.650> but<00:00:25.130> really<00:00:25.430> what

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
like that competitors but really what

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.400 
like that competitors but really what
matters<00:00:25.760> to<00:00:26.420> the<00:00:26.510> birds<00:00:26.690> the<00:00:26.840> most<00:00:27.020> is<00:00:27.230> how

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
matters to the birds the most is how

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.870 
matters to the birds the most is how
fast<00:00:27.650> and<00:00:27.890> they<00:00:27.950> put<00:00:28.160> on<00:00:28.280> weight<00:00:28.460> and<00:00:28.640> get<00:00:28.760> to

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
fast and they put on weight and get to

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.730 
fast and they put on weight and get to
the<00:00:28.970> Arctic<00:00:29.330> and<00:00:29.510> that<00:00:29.870> is<00:00:30.140> primarily<00:00:30.590> a

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
the Arctic and that is primarily a

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.260 
the Arctic and that is primarily a
function<00:00:30.800> of<00:00:31.190> how<00:00:31.310> many<00:00:31.520> eggs<00:00:31.700> there<00:00:31.910> are<00:00:32.059> on

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
function of how many eggs there are on

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.420 
function of how many eggs there are on
the<00:00:32.450> beaches<00:00:32.899> and<00:00:33.379> how<00:00:33.680> available<00:00:33.950> they<00:00:34.250> are

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
the beaches and how available they are

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.060 
the beaches and how available they are
to<00:00:34.520> the<00:00:34.610> birds<00:00:35.110> what<00:00:36.110> we<00:00:36.230> do<00:00:36.409> is<00:00:36.530> we<00:00:36.649> go<00:00:36.800> out<00:00:36.829> to

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
to the birds what we do is we go out to

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.700 
to the birds what we do is we go out to
each<00:00:37.219> beach<00:00:37.519> at<00:00:37.969> low<00:00:38.300> time<00:00:38.539> we<00:00:38.989> take<00:00:39.140> 20<00:00:39.530> core

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
each beach at low time we take 20 core

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.319 
each beach at low time we take 20 core
samples<00:00:40.159> in<00:00:40.309> each<00:00:40.550> lane<00:00:40.820> so<00:00:41.179> that's

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
samples in each lane so that's

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.680 
samples in each lane so that's
approximately<00:00:42.100> one<00:00:43.100> core<00:00:43.670> sample<00:00:44.059> per<00:00:44.329> square

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
approximately one core sample per square

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.610 
approximately one core sample per square
meter<00:00:44.960> of<00:00:45.050> beach<00:00:45.530> that<00:00:45.769> we're<00:00:45.920> sampling<00:00:46.249> and

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
meter of beach that we're sampling and

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.540 
meter of beach that we're sampling and
we<00:00:48.620> do<00:00:48.739> this<00:00:48.890> randomly<00:00:51.010> and<00:00:52.010> then<00:00:52.159> what<00:00:52.309> we<00:00:52.399> do

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
we do this randomly and then what we do

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.250 
we do this randomly and then what we do
is<00:00:52.699> we<00:00:52.789> put<00:00:52.969> the<00:00:53.089> samples<00:00:53.659> inches<00:00:53.960> it<00:00:54.109> back

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
is we put the samples inches it back

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.930 
is we put the samples inches it back
baggie<00:00:54.530> then<00:00:55.039> we<00:00:55.129> bring<00:00:55.309> them<00:00:55.399> back<00:00:55.460> to<00:00:55.819> the

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
baggie then we bring them back to the

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.469 
baggie then we bring them back to the
house<00:00:56.210> where<00:00:57.170> we<00:00:57.229> will<00:00:57.589> first<00:00:57.859> go<00:00:58.069> through<00:00:58.479> and

00:00:59.469 --> 00:00:59.479 
house where we will first go through and

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.129 
house where we will first go through and
put<00:00:59.839> them<00:00:59.960> through<00:00:59.989> a<00:01:00.229> series<00:01:00.620> of<00:01:00.649> sins<00:01:02.139> and

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:03.139 
put them through a series of sins and

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:04.509 
put them through a series of sins and
the<00:01:03.710> horseshoe<00:01:03.979> crab<00:01:04.159> eggs<00:01:04.280> are

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
the horseshoe crab eggs are

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.149 
the horseshoe crab eggs are
approximately<00:01:05.120> between<00:01:05.239> two<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:05.990> three

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
approximately between two and three

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.530 
approximately between two and three
millimeters<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:07.460> that<00:01:07.670> keeps<00:01:07.880> all<00:01:08.180> of<00:01:08.360> our

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
millimeters so that keeps all of our

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.370 
millimeters so that keeps all of our
eggs<00:01:09.130> inside<00:01:10.130> our<00:01:10.550> last<00:01:10.850> sip<00:01:11.180> we<00:01:11.840> then<00:01:12.050> take

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
eggs inside our last sip we then take

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.070 
eggs inside our last sip we then take
the<00:01:12.970> sand<00:01:13.970> that's<00:01:14.210> left<00:01:14.420> in<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.630> last<00:01:14.780> sieve

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
the sand that's left in the last sieve

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.390 
the sand that's left in the last sieve
and<00:01:15.260> put<00:01:15.410> it<00:01:15.500> into<00:01:15.710> one<00:01:15.740> of<00:01:15.950> our<00:01:16.040> counting

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
and put it into one of our counting

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.710 
and put it into one of our counting
trees<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:18.010> we<00:01:19.010> go<00:01:19.220> through<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:20.600> entire

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
trees and we go through the entire

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.010 
trees and we go through the entire
sample<00:01:21.290> by<00:01:21.770> hands<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:22.880> count<00:01:23.390> each<00:01:23.720> of<00:01:23.930> the

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
sample by hands and count each of the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.360 
sample by hands and count each of the
little<00:01:24.170> horseshoe<00:01:24.470> crab<00:01:24.770> eggs<00:01:24.920> that<00:01:25.160> are<00:01:25.250> in

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
little horseshoe crab eggs that are in

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.690 
little horseshoe crab eggs that are in

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
it a red not needs to eat 21,000 eggs

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.630 
it a red not needs to eat 21,000 eggs
per<00:01:29.060> day<00:01:29.270> for<00:01:30.230> approximately<00:01:30.890> two<00:01:31.310> to<00:01:31.430> three
