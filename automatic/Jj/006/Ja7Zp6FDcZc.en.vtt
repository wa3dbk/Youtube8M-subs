I'm taking from this is that sometimes
our<00:01:53.520> government<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.030> work<00:01:54.210> or<00:01:54.450> at<00:01:54.810> least<00:01:55.020> try

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
our government can work or at least try

to work and in light of this filibuster
a<00:01:56.969> truly<00:01:57.540> bipartisan<00:01:58.020> effort<00:01:58.439> could<00:01:58.530> be<00:01:58.680> made
