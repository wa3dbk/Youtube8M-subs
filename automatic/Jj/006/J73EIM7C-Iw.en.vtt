00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.929
 hi guys then this is mine 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.879
 proposal for new year you know that the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.919
 second part is a video tutorial 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.630
 inspired by jennifer lawrence in the first 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.190
 I did the illuminating face base the 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.020
 I do contouring in this instead 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.150
 this very intense smokey eyes 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.080
 very suitable for new years 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.750
 I make this video in collaboration 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.310
 with five other girls then each 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.080
 will make a proposal for new year that you 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.699
 you will have five ideas and then the idea 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.380
 I think the link is very nice 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.140
 of their info pops channels we start 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.390
 then I first apply the primer 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.540
 Kiko the classic of all 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.540
 eyelid 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.680
 then they take bretto kiko number 122 which 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:46.570
 it has a dove gray color and I apply it 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.570
 all over the eyelid too 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:19.100
 Now we need the black eye shadow on Iuso 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.630
 number 180 of kiko and I'm going to apply it 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.780
 with a short flat brush 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.670
 tapping enel the obligation in the 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:31.150
 second half of the eye being a lot 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.150
 attached to the eyelid rim and rising 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.080
 ok start fading with a brush for 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.770
 antea shade bringing the nuance 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.900
 outwards and upwards 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.090
 but we never have in the inner corner 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.090
 which must always remain very bright 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.959
 well now we need kiko eye shadow 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.989
 infinities park the number 410 which is a 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.910
 very pigmented blue and glittery 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.269
 I go to apply where I first put the 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.269
 black 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.520
 I pick up the brush for a wide shade 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.010
 and I am going to blend it all as it is a 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.750
 trick in which there is a lot of dark dust 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.600
 I advise you to do the makeup first 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:54.310
 eyes then the base in fact now let's go 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.230
 to adjust the short cut of the 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.540
 smokey eyes with brush for 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.360
 foundation the foundation so that 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.190
 so we go to clean the eye and 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.190
 any excess dust 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.390
 well now with a light beige I use the 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.320
 light beige of the white kids palette 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.360
 brown i go to put it in the arch 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.330
 do not use a color 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.640
 too light or shiny but must 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:43.170
 be a very natural color a color 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.450
 beige meat ok now we need the pencil 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.570
 black island but will unravel of goods that e 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:54.060
 I'm going to board the whole eyelash line 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:58.640
 upper and lower part 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.640
 lower I will go to limestone 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:30.600
 and above all outwards because of them 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:34.260
 then we will blend it with the brush a 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.750

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.070
