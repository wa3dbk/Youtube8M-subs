00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
added a more gel

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.950 
added a more gel
in<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.860> heel<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.670> forefoot<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.600> things<00:01:44.840> I

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
in the heel and the forefoot so things I

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.289 
in the heel and the forefoot so things I
liked<00:01:45.200> about<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.560> shoe<00:01:45.970> definitely<00:01:46.970> softer

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
liked about the shoe definitely softer

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.210 
liked about the shoe definitely softer
than<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.510> condo<00:01:47.720> 20<00:01:48.140> added<00:01:48.560> gel<00:01:48.710> units<00:01:49.070> in<00:01:49.159> the

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
than the condo 20 added gel units in the

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.130 
than the condo 20 added gel units in the
heel<00:01:49.430> in<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.729> forefoot<00:01:50.090> made<00:01:50.690> this<00:01:50.810> an<00:01:50.930> even

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
heel in the forefoot made this an even

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.539 
heel in the forefoot made this an even
softer<00:01:51.290> ride<00:01:51.680> than<00:01:51.890> before<00:01:52.159> which<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:52.400> thought

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
softer ride than before which I thought

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.969 
softer ride than before which I thought
was<00:01:52.670> fantastic<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:54.140> wider<00:01:54.350> toe<00:01:54.619> blocks<00:01:54.860> I

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
was fantastic the wider toe blocks I

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.260 
was fantastic the wider toe blocks I
thought<00:01:55.159> was<00:01:55.280> a<00:01:55.310> lot<00:01:55.490> better<00:01:55.700> I<00:01:55.790> liked<00:01:56.060> some

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
thought was a lot better I liked some

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.969 
thought was a lot better I liked some
room<00:01:56.450> for<00:01:56.780> my<00:01:56.930> toes<00:01:57.140> display<00:01:57.590> a<00:01:57.619> little<00:01:57.770> bit

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
room for my toes display a little bit

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.430 
room for my toes display a little bit
with<00:01:58.130> each<00:01:58.159> stride<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.479> this<00:01:59.659> was<00:01:59.869> better<00:02:00.290> than

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
with each stride so this was better than

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.719 
with each stride so this was better than
the<00:02:00.530> counter<00:02:00.800> 20<00:02:01.070> in<00:02:01.159> that<00:02:01.310> regard<00:02:01.580> and

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
the counter 20 in that regard and

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.730 
the counter 20 in that regard and
likewise<00:02:02.570> I<00:02:02.810> felt<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:03.110> was<00:02:03.229> more<00:02:03.350> supportive

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
likewise I felt it was more supportive

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.590 
likewise I felt it was more supportive
in<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.040> arch<00:02:04.190> as<00:02:04.580> a<00:02:04.640> runner<00:02:04.909> with<00:02:05.119> low<00:02:05.299> arches

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
in the arch as a runner with low arches

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.450 
in the arch as a runner with low arches
the<00:02:06.229> more<00:02:06.380> arch<00:02:06.560> support<00:02:06.890> I<00:02:06.979> can<00:02:07.159> get<00:02:07.280> in<00:02:07.399> a

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
the more arch support I can get in a

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.650 
the more arch support I can get in a
stability<00:02:07.640> shoe<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.300> better

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
stability shoe the better

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.210 
stability shoe the better
what<00:02:09.050> I<00:02:09.080> would<00:02:09.229> like<00:02:09.350> to<00:02:09.500> see<00:02:09.649> improved<00:02:10.069> on

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
what I would like to see improved on

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.640 
what I would like to see improved on
this<00:02:10.310> shoe<00:02:10.520> would<00:02:10.700> be<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:10.940> overall<00:02:11.209> weights

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
this shoe would be the overall weights

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.410 
this shoe would be the overall weights
although<00:02:12.650> it<00:02:12.770> is<00:02:12.890> very<00:02:12.980> cushioned<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.790> stable

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
although it is very cushioned and stable

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.910 
although it is very cushioned and stable
it's<00:02:14.720> not<00:02:14.930> as<00:02:15.080> light<00:02:15.230> as<00:02:15.350> I<00:02:15.470> would<00:02:15.620> like<00:02:15.769> it<00:02:15.890> to

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
it's not as light as I would like it to

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.070 
it's not as light as I would like it to
be<00:02:16.040> some<00:02:16.940> things<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.209> like<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:17.450> see<00:02:17.600> improve<00:02:17.900> is

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
be some things I like to see improve is

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.509 
be some things I like to see improve is
the<00:02:18.200> weight<00:02:18.350> of<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.560> shoe<00:02:18.739> so<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.070> definitely

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
the weight of the shoe so I definitely

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.430 
the weight of the shoe so I definitely
agree<00:02:19.610> with<00:02:19.730> Kathy<00:02:20.000> on<00:02:20.239> that<00:02:20.360> front<00:02:20.570> though

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
agree with Kathy on that front though

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.440 
agree with Kathy on that front though
the<00:02:21.590> condo<00:02:21.890> 21<00:02:22.310> is<00:02:22.519> technically<00:02:23.000> lighter<00:02:23.239> than

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
the condo 21 is technically lighter than

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.180 
the condo 21 is technically lighter than
the<00:02:23.540> previous<00:02:23.900> model<00:02:24.290> I'd<00:02:24.560> like<00:02:24.739> to<00:02:24.860> see<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.100> be

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
the previous model I'd like to see it be

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.740 
the previous model I'd like to see it be
more<00:02:25.430> on<00:02:25.550> par<00:02:25.790> with<00:02:25.820> other<00:02:25.970> stability<00:02:26.570> shoes

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
more on par with other stability shoes

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.330 
more on par with other stability shoes

for a well cushioned ride it's hard to
