they're they're really lightweight it's

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.190 
they're they're really lightweight it's
just<00:02:02.670> awkward<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.299> why<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.450> can't<00:02:03.780> pick<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:03.990> up

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
just awkward is why I can't pick it up

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.920 
just awkward is why I can't pick it up
totally<00:02:04.950> with<00:02:05.100> one<00:02:05.280> hand<00:02:05.579> and

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.930 

the<00:02:08.680> other<00:02:08.830> side<00:02:09.190> also<00:02:09.610> has<00:02:10.650> a<00:02:11.730> little<00:02:12.730> peg

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
the other side also has a little peg

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.660 
the other side also has a little peg
holes<00:02:13.210> all<00:02:13.510> in<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:13.840> but<00:02:14.470> I'm<00:02:14.590> not<00:02:14.710> sure<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.550> don't

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
holes all in it but I'm not sure I don't

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.460 
holes all in it but I'm not sure I don't
think<00:02:15.940> that's<00:02:16.150> necessarily<00:02:16.810> for<00:02:17.110> catching

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
think that's necessarily for catching

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.080 
think that's necessarily for catching
