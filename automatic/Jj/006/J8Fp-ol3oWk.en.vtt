any comment you can make about how
people<00:01:51.770> might<00:01:51.920> work<00:01:52.790> that<00:01:53.030> technique<00:01:53.510> up<00:01:53.720> to

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
people might work that technique up to

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.200 
people might work that technique up to
where<00:01:54.200> they<00:01:54.320> could<00:01:54.500> get<00:01:55.490> it<00:01:55.610> to<00:01:55.700> play<00:01:55.910> that

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
where they could get it to play that

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.730 
where they could get it to play that
fast<00:01:56.479> a<00:01:57.700> lot<00:01:58.700> of<00:01:58.820> practice<00:01:59.180> a<00:01:59.450> lot<00:01:59.840> of<00:01:59.990> practice

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
fast a lot of practice a lot of practice

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.770 
fast a lot of practice a lot of practice
now<00:02:00.920> I'm<00:02:01.100> getting<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:01.850> put<00:02:02.420> that<00:02:02.600> thing

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
now I'm getting you to put that thing

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.390 
now I'm getting you to put that thing
where<00:02:03.680> you<00:02:03.770> could<00:02:03.920> play<00:02:04.040> up<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.340> speed<00:02:04.900> I

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
where you could play up the speed I

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.440 
where you could play up the speed I
noticed<00:02:07.400> when<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:07.580> started<00:02:07.880> using<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.240> cross

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
noticed when I started using the cross

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.800 
noticed when I started using the cross
picking<00:02:08.840> in<00:02:08.959> rhythm<00:02:09.380> I<00:02:10.360> saw<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:11.690> know

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
picking in rhythm I saw you know

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.449 
picking in rhythm I saw you know
eventually<00:02:12.080> over<00:02:12.470> time<00:02:12.680> that<00:02:12.920> it's<00:02:13.220> just

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
eventually over time that it's just

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.750 
eventually over time that it's just
something<00:02:14.300> that<00:02:14.330> comes<00:02:14.660> that<00:02:15.520> that<00:02:16.520> feels

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
something that comes that that feels

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.130 
something that comes that that feels
natural<00:02:17.110> right<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:19.510> now<00:02:20.510> you<00:02:20.570> showed<00:02:20.810> us<00:02:20.959> the

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
natural right so now you showed us the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.140 
natural right so now you showed us the
one<00:02:21.350> technique<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:22.220> we<00:02:22.760> went<00:02:22.910> over<00:02:22.970> in

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
one technique that we went over in

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.090 
one technique that we went over in
detail<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.690> there<00:02:23.810> any<00:02:23.930> other<00:02:24.200> maybe

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
detail is there any other maybe

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.979 
detail is there any other maybe
alternative<00:02:25.910> right<00:02:26.060> hand<00:02:26.360> things<00:02:26.630> you<00:02:26.840> do

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
alternative right hand things you do

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.360 
alternative right hand things you do
when<00:02:27.170> you're<00:02:27.320> fitting<00:02:27.500> that<00:02:27.709> cross<00:02:27.950> pick<00:02:28.220> and

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
when you're fitting that cross pick and

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.610 
when you're fitting that cross pick and
technique<00:02:28.700> into<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.120> rhythm<00:02:30.050> arrangement

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
technique into a rhythm arrangement

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.340 
technique into a rhythm arrangement
we're<00:02:33.620> like<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:34.070> song<00:02:34.310> we<00:02:34.340> just<00:02:34.760> did<00:02:35.350> dusty

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
we're like the song we just did dusty

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
what happens when you go into the décor

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.800 
what happens when you go into the décor
because<00:02:43.310> that's<00:02:43.489> mainly<00:02:44.150> in<00:02:44.209> this<00:02:44.360> song<00:02:44.570> word

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810

the cross picking has done it is through
this<00:02:49.010> section<00:02:49.310> here<00:02:49.670> is<00:02:49.730> like

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.449 

and<00:02:53.239> it's<00:02:53.390> just<00:02:53.599> as<00:02:53.870> simple<00:02:54.200> down<00:02:54.439> the<00:02:54.709> mainly

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459

you might not hear that part during the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.330 
you might not hear that part during the
song<00:03:08.300> when<00:03:08.540> it's<00:03:08.660> going<00:03:08.840> by<00:03:08.989> so<00:03:09.170> fast<00:03:09.200> but<00:03:09.830> slow

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
can you plate up the speed just for

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.000

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:22.969 
yeah like during the ACE section of the

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:36.120 
yeah like during the ACE section of the
song<00:03:23.180> was<00:03:23.420> like

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.200 

right<00:03:36.670> there<00:03:36.880> would<00:03:37.030> be<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.300> part

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.240

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
there's a lot one other thing I noticed

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.490 
there's a lot one other thing I noticed
it's<00:03:45.430> sort<00:03:45.880> of<00:03:45.940> off<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.270> cross<00:03:46.690> picking<00:03:47.080> topic

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
it's sort of off the cross picking topic

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.930 
it's sort of off the cross picking topic
but<00:03:47.680> at<00:03:47.800> the<00:03:47.860> beginning<00:03:48.190> of<00:03:48.310> that<00:03:48.370> song<00:03:48.700> where

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
but at the beginning of that song where

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.210 
but at the beginning of that song where
were<00:03:49.060> you<00:03:49.150> doing<00:03:49.420> a<00:03:49.510> big<00:03:49.720> down<00:03:50.050> strum<00:03:50.500> sort<00:03:51.160> of

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
were you doing a big down strum sort of

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.430 
were you doing a big down strum sort of
a<00:03:51.280> hesitation<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:52.360> then<00:03:52.480> almost<00:03:52.630> tickling

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
a hesitation and then almost tickling

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.800 
a hesitation and then almost tickling
the<00:03:53.560> strings<00:03:53.860> with<00:03:54.040> your<00:03:54.070> pick<00:03:54.460> and<00:03:54.810> then

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
the strings with your pick and then

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.480 
the strings with your pick and then
going<00:03:56.080> in<00:03:56.200> that<00:03:56.290> big<00:03:56.500> down<00:03:56.710> strum<00:03:57.040> again<00:03:57.160> can

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
going in that big down strum again can

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.830 
going in that big down strum again can
you<00:03:57.550> talk<00:03:57.730> about<00:03:57.760> that<00:03:58.000> for<00:03:58.360> a<00:03:58.390> second

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
you talk about that for a second

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.980 
you talk about that for a second
yeah<00:03:59.760> at<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.880> beginning<00:04:01.270> of<00:04:01.300> the<00:04:01.420> song<00:04:01.600> there

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
yeah at the beginning of the song there

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.820 
yeah at the beginning of the song there
it<00:04:02.110> has<00:04:02.290> some<00:04:02.530> stops<00:04:02.830> at<00:04:03.690> one<00:04:04.690> and<00:04:04.930> G<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.470> the

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
it has some stops at one and G and the

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.449 
it has some stops at one and G and the
other<00:04:06.010> one<00:04:06.190> I'm<00:04:06.310> using<00:04:06.490> the<00:04:06.730> alternate<00:04:07.180> chord

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
other one I'm using the alternate chord

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.770 
other one I'm using the alternate chord
I've<00:04:09.459> showed<00:04:09.730> you<00:04:09.850> before<00:04:09.970> they<00:04:10.330> have<00:04:10.480> for<00:04:10.720> the

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
I've showed you before they have for the

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.990 
I've showed you before they have for the
G<00:04:10.959> in<00:04:11.050> the<00:04:11.140> bass<00:04:11.290> what<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:11.620> call<00:04:11.830> it<00:04:11.980> so<00:04:12.220> it's

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
G in the bass what I call it so it's

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:30.840 
G in the bass what I call it so it's
like

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.120 

okay<00:04:31.510> well<00:04:31.990> I<00:04:32.050> wanted<00:04:32.290> people<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:32.680> see<00:04:32.950> that

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
okay well I wanted people to see that

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.660 
okay well I wanted people to see that
that<00:04:33.550> light<00:04:33.940> sort<00:04:34.510> of<00:04:34.800> very<00:04:35.800> light<00:04:36.010> strumming

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
that light sort of very light strumming

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.060 
that light sort of very light strumming
almost<00:04:37.510> tickling<00:04:37.990> of<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.230> strings<00:04:38.560> there<00:04:38.830> and

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
almost tickling of the strings there and

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.570 
almost tickling of the strings there and
that<00:04:39.580> that's<00:04:39.790> not<00:04:40.030> only<00:04:41.040> gives<00:04:42.040> a<00:04:42.130> little<00:04:42.280> fill

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
that that's not only gives a little fill

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.220 
that that's not only gives a little fill
but<00:04:42.760> also<00:04:42.880> add<00:04:43.120> some<00:04:43.270> dynamics<00:04:43.960> because

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
but also add some dynamics because

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.810 
but also add some dynamics because
you're<00:04:44.470> you're<00:04:44.770> doing<00:04:45.040> that<00:04:45.190> quite<00:04:45.550> a<00:04:45.580> bit

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
you're you're doing that quite a bit

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.580 
you're you're doing that quite a bit
lighter<00:04:46.090> and<00:04:46.420> then<00:04:46.600> come<00:04:46.840> in<00:04:46.990> with<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:47.170> heavier

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
lighter and then come in with a heavier

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.180 
lighter and then come in with a heavier
strum<00:04:48.010> right<00:04:48.700> I<00:04:49.600> try<00:04:50.500> to<00:04:50.560> slow<00:04:50.800> this<00:04:50.950> down<00:04:51.010> just

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
strum right I try to slow this down just

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.480 
strum right I try to slow this down just
a<00:04:51.520> little<00:04:51.550> bit<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:53.740> stop<00:04:53.980> part<00:04:54.190> you<00:04:54.370> know

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
a little bit the stop part you know

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:01.200 
a little bit the stop part you know
that's<00:04:54.700> just<00:04:54.760> one<00:04:55.090> full<00:04:55.390> brush<00:04:55.990> you<00:04:56.290> know<00:05:00.210> just

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
that's just one full brush you know just

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.550 
that's just one full brush you know just
really<00:05:01.390> lightly<00:05:01.690> something<00:05:02.200> like<00:05:02.320> that

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
really lightly something like that

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.790 
really lightly something like that
uh-huh

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.870 

and<00:05:06.800> it<00:05:06.920> looks<00:05:07.070> like<00:05:07.130> there's<00:05:07.400> no<00:05:07.520> definite

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
and it looks like there's no definite

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.550 
and it looks like there's no definite
pattern<00:05:08.420> to<00:05:08.630> that<00:05:08.780> little<00:05:08.960> strumming<00:05:09.410> it's

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
pattern to that little strumming it's

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.590 
pattern to that little strumming it's
just<00:05:09.740> sort<00:05:09.950> of<00:05:10.040> whatever<00:05:10.220> feel<00:05:11.210> you<00:05:11.420> got

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
just sort of whatever feel you got

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.510 
just sort of whatever feel you got
whatever<00:05:11.870> fits<00:05:12.230> in<00:05:12.440> there<00:05:12.590> just<00:05:12.800> up<00:05:13.250> and<00:05:13.400> down

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
whatever fits in there just up and down

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:20.920 
whatever fits in there just up and down
Bruce<00:05:13.850> you<00:05:14.180> know<00:05:14.300> how<00:05:17.290> support<00:05:18.290> there<00:05:18.470> okay
