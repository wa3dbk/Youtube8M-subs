00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.800 
respects but the team was very motivated
and<00:02:48.280> focused<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.910> concentrated<00:02:49.569> during<00:02:49.750> the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
and focused and concentrated during the

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.710 
and focused and concentrated during the
week<00:02:49.959> in<00:02:50.080> practice<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.739> you<00:02:51.640> know<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.790> think<00:02:52.060> we

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
week in practice and you know I think we

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.449 
week in practice and you know I think we
gained<00:02:52.930> some<00:02:53.140> confidence<00:02:53.290> in<00:02:53.769> some<00:02:53.950> momentum

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
gained some confidence in some momentum

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.120 
gained some confidence in some momentum
in<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.670> game<00:02:54.850> as<00:02:55.090> how<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.480> game<00:02:55.720> went<00:02:56.130> we've

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
in the game as how the game went we've

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.830 
in the game as how the game went we've
got<00:02:57.280> tremendous<00:02:57.459> respect<00:02:57.940> for<00:02:58.060> göttingen<00:02:58.630> and

got tremendous respect for göttingen and
personally<00:02:59.799> I've<00:02:59.920> got<00:03:00.099> the<00:03:00.190> respect<00:03:00.400> for<00:03:00.670> John

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
personally I've got the respect for John

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.330 
personally I've got the respect for John
and<00:03:01.360> what<00:03:02.230> these<00:03:02.410> guys<00:03:02.590> have<00:03:02.650> been<00:03:02.860> able<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.160> do

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
and what these guys have been able to do

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.229 
and what these guys have been able to do
as<00:03:03.610> a<00:03:03.670> team<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:05.709> I<00:03:05.950> I'd<00:03:06.640> like<00:03:06.819> the<00:03:07.000> way<00:03:07.090> they

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
as a team and I I'd like the way they

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.080 
as a team and I I'd like the way they
play<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.900> up-tempo<00:03:08.260> style<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:09.670> I<00:03:09.760> think<00:03:09.819> we

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
play the up-tempo style and I think we

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.110 
play the up-tempo style and I think we
were<00:03:10.180> prepared<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:11.739> handle<00:03:12.099> the<00:03:12.250> situations

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
were prepared to handle the situations

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.830 
were prepared to handle the situations
and<00:03:13.630> as<00:03:14.549> John<00:03:15.549> mentioned<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:16.090> key<00:03:16.390> in<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.660> game

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
and as John mentioned a key in the game

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.380 
and as John mentioned a key in the game
was<00:03:17.019> para<00:03:17.260> Gunther<00:03:17.910> controlling<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.060> tempo

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
was para Gunther controlling the tempo

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.259 
was para Gunther controlling the tempo
and<00:03:19.570> not<00:03:19.720> gettin<00:03:20.019> sped<00:03:20.320> up<00:03:20.500> from<00:03:20.859> the<00:03:20.950> pressure

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
and not gettin sped up from the pressure

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.300 
and not gettin sped up from the pressure
and<00:03:22.269> I<00:03:22.600> think<00:03:22.780> that<00:03:22.930> that<00:03:23.230> set<00:03:23.859> the<00:03:23.950> table<00:03:24.280> for

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
and I think that that set the table for

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.729 
and I think that that set the table for
the<00:03:24.609> rest<00:03:24.790> of<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:24.970> guys<00:03:25.120> in<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.570> first<00:03:26.560> half

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
the rest of the guys in the first half

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.699 
the rest of the guys in the first half
Coleman<00:03:27.220> was<00:03:27.340> fantastic<00:03:28.000> I<00:03:28.780> was<00:03:29.470> really

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
Coleman was fantastic I was really

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.800 
Coleman was fantastic I was really
pleased<00:03:30.040> because<00:03:30.220> he<00:03:30.609> has<00:03:30.730> not<00:03:30.910> really<00:03:31.269> found

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
pleased because he has not really found

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.270 
pleased because he has not really found
his<00:03:31.930> rhythm<00:03:32.079> and<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.410> season<00:03:32.739> up<00:03:32.890> until<00:03:33.160> this

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
his rhythm and the season up until this

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.539 
his rhythm and the season up until this
point<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:34.359> then<00:03:34.959> Robin<00:03:35.350> also<00:03:36.100> made<00:03:36.250> some<00:03:36.400> big

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
point and then Robin also made some big

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.059 
point and then Robin also made some big
plays<00:03:37.049> but<00:03:38.049> I<00:03:38.079> really<00:03:38.319> like<00:03:38.470> our<00:03:38.650> team<00:03:38.829> with

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
plays but I really like our team with

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.430 
plays but I really like our team with
the<00:03:39.280> John<00:03:39.549> down<00:03:39.850> inside<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:41.079> know<00:03:41.200> today

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
the John down inside and you know today

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.900 
the John down inside and you know today
I<00:03:41.470> think<00:03:41.739> rocky<00:03:41.950> made<00:03:42.190> a<00:03:42.220> big<00:03:42.400> difference<00:03:42.609> on

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
I think rocky made a big difference on

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.940 
I think rocky made a big difference on
the<00:03:43.030> perimeter<00:03:43.239> with<00:03:43.569> the<00:03:44.019> defense<00:03:44.440> in<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.680> 20

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
the perimeter with the defense in the 20

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.610 
the perimeter with the defense in the 20
20<00:03:45.340> 20<00:03:45.459> run<00:03:45.730> with<00:03:45.970> you<00:03:46.750> know<00:03:46.870> Travis<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.440> rocky

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
20 20 run with you know Travis and rocky

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.199 
20 20 run with you know Travis and rocky
together<00:03:48.040> I<00:03:48.280> think<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:48.730> was<00:03:48.850> that<00:03:49.030> was

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
together I think that was that was

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.039 
together I think that was that was
excellent<00:03:49.480> but<00:03:50.250> not<00:03:51.250> an<00:03:51.370> easy<00:03:51.489> game<00:03:52.049> gotten

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
excellent but not an easy game gotten

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.309 
excellent but not an easy game gotten
get<00:03:53.200> is<00:03:53.319> a<00:03:54.209> interesting<00:03:55.209> team<00:03:55.600> to<00:03:55.750> prepare<00:03:56.079> for

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
get is a interesting team to prepare for

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.610 
get is a interesting team to prepare for
because<00:03:56.680> of<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:57.209> style<00:03:58.209> of<00:03:58.329> play<00:03:58.600> and<00:03:58.900> it's<00:03:59.500> a

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
because of the style of play and it's a

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.069 
because of the style of play and it's a
fun<00:03:59.859> challenge<00:04:00.130> for<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.579> team<00:04:00.790> to<00:04:01.030> play<00:04:01.840> that

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
fun challenge for the team to play that

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.720 
fun challenge for the team to play that
way<00:04:02.200> because<00:04:02.410> it's<00:04:02.560> a<00:04:02.739> player's<00:04:02.980> game<00:04:03.220> no

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730
