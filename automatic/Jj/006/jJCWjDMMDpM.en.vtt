00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
use it's kind of like a mix of a

semi-auto rifle and El Diablo I say the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.459 
semi-auto rifle and El Diablo I say the
El<00:00:44.670> Diablo<00:00:45.149> because<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:46.110> scope<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.910> scope

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
El Diablo because the scope is the scope

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.560 
El Diablo because the scope is the scope
mechanic<00:00:49.469> acts<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.129> same<00:00:50.309> where<00:00:51.090> it's<00:00:51.390> not

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
mechanic acts the same where it's not

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.900 
mechanic acts the same where it's not
necessary<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.230> use<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.710> scope<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.730> can

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
necessary to use the scope but you can

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.010 
necessary to use the scope but you can
actually<00:00:54.090> hit<00:00:54.809> X<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:56.239> ready<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.449> scope<00:00:57.750> and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
actually hit X to ready the scope and

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.160 
actually hit X to ready the scope and
look<00:00:58.559> through<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.270> I<00:01:00.270> say<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.719> semi-auto

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
look through it and I say the semi-auto

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.369 
look through it and I say the semi-auto
because<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:02.129> kind<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.550> acts<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.539> except

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
because it kind of acts like it except

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.210 
because it kind of acts like it except
the<00:01:04.769> fire<00:01:05.369> rate<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.820> slightly<00:01:06.240> faster<00:01:07.220> except

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
the fire rate is slightly faster except

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.370

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
for free in game and it kind of gives

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.580 
for free in game and it kind of gives
you<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.090> slight<00:02:18.450> advantage<00:02:18.629> over<00:02:19.200> other

players and I really don't like the idea
of<00:02:22.019> that<00:02:22.340> I'm<00:02:23.340> sure<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:24.330> scope<00:02:24.660> really

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
of that I'm sure the scope really

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.890 
of that I'm sure the scope really
doesn't<00:02:26.930> add<00:02:27.930> much<00:02:28.709> value<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.849> weapon<00:02:30.209> not

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
doesn't add much value to the weapon not

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.380 
doesn't add much value to the weapon not
that's<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.319> bad<00:02:33.050> use<00:02:34.050> not<00:02:34.590> really<00:02:35.160> value<00:02:35.610> but<00:02:35.849> it

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
that's a bad use not really value but it

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.630 
that's a bad use not really value but it
doesn't<00:02:37.110> really<00:02:37.260> give<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.709> much<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.310> an

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
doesn't really give you much of an

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.900 
doesn't really give you much of an
advantage<00:02:38.760> i<00:02:39.269> guess<00:02:39.450> but<00:02:40.310> still<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.340> don't<00:02:41.610> like

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
advantage i guess but still I don't like

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.550 
advantage i guess but still I don't like
the<00:02:42.060> idea<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:44.360> get<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.540> use<00:02:45.810> something

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
the idea of you get to use something

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.580 
the idea of you get to use something
that<00:02:46.769> other<00:02:47.310> people<00:02:47.400> can't<00:02:48.360> use<00:02:48.660> because<00:02:49.170> they

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
that other people can't use because they

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.809 
that other people can't use because they
paid<00:02:49.890> real<00:02:50.700> real<00:02:51.599> money<00:02:51.870> for<00:02:52.380> but<00:02:53.190> um<00:02:53.430> that's

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
paid real real money for but um that's

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.479 
paid real real money for but um that's
