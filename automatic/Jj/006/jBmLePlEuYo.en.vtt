00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello my name is yannick and me 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.130
 call you out there again cordially 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.810
 Welcome to my youtube channel 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.590
 I'll show you today easily 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.400
 absolutely we can do that myself 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.070
 of course I have something again 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.940
 I have done some preliminary work 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.580
 peeled a total of 750 grams and me 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.390
 cut equal to none yet here 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:27.210
 Of course then only in the core 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.810
 Cut out very quickly and then 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:35.010
 outside, remove the bark 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:39.000
 simply turn off the peel of the apple 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:43.040
 I completely put the whole in the compost 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.559
 or in the women in front 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.600
 so is the peel at every apfelbeck 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.899
 and now cut all her something 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:57.079
 less and leave her husband Paul 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.079
 I do not know if we see something 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:06.360
 I would have been a little blinded, yes 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.520
 I think I can do it , I mean that 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:17.040
 very specifically twice the length through and 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:25.070
 three times in the broad the wheel times like that 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:30.119
 hold so here are two times half 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.409
 do you have such a small piece and 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.220
 We just do it with everyone 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.220
 april as well 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.340
 rdf i have now cut small and 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.830
 Now the whole thing comes into the pot, yes, we 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.660
 with the drops pretty big and 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.990
 adjust now over the middle one 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.420
 so a bit warmer the middle and 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.740
 accurately first the 750 small 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:09.060
 cut apples purely by nothing 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:13.650
 next to it comes to 50 grams 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.690
 sugar beautiful ford parties to come 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.570
 40 grams of water can be warm or cold 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.700
 it did not matter 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:25.770
 then comes half a lemon 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.459
 freshly squeezed and comes last 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.880
 another heaping teaspoon 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.880
 vanilla sugar 1 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.030
 then we do next then 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.700
 Cover it and the whole thing is on 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.260
 bring to the boil 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.030
 the whole already boiled up and 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.350
 Now let's turn it on half 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.060
 around now with me on duration of the v6 and 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.950
 now we are three minutes, and 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.630
 Let's see if it's good and 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.150
 At most, let that be five minutes now 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.820
 still simmer the whole thing is buttery soft 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.269
 cooked now and now I have one 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.269
 perfectly normal 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.020
 yes so the whole looks like just could you 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:20.520

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:23.790

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.920
 Let's get the whole deal around this 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.890
 bowl let the whole cool down 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.230
 the whole looks beautiful now 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.000
 very hot now 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.830

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.810
