I didn't enough time so that was just a

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.449 
I didn't enough time so that was just a
really<00:03:24.030> easy<00:03:24.360> level<00:03:24.870> they<00:03:25.500> get<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.890> lot<00:03:26.190> harder

trust me like I'm actually kind of stuck

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.880 
trust me like I'm actually kind of stuck
and<00:03:29.370> after<00:03:30.269> each<00:03:30.450> one<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:31.050> level<00:03:31.410> up<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.800> you

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
and after each one you level up and you

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.800 
and after each one you level up and you
get<00:03:32.070> items<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:33.709> there<00:03:34.709> is<00:03:34.950> dungeons<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:35.940> PvP

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
get items and there is dungeons and PvP

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.220 
get items and there is dungeons and PvP
right<00:03:37.769> there<00:03:38.070> go<00:03:39.000> ahead<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.420> try<00:03:39.600> it<00:03:39.720> out<00:03:39.930> I

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
right there go ahead and try it out I

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.210 
right there go ahead and try it out I
guess<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:41.550> doesn't<00:03:41.790> require<00:03:42.000> Wi-Fi<00:03:42.900> only<00:03:43.440> as

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
guess it doesn't require Wi-Fi only as

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.720 
guess it doesn't require Wi-Fi only as
long<00:03:44.580> as<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:44.820> have<00:03:45.000> your<00:03:45.030> network<00:03:45.800> so<00:03:46.800> we<00:03:47.190> can

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
long as you have your network so we can

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.660 
long as you have your network so we can
do<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.000> quick<00:03:48.330> match<00:03:48.600> or<00:03:49.470> we<00:03:49.709> find<00:03:49.980> an<00:03:50.160> opponent

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
do a quick match or we find an opponent

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.920 
do a quick match or we find an opponent
real<00:03:50.820> fast<00:03:51.350> so<00:03:52.350> right<00:03:52.500> here<00:03:52.530> these<00:03:52.980> sky<00:03:53.930> he's

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
real fast so right here these sky he's

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.900 
real fast so right here these sky he's
pretty<00:03:55.200> close<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.769> little<00:03:56.130> it's<00:03:56.400> gonna<00:03:56.670> be
