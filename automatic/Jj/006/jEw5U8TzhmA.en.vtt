00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
start at the top and go down alright so

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.670 
start at the top and go down alright so
first<00:00:23.910> start<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.269> grips<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.869> grips<00:00:25.470> are

looking back wheel uh you know it's

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.330 
looking back wheel uh you know it's
pretty<00:03:31.950> nice<00:03:32.329> same<00:03:33.329> as<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.569> front<00:03:33.840> wheel

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
pretty nice same as the front wheel

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.500

thing<00:03:35.340> about<00:03:35.549> these<00:03:35.730> wheels<00:03:36.030> though<00:03:36.239> they

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
thing about these wheels though they

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.390 
thing about these wheels though they
don't<00:03:36.600> spin<00:03:37.019> very<00:03:37.230> fast<00:03:37.319> but<00:03:37.739> they<00:03:38.280> have

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
don't spin very fast but they have

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.039 
don't spin very fast but they have
really<00:03:38.639> good<00:03:38.760> bearing<00:03:39.299> so<00:03:39.480> I<00:03:39.510> don't<00:03:39.810> think<00:03:39.959> it

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
really good bearing so I don't think it

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.559 
really good bearing so I don't think it
matters<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.799> doesn't<00:03:41.190> because<00:03:41.400> it's<00:03:41.579> lots

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
matters and it doesn't because it's lots

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.650 
matters and it doesn't because it's lots
