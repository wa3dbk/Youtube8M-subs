00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.629
 start our after the match 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.310
 press conference with the participation of the main 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.569
 team coach vigilant vyacheslav and 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.480
 evgeny chumak wasp 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.420
 team coach Dynamo Moscow Vyacheslav 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.920
 Timofeicha Arhipkin and then neglinka 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.470
 still sick therefore not 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.020
 attended the match and so according to tradition 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.130
 starting out of the guests vyacheslav and gay nothing 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.430
 in the comments comments there match him i 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.740
 really all this thanks guys 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.050
 they showed themselves character showed 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.780
 courage yes we have and they did not have enough 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.320
 players data playing in 12 field 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.000
 players 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:43.469
 well but against the dynamo of Moscow you 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.620
 in full force of course very hard 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.579
 hard in 12 players absolutely and therefore 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.770
 that nobody can 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:56.780
 therefore, with all of this, three rods and 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.129
 crossbar and with all hello hammer and 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.260
 the coffins unfolded it could be 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.980
 brilliantly brought the other side today 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.979
 fly to 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.670
 well done and we pulled out today left 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.040
 us in the game 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:14.159
 made the move the most important thing 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.799
 there is a character team to this character 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.680
 there are not enough performers who can 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:24.180
 which can complete 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.520
 yes this moment for today is too 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.100
 a short bench affects what 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.820
 We have no time staffing of 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.570
 the start of the season and win fishing on how 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.580
 never probably noticeable especially in 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.080
 games against 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:47.820
 Oh super advice something so thank you 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:50.070
 mecheslav tolerate but I want to tell the guys 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.940
 thank you very much was very good 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.790
 mood good desire even the first half 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.740
 I can probably say that 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.530
 excessive desire is probably not allowed 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.330
 play such a lot of snow and it 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.520
 I even had to reassure the guys a little 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.030
 that each so they ran a period 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.710
 even prepared the sector playing 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.990
 three people less we run forward 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.910
 score goals like that is problematic 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.680
 it was the opposite to calm them down and to be 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.480
 all means called with head and with 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:27.030
 rational attitude is great development 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:31.890
 attacks but I will really say so the second game 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.610
 for the second day it was important not to overload 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.730
 and at 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.360
 so much effort will spend exactly so much 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.280
 how much is needed to win in general not 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.730
 force and not overload the main thing 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.380
 now 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.920
 which is very trust 38 seems enough 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:03:00.720
 feel yourself 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:03:03.030
 questions in the first half pass 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.800
 exactly centered and you are forced or 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.630
 farrell 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.000
 shop on your players guy on it there 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.100
 were the cattle have you turned on it 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.620
 attention seen in this trend may 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.940
 be this or you have such a keen scheme 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.740
 the director is just a coincidence that I am just 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.390
 I want to repeat they put before 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.800
 just score in the first few minutes less 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.130
 degrees thought about defense i wanted 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.330
 I understand the guys and the desire was great and 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.380
 maybe it's just a cold head 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:36.350
 what was called should have started 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:39.260
 so it was necessary and the middle of the first 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:43.040
 halftime talking pillow cases and when 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.460
 had a break, too, had to wear a hood 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.460
 called 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:56.510
 Today marked the network it was much 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:04:02.240
 it seemed tougher any than yesterday with what 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:03.290
 this is due may explain harder than 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.550
 than tougher 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.530
 that is, and rougher and scuffles would be me 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.730
 I know before the match they tried to set it up like this 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.150
 guys what will pull you 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.760
 getting closer to the new year final that's closer 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.500
 so every game will be tougher and 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.990
 tougher 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:27.650
 rather yesterday's game surprised not so 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.110
 today's autograph that is 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:35.169
 Krasnogorsk we will see living lives 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:40.150
 stone 10 where goes ok will come 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:44.199
 at 98 you got a team today 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.860
 punishment for later doctor 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:51.610
 no one from there compressor plant 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.830
 punishment here we all came out with love 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:05:02.729
 let's all all the other ratings let's 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:02.729
 there is not now almost passive classic
