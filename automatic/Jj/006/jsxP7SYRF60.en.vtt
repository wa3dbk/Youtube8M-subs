Dunlop's scientific tests he did it in
his<00:00:18.800> backyard<00:00:19.010> but<00:00:19.460> I've<00:00:19.790> come<00:00:20.330> here<00:00:20.510> because

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
his backyard but I've come here because

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.840 
his backyard but I've come here because
I've<00:00:20.990> got<00:00:21.350> a<00:00:21.380> slope<00:00:21.830> here<00:00:22.130> i'm<00:00:22.430> going<00:00:22.610> to<00:00:22.700> hold

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
I've got a slope here i'm going to hold

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.670 
I've got a slope here i'm going to hold
each<00:00:22.970> wheel<00:00:23.360> in<00:00:23.510> turn<00:00:23.720> up<00:00:23.930> at<00:00:24.140> the<00:00:24.230> top<00:00:24.410> of<00:00:24.440> this

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
each wheel in turn up at the top of this

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.950 
each wheel in turn up at the top of this
slope<00:00:24.950> so<00:00:25.430> then<00:00:25.670> they<00:00:25.790> both<00:00:26.240> have<00:00:26.480> exactly<00:00:26.870> the

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
slope so then they both have exactly the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.930 
slope so then they both have exactly the
same<00:00:27.020> so<00:00:27.410> to<00:00:27.470> run<00:00:27.830> down<00:00:28.070> and<00:00:28.370> then<00:00:28.790> they're

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
same so to run down and then they're

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.550 
same so to run down and then they're
going<00:00:29.090> to<00:00:29.210> run<00:00:29.390> into<00:00:29.540> these<00:00:29.720> obstacles<00:00:30.140> at<00:00:30.470> the

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
of these wheels will run better okay

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.979 
of these wheels will run better okay
first<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:47.269> solid<00:00:47.749> rubber<00:00:48.019> one<00:00:49.480> way<00:00:50.480> hold<00:00:50.899> it

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
first the solid rubber one way hold it

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.750 
first the solid rubber one way hold it
up<00:00:51.079> to<00:00:51.170> the<00:00:51.230> top<00:00:51.440> right<00:00:52.100> at<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:52.399> top<00:00:52.550> of<00:00:52.609> the

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
up to the top right at the top of the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.520 
up to the top right at the top of the
slope<00:00:52.940> I'm<00:00:53.149> just<00:00:53.479> holding<00:00:53.780> it<00:00:53.989> and<00:00:54.109> letting<00:00:54.260> go

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
slope I'm just holding it and letting go

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.639 
slope I'm just holding it and letting go
one<00:00:55.100> two<00:00:55.309> three<00:00:55.670> go<00:00:57.699> it<00:00:58.699> just<00:00:59.420> made<00:00:59.870> it<00:01:00.079> it

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
one two three go it just made it it

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.619 
one two three go it just made it it
obviously<00:01:00.769> came<00:01:01.280> quite<00:01:01.819> a<00:01:01.850> cropper<00:01:02.389> on<00:01:02.510> the

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
obviously came quite a cropper on the

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.200 
obviously came quite a cropper on the
first<00:01:02.899> one<00:01:03.170> it<00:01:03.499> just<00:01:04.040> crawled<00:01:04.430> over<00:01:04.580> all<00:01:04.879> three

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
first one it just crawled over all three

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.420 
first one it just crawled over all three
and<00:01:05.420> it's<00:01:05.690> what<00:01:05.900> about<00:01:06.200> a<00:01:06.439> foot<00:01:06.979> beyond<00:01:07.280> the

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
and it's what about a foot beyond the

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.190 
and it's what about a foot beyond the
third<00:01:07.640> one<00:01:07.850> now<00:01:08.649> let's<00:01:09.649> see<00:01:09.860> what<00:01:10.009> this<00:01:10.130> new

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
third one now let's see what this new

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.260 
third one now let's see what this new
pneumatic<00:01:12.200> tire<00:01:12.439> can<00:01:12.740> do<00:01:12.969> exactly<00:01:13.969> the<00:01:14.240> same

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
pneumatic tire can do exactly the same

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.969 
pneumatic tire can do exactly the same
conditions<00:01:14.869> I'm<00:01:15.049> just<00:01:15.200> holding<00:01:15.439> it<00:01:15.649> right<00:01:15.829> at

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
conditions I'm just holding it right at

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.709 
conditions I'm just holding it right at
the<00:01:16.009> top<00:01:16.159> of<00:01:16.219> the<00:01:16.399> slope<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:16.880> I'm<00:01:17.390> just<00:01:17.630> going

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:17.719 
the top of the slope and I'm just going

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:19.779 
the top of the slope and I'm just going
to<00:01:17.810> let<00:01:17.930> it<00:01:17.960> go<00:01:18.399> trying<00:01:19.399> to<00:01:19.490> let<00:01:19.610> it<00:01:19.729> go

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
to let it go trying to let it go

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.340 
to let it go trying to let it go
straight<00:01:20.090> down<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.390> middle<00:01:20.420> one<00:01:21.079> two<00:01:21.320> three

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
straight down the middle one two three

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.450 
straight down the middle one two three
go<00:01:22.630> yeah<00:01:23.630> look<00:01:23.930> at<00:01:24.020> that<00:01:24.049> straight<00:01:24.560> over<00:01:24.950> no

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
go yeah look at that straight over no

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.980 
go yeah look at that straight over no
problems<00:01:25.969> at<00:01:26.119> all<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.450> it's<00:01:26.570> still<00:01:26.780> going

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
problems at all and it's still going

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.130 
problems at all and it's still going
right<00:01:27.409> up<00:01:27.439> this<00:01:27.740> mountain<00:01:28.030> terrific

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
right up this mountain terrific

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.999 
right up this mountain terrific
obviously<00:01:30.140> it's<00:01:30.229> going<00:01:30.350> to<00:01:30.409> be<00:01:30.500> much<00:01:30.770> better

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
obviously it's going to be much better

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.399 
obviously it's going to be much better
on<00:01:31.250> really<00:01:31.670> rough<00:01:31.850> ground<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:33.020> reason

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
on really rough ground and the reason

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.060 
on really rough ground and the reason
for<00:01:33.439> that<00:01:33.560> is<00:01:34.159> that<00:01:34.219> this<00:01:34.609> pneumatic<00:01:35.180> tire

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
for that is that this pneumatic tire

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.679 
for that is that this pneumatic tire
reduces<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.250> unsprung<00:01:38.030> weight<00:01:38.180> of<00:01:38.600> the

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
reduces the unsprung weight of the

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.310 
reduces the unsprung weight of the
bicycle<00:01:39.070> almost<00:01:40.070> 20<00:01:40.780> let<00:01:41.780> me<00:01:41.869> show<00:01:42.049> you<00:01:42.140> what<00:01:42.289> I

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
bicycle almost 20 let me show you what I

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.469 
bicycle almost 20 let me show you what I
mean<00:01:42.409> look<00:01:42.890> when<00:01:43.280> this<00:01:43.399> solid<00:01:44.030> tag<00:01:44.270> comes

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
mean look when this solid tag comes

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.899 
mean look when this solid tag comes
along<00:01:44.750> and<00:01:44.899> hits<00:01:45.289> an<00:01:45.530> obstacle<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:46.280> there's<00:01:46.759> no

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
along and hits an obstacle it there's no

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.669 
along and hits an obstacle it there's no
given<00:01:47.299> that<00:01:47.450> in<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.689> tower<00:01:47.899> door<00:01:48.079> so<00:01:48.320> it's<00:01:48.439> got

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
given that in the tower door so it's got

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.169

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
to go into the air and that means all

to go into the air and that means all
the<00:01:50.210> energy<00:01:50.719> in<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.869> bicycle<00:01:51.229> is<00:01:51.259> wasted

the energy in the bicycle is wasted

this comes along look it squishes and

this comes along look it squishes and
