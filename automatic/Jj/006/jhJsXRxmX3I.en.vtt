00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:17.889
 whiter whiter taller 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.889
 with more weight with less weight too 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.150
 thank you very well 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.670
 for visual disability is only 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.179
 a physical characteristic 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.179
 do not 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.680
 I have a team 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.680
 she 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.980
 accompanies me takes care of me 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.980
 my guide 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.990
 Y 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.820
 in a restaurant they told me not to 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:06.450
 could enter with pets 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.130
 and then what do you do you take your eyes off 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.860
 and you leave them outside to be able to enter 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.390
 a cane is the extension of your hand 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.390
 a dog is your eyes 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:27.189
 the dogs are no longer a pet 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:27.189
 the dogs already give the piece for their mom 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.770
 I'm a professional announcer studying dubbing 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.149
 I am currently doing analysis 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.920
 of quality and I also have another job 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.520
 which is to give development conferences 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.520
 personal 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.870
 when they gave me to iva they told me that 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.060
 It was going to be like a shoe 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.060
 let me tell myself little by little 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.390
 but you're going to have a soul mate 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.390
 they said 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:18.140
 so you can see what you would ask for would be 30 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:22.060
 seconds to see there 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.060
 the dog already looking me in the eyes
