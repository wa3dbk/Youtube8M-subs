lacquer type material over the top of it
so<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:00.989> turned<00:01:01.350> out<00:01:01.469> real<00:01:01.710> nice<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.660> took<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
so that turned out real nice I took the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.130 
so that turned out real nice I took the
entire<00:01:04.080> control<00:01:04.680> panel<00:01:05.070> apart<00:01:05.840> as<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.990> can

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
entire control panel apart as you can

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.980 
entire control panel apart as you can
see<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:07.470> not<00:01:07.590> bolted<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.100> here<00:01:08.340> anymore<00:01:08.990> it

see it's not bolted on here anymore it

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.800 
see it's not bolted on here anymore it
is<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.640> obviously<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.760> dedicated<00:01:12.420> Neo<00:01:12.720> Geo

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
is a obviously the dedicated Neo Geo

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.310 
is a obviously the dedicated Neo Geo
system<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:13.979> was<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.549> here<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.140> think<00:01:16.140> from

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
system one that was on here I think from

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
system one that was on here I think from
the<00:01:16.470> factory<00:01:17.270> this<00:01:18.270> panel<00:01:18.600> came<00:01:19.080> with<00:01:19.380> one<00:01:20.070> two

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
the factory this panel came with one two

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.580 
the factory this panel came with one two
three<00:01:20.729> four<00:01:21.259> 1234<00:01:22.369> a<00:01:23.369> joystick<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.350> and

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
three four 1234 a joystick this this and

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.050 
three four 1234 a joystick this this and
whatever<00:01:25.710> these<00:01:25.950> square<00:01:26.310> things<00:01:26.610> are<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.880> think

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
whatever these square things are I think

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.899 
whatever these square things are I think
whoever<00:01:27.689> i<00:01:27.990> bought<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.500> game<00:01:28.740> from<00:01:28.950> drilled

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
whoever i bought this game from drilled

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.429 
whoever i bought this game from drilled

these three buttons here and these three

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
buttons here and turned it into

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.149 
buttons here and turned it into
obviously<00:01:34.229> like<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> street<00:01:34.710> fighter<00:01:34.920> type

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
obviously like a street fighter type

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.539 
obviously like a street fighter type
thing<00:01:35.340> which<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.640> cool<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:37.280> what<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.310> did<00:01:38.400> is

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
thing which is cool so what I did is

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.580 
thing which is cool so what I did is
took<00:01:38.880> off<00:01:39.060> at<00:01:39.270> wood<00:01:39.540> green<00:01:39.780> stuff<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.439> was<00:01:40.560> on

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
took off at wood green stuff that was on

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.249 
took off at wood green stuff that was on
the<00:01:40.770> mk2<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.579> guys<00:01:41.729> saw<00:01:42.049> and<00:01:43.049> I'm<00:01:43.140> going

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
the mk2 that you guys saw and I'm going

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.810 
the mk2 that you guys saw and I'm going
to<00:01:43.290> turn<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.649> back<00:01:43.890> into<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> street<00:01:44.579> fighter

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
to turn this back into a street fighter

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.569 
to turn this back into a street fighter
because<00:01:45.149> obviously<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.570> can't<00:01:45.780> do<00:01:45.960> neo<00:01:46.170> geo

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
because obviously you can't do neo geo

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.499 
because obviously you can't do neo geo
because<00:01:47.579> these<00:01:47.700> buttons<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.090> been<00:01:48.149> drilled

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
because these buttons have been drilled

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.780 
because these buttons have been drilled
out<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.290> don't<00:01:49.500> really<00:01:49.799> play<00:01:50.130> Neo<00:01:50.310> Geo<00:01:50.399> game

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
out and I don't really play Neo Geo game

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.770 
out and I don't really play Neo Geo game
so<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:52.200> know<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.619> each<00:01:52.770> his<00:01:52.799> own<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:54.630> I'm

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
so you know to each his own so I'm

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.789 
so you know to each his own so I'm
thinking<00:01:54.840> what<00:01:55.229> I'm<00:01:55.290> going<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.439> do<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.619> order

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
thinking what I'm going to do is order

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.410 
thinking what I'm going to do is order
that<00:01:56.009> one<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.399> kind<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.700> comes<00:01:56.909> down<00:01:57.030> it's

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
that one that kind of comes down it's

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.300 
that one that kind of comes down it's
got<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:58.409> material<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.219> a

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
got like this material on like a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.999 
got like this material on like a
concrete<00:01:59.820> type<00:02:00.030> material<00:02:00.540> or<00:02:01.259> image<00:02:01.770> rather

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
concrete type material or image rather

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.550 
concrete type material or image rather
and<00:02:02.340> then<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.180> wraps<00:02:03.479> around<00:02:03.689> down<00:02:04.140> here<00:02:04.170> and

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
and then it wraps around down here and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.289 
and then it wraps around down here and
it<00:02:04.619> says<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:04.950> Street<00:02:05.250> Fighter<00:02:05.280> 2<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.240> a

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
it says like Street Fighter 2 like in a

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.619 
it says like Street Fighter 2 like in a
purple<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.810> yellow<00:02:07.879> it's<00:02:08.879> pretty<00:02:09.149> common<00:02:09.390> one

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
purple and yellow it's pretty common one

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.089 
purple and yellow it's pretty common one
for<00:02:09.780> like<00:02:09.840> those<00:02:10.080> dynamo<00:02:10.500> cabinets<00:02:10.950> which

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
for like those dynamo cabinets which

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.440 
for like those dynamo cabinets which
this<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.430> fairly<00:02:12.030> similar<00:02:12.510> to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
this is fairly similar to

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.970 
this is fairly similar to
another<00:02:13.989> thing<00:02:14.140> I<00:02:14.230> did<00:02:14.379> is<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.560> took<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.770> entire

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
another thing I did is I took the entire

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.540 
another thing I did is I took the entire
coin<00:02:15.550> door<00:02:15.790> out<00:02:17.069> took<00:02:18.069> all<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.370> mechanisms

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
coin door out took all the mechanisms

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.930 
coin door out took all the mechanisms
out<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.269> it<00:02:19.360> completely<00:02:20.290> sanded<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.250> down<00:02:21.310> and

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
out of it completely sanded it down and

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.210 
out of it completely sanded it down and
spray<00:02:22.480> painted<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.080> as<00:02:23.290> well<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.860> then<00:02:23.950> put

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
spray painted that as well and then put

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.670 
spray painted that as well and then put
like<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.400> lack<00:02:24.700> of<00:02:24.730> code<00:02:25.090> as<00:02:25.269> well<00:02:25.450> on<00:02:25.750> that<00:02:26.019> so

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
like a lack of code as well on that so

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.350 
like a lack of code as well on that so
it<00:02:26.739> turned<00:02:26.920> out<00:02:27.010> real<00:02:27.220> nice<00:02:27.400> unfortunately

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360

apart pretty easily as a prehensile

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.710 
apart pretty easily as a prehensile
cabinet<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.849> way<00:03:15.940> it<00:03:16.060> came<00:03:16.209> together<00:03:16.360> and

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
cabinet the way it came together and

when<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:16.989> comes<00:03:17.110> apart<00:03:17.290> it's<00:03:18.040> well

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
when it comes apart it's well

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.309 
when it comes apart it's well
constructed<00:03:18.459> I<00:03:18.910> have<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.120> say<00:03:19.299> that<00:03:19.329> I<00:03:19.720> don't

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
constructed I have to say that I don't

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.020 
constructed I have to say that I don't
know<00:03:20.410> if<00:03:20.500> this<00:03:20.620> date<00:03:20.889> signifies<00:03:21.519> one<00:03:21.760> this<00:03:21.910> was

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
know if this date signifies one this was

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.039 
know if this date signifies one this was
made<00:03:22.239> but<00:03:22.389> it<00:03:22.510> says<00:03:22.630> 113<00:03:23.290> 1993<00:03:24.280> so<00:03:24.519> hopefully

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
made but it says 113 1993 so hopefully

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.990 
made but it says 113 1993 so hopefully
that's<00:03:26.049> a<00:03:26.170> build<00:03:26.440> date<00:03:26.650> of<00:03:26.799> it<00:03:26.920> also<00:03:27.790> another

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
that's a build date of it also another

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.879 
that's a build date of it also another
thing<00:03:28.120> I<00:03:28.299> did<00:03:28.450> is<00:03:28.600> where<00:03:29.200> I<00:03:29.230> got<00:03:29.440> this<00:03:29.650> there

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
thing I did is where I got this there

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.270 
thing I did is where I got this there
was<00:03:30.010> no<00:03:30.190> way<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.370> get<00:03:30.910> into<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.269> test<00:03:31.630> menu<00:03:32.280> or

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
was no way to get into the test menu or

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.699 
was no way to get into the test menu or

way to adjust the volume for example he

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.340 
way to adjust the volume for example he
put<00:03:38.859> like<00:03:39.010> a<00:03:39.040> mortal<00:03:39.370> kombat<00:03:39.730> borden<00:03:40.150> here<00:03:40.420> mk2

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
put like a mortal kombat borden here mk2

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.300 
put like a mortal kombat borden here mk2
mk3<00:03:41.680> mk4<00:03:43.470> there's<00:03:44.470> no<00:03:44.680> way<00:03:44.829> to<00:03:44.889> change<00:03:45.160> the

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
mk3 mk4 there's no way to change the

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.770 
mk3 mk4 there's no way to change the
volume<00:03:45.549> because<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:46.180> can't<00:03:46.359> get<00:03:46.510> into<00:03:46.690> the

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
volume because you can't get into the

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.770 
volume because you can't get into the
test<00:03:47.019> menu<00:03:47.319> so<00:03:47.530> i<00:03:48.150> had<00:03:49.150> this<00:03:49.329> sitting<00:03:49.569> around

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
test menu so i had this sitting around

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.360 
test menu so i had this sitting around
underwear<00:03:50.170> i<00:03:50.230> got<00:03:50.410> it<00:03:50.530> i<00:03:50.560> got<00:03:50.590> on<00:03:50.799> like<00:03:50.950> that<00:03:51.100> k

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
underwear i got it i got on like that k

underwear i got it i got on like that k
lov<00:03:51.760> website<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:52.980> actually<00:03:53.980> ran<00:03:54.190> wires<00:03:54.549> that

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
lov website and actually ran wires that

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.300 
lov website and actually ran wires that
were<00:03:55.239> not<00:03:55.600> there<00:03:55.870> into<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.530> Jama<00:03:56.799> connector

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
were not there into the Jama connector

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.699 
were not there into the Jama connector
and<00:03:57.519> wired<00:03:58.420> them<00:03:58.630> up<00:03:58.750> here<00:03:58.989> so<00:03:59.170> now<00:03:59.319> i<00:03:59.349> can<00:03:59.410> get

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
and wired them up here so now i can get

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.370 
and wired them up here so now i can get
into<00:03:59.920> the<00:04:00.040> test<00:04:00.310> menu<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:01.750> adjust<00:04:02.109> you<00:04:02.319> know

game adjustments and add credits I don't

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.819 
game adjustments and add credits I don't
know<00:04:04.660> what<00:04:04.840> to<00:04:04.930> do<00:04:05.049> with<00:04:05.170> these<00:04:05.349> three<00:04:05.590> wires

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
know what to do with these three wires

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.430

here<00:04:06.420> there's<00:04:07.420> two<00:04:07.569> yellow<00:04:07.780> ones<00:04:08.019> in<00:04:08.170> a<00:04:08.230> white

here there's two yellow ones in a white
one<00:04:08.620> I'm<00:04:08.739> guessing<00:04:09.069> one<00:04:09.220> as<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.430> power<00:04:09.639> and

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
one I'm guessing one as the power and

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.729 
one I'm guessing one as the power and
the<00:04:10.090> other<00:04:10.239> two<00:04:10.450> maybe<00:04:10.750> or<00:04:10.989> up<00:04:11.169> and<00:04:11.290> down<00:04:11.410> for

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
the other two maybe or up and down for

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.170 
the other two maybe or up and down for
the<00:04:11.799> volume<00:04:12.190> it's<00:04:12.849> a<00:04:13.120> very<00:04:13.870> similar<00:04:14.849> you<00:04:15.849> know

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
the volume it's a very similar you know

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.240 
the volume it's a very similar you know
a<00:04:16.269> little<00:04:16.419> little<00:04:16.780> test<00:04:17.109> credit<00:04:17.769> volume

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
a little little test credit volume

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.099 
a little little test credit volume
switch<00:04:18.459> that's<00:04:18.910> in<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.209> mortal<00:04:19.450> kombat<00:04:19.840> ones

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.960 
but that's really all I've done right
now<00:04:42.080> I'm<00:04:42.400> contemplating<00:04:43.400> what<00:04:43.550> I<00:04:43.610> should<00:04:43.820> do

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
now I'm contemplating what I should do

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.150 
now I'm contemplating what I should do
with<00:04:44.000> this<00:04:44.180> cabinet<00:04:44.660> I've<00:04:45.530> always<00:04:45.710> wanted<00:04:45.800> a

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
with this cabinet I've always wanted a

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.880 
with this cabinet I've always wanted a
dedicated<00:04:46.580> street<00:04:47.480> fighter<00:04:47.690> 2<00:04:47.930> cabinet<00:04:48.440> but

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
dedicated street fighter 2 cabinet but

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.050 
dedicated street fighter 2 cabinet but
they<00:04:48.980> come<00:04:49.160> in<00:04:49.310> those<00:04:49.490> I<00:04:49.520> think<00:04:49.940> they're

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
they come in those I think they're

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.460 
they come in those I think they're
called<00:04:50.360> Q<00:04:51.260> sound<00:04:51.620> it's<00:04:52.310> a<00:04:52.370> big<00:04:52.610> blue<00:04:53.470> for

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
called Q sound it's a big blue for

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
called Q sound it's a big blue for
street<00:04:54.680> fighter<00:04:54.800> 2<00:04:55.040> that's<00:04:55.220> the<00:04:55.310> way<00:04:55.400> it

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
street fighter 2 that's the way it

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.920 
street fighter 2 that's the way it
actually<00:04:55.640> came<00:04:56.000> out<00:04:56.150> when<00:04:56.300> it<00:04:56.330> first<00:04:56.630> came<00:04:56.780> out

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
actually came out when it first came out

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.360 
actually came out when it first came out
from<00:04:57.140> Capcom<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:57.830> then<00:04:57.920> they<00:04:58.010> did<00:04:58.220> these

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
from Capcom and then they did these

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.240 
from Capcom and then they did these
dynamo<00:04:58.910> you<00:04:59.900> know<00:04:59.990> add<00:05:00.260> a<00:05:00.290> kid<00:05:00.680> or<00:05:00.920> you<00:05:01.160> know

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
dynamo you know add a kid or you know

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.710 
dynamo you know add a kid or you know
like<00:05:01.430> kits<00:05:01.790> where<00:05:02.060> you<00:05:02.150> just<00:05:02.270> drop<00:05:02.480> them<00:05:02.600> in

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
like kits where you just drop them in

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.230 
like kits where you just drop them in
the<00:05:02.840> Dynamo<00:05:03.200> cabinet<00:05:03.620> so<00:05:03.830> I<00:05:04.310> just<00:05:04.820> don't<00:05:04.940> I

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
the Dynamo cabinet so I just don't I

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.910 
the Dynamo cabinet so I just don't I
don't<00:05:05.480> really<00:05:05.840> want<00:05:06.020> a<00:05:06.080> full-size<00:05:06.290> cabinet

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
don't really want a full-size cabinet

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.020 
don't really want a full-size cabinet
for<00:05:07.040> that<00:05:07.130> I<00:05:07.160> think<00:05:07.460> this<00:05:07.580> little<00:05:07.670> won't<00:05:07.940> be

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
for that I think this little won't be

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.060 
for that I think this little won't be
pretty<00:05:08.180> cool<00:05:08.420> since<00:05:08.480> the<00:05:09.350> control<00:05:09.710> panel<00:05:09.980> has

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
pretty cool since the control panel has

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.320 
pretty cool since the control panel has
already<00:05:10.160> drilled<00:05:10.460> out<00:05:10.670> and<00:05:10.910> I<00:05:10.940> can<00:05:11.120> get<00:05:11.210> the

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
already drilled out and I can get the

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.600 
already drilled out and I can get the
graphics<00:05:11.750> fairly<00:05:12.110> easily<00:05:12.260> and<00:05:12.410> I<00:05:12.590> have<00:05:12.770> three

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
graphics fairly easily and I have three

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.750 
graphics fairly easily and I have three
or<00:05:13.820> four<00:05:14.800> champion<00:05:15.800> edition<00:05:16.010> boards<00:05:16.550> in<00:05:16.700> a

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:32.390 
different characters around there and I

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.580 
different characters around there and I
think<00:06:32.570> it<00:06:32.660> has<00:06:32.750> some<00:06:32.960> moves<00:06:33.170> or<00:06:33.380> something

think it has some moves or something

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.290 
think it has some moves or something
like<00:06:33.680> that<00:06:33.740> but<00:06:34.040> that'd<00:06:34.160> be<00:06:34.250> pretty<00:06:34.370> cool<00:06:34.490> the

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300
