I<00:01:47.820> think<00:01:48.720> pretty<00:01:49.080> big<00:01:49.259> it's<00:01:49.439> pretty<00:01:49.710> thick

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
I think pretty big it's pretty thick

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.440 
I think pretty big it's pretty thick
pretty<00:01:51.030> dense

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
pretty dense

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.620 
pretty dense
um<00:01:52.520> I'm<00:01:53.520> not<00:01:53.580> checked<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.390> careful<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.350> it

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
um I'm not checked to be careful to it

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.770 
um I'm not checked to be careful to it
but<00:01:57.630> all<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.080> thing<00:01:58.259> needs<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:59.630> good<00:02:00.630> if

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
but all this thing needs is good if

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.620 
but all this thing needs is good if
they'll<00:02:01.140> take<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.470> out<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.680> put<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.159> on

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
they'll take that out and put it on

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.210 
they'll take that out and put it on
somewhere<00:02:03.630> if<00:02:03.840> it'll<00:02:04.020> fit<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.619> don't<00:02:04.710> know<00:02:04.950> but

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
somewhere if it'll fit I don't know but

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.080 
somewhere if it'll fit I don't know but
um<00:02:06.740> maybe<00:02:07.740> put<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.100> on<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.280> pressure<00:02:08.819> washer

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
um maybe put it on the pressure washer

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.979 
um maybe put it on the pressure washer
does<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.869> means<00:02:10.080> anywhere<00:02:10.380> filter<00:02:11.900> as<00:02:12.900> a

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
does that means anywhere filter as a

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.740 
does that means anywhere filter as a
fuel<00:02:13.350> shutoff<00:02:13.590> valve

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
fuel shutoff valve

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.509 
fuel shutoff valve
it's<00:02:15.750> off<00:02:16.260> no<00:02:16.440> no<00:02:16.920> it's<00:02:17.100> awful

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
it's off no no it's awful

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.650 
it's off no no it's awful
um<00:02:18.420> I'll<00:02:19.200> turn<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.500> on<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:20.060> do<00:02:21.060> salute<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.480> guys

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
um I'll turn it on to do salute you guys

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.490 
um I'll turn it on to do salute you guys
over<00:02:21.989> there<00:02:22.110> clean<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.680> up

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.340 

so<00:02:29.010> that's<00:02:29.880> actually<00:02:30.210> pros<00:02:30.720> really<00:02:31.110> slow

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
so that's actually pros really slow

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.730 
so that's actually pros really slow
though<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.910> clutch<00:02:34.850> play<00:02:35.850> control<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:37.530> you

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
though and clutch play control so you

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.350 
though and clutch play control so you
hold<00:02:37.950> this<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.310> starting<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.850> pull<00:02:39.000> both<00:02:39.150> of

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
hold this to starting to pull both of

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.410 
hold this to starting to pull both of
them<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.570> believe<00:02:40.430> so

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:03:44.149 

I'll<00:02:45.420> start<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.810> up

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.220
