00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.459
 next in the little pouch 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.739

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.050

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.579
 iphone 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.700
 why they gave the load 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.830

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:49.470
 so after if I charge them 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.000
 internally and a pharmaprix charger 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.370
 lightning that does a little more 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:02.340
 of inhabitants to put on both sides and 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:06.750
 so it's a version of oisans dac 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.420
 with the small goatee office and the 3g 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.399

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.359

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:40.529

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:43.799
 who always ski better than taking 

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:45.959
 finally the smart cover they offer 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.490
 because she holds that slab so if 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:51.420

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.010
 what was happening 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.010
 m 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.720

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.130
 after yes in terms of the use of 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.320

 sfr free thiedart micro sim and the nano 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.530
 sim the last one that fits well 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.250
 obviously on a year and 1 min and on 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.890
 the iphone 5 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.630
 so everyone who has a bad chip 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.680
 micro sim it will need adapters 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.020
 to be able to put them 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.510
