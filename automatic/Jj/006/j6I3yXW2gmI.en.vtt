around to purchasing it I would just
purchase<00:03:29.220> other<00:03:29.370> things<00:03:29.700> instead<00:03:30.090> of

purchase other things instead of

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.990 
purchase other things instead of
purchasing<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.870> immortal<00:03:31.410> itself<00:03:32.069> and<00:03:32.340> their

Corsica and I was in Corsica I go to
Corsica<00:03:38.730> every<00:03:39.030> two<00:03:39.209> years<00:03:39.239> or<00:03:39.510> so<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:39.870> love<00:03:40.260> it

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
Corsica every two years or so I love it

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.020

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.960 
there it's absolutely beautiful
and<00:03:42.569> we<00:03:43.049> just<00:03:43.380> by<00:03:43.560> chance<00:03:43.889> came<00:03:44.310> across<00:03:44.579> a

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
and we just by chance came across a

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.180 
and we just by chance came across a
distillery<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.169> they<00:03:46.380> had<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.799> more<00:03:46.980> talented

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
distillery and they had a more talented

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.129 
distillery and they had a more talented
all<00:03:47.880> over<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.329> place<00:03:48.450> they<00:03:48.599> showed<00:03:48.810> us<00:03:48.959> how

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
all over the place they showed us how

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.440 
all over the place they showed us how
they<00:03:49.349> distill<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:50.370> plant<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.120> got<00:03:51.299> this

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
they distill the plant and I got this

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.069 
they distill the plant and I got this
for<00:03:51.690> only<00:03:51.840> 20<00:03:52.500> bucks<00:03:53.269> as<00:03:54.269> opposed<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.569> 80<00:03:54.810> which

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
for only 20 bucks as opposed to 80 which

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.990 
for only 20 bucks as opposed to 80 which
is<00:03:55.200> instead<00:03:55.470> living<00:03:55.739> libations<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.519> think<00:03:56.880> it's

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
is instead living libations I think it's

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.099 
is instead living libations I think it's
because<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.359> probably<00:03:57.630> didn't<00:03:57.810> have<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:58.019> go

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
because it probably didn't have to go

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.449 
because it probably didn't have to go
through<00:03:58.349> all<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.560> shipping<00:03:58.919> and<00:03:59.160> all<00:03:59.280> that

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
through all the shipping and all that

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.759 
through all the shipping and all that
stuff<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:00.389> just<00:04:00.750> really<00:04:01.349> love<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.650> it

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
stuff and I just really love it it

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.580 
stuff and I just really love it it

as<00:04:41.480> being<00:04:41.720> free<00:04:42.200> is<00:04:42.380> lots<00:04:42.620> of<00:04:42.770> fun<00:04:43.010> I<00:04:43.220> wasn't

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
as being free is lots of fun I wasn't

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.900 
as being free is lots of fun I wasn't
that<00:04:44.150> into<00:04:45.140> the<00:04:45.410> idea<00:04:45.770> of<00:04:45.830> getting<00:04:46.310> this<00:04:46.640> one

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910

that into the idea of getting this one
at<00:04:47.840> first<00:04:48.320> I<00:04:48.680> just<00:04:48.950> didn't<00:04:49.190> really<00:04:49.370> think<00:04:49.520> that

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
at first I just didn't really think that

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.000
