00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.280
 what we have today is one want that sense 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.180
 part of the telephone line 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.670
 corporate or for the market of companies or people who want to be 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.410
 always communicated in reality as you see is a phone that you do not have 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.419
 camera 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:16.810
 does not have many things it has just a usb connector 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.290
 in fact none of the three glasses and would find either works very well 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.619
 has a connector vs d quintero 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.759
 beyond that from the multimedia features this is one of the best 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.079
 equipment that I tried 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.939
 for everything that is messaging and sending emails 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.480
 not only have they seen in the aedile they are the famous typical sent you that you can 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.770
 use with installers 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.780
 like china and the obvious and horse mackerel 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.390
 Brown could not play 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.600
 but also you have a lot of installers that is well in 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.990
 default 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.150
 at 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.280
 the on the computer that that allows you to connect from any server on the 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.880
 agreement 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.950
 to any public servant decline is that you would have connectivity with 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.200
 any type of private or corporate network that you go to the platform 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.840
 windows 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.080
 iu with intel and zinc that is their own development 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.430
 beyond that the team has 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.640
 Hummer is a sixty with all the characteristics of this one 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.450
 operating system that allows you to have from things like this there is q that is 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.450
 something that you end up using terribly especially with the percent keyboard and 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.070
 one thing that has quite interesting that 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.040
 amelie wolves typing but rates on the curious the keyboard is deduced only 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.049
 that a bar the itc very very good 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.710
 notice that in these moments band because it recognizes that there is light 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.409
 and it's going very well beyond that does not have great team things 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.310
 but 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.530
 for what is made to work and it works very common well at size level 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.860
 as you can see it is quite thin but the gigantic this compared these 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.830
 a time is perea l 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.140
 see if we compare how much larger is a hundred percent dead 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.430
 much thinner but it is much wider and if we compare it with a 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.730
 most consumer phone with his girlfriend 6 1 3 1 the giant size difference 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.990
 beyond this many people imagine that this can compare 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.800
 with a phone like the camera failure and et cetera and not just what I say 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.950
 this this phone comes to compete directly against the blackberry and 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.380
 against some other phone with windows there is no and in that competition 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.080
 personally I do not think it wins 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.390
 because he has the possibility to connect as I said before with everything 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.730
 came out an agreement windows servers this start 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.610
 and similar things is definitely a very good purchase 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.630
 It's a pretty cheap phone and in a hands-free phone, what do I know when I 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.260
 speak they have to use it like this when they use handsfree that the one that really 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.060
 I was surprised and I liked it a lot
