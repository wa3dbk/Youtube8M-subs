00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.540

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.220
 There's the last days and me again 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.210

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.190
 Let's go here there was a big one 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.049
 salad with sweet potatoes and fried 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.430

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.529
 above and here you can again the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.270
 mushrooms also see this before 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.609
 gave a short time again a small one 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.580
 between picture here I have shopped 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.000
 for yes, if the basenfasten finally around 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.189
 is 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.080
 then there's with me in any case 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.540
 many more sweets 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.860
 without sugar especially if at all 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.660
 maybe I bought two things 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.860
 somehow with agave dicksaft or 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:45.469
 Coconut blossoms sugar flavored or sweetened 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.730
 yes solved means sweetened are research 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.739
 exactly and there you want to ask yourself 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.570
 do you want a photo to if so would 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.530
 I make a candy that no 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.059
 sugar I think that is quite 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.230
 interesting for you a few more 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.969
 other things but I can 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.250
 you also like to show then there was 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.300
 Here the next day a pumpkin soup 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.739
 with some cream and some pumpkin seeds 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.020
 I'm still developing myself 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.590
 this vanilla berrys being triegel 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.320
 granted 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.700
 that's for the most part based so it 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.140
 are equal parquet shot in there I have 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.390
 I did not say it to 100 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.540
 percent basis for basen fasting therefore 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.189
 that was okay okay we are already by day 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.689
 22 and now you think determines ago 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.479
 noodles do not go at all 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.220
 Basenfasten believe me it works 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.630
 left is first the salad and right 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.689
 I have to tell you there are such 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.549
 noodles from the cognac root yes and the 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.320
 I think I'm standing or something 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.180
 called and my brother does that yes 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.329
 for a long time low carb because he 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.310
 wants to lose weight and he has just these 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.020
 yes have noodles quasi na the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.490
 actually no nutrients are like 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.350
 I do not think why no now 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.670

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.530

 carbohydrates no no protein no fat 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.909
 and do not do anything really full 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.630
 she was extremely high in fiber 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.000
 contain 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.100
 and this day in rudel I have on

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.369
 I was so into noodles so had that 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.409

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.509
 craving of mine so I've got really so 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.789
 after that I had solved that 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.530
 someday said to him hey I need 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.590

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.640
 a little help flake and it was 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.470
 Also something completely new what I did 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.209
 I've never eaten like that either 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.380

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.940
 sweet potatoes over everything with cash flows 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.549
 especially that is a combination of the 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.860
 symphony so delicious again and again 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:19.250
 bit more colorful here was a big one 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:22.610
 Pan with worries that I think it was 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.250
 a of frosta's vegetables was yummy before 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.290
 vegan in any case and it was 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.320
 Spinach with a bit of this 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.510
 jander frame boiled up so what as well 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.650
 creamed but really really good and the 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.970
 frosta dishes 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.500
 they are a bit more expensive 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.210
 partly but I always do it 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.229
 Not so it's a helping hand 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.669
 mostly in it 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.990
 or if I do not 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.990
 Basenfasten usually always do one 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:48.229
 large portion of rice or noodles or 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.580
 otherwise something to crops and 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.620
 then it is perfect but 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.090
 It does not take so deep in the 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.950
 bag but it is just fine because the 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.289
 Mix for me totally delicious on 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.260
 I had high blood here the next day 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.530
 Price with a few grapes 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.820
 and there were still high wheat with it 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.440
 tomato sauce and a little bit of 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.450

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.220
 I think the boiled potatoes 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.200

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.420

 I do not stop because it's just before 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.730

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.440

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:25.280
 meal after basenfasten here 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.350

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.220
 and there it was really happy that times 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.770
 could eat it again noodles 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.050
 thick noodles and yes I hope you have 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.550
 I liked my summary and me 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.530
 have seen we have over 400 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.150
 posts on instagram with the hashtag 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.620
 he collects and looks at calif 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.960
 absolutely pure if you are a little bit 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.700
 to have inspiration what you want 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.910
 eat fast base a look at 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.760
 Do not forget what you are doing 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:04.060
 Basenfasten to prepare so great 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:06.490
 and that 's really a really great stuff 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.260
 round business already the form of fasting 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.670
 do not have to cure what many do not 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.030
 I think it's a very tough one 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:16.000
 workable form which is also feasible 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.650
 for everyday life and yes thank you
