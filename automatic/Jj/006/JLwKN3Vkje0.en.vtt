all of our traffic signal assemblies
with<00:01:38.130> LED<00:01:38.670> lights<00:01:38.910> rather<00:01:39.300> than<00:01:39.509> incandescent

with LED lights rather than incandescent

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.570 
with LED lights rather than incandescent
bulbs<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.650> we've<00:01:40.770> been<00:01:40.890> using<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.190> years

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
bulbs that we've been using for years

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.910 
bulbs that we've been using for years
and<00:01:42.240> those<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.979> about<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.540> nine-time

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
and those it's about a nine-time

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.680 
and those it's about a nine-time
decrease<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.400> wattage<00:01:47.700> pull<00:01:47.970> off<00:01:48.300> of<00:01:48.509> the

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
decrease in the wattage pull off of the

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.410 
decrease in the wattage pull off of the
city<00:01:48.900> of<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> utility<00:01:49.560> system<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:51.119> saves

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
city of the utility system so that saves

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.810 
city of the utility system so that saves
a<00:01:51.600> lot<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.780> energy<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.920> fact<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.430> old<00:01:53.580> lights

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
a lot of energy in fact the old lights

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.200 
a lot of energy in fact the old lights
pulled<00:01:54.180> 135<00:01:55.170> watts<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.800> the<00:01:56.130> new<00:01:56.250> ones<00:01:56.460> just

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
pulled 135 watts and the new ones just

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.830 
pulled 135 watts and the new ones just
15<00:01:57.690> also<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.710> lifespan<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.250> those<00:01:59.400> is<00:01:59.550> about

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
15 also the lifespan on those is about

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.410 
15 also the lifespan on those is about
roughly<00:02:00.840> twice<00:02:01.080> as<00:02:01.140> long<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.909> know<00:02:03.000> we<00:02:03.240> get

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
roughly twice as long so you know we get

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.600 
roughly twice as long so you know we get
some<00:02:03.630> gains<00:02:03.840> with<00:02:04.140> not<00:02:04.979> having<00:02:05.190> to<00:02:05.310> send<00:02:05.490> our

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
some gains with not having to send our

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.100 
some gains with not having to send our
guys<00:02:05.760> out<00:02:05.970> enough<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.300> change<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.810> bulbs<00:02:07.020> out

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
guys out enough to change the bulbs out

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.469 
guys out enough to change the bulbs out
quite<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:07.530> often<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.130> that<00:02:08.850> helps<00:02:09.119> out<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.269> lot

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
quite so often so that helps out a lot

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.630 
quite so often so that helps out a lot
the<00:02:10.050> second<00:02:10.410> program<00:02:10.560> has<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.010> really<00:02:11.400> fancy

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
the second program has a really fancy

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.250 
the second program has a really fancy
title<00:02:12.180> we<00:02:12.510> generally<00:02:12.989> call<00:02:13.200> it

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
title we generally call it

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.350 
title we generally call it
synchronization<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.370> optimization<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.269> our

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
signal system and what we're looking at

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.820 
signal system and what we're looking at
doing<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:18.239> in<00:02:18.570> some<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:19.080> our<00:02:19.200> signals<00:02:19.650> we're

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
doing is in some of our signals we're

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.830 
doing is in some of our signals we're
really<00:02:19.980> focusing<00:02:20.459> on<00:02:20.610> three<00:02:20.970> main<00:02:21.239> arterial
