00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.330
 there are difficult days there are situations 

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:08.490
 difficult to overcome I do not understand there 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.519
 moods that we would like 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.730
 have but we do not know how to feel 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.730
 best 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.680
 think of a beautiful moment in your life 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.140
 Some loved one that I love and want 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.550
 all your happiness and makes an effort 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.870
 smiling 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.530
 because it is your smile will illuminate your day 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:33.380
 and now I felt this old 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.770
 little by little you will see that the sadness of 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.000
 save will be 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.340
 because time cures everything 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.440
 every time you think about the things that 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.920
 lately you have gone wrong 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.039
 look for your memories something very nice 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.260
 so that the problems do not weigh so much 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:53.719
 every time you sit alone think of 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.539
 Every person that made you happy, no more 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.420
 think because it is in your mind there 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.909
 images words that you assured in this 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.659
 it will be good to remember 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:07.320
 look for the ones if they are not there then 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.409
 they will be in your heart 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.310
 believe in your dreams even in those who 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.470
 they seem impossible 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.860
 think about how wonderful it is to have the 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:21.369
 opportunity to go through this land is 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.280
 also a challenge because by step each 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.909
 step you give you can find a 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.069
 obstacle but not 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.000
 as such, look at it as an opportunity 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:35.390
 to improve your condition 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.970
 if you ever fall, get up and follow 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.630
 go ahead and always keep in mind that you 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.860
 you are special that there is no one like you and 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.860
 that there is no this can match 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.659
 when sadness seizes 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.640
 we want to cry 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.590
 we can spawn by writing and 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.310
 remembering things that we think have 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.770
 been forgotten but it's not like that 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.409
 forget the memories always live 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.720
 dormant in us that's why they're called 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.770
 memories because they are always together 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.650
 you 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.560
 many times we feel so alone that 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.810
 the only company is our computer 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.840
 there we write what perhaps in words 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.330
 we can not say 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.849
 the sorrows of the soul are the most 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.280
 difficult to heal because they are something that 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.810
 he gets up like us and he also 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.080
 lie in our bed 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.860
 whenever we write something it is for another 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.670
 so that another person can read us 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.070
 and feel that we need something from them 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.130
 maybe a call or just a 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.280
 word of encouragement 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.890
 when the sad day comes when nothing 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.910
 go well in our lives 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.650
 when we feel that there is only room for 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.780
 the sadness 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.569
 let's remember the happy moments that 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.380
 we also had there may be many 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:05.220
 reasons to feel that way 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:09.370
 let's take advantage of our sadness 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.240
 write whatever anything 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.780
 something that brought us a lot of pain 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:19.560
 perhaps separate us from that being that one day 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.350
 we go a lot and today we find it hard to forget or 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.630
 maybe the distance from our families 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:28.170
 are in other countries or the loss 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:31.500
 physical of being a loved one that we love 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.580
 so much life is difficult nothing is easy 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.610
 nobody said it 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.850
 we must reflect on what caused us so much 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.850
 pain but surely always 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.130
 we are sad it is because we are not at 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.110
 side of the person we love or maybe 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.320
 we are next to someone who does not have 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.500
 what to see already with our dreams and not 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.410
 we are able to tell you that we no longer 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.360
 we love we do not have the courage to face 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.990
 this situation 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.200
 from there the sadness of our soul is born 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.750
 let's not forget that grief and sadness 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.390
 are empty of our life something that 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.330
 we want if we do not have that something that we 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.959
 awakens wanting to be in another 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:19.420
 side and at another time although it is believed 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.570
 that happiness are small pieces of 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.390
 time that gives us life that is not 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.490
 a constant but how little or much 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.110
 last is good 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.810
 because there is nothing cuter than 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.120
 wake up happy next to the 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.580
 person that we love that do not exist 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.970
 distances there's nothing cuter than 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.550
 feel our expectations go for a 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.639
 good way that our families are 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.910
 solid and healthy that our dreams are 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:52.210
 achievable that our health does not indicate 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:55.660
 nothing bad me in every day there is a reason 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.920
 to get up and go out and fight the 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.930
 life for what we want to conquer 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.000
 definitively there are no great 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.650
 problems that we can not give a 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.650
 solution 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.889
 We have different moods each 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.780
 today is the sadness tomorrow will be the 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.910
 happiness 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.760
 you can now start giving 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.460
 thank you for having one more day of life and 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.040
 if you do not think and reflect on 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.889
 next questions you know how many people 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:29.610
 died in the world while you listened 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:31.920
 this you know what they are feeling now 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.020
 your loved ones 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.170
 although today the sadness has stayed 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:41.160
 for a short time in your life only 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:44.070
 you have enough strength to be able 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.580
 want to do something different and positive 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.580
 in your life
