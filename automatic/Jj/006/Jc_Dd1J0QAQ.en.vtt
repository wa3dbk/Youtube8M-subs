this<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:01.369> launch<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.610> up<00:02:02.910> and<00:02:03.800> we're<00:02:04.800> going

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
this so launch this up and we're going

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.620 
this so launch this up and we're going
to<00:02:05.040> try<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.340> uninstall<00:02:05.700> all<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.990> our<00:02:07.340> drivers

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
to try to uninstall all of our drivers

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.699 
to try to uninstall all of our drivers
alright<00:02:09.630> so<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.869> can<00:02:09.990> see<00:02:10.200> all<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.410> these

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
alright so you can see all of these

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.520 
alright so you can see all of these
drivers<00:02:11.430> right<00:02:11.670> through<00:02:11.880> here<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:13.050> we're

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
drivers right through here so we're

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.500 
drivers right through here so we're
going<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.740> hit<00:02:13.920> control<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.790> then<00:02:15.360> we're

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
going to hit control and then we're

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.180 
going to hit control and then we're
going<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.660> highlight<00:02:16.050> them<00:02:16.260> all<00:02:16.380> we<00:02:17.100> don't

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
going to highlight them all we don't

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.740 
going to highlight them all we don't
want<00:02:17.400> we<00:02:17.580> don't<00:02:17.670> want<00:02:17.850> that<00:02:18.030> one<00:02:18.330> highlighted

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
want we don't want that one highlighted

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.040 
want we don't want that one highlighted
so<00:02:20.000> highlight<00:02:21.000> highlight<00:02:21.420> highlight

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
so highlight highlight highlight

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.830 
so highlight highlight highlight
highlight<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:23.180> then<00:02:24.180> we're<00:02:24.540> going<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.720> go

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
highlight and then we're going to go

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.540 
highlight and then we're going to go
down<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.110> see<00:02:25.500> if<00:02:25.560> we<00:02:25.650> have<00:02:25.800> any<00:02:25.950> Samsung

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
down and see if we have any Samsung

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.040 
down and see if we have any Samsung
drivers<00:02:27.030> in<00:02:27.209> here<00:02:27.480> which<00:02:27.660> we<00:02:27.840> might<00:02:30.050> doesn't

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
drivers in here which we might doesn't

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.980 
drivers in here which we might doesn't
look<00:02:31.110> like<00:02:31.200> we<00:02:31.500> do

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.620 

ok

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
ok

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.770 
ok
so<00:02:37.440> those<00:02:38.430> are<00:02:38.460> our<00:02:38.760> drivers<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.480> then<00:02:39.630> we're

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
so those are our drivers and then we're

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.470 
so those are our drivers and then we're
going<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.200> right<00:02:40.440> click<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:41.480> uninstall

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
going to right click and uninstall

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.950 
going to right click and uninstall
selected<00:02:43.020> drivers<00:02:44.510> do<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.630> want<00:02:45.840> to

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
selected drivers do you want to

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.260 
selected drivers do you want to
uninstall<00:02:46.050> say<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.340> yes<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:49.700> once<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.850> drivers

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
uninstall say it yes so once the drivers

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.090 
uninstall say it yes so once the drivers
are<00:02:51.300> installed<00:02:51.600> we<00:02:52.380> can<00:02:52.410> move<00:02:52.680> on<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:52.980> the

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
are installed we can move on to the

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.150 
are installed we can move on to the
automatic<00:02:53.580> configuration<00:02:53.730> tool<00:02:55.160> which

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
automatic configuration tool which

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.920 
automatic configuration tool which
actually<00:02:56.430> did<00:02:56.760> not<00:02:56.910> work<00:02:57.120> for<00:02:57.300> me<00:02:57.360> but<00:02:57.750> it

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
actually did not work for me but it

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.240 
actually did not work for me but it
might<00:02:58.230> work<00:02:58.260> for<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:58.830> we're<00:02:58.950> going<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.130> run

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
might work for you so we're going to run

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.770 
might work for you so we're going to run
through<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.610> and<00:02:59.730> then<00:03:00.000> I'll<00:03:00.150> go<00:03:00.330> through<00:03:00.630> the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
through it and then I'll go through the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.620 
through it and then I'll go through the
manual<00:03:01.080> way<00:03:02.070> of<00:03:02.190> doing<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.490> also<00:03:05.150> all<00:03:06.150> right<00:03:06.330> so

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
manual way of doing it also all right so

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.990 
manual way of doing it also all right so
there<00:03:06.960> we<00:03:07.080> go<00:03:07.140> those<00:03:07.500> are<00:03:07.680> uninstalled<00:03:08.640> so<00:03:08.880> we

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
there we go those are uninstalled so we

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.890 
there we go those are uninstalled so we
can<00:03:09.180> hit<00:03:09.600> this<00:03:09.870> so<00:03:10.680> next<00:03:11.400> step<00:03:11.610> in<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.420> is<00:03:12.720> to

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
can hit this so next step in this is to

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.330 
can hit this so next step in this is to
go<00:03:13.050> ahead<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.380> hit<00:03:13.470> this<00:03:13.650> right<00:03:13.920> here<00:03:14.130> just

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
go ahead and hit this right here just

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.320 
go ahead and hit this right here just
automatic<00:03:14.820> driver<00:03:15.060> configuration<00:03:15.680> windows<00:03:16.680> 7

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
automatic driver configuration windows 7

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.620 
automatic driver configuration windows 7
so<00:03:18.330> we're<00:03:18.630> going<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:19.050> launch<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:20.420> all<00:03:21.420> right

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
so we're going to launch that all right

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.810 
so we're going to launch that all right
this<00:03:22.350> script<00:03:22.650> will<00:03:22.950> attempt<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.400> automate

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
this script will attempt to automate

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.370 
this script will attempt to automate
configure<00:03:24.180> your<00:03:24.270> drivers<00:03:24.660> for<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.940> so<00:03:27.380> it'll

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
configure your drivers for you so it'll

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.380 
configure your drivers for you so it'll
tell<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.710> when<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:28.950> plug<00:03:29.280> in<00:03:29.460> your<00:03:29.580> device<00:03:29.910> it

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
tell you when to plug in your device it

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.880 
tell you when to plug in your device it
will<00:03:30.480> do<00:03:30.600> all<00:03:30.720> those<00:03:30.840> things<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.620> first<00:03:31.770> thing

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
will do all those things the first thing

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.380 
will do all those things the first thing
it<00:03:32.070> does<00:03:32.100> is<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.370> downloads<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.820> drivers<00:03:33.210> I

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
it does is it downloads the drivers I

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.980 
it does is it downloads the drivers I
already<00:03:33.600> have<00:03:33.900> them<00:03:34.110> but<00:03:34.830> it'll<00:03:34.950> do<00:03:35.100> it

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
already have them but it'll do it

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.390 
already have them but it'll do it
automatically<00:03:36.990> for<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.320> so<00:03:38.040> we're<00:03:38.190> go<00:03:38.250> ahead

automatically for you so we're go ahead

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.080 
automatically for you so we're go ahead
okay<00:03:38.570> so<00:03:39.570> attempting<00:03:40.020> to<00:03:40.140> install<00:03:40.350> drivers<00:03:41.090> so

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
okay so attempting to install drivers so

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
okay so attempting to install drivers so
if<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.900> haven't<00:03:44.390> if<00:03:45.390> it<00:03:45.600> has<00:03:45.750> been<00:03:45.900> downloaded

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
if you haven't if it has been downloaded

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.380 
if you haven't if it has been downloaded
it'll<00:03:46.410> take<00:03:46.530> longer<00:03:46.740> than<00:03:46.980> this<00:03:47.130> but<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:48.210> the

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
it'll take longer than this but so the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.850 
it'll take longer than this but so the
next<00:03:48.540> thing<00:03:48.660> we<00:03:48.840> want<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:49.050> do<00:03:49.230> is<00:03:49.440> we<00:03:49.590> want<00:03:49.620> to

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
next thing we want to do is we want to

next thing we want to do is we want to
go<00:03:49.980> into<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.520> phone<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:51.030> hit<00:03:51.180> this<00:03:51.330> USB

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
go into the phone and hit this USB

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.810 
go into the phone and hit this USB
debugging<00:03:51.990> so<00:03:54.440> on<00:03:55.440> on<00:03:55.800> your<00:03:56.220> should<00:03:56.550> save<00:03:56.730> the

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
debugging so on on your should save the

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.320 
debugging so on on your should save the
tablet<00:03:57.210> here<00:03:58.130> we're<00:03:59.130> going<00:03:59.460> to<00:03:59.730> go<00:04:00.090> into

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
tablet here we're going to go into

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.060 
tablet here we're going to go into
settings<00:04:02.420> developer<00:04:03.420> options<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:04.380> then

settings developer options and then

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.040 
settings developer options and then
right<00:04:05.250> here<00:04:05.280> USB<00:04:06.120> debugging<00:04:06.270> and<00:04:06.690> then<00:04:06.900> you

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
right here USB debugging and then you

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.990 
right here USB debugging and then you
want<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.260> make<00:04:07.410> sure<00:04:07.440> that<00:04:08.190> it<00:04:08.430> is<00:04:08.640> checked

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
want to make sure that it is checked

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.570 
want to make sure that it is checked
which<00:04:09.480> mine<00:04:09.720> is<00:04:09.930> so<00:04:10.560> USB<00:04:11.040> debugging<00:04:11.160> is

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
which mine is so USB debugging is

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.390 
which mine is so USB debugging is

done the next thing you can do is after

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.430 
done the next thing you can do is after
year<00:04:19.739> you<00:04:20.160> plug<00:04:20.459> in<00:04:20.700> wait<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.000> bit<00:04:21.270> so<00:04:22.140> we<00:04:22.350> have

fastboot<00:05:38.039> connectivity<00:05:38.639> check<00:05:38.879> so<00:05:39.259> you<00:05:40.259> can

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409 
fastboot connectivity check so you can

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:43.329 
fastboot connectivity check so you can
see<00:05:40.589> what<00:05:40.830> it<00:05:40.949> looks<00:05:40.979> like<00:05:41.219> on<00:05:41.370> the<00:05:41.490> tablet<00:05:41.909> and

see what it looks like on the tablet and
we're<00:05:44.339> going<00:05:44.460> to<00:05:44.550> go<00:05:44.759> into<00:05:45.499> fastboot<00:05:46.499> here<00:05:46.770> and

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:46.949 
we're going to go into fastboot here and

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:48.469 
we're going to go into fastboot here and
we'll<00:05:47.039> check<00:05:47.249> that<00:05:47.490> so<00:05:47.819> okay<00:05:48.150> so<00:05:48.210> it's

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
we'll check that so okay so it's

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.429 
we'll check that so okay so it's
checking<00:05:48.719> fastboot<00:05:50.930> so<00:05:51.930> let's<00:05:52.080> let<00:05:52.199> it<00:05:52.319> go

00:05:52.429 --> 00:05:52.439 
checking fastboot so let's let it go

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:54.709 
checking fastboot so let's let it go
through<00:05:52.680> these<00:05:52.830> steps<00:05:53.180> fastboot<00:05:54.180> looks<00:05:54.569> like

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:54.719 
through these steps fastboot looks like

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:56.920 
through these steps fastboot looks like
it<00:05:54.870> checked<00:05:55.080> that<00:05:55.229> okay<00:05:55.529> all<00:05:56.430> right

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
it checked that okay all right

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.209 
it checked that okay all right
configuration<00:05:57.930> your<00:05:58.560> drivers<00:05:59.009> is

00:05:59.209 --> 00:05:59.219 
configuration your drivers is

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:00.800 
configuration your drivers is
successfully<00:05:59.789> configured<00:06:00.300> now<00:06:00.599> it's

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
successfully configured now it's

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.879 
successfully configured now it's
rebooting<00:06:01.229> your<00:06:01.259> device<00:06:02.360> so<00:06:03.360> as<00:06:03.689> you<00:06:04.589> can<00:06:04.680> see

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
rebooting your device so as you can see

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.379 
rebooting your device so as you can see
i'm<00:06:05.009> actually<00:06:05.189> already<00:06:05.520> unlocked<00:06:05.969> down<00:06:06.180> here

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
i'm actually already unlocked down here

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.480 
i'm actually already unlocked down here
in<00:06:06.449> the<00:06:06.539> bottom<00:06:06.740> but<00:06:07.740> you<00:06:07.979> don't<00:06:08.159> have<00:06:08.279> to<00:06:08.399> be

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
in the bottom but you don't have to be

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.579 
in the bottom but you don't have to be
to<00:06:08.610> do<00:06:08.759> this<00:06:08.879> configuration<00:06:09.300> so<00:06:10.199> it's<00:06:10.349> waiting

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:10.589 
to do this configuration so it's waiting

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:13.570 
to do this configuration so it's waiting
for<00:06:10.740> my<00:06:10.860> advice<00:06:11.009> to<00:06:11.339> boot<00:06:11.490> back<00:06:11.699> up<00:06:12.080> and

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
for my advice to boot back up and

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.790 
for my advice to boot back up and
basically<00:06:14.580> that<00:06:14.909> will<00:06:15.089> be<00:06:15.270> the<00:06:15.800> automatic

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
basically that will be the automatic

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.219 
basically that will be the automatic
configuration<00:06:18.080> so<00:06:19.080> once<00:06:19.889> we<00:06:20.189> do<00:06:21.120> that<00:06:21.229> that's

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
configuration so once we do that that's

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:24.320 
configuration so once we do that that's
that's<00:06:22.740> your<00:06:23.219> you're<00:06:23.460> pretty<00:06:23.759> much<00:06:23.789> set<00:06:24.149> up

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
that's your you're pretty much set up

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.879 
that's your you're pretty much set up
see<00:06:24.750> what<00:06:24.899> this<00:06:25.080> let<00:06:25.289> this<00:06:25.409> boot<00:06:25.649> back<00:06:25.860> up

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:25.889 
see what this let this boot back up

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:31.249 
see what this let this boot back up
you'll<00:06:26.849> be<00:06:27.000> completely<00:06:27.330> set<00:06:27.629> up<00:06:27.659> to<00:06:27.960> run<00:06:30.259> the

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 
you'll be completely set up to run the

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:34.369 
you'll be completely set up to run the
application<00:06:31.759> so<00:06:32.759> should<00:06:33.419> should<00:06:33.870> finish<00:06:34.080> up

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:34.379 
application so should should finish up

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:36.220 
application so should should finish up
here

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.230
