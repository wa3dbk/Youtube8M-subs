and cooking creams and the reason I've

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.670 
and cooking creams and the reason I've

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
added quite a lot of olive oil is

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.410 
added quite a lot of olive oil is
because<00:04:11.860> I<00:04:11.950> like<00:04:12.520> the<00:04:12.670> mixture<00:04:12.940> of<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.180> cream

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
because I like the mixture of the cream

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.410 
because I like the mixture of the cream
and<00:04:13.630> Tanvi<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:15.220> oil<00:04:15.490> they<00:04:15.910> will<00:04:16.030> find<00:04:16.269> them

and Tanvi the oil they will find them

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.120 
and Tanvi the oil they will find them
they<00:04:16.690> will<00:04:16.810> kind<00:04:16.959> of<00:04:17.109> stick<00:04:17.590> together<00:04:17.739> but

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
they will kind of stick together but

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.440 
they will kind of stick together but
they<00:04:18.250> were<00:04:18.340> separate<00:04:18.760> at<00:04:18.880> the<00:04:19.000> same<00:04:19.209> time

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450
