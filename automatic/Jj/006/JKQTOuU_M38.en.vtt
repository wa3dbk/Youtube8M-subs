00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.660
 greetings friends today I make this video to explain what is in 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.800
 game in the soccer world cup why the soccer games the fifa 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.269
 does not allow the use of technology to see arbitration errors and correct them 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:18.810
 Surely many of you, like me, will be deluded with some team of 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.619
 football as my friend with mexico or will have even seen how in a team of 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.140
 football in the World Cup something unfair happened well I'll explain how 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.289
 works this disgusting mafia export 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.479
 It looks dirty called fifa 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:34.579
 do you remember the United States party slovenia 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.710
 an arbitral error denied the victory to the Americans but it was not an error 'is 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.580
 something ordered by fifa 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.960
 He also cited what happened to Argentina 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.030
 they sang him goal in advance 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.920
 the same day in the germany-england party and that's what happened 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.410
 they eliminated a goal to england 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.570
 chance 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.360
 no gentlemen the fifa 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.560
 as an achievement france the classification to the world 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.800
 with a goal he made with his hand 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.280
 apart from that we have to make sure that a team arrives 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.110
 weakened to the matches that fifa wants him to lose 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.150
 the referees president fifa orders fill out the card teams 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.420
 yellows disguising the key players like the 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.800
 accumulation of cards do you mind of different parties 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.259
 the goals that were not remembered the goals that did not sing that were goals 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.300
 remember someone sent off with a red card for a foul that does not 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.210
 a penalty 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.200
 remember some yellow card taken out for nothing 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.610
 remember some player who was looted injured by a foul 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.020
 leaving injured for months all that is not coincidence 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.289
 and is that in this football is willing or not 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.289
 a match if not millions of euros and dollars 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.560
 to the fifa serves him economically is a party that produces greater benefit 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.360
 economic 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.240
 greater raiting 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.520
 one is like a final with germany and brazil that a final of mexico against 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.730
 Slovakia 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.760
 breasts the fools the fifa is moving the threads behind the curtain so 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.189
 like in a game of chess is moving the pieces 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:12.969
 and if this were not enough, the most important business of fifa is the business of 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:13.810
 bets 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.090
 through these moves millions and millions of dollars and euros 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.739
 especially when the bets are 10 to 1 for or against a team to 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.280
 the track does not suit them that this or that team wins 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.640
 the fifa even monitors the betting market over the world on the internet 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.549
 they do not believe me 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.860
 put in the search engine these words the fifa watches over the internet the market of 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.809
 bets on him 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:39.150
 puyang assert 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.880
 millions are moving in japan china united states 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.269
 European casinos like Las Vegas casinos like elmo 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:52.319
 and many more places where these cute little angels run the 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.699
 fifa put their millions 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:58.839
 investment and they are not stupid to get to cross their fingers indicating that 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:00.509
 the results are given 

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:03.519
 many of the fifa have shares in casino 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.069
 they plan very 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.419
 a lot of money is at stake to 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:12.009
 in the selection of an African country come to spoil that practice 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:13.519
 safe 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.519
 bush like in different sports like basketball 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:21.579
 perfectly allow the use of 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.059
 with television replays to ask to correct the referee's mistakes 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:28.979
 even some have up jury 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:33.759
 and these fifa gentlemen in football do not want repetitions they say that that 

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:38.109
 would remove the cheekiness of football but the reality is that mischief is not 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.649
 of football but of the casino owner of the fifa gentlemen with shares in 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:45.329
 casinos and those that control bets 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.329
 Many people refuse to accept this harsh reality 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:52.959
 and is that maybe they think that the arbitrators are appointed by Jesus 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.409
 and that they are angels from heaven 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.129
 they think they do not like money they think they do not think 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.360
 in caritas de plata gentlemen the fifa is a perfectly organization 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.159
 structured 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.739
 do not be so inc 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.929
 that's a vulgar copy of the worst ilk 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:14.779
 that's why the next time you see a football game do not get excited 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:19.839
 foolishly remember, look at the details match by match and add the 

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:22.119
 all to convince themselves
