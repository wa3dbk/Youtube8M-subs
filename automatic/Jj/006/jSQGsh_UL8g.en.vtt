tool we're going to select these top two

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.350 
tool we're going to select these top two
points<00:00:49.070> now<00:00:50.070> most<00:00:50.339> people<00:00:50.430> don't<00:00:50.790> know<00:00:51.030> how<00:00:51.330> to

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
points now most people don't know how to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.719 
points now most people don't know how to
properly<00:00:51.960> use<00:00:52.080> the<00:00:52.500> curvature<00:00:53.040> tool<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:53.610> go

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
properly use the curvature tool but go

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:56.899 
properly use the curvature tool but go
ahead<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.030> select<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.010> this<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.640> tool

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
ahead and select it and this is the tool

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.549 
ahead and select it and this is the tool
that<00:00:57.119> makes<00:00:57.269> the<00:00:57.479> difference<00:00:57.510> between<00:00:57.989> anime

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
that makes the difference between anime

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.130 
that makes the difference between anime
studio<00:00:58.769> and<00:00:59.369> other<00:00:59.729> programs<00:01:00.059> other<00:01:00.690> programs

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
studio and other programs other programs

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.660 
studio and other programs other programs
that<00:01:01.229> do<00:01:01.440> vectors<00:01:01.860> do<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> little<00:01:02.430> bit

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
that do vectors do this a little bit

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.929 
that do vectors do this a little bit
differently<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.830> so<00:01:04.830> basically<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:05.489> have<00:01:05.700> two

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
differently but so basically we have two

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.760 
differently but so basically we have two
points<00:01:06.390> highlighted<00:01:06.960> right<00:01:07.140> now<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.530> there

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
points highlighted right now and there

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.820 
points highlighted right now and there
are<00:01:07.799> two<00:01:07.979> points<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.760> middle<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.830> four

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
are two points in the middle of four

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.980 
are two points in the middle of four
points<00:01:11.400> right<00:01:12.120> we<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.450> these<00:01:12.630> two<00:01:12.780> other

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
points right we have these two other

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.390 
points right we have these two other
points<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.380> aren't<00:01:13.620> selected<00:01:14.180> this<00:01:15.180> tool<00:01:15.600> is

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
points that aren't selected this tool is

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.900 
points that aren't selected this tool is
going<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.550> adjust<00:01:18.120> the<00:01:18.680> amount<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:20.400> sharpness

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
going to adjust the amount of sharpness

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.100 
going to adjust the amount of sharpness
in<00:01:21.330> our<00:01:21.690> curve<00:01:21.990> between<00:01:23.150> like<00:01:24.150> right<00:01:24.690> now<00:01:24.900> if

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
in our curve between like right now if

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.810 
in our curve between like right now if
we<00:01:25.170> select<00:01:25.440> it<00:01:25.740> just<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.130> one<00:01:26.310> point<00:01:26.550> it

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
we select it just this one point it

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.730 
we select it just this one point it
would<00:01:26.940> be<00:01:27.060> between<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.690> point<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
would be between this point and the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.390 
would be between this point and the
point<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.160> other<00:01:29.280> side<00:01:29.720> so<00:01:31.010> this<00:01:32.010> is<00:01:32.160> kind

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
point on the other side so this is kind

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.890 
point on the other side so this is kind
of<00:01:32.460> how<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.820> Tool<00:01:33.060> Works<00:01:33.120> it's<00:01:33.510> a<00:01:33.570> little<00:01:33.780> bit

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
of how this Tool Works it's a little bit

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.149 
of how this Tool Works it's a little bit
different<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:34.290> we've<00:01:34.409> got<00:01:34.590> two<00:01:34.800> points

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
different but we've got two points

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.490 
different but we've got two points
selected<00:01:35.310> if<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:36.420> then<00:01:36.659> go<00:01:36.840> up<00:01:36.990> here<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.320> click

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
selected if we then go up here and click

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.149 
selected if we then go up here and click
the<00:01:38.159> V<00:01:38.610> shape<00:01:39.470> it's<00:01:40.470> going<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.680> keep<00:01:40.860> them<00:01:41.010> like

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
the V shape it's going to keep them like

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.710 
the V shape it's going to keep them like
they<00:01:41.310> are<00:01:41.430> because<00:01:41.580> that's<00:01:41.880> how<00:01:42.030> we<00:01:42.090> created

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
they are because that's how we created

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.390 
they are because that's how we created
them<00:01:42.840> but<00:01:43.620> it's<00:01:43.740> going<00:01:43.830> to<00:01:43.890> make<00:01:44.040> sure<00:01:44.220> that

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
them but it's going to make sure that

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.140 
them but it's going to make sure that
they<00:01:44.550> are<00:01:44.820> sharp<00:01:45.690> in<00:01:46.790> between<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.909> other<00:01:48.030> two

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
they are sharp in between the other two

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.820 
they are sharp in between the other two
points<00:01:48.690> if<00:01:48.840> we<00:01:49.500> click<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.490> rounded<00:01:51.120> shape

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
points if we click the rounded shape

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.020 
points if we click the rounded shape
it's<00:01:52.830> going<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.100> change<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.400> curvature<00:01:54.000> of

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
it's going to change the curvature of

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.810 
it's going to change the curvature of
them<00:01:54.380> here's<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.440> real<00:01:55.890> quick<00:01:56.159> example<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.790> show

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
them here's a real quick example to show

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.270

you<00:01:56.970> what<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.210> mean<00:01:57.479> I'll<00:01:58.440> grab<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.830> add<00:01:58.950> points

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
you what I mean I'll grab the add points

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.590 
you what I mean I'll grab the add points
tool<00:01:59.580> and<00:02:00.510> i'll<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.710> make<00:02:02.090> three<00:02:03.090> points<00:02:03.330> in

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
tool and i'll just make three points in

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.109 
tool and i'll just make three points in

down here and the two up on top but

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.940 
down here and the two up on top but
leave<00:03:48.359> this<00:03:48.810> point<00:03:49.459> this<00:03:50.459> point<00:03:50.669> oops<00:03:51.950> this

because that's going to come into play

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.220 
because that's going to come into play
later<00:03:58.109> when<00:03:58.440> we<00:03:58.560> set<00:03:58.769> up<00:03:58.859> our<00:03:59.010> head<00:03:59.220> turn<00:04:00.230> all
