good<00:00:55.379> building<00:00:55.829> technique<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.460> think<00:00:56.670> Lego

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
good building technique and I think Lego

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.060 
good building technique and I think Lego
really<00:00:57.480> thought<00:00:57.719> through<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.559> set<00:00:58.829> that's

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
right took such a long time here's the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.130 
right took such a long time here's the
base<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:02.100> we've<00:01:02.250> seen<00:01:02.489> before<00:01:02.719> and<00:01:03.719> as<00:01:03.989> you

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
base that we've seen before and as you

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.690 
base that we've seen before and as you
can<00:01:04.260> see<00:01:04.290> there's<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.739> yellow<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.400> yellow

can see there's the yellow to yellow
barrels<00:01:06.450> which<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.750> find<00:01:06.900> quite<00:01:07.049> interesting

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
barrels which I find quite interesting

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.200 
barrels which I find quite interesting

there are no speech tavor the set
Russian<00:01:10.080> won't<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.740> them<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.070> could<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.430> gas

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
Russian won't be in them it could be gas

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.300 
Russian won't be in them it could be gas
it<00:01:11.939> could<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.210> some<00:01:12.360> nuclear<00:01:12.930> stuff<00:01:13.229> um<00:01:13.890> I'm

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
it could be some nuclear stuff um I'm

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.210 
it could be some nuclear stuff um I'm
not<00:01:14.490> sure<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:15.049> yes<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.080> little<00:01:16.710> droid<00:01:16.920> can

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
not sure and yes that little droid can

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.980 
not sure and yes that little droid can
fit<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.700> platform<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.360> think<00:01:18.570> that's<00:01:18.780> where

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
fit on the platform I think that's where

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.600 
fit on the platform I think that's where
he's<00:01:19.200> mainly<00:01:19.470> meant<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.830> go<00:01:19.950> i'm<00:01:20.009> not<00:01:20.220> sure<00:01:20.400> i

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
he's mainly meant to go i'm not sure i

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.760 
he's mainly meant to go i'm not sure i
think<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.210> some<00:01:21.450> transporting<00:01:22.200> platform<00:01:22.619> so

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
think it's some transporting platform so

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.870 
think it's some transporting platform so
you<00:01:22.860> put<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:23.220> there<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.549> then<00:01:23.670> they'll

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
you put it on there and then they'll

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.640 
you put it on there and then they'll
take<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.299> somewhere<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.140> i<00:01:25.170> think<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.530> was<00:01:25.619> a

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
take it somewhere so i think that was a

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.499 
take it somewhere so i think that was a
really<00:01:25.860> good<00:01:26.130> idea<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.850> good<00:01:27.090> concept<00:01:29.509> now

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
really good idea and a good concept now

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.210 
really good idea and a good concept now
here<00:01:30.869> are<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.079> closet<00:01:31.560> if<00:01:31.740> I'm<00:01:31.920> really

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
here are the closet if I'm really

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.649 
here are the closet if I'm really
interesting<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.790> alight<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.299> building

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
interesting and alight the building

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.030 
interesting and alight the building
techniques<00:01:34.079> they've<00:01:34.290> done<00:01:34.470> with<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.740> they<00:01:34.860> put

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
techniques they've done with it they put

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.550 
techniques they've done with it they put
like<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> lightsaber<00:01:35.939> pisa<00:01:36.329> truth<00:01:37.170> or<00:01:37.290> works

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
like a lightsaber pisa truth or works

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.109 
like a lightsaber pisa truth or works
really<00:01:37.740> well<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.159> think<00:01:38.189> they<00:01:38.490> can<00:01:38.520> rotate

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
really well and I think they can rotate

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.780 
really well and I think they can rotate
well<00:01:39.390> here's<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> back<00:01:40.680> view<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> exosuit

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
well here's the back view of the exosuit

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.330 
well here's the back view of the exosuit
we're<00:01:42.540> gonna<00:01:42.630> wait<00:01:42.930> till<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.380> main<00:01:43.649> view<00:01:44.189> of

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
we're gonna wait till the main view of

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.340 
we're gonna wait till the main view of
the<00:01:44.460> exosuit<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.180> think<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.780> looks<00:01:45.810> really<00:01:46.110> well

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
the exosuit I think it looks really well

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.410 
the exosuit I think it looks really well
with<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.860> cogs<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.579> stuff<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.119> think<00:01:48.299> it

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
with like cogs and stuff and I think it

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.389 
with like cogs and stuff and I think it
looks<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:49.110> it's<00:01:49.290> just<00:01:49.439> been<00:01:49.619> made<00:01:49.829> up<00:01:49.979> scrap

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
looks like it's just been made up scrap

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.749 
looks like it's just been made up scrap
metal<00:01:50.850> which<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.390> find<00:01:52.170> quite<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.560> nice<00:01:52.740> look<00:01:52.979> now

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
metal which I find quite a nice look now

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.520 
metal which I find quite a nice look now
here's<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.030> front<00:01:54.390> view<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.840> as<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.500> see

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
here's a front view and as you can see

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.580 
here's a front view and as you can see
there's<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.979> little<00:01:56.070> cockpit<00:01:56.729> where<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.590> pile

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
there's a little cockpit where the pile

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.859 
there's a little cockpit where the pile
up<00:01:58.770> would<00:01:58.950> sit<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.369> think<00:02:00.210> it's<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.390> man<00:02:00.600> who's

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
up would sit I think it's a man who's

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.469 
up would sit I think it's a man who's
it's<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.340> it's<00:02:02.340> very<00:02:02.610> gonna<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.240> top

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
it's a it's very gonna like the top

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.910 
it's a it's very gonna like the top
where<00:02:03.719> they've<00:02:03.869> got<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.110> bits<00:02:04.290> by<00:02:04.530> he<00:02:04.710> on<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
where they've got the bits by he on the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.730 
where they've got the bits by he on the
antennas<00:02:05.490> now<00:02:06.270> here's<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.750> view<00:02:06.960> i<00:02:06.990> love<00:02:07.469> most

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
antennas now here's the view i love most

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.440 
antennas now here's the view i love most
where<00:02:08.039> their<00:02:08.250> own<00:02:08.399> sideways<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.179> can<00:02:09.330> see

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
where their own sideways and you can see

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.600 
where their own sideways and you can see
the<00:02:09.569> claws<00:02:09.810> coming<00:02:10.110> out<00:02:10.289> like<00:02:10.890> pretty<00:02:11.400> sure

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
the claws coming out like pretty sure

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.550 
the claws coming out like pretty sure
they<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:11.940> hold<00:02:12.060> the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
they can hold the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.850 
they can hold the
lebaron<00:02:13.040> something<00:02:13.459> like<00:02:13.580> that<00:02:13.880> um<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:15.260> think

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
lebaron something like that um I think

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.589 
lebaron something like that um I think
you'll<00:02:16.340> probably<00:02:16.580> pick<00:02:16.880> up<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.209> Droid<00:02:17.480> or

you'll probably pick up the Droid or

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.059 
you'll probably pick up the Droid or
something<00:02:17.930> like<00:02:18.020> that<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.410> certainly<00:02:18.800> can

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
something like that it certainly can

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.309 
something like that it certainly can
pick<00:02:19.220> up<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.489> minifigure<00:02:19.940> everything's<00:02:20.930> on<00:02:21.080> Abu

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
structure instead of just like mom main

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.509 
structure instead of just like mom main
part<00:02:41.170> here's<00:02:42.170> one<00:02:42.440> where<00:02:42.830> it's<00:02:43.069> upside<00:02:43.489> down

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
part here's one where it's upside down

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.850 
part here's one where it's upside down
now<00:02:44.150> it's<00:02:44.600> very<00:02:44.810> cool<00:02:45.110> that<00:02:45.170> can<00:02:45.470> go<00:02:45.590> up<00:02:45.620> so

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
now it's very cool that can go up so

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.229 
now it's very cool that can go up so
damn<00:02:46.040> but<00:02:46.250> if<00:02:46.310> you're<00:02:46.459> in<00:02:46.580> Australia<00:02:47.090> then

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
damn but if you're in Australia then

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.270 
damn but if you're in Australia then
you're<00:02:47.390> already<00:02:47.600> upside<00:02:48.080> down<00:02:48.290> sorry<00:02:48.920> about

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
you're already upside down sorry about

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.630 
you're already upside down sorry about
that<00:02:49.310> awful<00:02:49.940> pump<00:02:50.239> I<00:02:50.989> think<00:02:51.860> it's<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.519> cool

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
that awful pump I think it's a cool

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.340 
that awful pump I think it's a cool
vision<00:02:53.030> that's<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.269> bit<00:02:53.390> of<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.540> playful<00:02:54.110> feature

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
vision that's a bit of a playful feature

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.250 
vision that's a bit of a playful feature
in<00:02:54.830> a<00:02:54.920> bit<00:02:55.069> of<00:02:55.100> a<00:02:55.220> joke<00:02:55.400> you<00:02:55.549> one<00:02:55.700> hey<00:02:55.970> girl<00:02:56.900> I'll

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
in a bit of a joke you one hey girl I'll

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.410 
in a bit of a joke you one hey girl I'll
turn<00:02:57.680> upside-down<00:02:58.040> V<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.730> that's<00:02:59.209> what<00:02:59.390> I

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
turn upside-down V and that's what I

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.820 
turn upside-down V and that's what I
kind<00:02:59.780> of<00:02:59.840> think<00:03:00.019> tell<00:03:00.290> me<00:03:00.410> what<00:03:00.560> you<00:03:00.769> think

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
kind of think tell me what you think

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.059 
kind of think tell me what you think
down<00:03:01.250> below<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:03.260> legs<00:03:03.500> can<00:03:03.739> probably

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
down below and the legs can probably

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.470 
down below and the legs can probably
split<00:03:04.280> out<00:03:04.519> so<00:03:04.670> I<00:03:04.730> think<00:03:04.819> you<00:03:05.090> could<00:03:05.239> do<00:03:05.360> the

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
split out so I think you could do the

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.890 
split out so I think you could do the
splits<00:03:05.780> happy<00:03:06.140> even<00:03:06.319> funny<00:03:07.099> and<00:03:07.340> I<00:03:07.400> suppose<00:03:07.900> so

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
splits happy even funny and I suppose so

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.750 
splits happy even funny and I suppose so
