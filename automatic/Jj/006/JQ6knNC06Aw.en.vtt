this<00:03:08.340> team<00:03:08.610> is<00:03:08.640> in<00:03:08.910> there<00:03:09.120> they'll<00:03:09.660> cook<00:03:09.959> in

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
this team is in there they'll cook in

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.740 
this team is in there they'll cook in
half<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.530> time<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:11.270> then<00:03:12.270> little<00:03:12.450> piece<00:03:12.600> of

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
half the time and then little piece of

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:21.350 
half the time and then little piece of
foil<00:03:18.920> now<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:19.980> water<00:03:20.280> prevented<00:03:20.880> overcooking

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
foil now the water prevented overcooking

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.810 
foil now the water prevented overcooking
you<00:03:22.020> get<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.200> lovely<00:03:22.500> wobbly<00:03:23.010> texture<00:03:23.520> in<00:03:23.640> their

degrees guests to carefully very
carefully<00:03:34.850> pop<00:03:35.850> that<00:03:36.000> into<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.300> oven<00:03:36.450> for

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
carefully pop that into the oven for

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.870 
carefully pop that into the oven for
about<00:03:39.000> 40<00:03:39.600> minutes<00:03:40.220> now<00:03:41.220> once<00:03:41.430> they're<00:03:41.640> cooked

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
about 40 minutes now once they're cooked

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.670 
about 40 minutes now once they're cooked
take<00:03:42.269> them<00:03:42.450> out<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:42.600> they'll<00:03:42.900> be<00:03:42.989> very<00:03:43.290> wobbly

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
take them out and they'll be very wobbly

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.949 
take them out and they'll be very wobbly
so<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.400> can<00:03:44.550> shake<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.880> ramekin<00:03:45.360> and<00:03:45.510> that

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
so you can shake the ramekin and that

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.570 
so you can shake the ramekin and that
the<00:03:46.140> whole<00:03:46.290> custard<00:03:46.739> will<00:03:46.830> move<00:03:47.010> but<00:03:47.459> there'll

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
the whole custard will move but there'll

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.699 
the whole custard will move but there'll
be<00:03:47.610> no<00:03:47.880> soft<00:03:48.720> spot<00:03:48.959> in<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.200> center<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.620> can

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
be no soft spot in the center you can

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.890 
be no soft spot in the center you can
see<00:03:49.920> now<00:03:50.100> cool<00:03:50.760> them<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:51.239> they'll<00:03:51.570> chill<00:03:51.750> them

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
see now cool them and they'll chill them

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.509 
see now cool them and they'll chill them
overnight<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:52.560> they'll<00:03:52.890> end<00:03:53.040> up<00:03:53.130> just<00:03:53.400> like

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
overnight and they'll end up just like

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.630 
overnight and they'll end up just like
this<00:03:53.700> one<00:03:53.850> here<00:03:54.530> so<00:03:55.530> they're<00:03:55.680> quite<00:03:55.980> firm<00:03:56.340> but

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
this one here so they're quite firm but

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.130 
this one here so they're quite firm but
underneath<00:03:56.850> you<00:03:57.180> can<00:03:57.299> just<00:03:57.540> see<00:03:57.660> that<00:03:57.780> wobble

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
underneath you can just see that wobble

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.370 
underneath you can just see that wobble
still<00:03:58.970> now<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.030> secret<00:04:00.510> this<00:04:00.600> topping<00:04:01.019> is<00:04:01.170> not

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
still now the secret this topping is not

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.340 
still now the secret this topping is not
to<00:04:01.500> put<00:04:01.620> too<00:04:01.650> much<00:04:01.950> sugar<00:04:02.010> on<00:04:02.660> so<00:04:03.660> i'm<00:04:04.079> going<00:04:04.290> to

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
to put too much sugar on so i'm going to

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.819 
to put too much sugar on so i'm going to
put<00:04:04.410> on<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:04.799> this<00:04:04.950> first<00:04:05.940> one<00:04:06.209> oops<00:04:06.959> spoonful

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
put on to this first one oops spoonful

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.250 
put on to this first one oops spoonful
half<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.940> castor<00:04:09.420> sugar<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.900> then<00:04:09.989> just

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
half of castor sugar and then just

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.229 
half of castor sugar and then just
spread<00:04:10.620> them<00:04:10.799> out<00:04:10.980> of<00:04:11.040> your<00:04:11.130> finger<00:04:11.579> now<00:04:12.180> of

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
spread them out of your finger now of

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.370 
spread them out of your finger now of
course<00:04:12.329> you<00:04:12.570> don't<00:04:12.660> need<00:04:12.840> to<00:04:12.959> put<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.230> sugar

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
course you don't need to put the sugar

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.199 
course you don't need to put the sugar
topical<00:04:13.890> at<00:04:14.010> all<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:14.670> can<00:04:14.850> just<00:04:14.970> eat<00:04:15.090> them

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
topical at all you can just eat them

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.860 
topical at all you can just eat them
just<00:04:15.420> as<00:04:15.720> they<00:04:15.750> are<00:04:17.150> and<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.299> magic<00:04:18.720> of

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
just as they are and the magic of

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.539 
just as they are and the magic of
science<00:04:19.200> we<00:04:19.680> have<00:04:19.709> all<00:04:19.890> these<00:04:20.040> wonderful

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
science we have all these wonderful

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:27.500 
science we have all these wonderful
things<00:04:21.019> and<00:04:23.060> just<00:04:24.770> go<00:04:25.770> round<00:04:26.100> like<00:04:26.970> that<00:04:27.000> keep

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
things and just go round like that keep

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.240 
things and just go round like that keep
going<00:04:27.750> so<00:04:27.900> commercially<00:04:28.290> the<00:04:28.500> sugars<00:04:28.890> start

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
going so commercially the sugars start

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.120 
going so commercially the sugars start
to<00:04:29.430> melt<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:30.960> secret<00:04:31.380> is<00:04:31.560> to<00:04:31.710> keep<00:04:31.860> going

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
to melt and the secret is to keep going

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.340 
to melt and the secret is to keep going
round<00:04:32.250> don't<00:04:32.520> stay<00:04:32.729> in<00:04:32.760> one<00:04:32.850> place<00:04:33.260> what<00:04:34.260> we

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
round don't stay in one place what we

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.630 
round don't stay in one place what we
don't<00:04:34.500> want<00:04:34.620> to<00:04:34.800> do<00:04:34.979> is<00:04:35.820> burning<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.330> custard

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
don't want to do is burning the custard

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.510 
don't want to do is burning the custard
sugar<00:04:38.640> with<00:04:38.850> you

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
sugar with you

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.080 
sugar with you
start<00:04:40.479> to<00:04:40.629> come<00:04:40.780> together<00:04:40.930> /<00:04:41.379> bout<00:04:41.620> that<00:04:41.770> job

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
start to come together / bout that job

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.480 
start to come together / bout that job
globules<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:44.020> reason<00:04:44.259> why<00:04:44.319> do<00:04:44.379> two<00:04:44.830> layers<00:04:45.160> is

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
globules the reason why do two layers is

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.149 
globules the reason why do two layers is
you<00:04:45.639> get<00:04:45.789> a<00:04:45.819> much<00:04:46.000> finer<00:04:46.590> cross<00:04:47.590> to<00:04:47.830> it<00:04:47.979> if<00:04:48.099> you

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
you get a much finer cross to it if you

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.369 
you get a much finer cross to it if you
try<00:04:48.370> and<00:04:48.430> put<00:04:48.580> too<00:04:48.729> much<00:04:48.849> sugar<00:04:48.909> at<00:04:49.210> once<00:04:49.389> you

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:50.379 
try and put too much sugar at once you

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:54.629 
try and put too much sugar at once you
know<00:04:50.500> with<00:04:50.680> uncooked<00:04:51.220> sugar<00:04:51.610> so<00:04:53.400> touch<00:04:54.400> more

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
know with uncooked sugar so touch more

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.159 
know with uncooked sugar so touch more
sugar<00:04:54.940> here<00:04:57.000> you're<00:04:58.000> not<00:04:58.240> too<00:04:58.509> much<00:04:58.720> just<00:04:58.780> a

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
sugar here you're not too much just a

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.439 
sugar here you're not too much just a
little<00:04:59.770> and<00:05:00.400> then<00:05:00.430> you<00:05:00.849> repeat<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.300> process

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.449 
little and then you repeat the process

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:10.680 
little and then you repeat the process
again<00:05:02.940> you're<00:05:03.940> too<00:05:04.240> thin<00:05:04.270> layers<00:05:09.150> and<00:05:10.150> there

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
again you're too thin layers and there

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:17.300 
again you're too thin layers and there
they<00:05:10.840> are<00:05:11.430> compass<00:05:12.430> a<00:05:12.460> chill<00:05:12.789> up<00:05:12.819> and<00:05:14.819> yeah

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
they are compass a chill up and yeah

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.559 
they are compass a chill up and yeah
perfect<00:05:18.310> OPP<00:05:18.870> and<00:05:19.870> here<00:05:20.349> it<00:05:20.500> is<00:05:20.530> a<00:05:21.569> nice

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569 
perfect OPP and here it is a nice

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:30.089 
perfect OPP and here it is a nice
alternative<00:05:24.449> Christmas<00:05:25.449> Day<00:05:25.720> I<00:05:26.610> think<00:05:29.099> that

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099 
alternative Christmas Day I think that

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:33.979 
alternative Christmas Day I think that
crunch

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:33.989 

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:36.790 

there<00:05:34.989> we<00:05:35.079> go

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
there we go
