00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.090 
yeah so I picked up these earbuds mainly
because<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.390> needed<00:00:28.110> a<00:00:28.320> replacement<00:00:28.590> for<00:00:29.010> my

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
because I needed a replacement for my

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.580 
because I needed a replacement for my
other<00:00:29.220> ones<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.700> think<00:00:30.270> I<00:00:30.510> go<00:00:31.200> into<00:00:31.350> it<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
other ones I think I go into it the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.290 
other ones I think I go into it the
sauna<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.980> lot<00:00:32.220> when<00:00:32.400> I<00:00:32.460> work<00:00:32.640> out<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.060> I<00:00:33.120> work

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
sauna a lot when I work out and I work

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.480 
sauna a lot when I work out and I work
out<00:00:33.420> about<00:00:33.630> five<00:00:33.870> days<00:00:34.080> a<00:00:34.110> week<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:35.070> think

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:35.490 
out about five days a week so I think

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.260 
out about five days a week so I think
all<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.000> heat<00:00:36.680> got<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.860> them<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.190> they<00:00:39.000> failed

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
all the heat got to them and they failed

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.290 
all the heat got to them and they failed
eventually<00:00:40.640> not<00:00:41.640> surprised

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
eventually not surprised

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.780 
eventually not surprised
seems<00:00:42.510> like<00:00:42.660> earbuds<00:00:43.160> don't<00:00:44.160> really<00:00:44.370> last<00:00:44.550> me

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
seems like earbuds don't really last me

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.760 
seems like earbuds don't really last me
very<00:00:45.000> long<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.540> usually<00:00:46.020> tend<00:00:46.290> to<00:00:46.410> get<00:00:46.530> cheap

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
very long I usually tend to get cheap

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.460 
very long I usually tend to get cheap
ones<00:00:47.040> and<00:00:47.340> that's<00:00:47.460> probably<00:00:47.730> why<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:49.020> decided

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
ones and that's probably why I decided

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.830 
ones and that's probably why I decided
to<00:00:49.620> check<00:00:49.739> these<00:00:49.950> earbuds<00:00:50.820> out<00:00:51.210> from<00:00:51.450> your

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
to check these earbuds out from your

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.310 
to check these earbuds out from your
buds<00:00:52.050> they<00:00:53.010> inspire<00:00:53.340> three<00:00:53.520> hundred<00:00:54.320> mainly

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
buds they inspire three hundred mainly

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.350 
buds they inspire three hundred mainly
because<00:00:55.440> they<00:00:55.920> looked<00:00:56.250> cool<00:00:56.579> first<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.240> all

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
because they looked cool first of all

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.510 
because they looked cool first of all
and<00:00:57.720> they<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> really<00:00:58.860> cool<00:00:59.040> feature

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
and they have a really cool feature

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.560 
and they have a really cool feature
which<00:01:00.300> allows<00:01:00.630> the<00:01:00.900> ear<00:01:01.050> buds<00:01:01.290> to<00:01:02.570> connect

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
which allows the ear buds to connect

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.370 
which allows the ear buds to connect
together<00:01:04.309> magnetically<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:06.149> backs<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:07.229> see

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
together magnetically the backs you see

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.570 
together magnetically the backs you see
the<00:01:07.500> logo<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:11.509> it<00:01:12.509> helps<00:01:13.229> when<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.530> run<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.220> I

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the logo and it helps when I run and I

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.359 
the logo and it helps when I run and I
don't<00:01:14.610> need<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> earphones<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.410> can<00:01:17.220> just

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
don't need the earphones in I can just

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.680 
don't need the earphones in I can just
connect<00:01:17.640> them<00:01:17.759> put<00:01:18.240> them<00:01:18.330> around<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.660> neck

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
connect them put them around the neck

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.800 
connect them put them around the neck
and<00:01:19.590> they<00:01:19.830> don't<00:01:20.009> bounce<00:01:20.160> everywhere<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:20.970> for

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and they don't bounce everywhere so for

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.510 
and they don't bounce everywhere so for
me<00:01:21.899> it<00:01:22.020> works<00:01:22.200> pretty<00:01:22.350> well<00:01:22.470> I've<00:01:23.310> been<00:01:23.460> using

buds<00:02:03.450> made<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.720> pretty<00:02:04.790> economic<00:02:05.790> design<00:02:06.439> as

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
buds made a pretty economic design as

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.810 
buds made a pretty economic design as
you<00:02:07.560> can<00:02:07.619> see<00:02:07.830> in<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.100> in<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.489> videos<00:02:08.790> that

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
you can see in the in the videos that

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.430 
you can see in the in the videos that
the<00:02:09.690> ergonomics<00:02:10.940> on<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.420> way<00:02:12.510> they<00:02:12.660> built<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
the ergonomics on the way they built the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.970 
the ergonomics on the way they built the
ear<00:02:13.709> piece<00:02:14.239> was<00:02:15.239> really<00:02:15.540> cool<00:02:15.720> because<00:02:15.989> the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
ear piece was really cool because the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.190 
ear piece was really cool because the
actual<00:02:17.310> earbud<00:02:17.730> has<00:02:18.480> an<00:02:18.630> attachment<00:02:18.959> that

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
actual earbud has an attachment that

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.280 
actual earbud has an attachment that
goes<00:02:19.290> onto<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.130> attachment<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.290> part

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
goes onto it the attachment is the part

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.990 
goes onto it the attachment is the part
which<00:02:22.560> actually<00:02:22.980> goes<00:02:23.130> into<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.489> ear<00:02:23.579> canal

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
which actually goes into the ear canal

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.259 
which actually goes into the ear canal
and<00:02:24.959> it<00:02:25.560> tells<00:02:25.799> the<00:02:26.100> sound<00:02:26.370> from<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.880> earbud

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
and it tells the sound from the earbud

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.080 
and it tells the sound from the earbud
which<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:28.079> really<00:02:28.320> cool<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.950> box<00:02:29.670> comes<00:02:30.000> with

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
smaller they worked really good really

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.330 
smaller they worked really good really
really<00:02:49.850> good<00:02:50.210> like<00:02:51.080> I<00:02:51.200> said<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.440> comes<00:02:52.160> with<00:02:52.310> a

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
really good like I said I comes with a

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.100 
really good like I said I comes with a
small<00:02:52.670> little<00:02:52.940> carrying<00:02:53.180> pouch<00:02:53.240> but<00:02:53.750> you<00:02:53.960> know

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
small little carrying pouch but you know

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.930 
small little carrying pouch but you know
I<00:02:54.140> don't<00:02:54.230> really<00:02:54.380> use<00:02:54.650> those<00:02:54.890> but<00:02:55.610> pretty<00:02:55.820> much

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
I don't really use those but pretty much

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.250 
I don't really use those but pretty much
with<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.270> reason<00:02:56.660> why<00:02:56.780> I<00:02:56.810> like<00:02:56.960> it<00:02:56.990> it's

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
with the reason why I like it it's

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.400 
with the reason why I like it it's
because<00:02:57.470> it's<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.830> sweat<00:02:58.160> proof<00:02:59.050> and<00:03:00.050> liquid

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
because it's a sweat proof and liquid

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.260 
because it's a sweat proof and liquid
proof<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:01.100> they're<00:03:01.640> really<00:03:01.970> really

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
proof and they're really really

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.960 
proof and they're really really
comfortable<00:03:02.830> like<00:03:03.830> I<00:03:03.890> said<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.070> run<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.430> lot<00:03:04.670> and
