what<00:00:25.490> what<00:00:25.730> I<00:00:25.760> would<00:00:25.910> consider<00:00:26.090> our<00:00:26.630> our<00:00:27.290> lower

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
what what I would consider our our lower

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.700 
what what I would consider our our lower
pricepoint<00:00:28.070> spinning<00:00:28.790> real<00:00:29.230> still<00:00:30.230> still

pricepoint spinning real still still

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.250 
pricepoint spinning real still still
very<00:00:30.950> high<00:00:31.130> quality<00:00:31.189> spinning<00:00:31.910> real<00:00:32.119> this<00:00:33.050> is

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
very high quality spinning real this is

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.850 
very high quality spinning real this is
the<00:00:34.450> second<00:00:35.450> version<00:00:35.600> of<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:35.990> pursuit<00:00:36.380> we've

the second version of the pursuit we've
made<00:00:37.040> some<00:00:37.190> improvements<00:00:37.430> over<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:38.000> first

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
made some improvements over the first

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.810 
made some improvements over the first
generation<00:00:38.720> so<00:00:39.050> what<00:00:39.560> we<00:00:39.680> have<00:00:39.829> here<00:00:40.130> is<00:00:40.310> a

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
generation so what we have here is a

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.720 
generation so what we have here is a
graphite<00:00:41.420> body<00:00:41.690> a<00:00:42.020> metal<00:00:42.680> side<00:00:42.890> plate<00:00:43.220> and<00:00:43.489> a

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
graphite body a metal side plate and a

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.599 
graphite body a metal side plate and a
graphite<00:00:44.120> rotor<00:00:44.470> we<00:00:45.470> also<00:00:45.620> have<00:00:46.070> added<00:00:46.489> the

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:46.609 
graphite rotor we also have added the

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:49.389 
graphite rotor we also have added the
line<00:00:46.789> capacity<00:00:47.359> rings<00:00:47.600> onto<00:00:48.109> the<00:00:48.230> spool<00:00:48.500> we

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
line capacity rings onto the spool we

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.490 
line capacity rings onto the spool we
have<00:00:49.489> a<00:00:49.550> thick<00:00:49.760> bail<00:00:49.969> wire<00:00:50.210> so<00:00:51.109> something

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
have a thick bail wire so something

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.200 
have a thick bail wire so something
you'll<00:00:51.649> see<00:00:51.859> on<00:00:51.980> all<00:00:52.190> pen<00:00:52.730> spinning<00:00:52.940> reels

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
you'll see on all pen spinning reels

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.599 
you'll see on all pen spinning reels
going<00:00:53.480> forward<00:00:53.809> is<00:00:53.899> the<00:00:54.050> thick<00:00:54.230> bail<00:00:54.440> wire<00:00:54.680> now

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
going forward is the thick bail wire now

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.549 
going forward is the thick bail wire now
we've<00:00:55.789> upgraded<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.359> handle<00:00:56.629> knobs<00:00:56.809> you<00:00:57.050> can

see on this this is a 6000 size here we

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.889 
see on this this is a 6000 size here we
have<00:01:00.230> what<00:01:00.649> we<00:01:00.710> call<00:01:00.859> our<00:01:00.920> football<00:01:01.280> mini<00:01:02.000> we

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
have what we call our football mini we

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.720 
have what we call our football mini we
do<00:01:03.289> a<00:01:03.320> paddle<00:01:03.739> knob<00:01:03.920> on<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.160> three<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:04.460> four

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
do a paddle knob on the three and four

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.610 
do a paddle knob on the three and four
thousand<00:01:05.239> then<00:01:05.420> we<00:01:05.510> do<00:01:05.660> the<00:01:05.810> football<00:01:06.020> mini<00:01:06.410> on

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
thousand then we do the football mini on

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.580 
thousand then we do the football mini on
the<00:01:06.940> five<00:01:07.940> and<00:01:08.150> six<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.630> then<00:01:09.170> we<00:01:09.200> go<00:01:09.380> up<00:01:09.470> to

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
the five and six and then we go up to

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.590 
the five and six and then we go up to
the<00:01:09.710> football<00:01:10.040> jr.<00:01:10.430> on<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.580> biggest<00:01:10.970> 8000
