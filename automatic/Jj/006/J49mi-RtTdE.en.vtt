no<00:00:03.570> recording<00:00:04.310> right<00:00:05.310> so<00:00:05.549> this<00:00:05.670> is<00:00:05.730> kismet<00:00:06.390> and

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
no recording right so this is kismet and

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.980 
no recording right so this is kismet and
he's<00:00:06.750> going<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.080> demonstrate<00:00:07.350> how<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.099> test

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
he's going to demonstrate how to test

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.370 
he's going to demonstrate how to test
blood<00:00:09.990> glucose<00:00:10.590> in<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:11.099> cath<00:00:11.780> so<00:00:12.780> here<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.170> have

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
blood glucose in a cath so here you have

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.700 
blood glucose in a cath so here you have
your<00:00:13.730> testing<00:00:14.730> kit<00:00:15.000> this<00:00:15.750> came<00:00:16.109> with<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.320> rely

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
your testing kit this came with the rely

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.480 
your testing kit this came with the rely
on<00:00:16.740> Prime<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.520> came<00:00:18.000> with<00:00:18.380> the<00:00:19.380> test<00:00:19.890> meter<00:00:20.160> and

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
on Prime it came with the test meter and

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.900 
on Prime it came with the test meter and
this<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.769> Lancet<00:00:22.769> pen<00:00:23.010> but<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.369> removed<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
this is a Lancet pen but I removed the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.420 
this is a Lancet pen but I removed the
top<00:00:24.150> because<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.660> don't<00:00:25.019> necessarily<00:00:25.859> want

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
top because you don't necessarily want

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.290 
top because you don't necessarily want
to<00:00:26.699> use<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:29.029> release<00:00:30.029> because<00:00:31.019> um<00:00:32.149> it's<00:00:33.149> not

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
to use the release because um it's not

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.240 
to use the release because um it's not
necessary<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:34.050> there<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.410> might<00:00:34.770> hurt<00:00:35.010> their

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
necessary in there it might hurt their

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.910 
necessary in there it might hurt their
ears<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.300> noise<00:00:36.780> garrison<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.559> take<00:00:37.800> it

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
ears and the noise garrison so I take it

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.569 
ears and the noise garrison so I take it
off<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.340> just<00:00:38.579> put<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:40.800> Lance<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:42.440> and

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
off and I just put the the Lance in and

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.580 
off and I just put the the Lance in and
here<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.910> my<00:00:45.210> kit<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.690> keep<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.230> thing<00:00:46.469> of
