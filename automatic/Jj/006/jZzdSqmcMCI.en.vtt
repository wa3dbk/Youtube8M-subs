00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.420
 the next thing he is not again 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.529
 a great fish recipes main goal 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.520
 brought along beautiful salmon trout 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.349
 many from austria and we will 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.869
 to prepare on the whole and that gives a lot 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.309
 great way to do it 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.650
 I brought Zidan planks there 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.690
 original sank who now 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.370
 water introduced so then when one 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.170
 it on the kehler do not give 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.390
 you have to start burning yourself 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.550
 know up to two hours before and up 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.860
 this coinage that was concert can 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.180
 he soft or break one is one 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.890
 this was ever used 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.930
 the economy is still on 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.239
 We will now be using these boards 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.609
 Salmon trout have much to prepare 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.250
 quite simply, we take these 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.559
 title here give to these boards at 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.710
 a bit of olive oil on that 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.539
 the fish does not stick 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.289
 Bisserl distribute it and then put 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:16.800
 we put on each board single fish fillet 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:19.170
 on it and thus makes the first step 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.569
 whether now the fish always stays there 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.940
 This level is better for the guest 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:25.890
 We will become the city ​​hall 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.590
 portioning this fish will be one 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:37.050
 lime and lime fast 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:39.569
 just finally narrow stripes around 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.190
 there's the fish on the tens 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.880
 naked portioned on it should one 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.050
 beautiful salmon trout many weeks or 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.550
 formations is important meanwhile 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.979
 completely cut through but only one 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.569
 cut to the skin but with it 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.880
 knife rheinfahrt trailer wrote 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.950
 so that the fish needs it 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.190
 be cut completely then you give 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:03.179
 just in this interface to 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:06.569
 lime sports and that marks then 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.709
 exactly this sollbruchstelle or each 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.450
 portions catches it again 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:13.379
 the fish is now seasoned with 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:18.300
 bit of salt and pepper very short 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:19.980
 Spice it with the mill and go over it 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.349
 so that the whole then as a beautiful picture 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.299
 get everything on the table is coming 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.730
 We now because a confident the 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.709
 is now better prepared in the mix 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.100
 The mixer comes a certain freshness 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.630
 beta 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.970
 I hacked for a short time then 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.700
 a group on teeth comes quickly 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.910
 very short 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.830
 up to a few pieces then one 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.990
 mustard crust for the second and mustard 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.140
 on the one hand have so far fiery 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:57.090
 must work in the future for this doubt 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:59.940
 is stronger or apache license and 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.680
 so it does not get too sharp then one 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.290
 add second place mustard 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.500
 tobi is a pumpkin kerns ems the a 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.490
 Bit by bit the Styrian again 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.950
 The pumpkin seeds break through 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.050
 and of course a bit sweeter and 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.870
 then the crust is not allowed to 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.330
 harm the sweet we go, of course 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.540
 All this we go just a little bit of 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.160
 honey about two tablespoons of honey 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.960
 then a bit of an abrasion of one 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.230
 lime and also the juice of lime 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.230
 to squeeze 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:44.250
 and, of course, on this amount of 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.000
 ca huelva there was no salt for what you got 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.530
 only the login 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:54.570
 the whole thing is now with the wand mixer 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:58.890
 briefly mixed and then with one 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:02.750
 bit of olive oil on mixed just that 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.750
 gives a good mutating mass 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.470
 the fish is prepared for the 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.680
 wood boards on it and this is then 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.260
 this marinade and the opponent's goal 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.520
 relatively fed to the fish fillet for 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.459
 So you really can over one 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.989
 give it full power because it is 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.730
 gives a very good taste then 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.530
 maybe spread a bit 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.050
 The fish will now be there on the grill 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.030
 placed indirectly is very important of 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.470
 the duration of her circus is expected for 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.440
 this salmon want to lewis for albatross 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.560
 the han ca rolfs kilo apiece only once 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.300
 allow about 15 to 20 minutes 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.000
 and then my beautiful result 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.460
 The mustard crust has beautiful color 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.490
 dribbled lime time looking design 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:49.230
 a bit of show and guests need to 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.230
 to access and let them taste
