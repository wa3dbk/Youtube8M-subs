00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.160 
on your left in the circle so basically
if<00:02:10.440> Natasha<00:02:11.130> is<00:02:11.580> standing<00:02:11.940> on<00:02:12.030> my<00:02:12.150> right<00:02:12.450> we'll

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
if Natasha is standing on my right we'll

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.000 
if Natasha is standing on my right we'll
be<00:02:13.350> facing<00:02:13.590> each<00:02:13.830> other<00:02:14.930> pretty<00:02:15.930> much<00:02:16.230> on<00:02:16.440> the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
be facing each other pretty much on the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.300 
be facing each other pretty much on the
first<00:02:17.630> measure<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:19.110> on<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.380> one<00:02:19.709> two<00:02:19.980> three

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
first measure so on the one two three

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.520 
first measure so on the one two three
four<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.910> then<00:02:20.940> we'll<00:02:21.750> be<00:02:21.930> moving<00:02:22.140> back

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
four and then we'll be moving back

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.910 
four and then we'll be moving back
toward<00:02:23.130> each<00:02:23.280> other<00:02:23.489> so<00:02:24.030> just<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.420> first<00:02:24.920> four

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
toward each other so just the first four

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.060 
toward each other so just the first four
counts<00:02:26.069> go<00:02:26.400> five<00:02:27.090> six<00:02:27.170> seven<00:02:28.170> eight<00:02:28.320> one<00:02:28.410> two

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
counts go five six seven eight one two

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.390 
counts go five six seven eight one two
three<00:02:29.220> four<00:02:29.580> five<00:02:30.330> six<00:02:30.720> seven<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.380> then<00:02:32.220> we're

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
three four five six seven and then we're

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.780 
three four five six seven and then we're
back<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.640> back<00:02:33.860> from<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.070> for<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.400> second

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
back to back from that for the second

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.590 
back to back from that for the second
eight<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:37.160> boogie<00:02:38.160> backs<00:02:38.370> leaders<00:02:39.239> will

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
eight of the boogie backs leaders will

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.220 
eight of the boogie backs leaders will
be<00:02:39.630> keeping<00:02:40.050> exactly<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.769> same<00:02:41.750> footwork<00:02:42.750> so
