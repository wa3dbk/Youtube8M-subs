00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.010 

just<00:00:01.230> a<00:00:01.350> quick<00:00:01.530> explanation<00:00:01.829> of<00:00:02.280> kerfing

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:03.020 
just a quick explanation of kerfing

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.869 
just a quick explanation of kerfing
kerfing<00:00:04.020> is<00:00:04.410> when<00:00:04.680> you<00:00:04.830> make<00:00:05.339> cuts<00:00:05.640> into<00:00:05.850> a

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
kerfing is when you make cuts into a

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.600 
kerfing is when you make cuts into a
board<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.359> make<00:00:06.480> it<00:00:06.540> able<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.560> bend<00:00:07.799> at<00:00:08.040> an

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
board to make it able to bend at an

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.770 
board to make it able to bend at an
angle<00:00:09.320> usually<00:00:10.550> usually<00:00:11.550> 90<00:00:11.969> degrees<00:00:12.330> because

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
angle usually usually 90 degrees because

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.930 
angle usually usually 90 degrees because
180<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.500> lot<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.769> cuts<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.370> lot<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.730> course

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
180 is a lot of cuts a lot of course

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.920 
180 is a lot of cuts a lot of course
togethers<00:00:15.330> but<00:00:16.699> basically<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.850> take<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.420> board

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
togethers but basically you take a board

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.140 
togethers but basically you take a board
and<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:20.010> see<00:00:20.130> how<00:00:20.220> has<00:00:20.430> all<00:00:20.550> these<00:00:20.670> cuts<00:00:20.910> but

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
and you see how has all these cuts but

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.460 
and you see how has all these cuts but
it's<00:00:21.270> still<00:00:21.390> together

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
it's still together

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.720 
it's still together
when<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.519> set<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> saw<00:00:24.529> about<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.859> sixteenth

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
when you set the saw about a sixteenth

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.009 
when you set the saw about a sixteenth
away<00:00:26.939> from<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.210> edge<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.420> can<00:00:27.449> see<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.840> you

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
away from the edge you can see that you

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.269 
away from the edge you can see that you
know<00:00:28.140> some<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.439> these<00:00:28.560> aren't<00:00:28.769> all<00:00:28.890> lined<00:00:29.099> up

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
know some of these aren't all lined up

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.279 
know some of these aren't all lined up
that's<00:00:29.880> because<00:00:30.179> like<00:00:30.420> sometimes<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:31.019> started

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
that's because like sometimes I started

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.930 
that's because like sometimes I started
from<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> other<00:00:31.650> end<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.399> just<00:00:32.610> did<00:00:32.759> this

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
from the other end and we just did this

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.510 
from the other end and we just did this
to<00:00:33.180> throw<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.510> together<00:00:33.630> for<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.110> video<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:35.219> um

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
to throw it together for the video so um

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.190 
to throw it together for the video so um
when<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.149> got<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.570> end<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.780> would<00:00:36.840> just<00:00:36.989> pull

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
when I got to the end I would just pull

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.020 
when I got to the end I would just pull
up<00:00:37.230> on<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.559> not<00:00:37.860> really<00:00:38.040> worry<00:00:38.280> about<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.700> but

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
up on it not really worry about it but

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.430 
up on it not really worry about it but
if<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.570> were<00:00:39.660> doing<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.050> know<00:00:40.170> make<00:00:40.410> sure

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
if you were doing it you know make sure

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.040 
if you were doing it you know make sure
you<00:00:40.590> follow<00:00:40.829> through<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> cut<00:00:41.660> but<00:00:42.660> um<00:00:43.579> and

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
you follow through on the cut but um and

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.720 
you follow through on the cut but um and
dang<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.200> felt<00:00:46.410> bright<00:00:46.680> once<00:00:46.950> there<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.219> go<00:00:47.370> um

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
dang it felt bright once there we go um

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.319 
dang it felt bright once there we go um
so<00:00:48.450> yeah<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.719> can<00:00:49.110> make<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> cut<00:00:49.559> um<00:00:50.460> we<00:00:51.059> didn't

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
so yeah you can make a cut um we didn't

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.090 
so yeah you can make a cut um we didn't
draw<00:00:51.629> any<00:00:51.809> lines<00:00:52.050> for<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.440> because<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:53.070> I

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
draw any lines for this because like I

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.439 
draw any lines for this because like I
said<00:00:53.340> we're<00:00:53.489> just<00:00:53.640> sewing<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.910> together<00:00:54.000> but

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
said we're just sewing it together but

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.689 
said we're just sewing it together but
usually<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.469> know<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.680> take<00:00:56.010> yourself<00:00:56.430> or

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
usually you know you take yourself or

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.090 
usually you know you take yourself or
your<00:00:56.969> pencil<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.480> draw<00:00:57.690> lines<00:00:57.930> every<00:00:58.859> so

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
your pencil and you draw lines every so

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.240 
your pencil and you draw lines every so
far<00:00:59.340> apart<00:00:59.609> closer<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.140> more<00:01:01.379> little<00:01:01.800> easier

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
far apart closer the more little easier

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.399 
far apart closer the more little easier
Bend<00:01:02.640> less<00:01:02.879> cut<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.149> have<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.329> make<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:04.350> also

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
Bend less cut you have to make but also

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.230 
Bend less cut you have to make but also
you<00:01:04.619> don't<00:01:04.769> need<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.220> close<00:01:05.460> where<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.119> know

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
you don't need to close where you know

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.390 
you don't need to close where you know
you<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.080> break<00:01:07.380> out<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.799> there<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.040> whatnot

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
you just break out of there and whatnot

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.670 
you just break out of there and whatnot
so<00:01:08.750> basically<00:01:12.049> once<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.170> make<00:01:13.320> these<00:01:13.470> cuts

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
so basically once you make these cuts

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.830 
so basically once you make these cuts
this<00:01:14.369> end<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> little<00:01:14.970> bendable<00:01:15.659> because

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
this end is a little bendable because

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.649 
this end is a little bendable because
MDF<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.619> just<00:01:16.890> about<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.250> like<00:01:17.850> fibers<00:01:18.360> like

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
MDF is just about to like fibers like

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.630 
MDF is just about to like fibers like
it's<00:01:18.930> basically<00:01:19.200> compressed<00:01:19.650> solid<00:01:19.979> sawdust

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
it's basically compressed solid sawdust

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.460 
it's basically compressed solid sawdust
so<00:01:21.630> we<00:01:21.869> hold<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.170> margin<00:01:23.810> so<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:25.320> take

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
so we hold this margin so you can take

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.030 
so we hold this margin so you can take
the<00:01:25.619> wood<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.780> bend<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.080> pretty<00:01:28.950> much

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the wood and bend to it pretty much

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.969 
the wood and bend to it pretty much
another<00:01:29.310> degree<00:01:29.490> well<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.119> mean<00:01:30.619> what<00:01:31.619> more<00:01:31.829> can

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
another degree well I mean what more can

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.990 
another degree well I mean what more can
you<00:01:32.070> ask<00:01:32.130> out<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.700> piece<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.909> wood<00:01:34.460> but<00:01:35.460> yeah

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
you ask out of a piece of wood but yeah

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.670 
you ask out of a piece of wood but yeah
that's<00:01:36.240> pretty<00:01:36.390> much<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.689> just<00:01:37.290> make<00:01:37.530> your

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
that's pretty much it just make your

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.670 
that's pretty much it just make your
cuts<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:39.210> can<00:01:39.509> bend<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.810> there's<00:01:40.320> mass

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
cuts and you can bend it there's mass

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.620 
cuts and you can bend it there's mass
involved<00:01:41.310> if<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.640> actually<00:01:41.880> are<00:01:42.210> going<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.479> do

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
involved if you actually are going to do

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.010 
involved if you actually are going to do
this

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
this

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.550 
this
um<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:44.509> personally<00:01:45.509> do<00:01:45.689> not<00:01:45.720> know<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.140> math<00:01:46.350> I

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
um I personally do not know the math I

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.819 
um I personally do not know the math I
just<00:01:46.890> make<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> cut<00:01:47.939> bend<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.079> or<00:01:49.290> make<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> couple

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
just make a cut bend it or make a couple

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.090 
just make a cut bend it or make a couple
cuts<00:01:50.040> bend<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.880> then<00:01:51.210> see<00:01:51.810> how<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.860> how

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
cuts bend it and then see how like how

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.160 
cuts bend it and then see how like how
far<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.369> can<00:01:53.549> get<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.700> demand<00:01:54.060> without<00:01:54.810> like

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
far I can get a demand without like

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.350 
far I can get a demand without like
breaking<00:01:55.439> or<00:01:55.710> nothing<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.159> then<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:57.180> make

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
breaking or nothing and then like make

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.120 
breaking or nothing and then like make
another<00:01:57.630> cut<00:01:57.899> couple<00:01:58.409> cuts<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.829> just<00:01:58.979> keep

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
another cut couple cuts and just keep

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.319 
another cut couple cuts and just keep
doing<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.490> till<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.759> get<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.000> where<00:02:00.240> you

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
doing that till you get to where you

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.499 
doing that till you get to where you
need<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.570> be<00:02:00.799> and<00:02:01.909> if<00:02:02.909> you're<00:02:03.090> going<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.329> do

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
need to be and if you're going to do

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.530 
need to be and if you're going to do
this<00:02:03.719> on<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> pork<00:02:04.530> or<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.860> box<00:02:05.509> subwoofer<00:02:06.509> box

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
this on a pork or a box subwoofer box

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.249 
this on a pork or a box subwoofer box
then<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.520> can't<00:02:08.520> just<00:02:08.580> add<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.179> support<00:02:09.750> and

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
then you can't just add the support and

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.750 
then you can't just add the support and
the<00:02:10.349> front<00:02:10.619> wall<00:02:10.739> together<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.310> expect<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.700> to

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
the front wall together and expect it to

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.979 
the front wall together and expect it to
bin<00:02:11.970> because

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
bin because

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.599 
bin because
because<00:02:13.439> you're<00:02:13.680> curving<00:02:14.159> it<00:02:14.310> instead<00:02:14.549> of

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:14.609 
because you're curving it instead of

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:16.610 
because you're curving it instead of
making<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.150> straight<00:02:15.420> corner<00:02:15.810> it's<00:02:16.349> going<00:02:16.560> to

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
making a straight corner it's going to

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.030 
making a straight corner it's going to
cut<00:02:16.890> off<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.099> few<00:02:17.640> inches<00:02:18.290> like<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.829> right

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
cut off a few inches like this right

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.330 
cut off a few inches like this right
here<00:02:20.489> is<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.510> many<00:02:21.689> inches<00:02:21.810> but<00:02:22.500> if<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.769> skip

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
here is so many inches but if you skip

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.349 
here is so many inches but if you skip
that<00:02:23.519> part<00:02:23.579> right<00:02:23.849> there<00:02:23.909> you're<00:02:24.209> going<00:02:24.299> to

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
that part right there you're going to

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.420 
that part right there you're going to
cut<00:02:24.569> off<00:02:24.719> you<00:02:24.870> know<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.019> little<00:02:25.290> distance<00:02:25.680> so

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
cut off you know a little distance so

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.699 
cut off you know a little distance so
you<00:02:26.489> actually<00:02:26.969> have<00:02:27.269> to<00:02:27.390> measure<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.349> up<00:02:28.500> and

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
you actually have to measure it up and

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.030 
you actually have to measure it up and
trim<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.060> afterwards<00:02:30.500> unless<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.680> actually

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
trim it afterwards unless you actually

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.599 
trim it afterwards unless you actually
math<00:02:32.370> but<00:02:32.879> if<00:02:33.510> this<00:02:33.629> is<00:02:33.780> our<00:02:34.049> ghetto<00:02:34.609> redneck

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
math but if this is our ghetto redneck

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:39.079 
math but if this is our ghetto redneck
way<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.120> there<00:02:36.930> we<00:02:37.019> go
