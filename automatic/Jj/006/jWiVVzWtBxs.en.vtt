 parts of this object are different materials for 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.240
 let's create this box 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:39.600
 the parameters have made these tones square 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:42.239
 moan table there is a square turn on 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.170
 of his section pressing us musk hogwarts and 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.170
 choosing ajetrays 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.489
 let's choose a section 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.489
 3 3 by 3 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:02.060
 so now we need to change 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.850
 its separate polygon under this 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.880
 squares and not defecation he her numbers 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.530
 that is, how will 3d max remember on 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.380
 which squares which colors should 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.290
 were now pushing means on our box 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.080
 right click select item 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:21.170
 envelope and envelope it was a field now 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.050
 this is our editable polygon and click 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.490
 key 4 or select polygons in 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:32.479
 the parameters of this object and start me 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:37.430
 let's say you chose this polygon down 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:45.110
 lower to point material sayid eset go 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:50.330
 we press we admit we press we admit units 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:55.610
 let's give it so let's give a deuce of it let 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:02:08.420
 there are three to this four 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:15.600
 five and six so in order all 8 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:19.890
 9 there is now go material editor 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.950
 pressing the m key opens our window 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.100
 and now create not standard material 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.230
 a multi boot jack which allows 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.860
 lay several materials on one 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.150
 the object does not click twice and as you can see
