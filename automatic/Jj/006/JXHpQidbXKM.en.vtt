00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.299 
it's a question that pretty much the
entire<00:00:33.660> security<00:00:34.380> community<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.980> still

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
entire security community is still

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.090 
entire security community is still
wondering<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.690> had<00:00:37.410> nobody's<00:00:37.739> really<00:00:37.860> come

up with an answer as far as how to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.869 
up with an answer as far as how to
secure<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.290> windows<00:00:40.829> machine<00:00:40.860> no<00:00:41.579> they<00:00:41.700> don't

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
secure a windows machine no they don't

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.840 
secure a windows machine no they don't
make<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.090> easy<00:00:42.210> um<00:00:43.100> no<00:00:44.100> people<00:00:44.460> want<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.730> get

make it easy um no people want to get
give<00:00:45.390> windows<00:00:45.750> hell<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.280> mean<00:00:47.700> there's

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.330 
give windows hell but I mean there's
some<00:00:48.059> basic<00:00:48.480> security<00:00:49.110> practices<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:50.190> can

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
some basic security practices you can

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.819 
some basic security practices you can
follow<00:00:50.600> you<00:00:51.600> know<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> lot<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.020> times<00:00:52.289> it's<00:00:52.649> not

follow you know a lot of times it's not

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.920 
follow you know a lot of times it's not
necessarily<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.699> operating<00:00:54.539> system<00:00:54.809> you're

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
necessarily the operating system you're

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.420 
necessarily the operating system you're
on<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.530> services<00:00:56.010> you're<00:00:56.160> running

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
on it's a services you're running

on it's a services you're running
programs<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.239> you're<00:00:57.329> running<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.690> mean

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
programs that you're running I mean

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.110 
programs that you're running I mean
Linux<00:00:58.410> can<00:00:58.590> be<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.920> as<00:00:59.039> insecure<00:00:59.430> as<00:00:59.640> windows

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
Linux can be just as insecure as windows

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.720 
Linux can be just as insecure as windows
it's<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.170> way<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.649> it's<00:01:01.829> exactly<00:01:02.489> and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
it's just the way that it's exactly and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.460 
it's just the way that it's exactly and
I<00:01:03.000> mean<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> big<00:01:03.420> problem<00:01:03.840> with<00:01:03.930> windows<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
I mean the big problem with windows the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.750 
I mean the big problem with windows the
biggest<00:01:04.799> problem<00:01:05.070> with<00:01:05.159> Windows<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.610> that

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
biggest problem with Windows is that

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.060 
biggest problem with Windows is that
when<00:01:06.270> an<00:01:06.390> exploit<00:01:06.840> or<00:01:07.020> vulnerability<00:01:07.680> comes

that's going to be on the second tuesday
of<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.229> month<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.580> know<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.880> case<00:01:24.119> of

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
of the month so you know in the case of

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.789 
of the month so you know in the case of
the<00:01:24.330> wmf<00:01:24.780> exploit<00:01:25.140> i<00:01:25.229> think<00:01:25.380> they<00:01:25.439> released<00:01:25.710> it

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the wmf exploit i think they released it

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.350 
the wmf exploit i think they released it
a<00:01:25.860> little<00:01:25.979> bit<00:01:26.130> early<00:01:26.430> because<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
a little bit early because of the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.450 
a little bit early because of the
severity<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.049> attack<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:28.619> nevertheless

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
severity of the attack but nevertheless

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.789 
severity of the attack but nevertheless
you're<00:01:30.360> still<00:01:30.659> dependent<00:01:31.020> upon<00:01:31.110> them<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.740> i

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
you're still dependent upon them and i

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.230 
you're still dependent upon them and i
think<00:01:32.009> that's<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.310> problem<00:01:32.430> that's<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
think that's the problem that's the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.460 
think that's the problem that's the
thing<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.479> really<00:01:33.600> turns<00:01:33.900> off<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> lot<00:01:34.350> of

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
thing that really turns off a lot of

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.950 
thing that really turns off a lot of
security<00:01:34.680> consultants<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:36.479> know<00:01:36.600> people

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
security consultants and you know people

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.469 
security consultants and you know people
are<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.860> know<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.369> note<00:01:38.549> as<00:01:39.210> far<00:01:39.390> as

the beautiful thing about penetration

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.729 
the beautiful thing about penetration
testing<00:04:16.139> is<00:04:16.349> the<00:04:16.829> fact<00:04:17.070> that<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.489> know<00:04:18.229> if<00:04:19.229> you

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
testing is the fact that you know if you

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.440 
testing is the fact that you know if you

can't actually penetrate the box

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.240 
can't actually penetrate the box
yourself<00:04:21.599> it's<00:04:22.229> probably<00:04:22.590> not<00:04:22.740> you<00:04:23.010> know<00:04:23.039> the

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
yourself it's probably not you know the

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.110 
yourself it's probably not you know the
crucial<00:04:23.729> vulnerability<00:04:24.690> you<00:04:24.900> know

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
crucial vulnerability you know

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.879 
crucial vulnerability you know
oftentimes<00:04:25.419> the<00:04:25.810> biggest<00:04:26.320> vulnerabilities

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
oftentimes the biggest vulnerabilities

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.830 
oftentimes the biggest vulnerabilities
are<00:04:27.100> the<00:04:27.460> ones<00:04:27.610> that<00:04:27.669> are<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.240> easiest<00:04:28.660> to

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
are the ones that are the easiest to

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.230 
are the ones that are the easiest to
perform<00:04:29.260> like<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:29.919> wmf<00:04:30.400> exploit<00:04:30.820> as<00:04:31.000> soon<00:04:31.180> as

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
perform like the wmf exploit as soon as

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.780 
perform like the wmf exploit as soon as
it<00:04:31.360> came<00:04:31.479> out<00:04:31.690> I<00:04:31.900> mean<00:04:32.350> everybody<00:04:33.340> could<00:04:33.550> do<00:04:33.669> it

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
it came out I mean everybody could do it

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.140 
it came out I mean everybody could do it
because<00:04:34.030> it's<00:04:34.180> so<00:04:34.419> easy<00:04:35.310> so<00:04:36.310> that's<00:04:36.880> why<00:04:37.000> don't

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
because it's so easy so that's why don't

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.430 
because it's so easy so that's why don't
really<00:04:37.300> like<00:04:37.479> I<00:04:37.720> don't<00:04:37.780> really<00:04:38.290> like

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
really like I don't really like

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.840 
really like I don't really like

they<00:04:39.970> go<00:04:40.060> it's<00:04:40.240> really<00:04:40.510> great<00:04:40.750> there's<00:04:41.290> no<00:04:41.470> way

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
they go it's really great there's no way

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.070 
they go it's really great there's no way
to<00:04:41.940> secure<00:04:42.940> a<00:04:42.970> computer<00:04:43.540> because<00:04:43.690> at<00:04:43.900> any

to secure a computer because at any

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.420 
to secure a computer because at any
point<00:04:44.410> you<00:04:44.590> never<00:04:44.860> know<00:04:45.070> when<00:04:45.220> a<00:04:45.250> new

vulnerability<00:04:45.970> will<00:04:46.060> come<00:04:46.180> out<00:04:46.330> or<00:04:47.169> which

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
vulnerability will come out or which

ones are out that are not public right
but<00:04:50.020> this<00:04:50.110> monogram<00:04:50.500> is<00:04:50.590> a<00:04:50.620> great<00:04:50.800> way<00:04:50.889> to

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
but this monogram is a great way to

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
mean you could read you know you could

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.800 
mean you could read you know you could
spend<00:06:08.110> like<00:06:08.919> weekends<00:06:09.669> reading<00:06:10.120> white<00:06:10.360> papers

on<00:06:11.169> best<00:06:11.620> security<00:06:12.010> practices<00:06:12.400> what<00:06:13.000> when<00:06:13.389> it

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 
on best security practices what when it

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:16.589 
on best security practices what when it
all<00:06:13.570> boils<00:06:13.780> down<00:06:14.020> to<00:06:14.349> it<00:06:14.940> most<00:06:15.940> likely<00:06:16.240> if<00:06:16.510> you

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 
all boils down to it most likely if you

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:18.510 
all boils down to it most likely if you
run<00:06:16.780> a<00:06:16.810> home<00:06:17.050> network<00:06:17.430> nobody's<00:06:18.430> really

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
run a home network nobody's really

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.370 
run a home network nobody's really
interested<00:06:18.610> in<00:06:19.120> what<00:06:19.300> your<00:06:19.419> computer<00:06:19.840> has<00:06:20.020> you

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
interested in what your computer has you

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.450 
interested in what your computer has you
know<00:06:20.470> I<00:06:20.500> mean<00:06:20.650> though<00:06:20.770> he's<00:06:20.889> gonna<00:06:21.070> be<00:06:21.160> trying

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
know I mean though he's gonna be trying

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.420 
know I mean though he's gonna be trying
to<00:06:21.580> break<00:06:21.910> it<00:06:22.180> I<00:06:22.360> had<00:06:22.750> to<00:06:22.870> say<00:06:23.050> it<00:06:23.199> but<00:06:23.650> I<00:06:24.190> mean

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
to break it I had to say it but I mean

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.100 
to break it I had to say it but I mean
most<00:06:24.699> likely<00:06:25.150> nobody<00:06:25.449> really<00:06:25.599> cares<00:06:25.840> what's

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
most likely nobody really cares what's

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.300 
most likely nobody really cares what's
on<00:06:26.260> your<00:06:26.380> computer<00:06:26.770> and<00:06:26.949> they<00:06:27.039> really<00:06:27.280> don't

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
on your computer and they really don't
