00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
pokemon cards in a long time so when I

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.629 
pokemon cards in a long time so when I
saw<00:00:09.809> this<00:00:09.990> at<00:00:10.170> target<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.740> got<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.400> because<00:00:11.490> I

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
saw this at target I got it because I

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.160 
saw this at target I got it because I
had<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.880> money<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.690> thought<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:13.019> would<00:00:13.080> be

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
had the money and I thought it would be

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.839 
had the money and I thought it would be
cool<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.410> open<00:00:13.889> since<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.370> haven't<00:00:14.519> opened<00:00:14.820> a

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
cool to open since I haven't opened a

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.390 
cool to open since I haven't opened a
packing<00:00:15.210> so<00:00:15.389> long<00:00:15.619> I've<00:00:16.619> actually<00:00:16.859> watched<00:00:17.250> a

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
packing so long I've actually watched a

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.640 
packing so long I've actually watched a
few<00:00:17.550> videos<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:18.060> people<00:00:18.210> opening<00:00:18.779> x<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.289> y<00:00:19.410> and

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
few videos of people opening x and y and

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.050 
few videos of people opening x and y and
I<00:00:19.680> know<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.189> poll<00:00:20.430> rates<00:00:20.640> are<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> lot

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
I know that the poll rates are a lot

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.529 
I know that the poll rates are a lot
harder<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.539> this<00:00:21.750> set<00:00:22.020> but<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.340> think<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.300> card

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
harder in this set but I think the card

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.759 
harder in this set but I think the card
I<00:00:24.600> would<00:00:24.689> be<00:00:24.779> hoping<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.080> get<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.410> most<00:00:25.619> would

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
I would be hoping to get the most would

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.070 
I would be hoping to get the most would
be<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.189> holographic<00:00:26.699> raichu<00:00:27.269> or<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> full<00:00:27.900> hour

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
be the holographic raichu or a full hour

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.650 
be the holographic raichu or a full hour
or<00:00:28.289> exi<00:00:28.800> will<00:00:28.920> be<00:00:28.980> awesome<00:00:29.330> but<00:00:30.330> either<00:00:30.449> way

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
or exi will be awesome but either way

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.939 
or exi will be awesome but either way
the<00:00:30.779> fact<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.170> comes<00:00:31.349> with<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.590> three
