not<00:01:36.590> part<00:01:36.920> of<00:01:37.039> the<00:01:37.130> rehabilitation<00:01:37.310> but<00:01:37.909> it

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
not part of the rehabilitation but it

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.840 
not part of the rehabilitation but it
really<00:01:38.180> does<00:01:38.420> help<00:01:39.280> just<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:40.340> get<00:01:40.490> out<00:01:40.579> and

then<00:01:41.420> do<00:01:42.109> a<00:01:42.140> comparative<00:01:42.710> spot<00:01:43.100> I<00:01:43.630> think<00:01:44.630> that

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
then do a comparative spot I think that

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.289 
then do a comparative spot I think that
really<00:01:44.899> helps<00:01:45.229> yeah<00:01:45.640> if<00:01:46.640> we<00:01:46.820> were<00:01:46.939> on<00:01:47.000> our<00:01:47.030> legs
