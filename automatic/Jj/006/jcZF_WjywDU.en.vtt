which<00:00:04.529> first<00:00:04.859> decided<00:00:05.370> on<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:05.640> concept<00:00:06.089> which

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
which first decided on a concept which

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.960 
which first decided on a concept which
was<00:00:06.569> expanding<00:00:07.049> horizons<00:00:07.140> and<00:00:07.760> through<00:00:08.760> that

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
was expanding horizons and through that

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
was expanding horizons and through that
we<00:00:09.030> decided<00:00:09.900> on<00:00:10.080> some<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.219> main

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
we decided on some of the main

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.110 
we decided on some of the main
architectural<00:00:12.990> features<00:00:13.670> we<00:00:14.670> joined<00:00:14.910> with

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
architectural features we joined with

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.900 
architectural features we joined with
Missouri<00:00:15.389> University<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:16.560> combine<00:00:17.369> more<00:00:17.699> of

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
Missouri University to combine more of

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.510 
Missouri University to combine more of
the<00:00:17.970> architectural<00:00:18.690> field<00:00:19.230> into<00:00:19.710> design<00:00:20.070> the

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
the architectural field into design the

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.240 
the architectural field into design the
majority<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.480> design<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.230> horizontal<00:00:23.010> and

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
majority of the design is horizontal and

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.820 
majority of the design is horizontal and
it<00:00:23.730> just<00:00:24.060> expands<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.779> eye<00:00:24.810> makes<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.710> feel

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
it just expands the eye makes it feel

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.769 
it just expands the eye makes it feel
bigger<00:00:25.980> we<00:00:26.580> first<00:00:26.820> started<00:00:26.910> out<00:00:27.300> with<00:00:27.539> one

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
bigger we first started out with one

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.839 
bigger we first started out with one
module<00:00:27.960> system<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.710> time<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.519> year<00:00:29.730> we

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
module system this time and this year we

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.910 
module system this time and this year we
decided<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.330> do<00:00:30.480> one<00:00:30.750> for<00:00:31.109> easy<00:00:31.289> transport

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
decided to do one for easy transport

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.160 
decided to do one for easy transport
just<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.579> see<00:00:33.270> if<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.480> would<00:00:33.540> be<00:00:33.719> better<00:00:33.870> and

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
just to see if it would be better and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.709 
just to see if it would be better and
we've<00:00:34.860> actually<00:00:35.040> really<00:00:35.730> liked<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.360> kind

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
we've actually really liked it it kind

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.110 
we've actually really liked it it kind
of<00:00:36.809> limited<00:00:37.200> us<00:00:37.410> on<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.890> design<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:39.000> was

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
of limited us on the design but it was

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.420 
of limited us on the design but it was
much<00:00:39.420> easier<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.930> put<00:00:40.140> up<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.040> was<00:00:41.070> very

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
much easier to put up and so it was very

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.790 
much easier to put up and so it was very
easy<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.940> put<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.510> mall<00:00:42.780> as<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.649> can

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
easy to put on to the mall as you can

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.970 
easy to put on to the mall as you can
see<00:00:44.040> with<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.850> louvers<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.289> solar<00:00:46.500> panels

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
see with the louvers in the solar panels

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.940 
see with the louvers in the solar panels
were<00:00:47.309> able<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.789> redirect<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.450> sunlight<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.829> a

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
were able to redirect the sunlight in a

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.619 
were able to redirect the sunlight in a
way<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.370> we<00:00:50.460> would<00:00:50.610> like<00:00:50.700> them<00:00:50.940> instead<00:00:51.600> of

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
way that we would like them instead of

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.660 
way that we would like them instead of
heating<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.020> house<00:00:52.170> with<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.129> direct<00:00:53.460> rays

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
heating the house with the direct rays

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.389 
heating the house with the direct rays
we<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.120> redirect<00:00:54.449> them<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.320> stand<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
we can redirect them if you stand in the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.069 
we can redirect them if you stand in the
doorway<00:00:56.640> at<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.969> front<00:00:57.210> door<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.930> can

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
doorway at the front door you can

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.680 
doorway at the front door you can
actually<00:00:58.260> see<00:00:58.500> all<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.460> way<00:00:59.550> across<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.390> it

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
actually see all the way across so it

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.590 
actually see all the way across so it
creates<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.469> nice<00:01:01.590> open<00:01:01.859> area<00:01:02.250> we've<00:01:02.879> created<00:01:03.390> a

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
creates a nice open area we've created a

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.600 
creates a nice open area we've created a
system<00:01:03.809> called<00:01:04.290> chameleon<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.159> we've<00:01:05.339> built

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
system called chameleon that we've built

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.800 
system called chameleon that we've built
from<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> ground<00:01:05.850> up<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.450> we're<00:01:06.689> actually

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
from the ground up and we're actually

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.359 
from the ground up and we're actually
trying<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.320> get<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> patent<00:01:07.710> through<00:01:07.979> at<00:01:08.100> school

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
trying to get a patent through at school

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.359 
trying to get a patent through at school
and<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:09.210> controls<00:01:10.049> many<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.890> operations

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
and it controls many of the operations

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.420 
and it controls many of the operations
in<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.520> house<00:01:11.729> including<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.659> washer/dryer

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
there as soon as we lay our foundations

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.469 
there as soon as we lay our foundations
and<00:01:28.200> we<00:01:28.530> can<00:01:28.890> go<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.220> there<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.520> we<00:01:29.670> get<00:01:30.240> data

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
and we can go in there and we get data

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.140 
and we can go in there and we get data
and<00:01:30.900> research<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.619> we<00:01:31.740> need<00:01:31.920> after<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> 2007

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
and research that we need after the 2007

and research that we need after the 2007
house<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.689> want<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.930> do<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.079> little<00:01:34.229> bit<00:01:34.380> better

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
house we want to do a little bit better

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.469 
house we want to do a little bit better
in<00:01:34.650> architecture<00:01:35.189> than<00:01:35.369> we<00:01:35.460> had<00:01:35.640> then<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.090> so

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
in architecture than we had then and so

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.630 
in architecture than we had then and so
we<00:01:36.689> joined<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:37.280> University<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.369> Missouri

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
we joined with University of Missouri

decorators there it's helped us

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.109 
decorators there it's helped us
understand<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.920> architecture<00:01:47.460> side<00:01:47.640> better

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
understand the architecture side better

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.539 
understand the architecture side better
everything's<00:01:48.930> about<00:01:49.229> clear<00:01:49.770> visions<00:01:50.250> and

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
everything's about clear visions and

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.429 
everything's about clear visions and
