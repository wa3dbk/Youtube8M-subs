so much success with this like I said

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.730 
so much success with this like I said
with<00:01:30.000> my<00:01:30.180> clients<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.049> salon<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.560> I

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
with my clients in the salon that I

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.530 
with my clients in the salon that I
figured<00:01:32.490> I'd<00:01:32.579> give<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.909> try<00:01:32.939> for<00:01:33.299> my<00:01:33.420> own

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
figured I'd give it a try for my own

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.990 
figured I'd give it a try for my own
hair<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.409> basically<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.549> comes<00:01:35.790> with

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
hair so basically it comes with

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.740 
hair so basically it comes with
everything<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.390> need

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.530 
everything you need
you've<00:01:37.409> got<00:01:37.590> your<00:01:37.680> relaxer<00:01:38.610> you've<00:01:39.240> got<00:01:39.420> your

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
you've got your relaxer you've got your

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.539 
you've got your relaxer you've got your
inductor<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.200> mix<00:01:40.409> with<00:01:40.500> your<00:01:41.130> relaxer

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
inductor that you mix with your relaxer

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.880 
inductor that you mix with your relaxer
to<00:01:41.579> activate<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.290> normally<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.320> would<00:01:43.619> put<00:01:43.649> this

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
to activate it normally I would put this

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.090 
to activate it normally I would put this
in<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.159> like<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> color<00:01:45.450> bowl<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.020> use<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.770> brush

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
in a like a color bowl and use a brush

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.580 
in a like a color bowl and use a brush
with<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.420> can<00:01:48.479> mix<00:01:48.780> only<00:01:49.049> half<00:01:49.409> of

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
with it so that I can mix only half of

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.160 
with it so that I can mix only half of
this<00:01:49.710> because<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.310> enough<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:51.420> do<00:01:51.600> two

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
this because this is enough to do two

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.460 
this because this is enough to do two
retouches<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.720> like<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.750> said<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.170> been<00:01:55.259> four
