well<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:47.309> very<00:00:47.430> interesting<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.360> time

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
well it's very interesting in this time

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.869 
well it's very interesting in this time
of<00:00:48.899> tremendous<00:00:49.320> controversy<00:00:50.070> surrounding

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
of tremendous controversy surrounding

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.500 
of tremendous controversy surrounding
the<00:00:50.940> Roman<00:00:51.270> Catholic<00:00:51.690> Church<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.850> revisit<00:00:53.850> why

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
the Roman Catholic Church to revisit why

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.470 
the Roman Catholic Church to revisit why
the<00:00:54.570> present<00:00:55.320> Pope<00:00:55.530> Joseph<00:00:56.309> Ratzinger<00:00:56.850> why<00:00:57.210> he

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
the present Pope Joseph Ratzinger why he

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.760 
the present Pope Joseph Ratzinger why he
chose<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.140> name<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:59.120> pope<00:01:00.120> benedict<00:01:00.690> xvi<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
chose the name of pope benedict xvi and

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.709 
chose the name of pope benedict xvi and
the<00:01:02.399> reason<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.270> important<00:01:03.690> right

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the reason this is so important right

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.170 
the reason this is so important right
now<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.110> because<00:01:04.530> there's<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.799> special<00:01:05.549> meaning

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
now is because there's a special meaning

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.710 
now is because there's a special meaning
