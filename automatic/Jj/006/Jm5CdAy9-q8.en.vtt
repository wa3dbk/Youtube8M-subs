00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.700
 so once we have planted 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.910
 the ideal is that they do not make themselves 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.469
 not eat slugs and here I 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.509
 wanted to talk to you about a little trick that 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.790
 I discovered last year through 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.650
 sir know an organic farmer of 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.560
 my region 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:23.460
 so once you're planting or 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.560
 we buy plants at the stores 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.070
 who are already sown paid who already have 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.080
 grown up these plants are often in a 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.390
 greenhouse where come from a greenhouse so he 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.100
 must acclimatize them to the outside climate 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.649
 before replanting 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.510
 you have to know that slugs are 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.610
 cleaners so the slugs go 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.020
 directly attack the plants 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.989
 fragile weakened and that's normal so 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.390
 what we have to do is strengthen our 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.379
 seedlings before putting them in the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.750
 garden so how do we do it so we can 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.110
 take them out 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.680
 every night every morning forgiveness 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:06.170
 for the regulars and then he returned 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.430
 in the evening the first days and then then 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.530
 after we can leave them we will say 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.970
 all the time outside before the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.360
 plant one they leave them in their 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.050
 skin and the often the problem these are 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.930
 slugs so slugs to avoid 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.080
 they come to eat our seedlings here 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:28.520
 so this famous thing is just a jump 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:31.220
 a board and the pot and then thanks to 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.649
 that slugs his arrival a lot 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.990
 slower on our plants 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.450
 so me every day I spend when 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.130
 even to monitor but thanks this little 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.520
 same thing during the night 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.850
 my plants are not devouring and I do not 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.979
 not lose all my work so I hope 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.890
 that this little trick to help you so 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.470
 it's a simple bucket and a board 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.210
 and you put your plants on top 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.939
 so the slugs will definitely 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.990
 not ironing 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.189
 on plants or where possible 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.740
 that there are some 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.869
 arrive here but then it's 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.259
 much easier to hunt them and 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:14.310
 So here I am, I pass my hands in 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.500
 to see if there are any and I do not 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.510
 see now I've found one 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.090
 this morning 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.420
 I hope this little thing will be able to 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.629
 help you protect your seedlings 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.629
 soon
