whatever you guys want to refer to it as
but<00:02:18.420> that's<00:02:18.540> what<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.750> think<00:02:18.990> enough<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.380> you

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
but that's what I think enough and you

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.260 
but that's what I think enough and you
have<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.130> nice<00:02:20.280> little<00:02:20.550> bumps<00:02:20.790> at<00:02:20.940> each<00:02:21.090> of

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
have the nice little bumps at each of

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.180 
have the nice little bumps at each of
the<00:02:21.360> corners<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:21.990> if<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.260> put<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.650> down<00:02:22.950> on<00:02:22.980> a

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
the corners so if you put a down on a

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.800 
the corners so if you put a down on a
surface<00:02:23.580> that's<00:02:23.880> what's<00:02:24.510> going<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.690> be

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
surface that's what's going to be

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.780 
surface that's what's going to be
touching<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.320> surface<00:02:25.530> whatever<00:02:26.130> your<00:02:26.310> ipod

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
touching the surface whatever your ipod

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.820 
touching the surface whatever your ipod
happens<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.240> be<00:02:27.360> on<00:02:27.480> not<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.230> actual<00:02:28.500> ipod

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
happens to be on not the actual ipod

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.160 
happens to be on not the actual ipod
itself<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:30.150> that's<00:02:30.630> going<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.840> give<00:02:30.960> you<00:02:31.020> some

but<00:03:14.610> I<00:03:14.670> went<00:03:15.030> ahead<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.240> I<00:03:15.390> stuck<00:03:15.570> my<00:03:15.660> finger

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
but I went ahead and I stuck my finger

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.020 
but I went ahead and I stuck my finger
on<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.020> inside<00:03:16.350> and<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.770> ripped<00:03:17.130> just<00:03:17.910> by

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
on the inside and it ripped just by

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.250 
on the inside and it ripped just by
pushing<00:03:18.240> up<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.510> little<00:03:18.660> bit<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.870> ripped<00:03:19.140> you

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
pushing up a little bit it ripped you

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.720 
pushing up a little bit it ripped you
guys<00:03:19.380> to<00:03:19.470> see<00:03:19.590> my<00:03:19.680> finger<00:03:19.920> through<00:03:20.100> there<00:03:20.220> it

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
guys to see my finger through there it

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.120 
guys to see my finger through there it
ripped<00:03:21.210> part<00:03:21.870> of<00:03:21.960> it<00:03:22.050> off<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.290> front<00:03:22.470> piece<00:03:22.680> so

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
ripped part of it off the front piece so

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.080 
ripped part of it off the front piece so
now<00:03:23.220> I'm<00:03:23.310> just<00:03:23.460> a<00:03:23.520> little<00:03:23.610> bit<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.880> worried

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
now I'm just a little bit of worried

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.580 
now I'm just a little bit of worried
about<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.450> coming<00:03:24.600> off<00:03:24.780> because<00:03:25.110> I<00:03:25.140> think<00:03:25.320> I

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
about it coming off because I think I

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.010 
about it coming off because I think I
would<00:03:25.710> kind<00:03:25.830> of<00:03:26.010> take<00:03:26.670> away<00:03:27.090> from<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.660> this

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
would kind of take away from the this

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.200 
would kind of take away from the this
case<00:03:28.260> looks<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.920> texture<00:03:29.340> but<00:03:29.640> I<00:03:29.820> don't<00:03:30.060> think

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
case looks and texture but I don't think

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.670 
case looks and texture but I don't think
that's<00:03:30.300> that<00:03:30.540> big<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.870> deal<00:03:31.050> because<00:03:31.290> it

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
that's that big of a deal because it

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.960 
that's that big of a deal because it
doesn't<00:03:32.010> it's<00:03:32.190> not<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.520> whole<00:03:32.670> thing<00:03:32.850> that

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
doesn't it's not the whole thing that

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.910 
doesn't it's not the whole thing that
popped<00:03:33.150> up<00:03:33.300> it<00:03:33.540> was<00:03:33.990> just<00:03:34.140> that<00:03:34.350> front<00:03:34.770> of<00:03:34.830> it

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
popped up it was just that front of it

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.520 
popped up it was just that front of it
and<00:03:35.130> it<00:03:35.730> might<00:03:35.970> just<00:03:36.000> be<00:03:36.360> for<00:03:36.720> this<00:03:36.930> one<00:03:37.260> case

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
and it might just be for this one case

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.320 
and it might just be for this one case
and<00:03:37.740> not<00:03:37.920> just<00:03:38.130> all<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.490> cases<00:03:38.670> in<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.120> same

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
and not just all the cases in that same

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.180 
and not just all the cases in that same
line<00:03:39.570> so<00:03:40.230> we're<00:03:40.560> going<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.770> go<00:03:40.800> ahead<00:03:40.860> and

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
line so we're going to go ahead and

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.680 
line so we're going to go ahead and
throw<00:03:41.460> it<00:03:41.580> in<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.730> ipod<00:03:42.060> once<00:03:42.330> again<00:03:42.510> guys

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
throw it in the ipod once again guys

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.270 
throw it in the ipod once again guys
that's<00:03:42.900> an<00:03:43.050> easy<00:03:43.380> flow<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.770> look<00:03:44.040> past

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
that's an easy flow to look past

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.890 
that's an easy flow to look past
especially<00:03:44.700> when<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:45.209> could<00:03:45.330> probably<00:03:45.540> just

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
especially when it could probably just

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.020 
especially when it could probably just
be<00:03:46.080> this<00:03:46.230> case<00:03:46.500> it's<00:03:47.160> very<00:03:47.400> easy<00:03:47.550> to<00:03:47.670> put<00:03:47.910> this

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
be this case it's very easy to put this

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.850 
be this case it's very easy to put this
case<00:03:48.270> on<00:03:48.480> go<00:03:48.959> ahead<00:03:49.050> and<00:03:49.350> structure<00:03:49.680> on<00:03:49.770> the

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
case on go ahead and structure on the

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.990 
case on go ahead and structure on the
outsides<00:03:50.220> just<00:03:50.459> like<00:03:50.580> you<00:03:50.670> would<00:03:50.760> any<00:03:50.910> other

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
outsides just like you would any other

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.360 
outsides just like you would any other
silicone<00:03:51.450> case<00:03:51.630> massage<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:52.620> into<00:03:52.740> place<00:03:53.040> like

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
silicone case massage it into place like

good shock absorption because of all the

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.410 
good shock absorption because of all the
silicone<00:04:06.420> you<00:04:06.930> guys<00:04:07.110> can<00:04:07.320> hear<00:04:08.090> that<00:04:09.090> it's<00:04:09.300> a

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.719 
unique because they're all just a bunch
of<00:05:58.199> silicon<00:05:58.590> and<00:05:58.620> then<00:05:58.889> they<00:05:59.099> do<00:05:59.159> something

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
of silicon and then they do something

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.360 
of silicon and then they do something
with<00:05:59.849> it<00:05:59.880> to<00:06:00.060> make<00:06:00.180> the<00:06:00.300> design<00:06:00.659> look<00:06:00.870> great
