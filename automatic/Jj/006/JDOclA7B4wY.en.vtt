00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
how different was the whole experience

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.770 
how different was the whole experience
of<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.960> Formula<00:01:25.350> One<00:01:25.380> race<00:01:25.530> for<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.100> Jenson

of a Formula One race for you Jenson

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.600 
of a Formula One race for you Jenson
it's<00:01:27.780> obviously<00:01:28.080> very<00:01:28.140> different<00:01:28.560> long<00:01:29.369> races

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
it's obviously very different long races

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.990 
it's obviously very different long races
to<00:01:29.909> start<00:01:30.150> with<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.540> 58<00:01:31.259> lap<00:01:31.409> races<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.700> very

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
to start with a 58 lap races is very

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.730 
to start with a 58 lap races is very
long<00:01:33.180> compared<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.930> what<00:01:34.020> I'm<00:01:34.110> used<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.409> it's

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
long compared to what I'm used to it's

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.770 
long compared to what I'm used to it's
about<00:01:34.860> 20<00:01:35.369> laps<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.700> Formula<00:01:36.119> three<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:36.689> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
about 20 laps in Formula three so it's a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.319 
about 20 laps in Formula three so it's a
it's<00:01:37.140> quite<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.350> big<00:01:37.530> difference<00:01:38.119> also<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
it's quite a big difference also the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.030 
it's quite a big difference also the
competition<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.140> best<00:01:40.409> drivers<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
competition is the best drivers in the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.039 
competition is the best drivers in the
world<00:01:41.070> I'm<00:01:41.340> racing<00:01:41.670> against<00:01:41.880> now<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.390> it's

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
throughout the whole day I think no it's

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.650 
throughout the whole day I think no it's
a<00:02:13.800> it's<00:02:14.040> been<00:02:14.849> a<00:02:14.910> pretty<00:02:15.120> good<00:02:15.270> day<00:02:15.330> I've<00:02:15.629> been

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
chilled pretty relaxed but I think

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.940 
chilled pretty relaxed but I think
that's<00:02:18.150> part<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:19.200> seems<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.739> way<00:02:19.860> of

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
that's part of the it seems a way of

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.770 
that's part of the it seems a way of
working<00:02:20.160> they've<00:02:21.000> not<00:02:21.180> put<00:02:21.420> undue<00:02:21.599> pressure

I did enjoy the experience I found a

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.030 
I did enjoy the experience I found a
quiet<00:03:18.450> place<00:03:18.720> in<00:03:19.019> one<00:03:19.140> of<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.290> grandstands

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
quiet place in one of the grandstands

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.089 
quiet place in one of the grandstands
and<00:03:20.280> away<00:03:20.940> from<00:03:21.000> everyone<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.780> really<00:03:22.709> soaked

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
and away from everyone and really soaked

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.130 
and away from everyone and really soaked
up<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.459> whole<00:03:23.610> race<00:03:23.819> it<00:03:24.030> was<00:03:24.120> brilliant<00:03:24.510> at

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
up the whole race it was brilliant at

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.449 
up the whole race it was brilliant at
the<00:03:25.260> end<00:03:25.409> of<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:25.680> I<00:03:25.799> guess<00:03:26.010> there's<00:03:26.280> be<00:03:26.430> a

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
the end of it I guess there's be a

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.039 
the end of it I guess there's be a
slight<00:03:26.849> sense<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.269> disappointment<00:03:27.629> that

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
slight sense of disappointment that

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.800 
slight sense of disappointment that
Jenson<00:03:28.680> he<00:03:28.830> was<00:03:29.069> in<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.370> points<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:29.909> the

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
Jenson he was in the points and the

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.119 
Jenson he was in the points and the
engine<00:03:31.080> heading<00:03:31.319> down<00:03:31.470> at<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.709> end<00:03:31.830> he<00:03:31.890> didn't

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
engine heading down at the end he didn't

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.490 
engine heading down at the end he didn't
didn't<00:03:32.340> manage<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:32.549> finish<00:03:32.780> yeah<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:33.810> think<00:03:34.170> a

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
didn't manage to finish yeah I think a

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.250 
didn't manage to finish yeah I think a
slight<00:03:34.769> disappointment<00:03:35.159> is<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.670> right<00:03:35.849> words

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
slight disappointment is the right words

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.570 
slight disappointment is the right words
just<00:03:37.260> he<00:03:37.379> handle<00:03:37.709> himself<00:03:37.980> so<00:03:38.159> well<00:03:38.370> in<00:03:38.489> the

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
just he handle himself so well in the

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.309 
just he handle himself so well in the
race<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.120> what<00:03:39.269> I<00:03:39.299> saw<00:03:39.599> I<00:03:39.629> didn't<00:03:39.959> put<00:03:40.080> a<00:03:40.110> foot

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319
