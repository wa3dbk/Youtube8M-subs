00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
controller so we're going to take them

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:45.140 
controller so we're going to take them
off<00:01:36.450> right<00:01:37.080> now<00:01:43.280> next<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.400> need<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.820> remove

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
off right now next I need to remove

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.929 
off right now next I need to remove
these<00:01:45.780> cables<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.799> can<00:01:47.040> use<00:01:47.189> them<00:01:47.400> to<00:01:47.580> jump

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
these cables so I can use them to jump

00:01:47.939 --> 00:02:00.830 
these cables so I can use them to jump
my<00:01:48.150> new<00:01:48.299> batteries

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.300 

now<00:02:01.840> we'll<00:02:02.020> just<00:02:02.260> put<00:02:02.470> these<00:02:02.590> batteries<00:02:02.950> away

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
now we'll just put these batteries away

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.220 
now we'll just put these batteries away
for<00:02:03.520> a<00:02:03.550> while<00:02:03.670> i<00:02:03.940> am<00:02:04.480> going<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:04.780> still<00:02:05.020> keep

for a while i am going to still keep

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.200 
for a while i am going to still keep
them<00:02:05.530> so<00:02:06.010> i<00:02:06.040> can<00:02:06.280> use<00:02:06.430> them<00:02:06.640> in<00:02:06.760> a<00:02:06.880> different

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
them so i can use them in a different

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.120 
them so i can use them in a different
project<00:02:07.360> a<00:02:07.720> different<00:02:08.080> solar<00:02:08.320> power<00:02:08.619> system

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
project a different solar power system

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.650 
project a different solar power system
later<00:02:09.340> on<00:02:09.550> maybe<00:02:09.820> when<00:02:10.119> generate<00:02:10.540> or

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
later on maybe when generate or

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.600 
later on maybe when generate or
something<00:02:10.899> like<00:02:10.960> that<00:02:11.020> but<00:02:12.010> i<00:02:12.070> still<00:02:12.370> need<00:02:12.550> to

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
something like that but i still need to

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.040 
something like that but i still need to
get<00:02:12.760> another<00:02:13.000> charge<00:02:13.390> controller<00:02:13.810> and

posts that we can place our wires on now

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.370 
posts that we can place our wires on now
we<00:03:21.790> will<00:03:22.480> take<00:03:22.780> our<00:03:24.600> red<00:03:25.600> wire<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:26.320> our

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
we will take our red wire to our

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.370 
we will take our red wire to our
positive<00:03:26.709> terminals<00:03:30.510> other<00:03:31.510> red<00:03:31.690> wire<00:03:31.930> over

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
positive terminals other red wire over

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.350 
positive terminals other red wire over
to<00:03:32.530> here<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:34.480> now<00:03:34.540> our<00:03:35.230> black<00:03:35.800> wire<00:03:36.100> to<00:03:36.519> one<00:03:37.209> of

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
to here and now our black wire to one of

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:46.750 
to here and now our black wire to one of
the<00:03:37.570> negative<00:03:38.170> term<00:03:38.410> loans

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.600 

and<00:03:47.299> our<00:03:47.659> other<00:03:47.930> negative<00:03:48.590> wire<00:03:48.799> over<00:03:49.459> to

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
and our other negative wire over to

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:56.020 
and our other negative wire over to
there<00:03:49.790> then<00:03:50.689> we<00:03:51.170> can<00:03:51.349> reconnect<00:03:51.799> our<00:03:55.030> charge

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
there then we can reconnect our charge

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:13.970 
there then we can reconnect our charge
controller<00:03:57.519> to<00:03:58.519> the<00:03:59.000> system

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.090 

now<00:04:14.980> we<00:04:15.040> are<00:04:15.310> reconnected<00:04:16.030> back<00:04:16.330> to<00:04:16.570> a<00:04:17.140> 12-volt

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
now we are reconnected back to a 12-volt

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.340 
now we are reconnected back to a 12-volt
system<00:04:18.959> but<00:04:19.959> this<00:04:20.230> time<00:04:20.440> we<00:04:20.709> have<00:04:20.739> over<00:04:22.350> 430

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
system but this time we have over 430

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.980 
system but this time we have over 430
amp<00:04:23.740> hours<00:04:24.190> we<00:04:24.850> have<00:04:25.090> let<00:04:25.390> the<00:04:25.690> charge

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
amp hours we have let the charge

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.990 
amp hours we have let the charge
controller<00:04:26.230> know<00:04:26.830> it's<00:04:27.070> still<00:04:27.310> on<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.520> 12-volt

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
controller know it's still on a 12-volt

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.190 
controller know it's still on a 12-volt
system<00:04:28.410> so<00:04:29.410> it's<00:04:29.560> time<00:04:29.830> now<00:04:30.040> to<00:04:30.340> plug<00:04:31.060> in<00:04:31.390> the

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
system so it's time now to plug in the

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:41.700 
system so it's time now to plug in the
