00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.109
 as always a greeting to all of you for 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.189
 thank you for the 100 entries on the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.740
 my channel 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.510
 I want to start a new playlist of 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.289
 video that will be called applications 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.640
 strange 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.399
 in practice I will show you those 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.200
 applications that are less known but 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.690
 which are sometimes even the most fun 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.469
 and in some cases even the most useful 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.930
 let's start with today's application 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:48.030
 which is a metal detector a metal 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.379
 detector 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.680
 once the application is open, yes 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.050
 presents in this way once placed 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.030
 the phone away from magnetic fields 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.010
 because this app works with 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.340
 the magnetic field in practice all the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.710
 metal and puts a magnetic field and 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.810
 thanks to the antenna of the mobile phone itself 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.840
 we could detect this magnetic field 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.330
 and therefore understand that it is metal 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.520
 then once the phone is removed from 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.650
 near computer televisions and all 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.150
 those cases appear that equipment 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.640
 emit magnetic fields 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.680
 go on the menu and fall on the caliber 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.299
 put ok and set the value of 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.979
 default 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:32.390
 now as you see here I have a series of 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.470
 some metal objects others not 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.939
 we can start for example with the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.619
 package of handkerchiefs and we must 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.229
 bring objects closer together 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.820
 possible to the antenna of the phone that 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.470
 in my case it is here at the top a 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.090
 left at the top of the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.240
 screen 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:51.299
 we take the object and approach it 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.070
 see nothing happens behind it 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.360
 nothing happens 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:02.149
 now let's take this empty box that 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.149
 it's metal we pass it here 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.280
 sorry see how the value increases 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.080
 I can guarantee you that this is not 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.200
 light sensor o di e la 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.670
 camera for which one does not mean 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.630
 that every object that you will support us 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.820
 above it will increase the value but is a 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.350
 magnetic field detector that makes us 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.420
 understand what the objects are 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.820
 they contain metal for example this one 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.520
 is a pump purse as you can 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:40.470
 see makes no change to the 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:46.500
 value here or of the ball bearings of 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:47.700
 metal also you see I'm not 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.290
 trying no keys 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.290
 if you want support also the phone 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:03:00.290
 See, I don't even have to touch the phone 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:06.890
 just let me get close and here we have 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.890
 you see a metal stapler 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:18.700
 or a pack of half-empty tires 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.700
 and does not increase the value 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:26.180
 this we say is not an application 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:29.659
 one hundred percent, however, we say 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.860
 that does his duty and very funny 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:36.769
 if you want to try it it has a weight of a mega 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.959
 3 more or less there was the link of the play 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.170
 store in the description is completely 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.780
 free and nothing thank you for the 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.849
 viewing this video in the future there 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.760
 will be other video reviews with 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:53.120
 such applications I recommend 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:57.489
 register to register and follow them 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.489
 thanks to everyone and to the next video
