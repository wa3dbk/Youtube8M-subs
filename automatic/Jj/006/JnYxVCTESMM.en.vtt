00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
really like or really want to use um I

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.300 
really like or really want to use um I
fast-forwarded<00:02:35.810> right<00:02:36.290> here<00:02:36.470> just<00:02:36.680> so<00:02:36.890> I<00:02:37.190> can

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
fast-forwarded right here just so I can

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.890 
fast-forwarded right here just so I can
get<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.760> object<00:02:38.090> that<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.209> wanted<00:02:38.630> just

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
get to the object that I wanted just

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.270 
get to the object that I wanted just
this<00:02:39.140> one<00:02:39.380> this<00:02:39.590> object<00:02:39.860> right<00:02:40.250> here

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
this one this object right here

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.640 
this one this object right here
basically<00:02:41.030> stands<00:02:41.540> out<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.870> most<00:02:42.019> out<00:02:42.290> of<00:02:42.350> all

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
basically stands out the most out of all

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.009 
basically stands out the most out of all
objects<00:02:43.220> but<00:02:43.730> from<00:02:43.970> my<00:02:44.150> way<00:02:44.450> just<00:02:44.840> for<00:02:44.930> the

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
objects but from my way just for the

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.720 
objects but from my way just for the
tutorials<00:02:45.530> like<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:45.769> guess<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.040> can<00:02:46.160> say<00:02:46.340> but

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
tutorials like I guess you can say but

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.640 
tutorials like I guess you can say but
as<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:47.000> see<00:02:47.180> once<00:02:47.420> I'm<00:02:47.569> rotating<00:02:47.959> it<00:02:48.230> like

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
as you see once I'm rotating it like

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.009 
as you see once I'm rotating it like
downwards<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.519> can<00:02:49.670> see<00:02:49.910> like<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.480> shadow<00:02:50.780> of

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
downwards you can see like the shadow of

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.960 
downwards you can see like the shadow of
the<00:02:51.140> map<00:02:51.319> I<00:02:51.470> guess<00:02:51.680> like<00:02:52.160> you<00:02:52.370> could<00:02:52.549> call<00:02:52.760> it

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
the map I guess like you could call it

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.330 
the map I guess like you could call it
it<00:02:53.299> basically<00:02:53.630> changed<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.140> way<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:55.010> how<00:02:55.160> it

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
it basically changed the way of how it

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.280 
it basically changed the way of how it
looks<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:55.790> it's<00:02:55.940> really<00:02:56.180> cool<00:02:56.420> um<00:02:57.049> you<00:02:57.200> can

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
looks and it's really cool um you can

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.570 
looks and it's really cool um you can
turn<00:02:57.350> or<00:02:57.530> whatever<00:02:57.769> way<00:02:57.950> you<00:02:58.010> want<00:02:58.130> if<00:02:58.489> you

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
turn or whatever way you want if you

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.949 
turn or whatever way you want if you
turn<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:58.880> around<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.239> can<00:02:59.390> make<00:02:59.510> it<00:02:59.690> straight

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
turn it around you can make it straight

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.660 
turn it around you can make it straight
actually<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.709> it'll<00:03:00.860> look<00:03:00.950> really<00:03:01.160> cool<00:03:01.430> and

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
actually and it'll look really cool and

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.280 
actually and it'll look really cool and
once<00:03:02.180> you<00:03:02.269> got<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:02.600> you<00:03:02.630> could<00:03:02.810> just<00:03:02.840> basically

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
once you got it you could just basically

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.930 
once you got it you could just basically
do<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.769> same<00:03:03.980> thing<00:03:04.190> for<00:03:04.340> all<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.790> other

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
do the same thing for all the other

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.940 
do the same thing for all the other
objects<00:03:05.390> all<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.870> other<00:03:06.049> like<00:03:06.410> objects<00:03:06.890> that

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
objects all the other like objects that

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.860 
objects all the other like objects that
you<00:03:07.100> want<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.610> again<00:03:08.239> I<00:03:08.450> fast-forwarded

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
you want and again I fast-forwarded

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.690 
you want and again I fast-forwarded
right<00:03:09.290> here<00:03:09.560> just<00:03:10.040> trying<00:03:10.340> it<00:03:10.489> with<00:03:10.549> like

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
right here just trying it with like

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.250 
right here just trying it with like
random<00:03:11.000> different<00:03:11.299> shapes<00:03:11.540> is<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.900> see<00:03:12.080> which

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
random different shapes is to see which

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.559 
random different shapes is to see which
one<00:03:12.470> looks<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.709> best<00:03:12.950> all<00:03:13.700> right<00:03:13.850> but<00:03:14.180> again

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
one looks the best all right but again

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.539 
one looks the best all right but again
that's<00:03:14.720> really<00:03:15.049> simple<00:03:15.290> because<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.310> do<00:03:16.430> with

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
that's really simple because to do with

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.130 
that's really simple because to do with
the<00:03:16.640> glass<00:03:16.850> like<00:03:17.299> the<00:03:17.420> grass<00:03:17.660> that<00:03:17.870> makes<00:03:18.049> the

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
the glass like the grass that makes the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.160 
the glass like the grass that makes the
grass<00:03:18.350> look<00:03:18.530> a<00:03:18.590> little<00:03:18.709> bit<00:03:18.859> more<00:03:18.980> darker<00:03:19.370> but

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
grass look a little bit more darker but

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.960 
grass look a little bit more darker but
from<00:03:21.170> what<00:03:21.320> I'm<00:03:21.500> seeing<00:03:21.530> this<00:03:22.220> can<00:03:22.549> only<00:03:22.700> work

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
from what I'm seeing this can only work

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.759 
from what I'm seeing this can only work
for<00:03:23.150> like<00:03:23.269> walls<00:03:23.570> I<00:03:23.930> mean<00:03:24.290> unless<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:24.590> want<00:03:24.709> to

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
for like walls I mean unless you want to

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.440 
for like walls I mean unless you want to
make<00:03:24.859> like<00:03:24.980> a<00:03:25.070> sideways<00:03:25.519> Park<00:03:26.030> or<00:03:26.209> whatever

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
make like a sideways Park or whatever

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.690 
make like a sideways Park or whatever
but<00:03:26.989> actually<00:03:27.560> see<00:03:27.769> like<00:03:27.920> right<00:03:28.160> here<00:03:28.370> I<00:03:28.400> just

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
but actually see like right here I just

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.069 
but actually see like right here I just
I'm<00:03:28.820> just<00:03:28.850> rotating<00:03:29.150> it<00:03:29.540> just<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:29.840> can<00:03:29.989> see

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
I'm just rotating it just you can see

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.900 
I'm just rotating it just you can see
the<00:03:30.140> difference<00:03:30.590> like<00:03:31.130> this<00:03:31.430> one's<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:31.850> little

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
the difference like this one's a little

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.640 
the difference like this one's a little
bit<00:03:32.090> more<00:03:32.239> dark<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:32.750> look<00:03:33.019> look<00:03:33.230> so<00:03:33.350> it<00:03:33.500> looks

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
bit more dark and look look so it looks

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.310 
bit more dark and look look so it looks
like<00:03:33.799> more<00:03:34.070> crystally<00:03:34.609> and<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:35.660> could<00:03:36.200> just

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
like more crystally and I could just

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.020 
like more crystally and I could just
rotate<00:03:36.769> it<00:03:36.799> back<00:03:37.070> to<00:03:37.340> make<00:03:37.489> it<00:03:37.609> match<00:03:37.820> or

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
rotate it back to make it match or

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.819 
rotate it back to make it match or
whatever<00:03:38.239> but<00:03:38.720> thanks<00:03:39.019> for<00:03:39.140> watching<00:03:39.530> and
