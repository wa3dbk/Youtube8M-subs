hone their skills McGill again officer

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.270 
hone their skills McGill again officer
better<00:01:23.729> area<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.119> train<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.780> larger<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:26.130> can

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
better area to train on is larger we can

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.830 
better area to train on is larger we can
also<00:01:26.400> use<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> ranges<00:01:27.150> through<00:01:27.390> life<00:01:27.630> fire

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
also use the ranges through life fire

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.020 
also use the ranges through life fire
and<00:01:27.990> platforms<00:01:28.500> from<00:01:29.369> there<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:29.700> guys<00:01:29.880> can

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
and platforms from there so guys can

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.600 
and platforms from there so guys can
practice<00:01:30.420> contract<00:01:30.900> drills<00:01:31.189> the<00:01:32.189> moving<00:01:32.490> in

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
practice contract drills the moving in

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.370 
practice contract drills the moving in
convoys<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.329> driving<00:01:33.720> at<00:01:33.840> night<00:01:33.869> drills

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
convoys and the driving at night drills

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.679 
convoys and the driving at night drills
so<00:01:34.979> it's<00:01:35.100> just<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.340> better<00:01:35.700> area<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.119> larger<00:01:36.540> area

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
so it's just a better area a larger area

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.990 
so it's just a better area a larger area
that<00:01:36.900> we<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:37.110> use<00:01:37.400> today<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> turnoff

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
that we can use today it's the turnoff

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.600 
that we can use today it's the turnoff
