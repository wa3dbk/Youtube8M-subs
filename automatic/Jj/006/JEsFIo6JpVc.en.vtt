00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
oh what a beautiful day for starcraft

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.369 
oh what a beautiful day for starcraft
isn't<00:00:04.259> it<00:00:04.350> folks<00:00:05.270> yep<00:00:06.270> that's<00:00:06.779> at<00:00:06.990> least<00:00:07.020> what

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
isn't it folks yep that's at least what

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.669 
isn't it folks yep that's at least what
I<00:00:07.410> think<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:08.189> right<00:00:08.820> now<00:00:09.000> we<00:00:09.059> have<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.990> Protoss

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
I think and right now we have a Protoss

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.440 
I think and right now we have a Protoss
vs<00:00:11.219> terran<00:00:11.519> on<00:00:11.849> our<00:00:12.030> hands<00:00:12.300> so<00:00:13.940> this<00:00:14.940> map<00:00:15.179> I

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
vs terran on our hands so this map I

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.359 
vs terran on our hands so this map I
believe<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.820> hmm<00:00:18.109> which<00:00:19.109> map<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.590> this<00:00:19.830> it's

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
believe it is hmm which map is this it's

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.050 
believe it is hmm which map is this it's
i<00:00:20.699> believe<00:00:21.180> it's<00:00:21.330> metal<00:00:21.840> palace<00:00:22.609> but<00:00:23.609> i<00:00:23.670> gotta

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
i believe it's metal palace but i gotta

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.359 
i believe it's metal palace but i gotta
double<00:00:24.420> check<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.810> anyway<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:25.710> we<00:00:26.189> have<00:00:26.340> a

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
double check that anyway so we have a

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.439 
double check that anyway so we have a
Protoss<00:00:27.029> here<00:00:27.359> versus<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.470> Terran<00:00:29.130> red<00:00:29.640> vs.

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
Protoss here versus a Terran red vs.

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.110 
Protoss here versus a Terran red vs.
blue<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:33.110> while<00:00:34.110> there's<00:00:34.380> still<00:00:34.559> no<00:00:34.829> action

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120

we<00:01:09.840> have<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.439> probe<00:01:10.830> here<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.490> actually<00:01:11.729> block

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
we have a probe here that actually block

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.340 
we have a probe here that actually block
to<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.630> barracks<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:14.450> it<00:01:15.450> was<00:01:15.689> pure<00:01:15.930> luck<00:01:15.990> i

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
to the barracks and it was pure luck i

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.340 
to the barracks and it was pure luck i
believe<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.860> now<00:01:17.040> ah<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:18.240> was<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> gang<00:01:19.110> bang

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
believe and now ah this was a gang bang

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.210 
believe and now ah this was a gang bang
this<00:01:19.979> was<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> total<00:01:20.580> gangbang<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.509> probe

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
this was a total gangbang on that probe

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.410 
this was a total gangbang on that probe
but<00:01:23.220> anyway<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:23.610> nicely<00:01:23.790> done<00:01:24.150> by<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
but anyway it's nicely done by the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.120 
but anyway it's nicely done by the
Terran<00:01:24.750> player<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.560> was<00:01:25.740> really<00:01:25.979> good

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
Terran player this was really good

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.730 
Terran player this was really good
surrounding<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> probe<00:01:27.060> here<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.990> let's<00:01:28.560> see

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
surrounding the probe here so let's see

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.039 
surrounding the probe here so let's see
the<00:01:29.040> turn<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> barracks<00:01:30.390> with<00:01:30.780> a

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
the turn is going for a barracks with a

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.859 
the turn is going for a barracks with a
refinery<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:31.979> we're<00:01:32.159> about<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.939> see<00:01:33.329> probably

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
refinery so we're about to see probably

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.219 
refinery so we're about to see probably
some<00:01:35.090> early<00:01:36.090> check<00:01:36.329> from<00:01:36.540> him<00:01:36.780> or<00:01:36.930> something

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
some early check from him or something

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.340 
some early check from him or something
like<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.380> or<00:01:38.130> maybe<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.990> he's<00:01:39.990> using<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
like that or maybe just he's using the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.200 
like that or maybe just he's using the
gas<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> reactor<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.520> don't<00:01:41.880> know<00:01:41.939> we're

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
gas for a reactor I don't know we're

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.069 
gas for a reactor I don't know we're
about<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.570> see<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.939> meanwhile<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.540> Protoss

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
about to see and meanwhile the Protoss

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.770 
about to see and meanwhile the Protoss
is<00:01:46.380> being<00:01:46.649> persistent<00:01:47.130> he's<00:01:47.610> sending<00:01:48.149> another

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
is being persistent he's sending another

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.410 
is being persistent he's sending another
probe<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.649> scout<00:01:49.979> because<00:01:50.640> he<00:01:50.880> leads<00:01:51.180> that

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
probe to scout because he leads that

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.830 
probe to scout because he leads that
scouting<00:01:51.750> information<00:01:52.560> right<00:01:53.159> away<00:01:53.840> because

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
scouting information right away because

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.230 
scouting information right away because
terrence<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.649> go<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:56.070> lot<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.610> different

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
terrence can go a lot of different

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.800 
terrence can go a lot of different
things<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:58.110> starcraft<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:58.829> really<00:01:59.479> hard<00:02:00.479> to

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
things in starcraft it's really hard to

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.160 
things in starcraft it's really hard to
just<00:02:01.880> understand<00:02:02.880> what<00:02:03.360> bill<00:02:03.750> they're<00:02:03.930> going

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
just understand what bill they're going

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.260 
just understand what bill they're going
for<00:02:04.469> if<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.070> don't<00:02:05.250> scalp<00:02:05.549> them<00:02:05.759> for<00:02:06.000> long

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
for if you don't scalp them for long

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.690 
for if you don't scalp them for long
enough<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:07.259> we<00:02:07.439> can<00:02:07.469> see<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.740> second<00:02:08.340> barracks

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
enough so we can see a second barracks

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.720 
enough so we can see a second barracks
here<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.239> he<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:10.229> turtle<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.619> probably<00:02:11.220> going

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
here so he the turtle is probably going

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.650 
here so he the turtle is probably going
for

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
for

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.190 
for
a<00:02:12.980> lot<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.670> know<00:02:14.790> Marines<00:02:15.210> here<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:15.990> we
