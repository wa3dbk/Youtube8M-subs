00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:10.140
 Hello everyone I am today 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.850
 Released from yg Acoustic 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:19.600
 A speaker called Carmel 2 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:24.730
 In this video you will find a high pitched thin line high pitched speaker with Japanese high pitched child just in front of the center 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.200
 I would like to listen to this here , but the price of this speaker is 2.55 million yen 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:32.599
 It is against a pair 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:38.210
 It is good with 2 million yen pair, and it is 380,000 yen pair 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.989
 Seriously this old will compare yourself today in I think let's compared can it is here 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.610
 I need a speaker 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:49.160
 First, I think Fu which it will be easy to only explanation as will be described in detail later 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:53.040
 This is good for Tadd 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.820
 This is a 3 way floor standing speaker 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:01.630
 Price 2 million yen Reproduction frequency band 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:05.290
 It will be a speaker of 28 Hz to 100 khz 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:08.270
 Here is a new release of yg acoustic 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:13.189
 It becomes a speaker called Carmel 2 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:17.299
 The playback frequency band is very long narrow 2 way speaker 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:20.630
 The price is from 32hz to 40khz 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:25.130
 The pair will be priced at 2.55 million 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.770
 As a feature of the speakers that are using the enclosure carved a metal 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:33.789
 There is a feature 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.789
 It became famous to be here too, but it is a serious speaker this q 1 speaker 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:43.360
 For example though it is a feature of this speaker 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:46.480
 nano tech carbon nanotubes, the lightest and strongest fiber on earth 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.860
 And that it is equipped with 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.540
 A metal enclosure like that yg acoustic carmel 2 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.810
 It has the feature of having 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.930
 But it is this speaker though 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.440
 Sealed 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:06.860
 Despite the disadvantage of the bookshelf, how is the proposal for the reproduction frequency band? 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:13.790
 yg Same as Acoustic Carmel 2 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:17.120
 32hz can be played from a very low place attack that 50khz 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.910
 You can play up to a frequency 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.780
 Though it is software to argue next 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.470
 The noise of this river flowing through 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.680
 And 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.920
 Raw student Reinard is a string music player 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.180
 And 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.240
 This is Jazz, yes Guitar and Vocal 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.020
 It is from last live at Doug 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:43.350
 Listen to a song called Mora Lisa singing by Grace Maaya 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:47.400
 And here is a digest version though 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:52.290
 Nun I say that Japan then you become a jazz vocalist 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:56.230
 I think you and finally try to listen to it the song say that 500 miles singing 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:01.659
 This is a very emanating from I de non I Neumann Czech Philharmonic 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:05.920
 I think Fu called Let's go this second movement of the symphony 6 New World 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:11.920
 It is cd player but we have reflected in the name of this 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:16.750
 Todd 's d 600,250,000 preamp is Todd's c 60,280,000 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.680
 Power amplifier is a digital domain b is one million yen btl 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.560
 It says that since 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:26.209
 Ma'am amp alone is about 7.3 million Nema ah's here 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.370
 Well enough system to listen to a speaker of 2 million yen to nearly 4 million yen 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.080
 I think it seems like it's not 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.890
 It is such a system 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.890
 I think that we compare three kinds of speakers today
