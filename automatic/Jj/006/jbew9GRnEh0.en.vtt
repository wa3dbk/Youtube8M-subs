00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 how the load should be distributed in a 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.500
 van 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.459
 and towards the part of the space destined to 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.609
 the burden of distributing the load between 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:17.750
 the two axes of the net upload the most 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.750
 forward possible 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.960
 the correct answer 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.059
 and distributing the load between the two 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.170
 axes of the van the most towards 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.809
 possible ahead 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.809
 before a signal to yield the step placed 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.460
 next to a green light as I 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.089
 act response to happening without stopping 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.750
 because the traffic light is green see 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:53.540
 happening whenever a vehicle does not come 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.200
 the step must be given in 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.200
 any case 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.200
 correct answer my past whenever 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.380
 do not come a vehicle 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.799
 What is the most common test between 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.110
 drivers to measure their level of alcohol 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.990
 response to blood tests in a 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.590
 medical center after also the test 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.280
 of the ethylometer response before walking in 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.280
 straight line 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.240
 the correct answer to the proof of 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.240
 kilometer 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.780
 because older people suffer more 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.970
 abuses 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.360
 because of its difficulty in distinguishing 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.720
 colors of the hugs exposed from that 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.490
 his reflexes are slower costs faith 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.490
 because they pay less attention 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.220
 correct answer and because your reflexes 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.009
 they are slower 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.540
 in an emergency braking on your 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:19.080
 vehicle has abs of go to step on the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.690
 brake pedal intermittent CÃ©sarman 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.569
 step on the brake pedal until 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.689
 let's notice that it vibrates 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.689
 the brake pedal is fully pressed to 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.370
 the correct answer like that and the 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.550
 brake pedal 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:47.370
 ajn test the practical test 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.370
 driving with touching point is
