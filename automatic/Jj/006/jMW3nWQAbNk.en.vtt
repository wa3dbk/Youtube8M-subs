it<00:00:12.300> was<00:00:12.420> designed<00:00:12.690> as<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.870> reconnaissance

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
it was designed as a reconnaissance

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.310 
it was designed as a reconnaissance
vehicle<00:00:14.009> but<00:00:14.700> because<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.660> lack<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.839> tanks

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
vehicle but because of the lack of tanks

vehicle but because of the lack of tanks
we<00:00:16.440> had<00:00:16.619> at<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.980> start<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.220> Second<00:00:17.550> World<00:00:17.580> War

we had at the start of Second World War
it<00:00:18.750> was<00:00:18.810> used<00:00:18.960> as<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> frontline<00:00:20.369> vehicle<00:00:20.970> and

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
it was used as a frontline vehicle and

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.779 
it was used as a frontline vehicle and
subsequently<00:00:22.500> it's<00:00:22.830> quite<00:00:23.070> poor<00:00:23.369> combat

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
subsequently it's quite poor combat

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.689 
subsequently it's quite poor combat
record<00:00:24.119> because<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:25.430> but<00:00:26.430> for<00:00:26.550> its

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
record because of that but for its

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.230 
record because of that but for its
intended<00:00:27.000> role<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.480> was<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.689> pretty<00:00:28.170> decent

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
intended role it was a pretty decent

okay<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:42.809> onto<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> lego<00:00:43.710> model<00:00:43.920> as<00:00:44.190> always

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
okay so onto the lego model as always

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.400 
okay so onto the lego model as always
after<00:00:44.850> four<00:00:45.300> hundred<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.600> sixty<00:00:45.870> degree<00:00:46.110> pan

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
after four hundred and sixty degree pan

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.100 
after four hundred and sixty degree pan
first<00:00:47.329> so<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.480> get<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.690> look<00:00:48.870> at<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
first so you can get a look at the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.389 
first so you can get a look at the
overall<00:00:49.770> vehicle<00:00:51.590> I'm<00:00:52.590> pretty<00:00:52.860> pleased<00:00:53.190> with

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
overall vehicle I'm pretty pleased with

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.340 
overall vehicle I'm pretty pleased with
this<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.180> think<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.510> captures<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:54.960> really

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
this I think it captures the really

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.930 
this I think it captures the really
weird<00:00:55.739> look<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:57.590> Vickers<00:00:58.590> mark<00:00:58.890> six<00:00:59.219> it's

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
weird look of the Vickers mark six it's

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.630 
weird look of the Vickers mark six it's
a<00:01:00.000> very<00:01:00.300> very<00:01:00.600> weird-looking<00:01:01.109> tank<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.640> so

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
a very very weird-looking tank it's so

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.789 
a very very weird-looking tank it's so
different<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.809> every<00:01:04.080> other<00:01:04.170> tank<00:01:04.439> that's<00:01:04.650> out

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
different to every other tank that's out

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.350 
different to every other tank that's out
there<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:06.890> yeah<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.850> I'll<00:01:08.939> show<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.119> the

there but yeah so I'll show you the
track<00:01:10.290> area<00:01:10.500> first<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.130> running<00:01:11.400> gear<00:01:13.159> so<00:01:14.159> I'm

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
track area first the running gear so I'm

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.469 
track area first the running gear so I'm
pretty<00:01:14.430> pleased<00:01:14.640> with<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.390> my

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
pretty pleased with this this is for my

pretty pleased with this this is for my
favorite<00:01:15.659> parts<00:01:16.259> about<00:01:16.759> this<00:01:17.759> model<00:01:18.119> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
favorite parts about this model it

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.320 
favorite parts about this model it
captures<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.500> weird<00:01:20.400> looking<00:01:20.729> truck<00:01:21.000> area

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
captures the weird looking truck area

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.350 
captures the weird looking truck area
pretty<00:01:21.540> well<00:01:22.369> using<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.549> droid<00:01:23.820> arms<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
pretty well using the droid arms and the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.429 
pretty well using the droid arms and the
claw<00:01:24.600> piece<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.320> suspension<00:01:26.070> detail<00:01:27.439> you

claw piece for the suspension detail you

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.140 
claw piece for the suspension detail you
might<00:01:28.530> notice<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.009> mud<00:01:29.670> guards<00:01:29.939> are<00:01:30.030> also

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
might notice the mud guards are also

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.319 
might notice the mud guards are also
sloping<00:01:30.780> backwards<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:32.729> once<00:01:32.909> again<00:01:33.090> another

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
sloping backwards and once again another

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.359 
sloping backwards and once again another
weird<00:01:33.780> feature<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:34.799> tank<00:01:37.220> around<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
weird feature of this tank around the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.280 
weird feature of this tank around the
front<00:01:38.640> there's<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.090> two<00:01:39.390> tow<00:01:39.630> hooks<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
front there's the two tow hooks and the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.760 
front there's the two tow hooks and the
very<00:01:40.500> weird<00:01:40.920> front<00:01:41.280> slope<00:01:42.439> once<00:01:43.439> again<00:01:43.590> it's

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
very weird front slope once again it's

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.249 
very weird front slope once again it's
such<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> weird<00:01:44.490> auricular<00:01:44.939> looking<00:01:45.479> tank<00:01:45.720> it's

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
such a weird auricular looking tank it's

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.590 
such a weird auricular looking tank it's
all<00:01:46.380> over<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> place<00:01:46.970> it's<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.119> not<00:01:48.570> very

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
all over the place it's a not very

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.859 
all over the place it's a not very
standard<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.259> say<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.530> least

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
standard to say the least

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.810 
standard to say the least
now<00:01:51.869> onto<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.439> other<00:01:52.890> side<00:01:53.750> you've<00:01:54.750> got<00:01:55.820> this

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
now onto the other side you've got this

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
now onto the other side you've got this
up<00:01:57.060> weird<00:01:57.329> overhang<00:01:57.930> on<00:01:58.079> one<00:01:58.200> side<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:59.840> the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
up weird overhang on one side and the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.359 
up weird overhang on one side and the
exhaust<00:02:01.320> pipe<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:03.560> going<00:02:04.560> round<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.130> rear

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
exhaust pipe and going round to the rear

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.240 
exhaust pipe and going round to the rear
this<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.299> once<00:02:06.719> again<00:02:06.780> another<00:02:06.930> fairly<00:02:07.890> unique

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
this is once again another fairly unique

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.110 
this is once again another fairly unique
thing<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.789> tank<00:02:09.119> has<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.280> slope<00:02:11.280> which<00:02:11.580> starts

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
thing this tank has a slope which starts

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.530 
thing this tank has a slope which starts
actually<00:02:12.510> before

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
actually before

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.880 
actually before
or<00:02:13.599> this<00:02:14.590> last<00:02:15.459> will<00:02:15.849> and<00:02:16.500> goes<00:02:17.500> all<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:17.769> way

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
or this last will and goes all the way

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.830 
or this last will and goes all the way
up<00:02:18.099> to<00:02:18.280> sort<00:02:18.519> of<00:02:18.609> roughly<00:02:19.209> there<00:02:19.420> as<00:02:19.599> you<00:02:19.719> can

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
up to sort of roughly there as you can

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.259 
up to sort of roughly there as you can
see<00:02:19.989> and<00:02:20.230> then<00:02:20.890> straight<00:02:21.310> from<00:02:21.579> that<00:02:21.760> point<00:02:22.030> to

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
see and then straight from that point to

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.690 
see and then straight from that point to
where<00:02:22.299> it<00:02:22.420> stops<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:23.049> have<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.530> normal<00:02:24.129> type

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
where it stops you have the normal type

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.030 
where it stops you have the normal type
of<00:02:24.849> slope<00:02:25.079> going<00:02:26.079> up<00:02:26.290> towards<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.799> back<00:02:26.950> of

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
of slope going up towards the back of

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.289 
of slope going up towards the back of
the<00:02:27.099> turret<00:02:27.280> once<00:02:27.579> again<00:02:27.700> it's<00:02:27.819> just<00:02:27.879> such<00:02:28.269> a

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
the turret once again it's just such a

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.710 
the turret once again it's just such a
bizarre<00:02:28.569> looking<00:02:28.930> vehicle<00:02:30.120> very<00:02:31.120> very<00:02:31.480> unique

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
bizarre looking vehicle very very unique

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.890 
bizarre looking vehicle very very unique
in<00:02:32.049> we're<00:02:32.230> designed<00:02:32.909> but<00:02:33.909> so<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.390> kind<00:02:34.689> of<00:02:34.720> like

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
in we're designed but so I kind of like

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.229 
in we're designed but so I kind of like
it<00:02:34.930> because<00:02:35.109> that<00:02:35.470> is<00:02:35.620> very<00:02:35.650> overly<00:02:36.340> but<00:02:36.579> so

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
it because that is very overly but so

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.280 
it because that is very overly but so
nice<00:02:37.959> to<00:02:38.200> look<00:02:38.319> at<00:02:38.470> same<00:02:38.799> time<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:40.109> then<00:02:41.109> onto

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
nice to look at same time and then onto

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.440 
nice to look at same time and then onto
the<00:02:41.680> turret<00:02:42.220> turret<00:02:42.700> was<00:02:42.909> kind<00:02:43.090> of<00:02:43.120> thrown

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
the turret turret was kind of thrown

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.809 
the turret turret was kind of thrown
together<00:02:43.599> I<00:02:44.049> had<00:02:44.560> this<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:45.310> whole<00:02:45.340> of<00:02:45.670> this

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
together I had this the whole of this

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.940 
together I had this the whole of this
land<00:02:46.090> around<00:02:46.209> for<00:02:46.420> ages<00:02:46.510> soldiers<00:02:46.989> I<00:02:47.230> wants<00:02:47.859> to

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
land around for ages soldiers I wants to

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.170 
land around for ages soldiers I wants to
get<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.069> video<00:02:48.310> out<00:02:48.340> so<00:02:48.579> I<00:02:48.609> just<00:02:48.639> threw<00:02:49.060> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
get a video out so I just threw the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.409 
get a video out so I just threw the
turret<00:02:49.450> together<00:02:51.090> subsequently<00:02:52.090> because

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:52.419 
turret together subsequently because

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:54.800 
turret together subsequently because
that<00:02:52.569> doesn't<00:02:52.840> have<00:02:52.930> any<00:02:53.079> opened<00:02:53.379> hatches

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
that doesn't have any opened hatches

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.839 
that doesn't have any opened hatches
but<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:55.959> does<00:02:56.109> rotate<00:02:56.319> 360<00:02:57.099> degrees<00:02:57.430> without

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
but it does rotate 360 degrees without

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.409 
but it does rotate 360 degrees without
any<00:02:58.269> issues<00:02:58.659> whatsoever<00:02:58.840> as<00:02:59.560> you<00:02:59.739> can<00:02:59.859> see<00:03:00.419> and

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:01.419 
any issues whatsoever as you can see and

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:04.349 
any issues whatsoever as you can see and
it's<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:02.109> pretty<00:03:02.500> pretty<00:03:03.250> decent<00:03:03.819> I<00:03:03.849> can<00:03:04.030> turret

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
it's a pretty pretty decent I can turret

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.240 
it's a pretty pretty decent I can turret
and<00:03:04.450> nonetheless<00:03:04.989> with<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.739> in<00:03:05.859> turn<00:03:06.010> around

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
and nonetheless with the in turn around

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:14.640 
and nonetheless with the in turn around
the<00:03:06.340> back<00:03:10.139> the<00:03:11.139> gun<00:03:11.379> does<00:03:12.250> depress<00:03:13.439> those<00:03:14.439> you

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
the back the gun does depress those you

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.379 
the back the gun does depress those you
who<00:03:14.859> don't<00:03:15.069> know<00:03:15.189> don't<00:03:15.790> know<00:03:15.939> what<00:03:16.269> that

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
who don't know don't know what that

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:17.640 
who don't know don't know what that
means<00:03:16.599> that<00:03:16.780> eighty<00:03:16.930> means<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.290> gun<00:03:17.439> can

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
means that eighty means the gun can

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.099 
means that eighty means the gun can
point<00:03:17.859> downwards<00:03:18.329> common<00:03:19.329> point<00:03:19.569> upwards

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
point downwards common point upwards

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.219 
point downwards common point upwards
from<00:03:20.349> its<00:03:20.560> horizontal<00:03:20.799> position<00:03:21.099> but<00:03:21.760> as<00:03:22.269> you

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:23.229 
from its horizontal position but as you

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:26.099 
from its horizontal position but as you
can<00:03:23.319> see<00:03:23.379> can<00:03:23.680> point<00:03:23.889> downwards<00:03:24.310> so<00:03:25.109> far

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
can see can point downwards so far

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.500 
can see can point downwards so far
adding<00:03:26.500> one<00:03:26.829> or<00:03:26.919> two<00:03:27.040> features<00:03:27.400> hoon<00:03:27.549> that<00:03:27.760> so

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
adding one or two features hoon that so

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.050 
adding one or two features hoon that so
overall<00:03:29.169> I'm<00:03:29.470> pretty<00:03:29.620> p2<00:03:29.979> this<00:03:30.129> model<00:03:30.790> and

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
overall I'm pretty p2 this model and

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.520 
overall I'm pretty p2 this model and
that's<00:03:31.540> what<00:03:31.659> is<00:03:31.750> this<00:03:31.840> a<00:03:31.930> model<00:03:32.199> rather<00:03:32.379> than

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
that's what is this a model rather than

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.210 
that's what is this a model rather than
a<00:03:32.739> workings<00:03:33.519> of<00:03:33.639> toy<00:03:34.290> but<00:03:35.290> I'm<00:03:35.500> really<00:03:35.799> sir<00:03:36.190> I

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
a workings of toy but I'm really sir I

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.069 
a workings of toy but I'm really sir I
think<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:36.549> captures<00:03:36.729> the<00:03:36.940> love<00:03:37.150> Koufos<00:03:37.569> weird

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
think it captures the love Koufos weird

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.089 
think it captures the love Koufos weird
ugly<00:03:38.470> looking<00:03:38.739> tank<00:03:39.040> is<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:40.870> reference<00:03:41.799> of

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
ugly looking tank is a reference of

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.390 
ugly looking tank is a reference of
scale<00:03:43.090> size<00:03:43.709> so<00:03:44.709> as<00:03:44.769> you<00:03:44.829> can<00:03:44.919> see<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.129> top<00:03:45.280> of

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
scale size so as you can see the top of

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.159 
scale size so as you can see the top of
the<00:03:45.459> minifigures<00:03:45.849> head<00:03:46.060> is<00:03:46.209> roughly<00:03:46.659> nine<00:03:46.930> the

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
the minifigures head is roughly nine the

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.530 
the minifigures head is roughly nine the
top<00:03:47.680> of<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:47.829> hole<00:03:47.979> here<00:03:48.239> gives<00:03:49.239> you<00:03:49.299> a<00:03:49.359> bit<00:03:49.510> of

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
top of the hole here gives you a bit of

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.460 
top of the hole here gives you a bit of
a<00:03:49.659> better<00:03:49.930> perspective<00:03:51.959> so<00:03:52.959> you<00:03:52.989> can<00:03:53.199> sort<00:03:53.440> of

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
a better perspective so you can sort of

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.729 
a better perspective so you can sort of
see<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:54.299> roughly<00:03:55.299> how<00:03:55.359> big<00:03:55.389> is<00:03:55.690> so<00:03:56.169> it's<00:03:56.349> decent

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
see it roughly how big is so it's decent

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.490 
see it roughly how big is so it's decent
size<00:03:56.919> even<00:03:57.370> with<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.870> word<00:03:59.079> scale<00:03:59.319> for

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
size even with the word scale for

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.449 
size even with the word scale for
minifigure<00:03:59.949> it<00:04:00.069> works<00:04:00.250> relatively<00:04:00.760> well<00:04:02.459> and

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
minifigure it works relatively well and

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.490 
minifigure it works relatively well and
that's<00:04:03.939> pretty<00:04:04.449> much<00:04:04.599> it<00:04:04.840> so<00:04:07.049> yeah<00:04:08.049> that's

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
that's pretty much it so yeah that's

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.429 
that's pretty much it so yeah that's
made<00:04:09.010> for<00:04:09.129> the<00:04:09.250> most<00:04:09.400> part<00:04:09.609> I<00:04:10.319> apologize<00:04:11.319> for
