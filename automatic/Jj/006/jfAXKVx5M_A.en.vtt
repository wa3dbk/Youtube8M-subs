00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.210
 well as soon as he left her too much 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.210
 in the various 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.790
 we hear of the states low state 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.650

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.590
 use this piece well listened by 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.990
 to work 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.660
 the disc 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:58.610
 more beautiful like this 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:02.020
 expensive but what is he using for andrea 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:10.820
 Well, what did you use to mock 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:16.250
 for near your near 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:18.260
 of the twelfth fret a past grandfather 87 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.730
 on 5 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.160
 this ok goes directly to the card 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.560
 of apo cia eight thousand and are very 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.630
 characterizing 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.040
 and then it is a side link but at the end 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.940
 I don't even know why because I know myself 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.650
 liked side in corner of the sila 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.650
 to see to define it with strange that 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:46.260
 European network name management and it does 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.330
 on the val this here this pre chi 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.150
 you have seen thousands of studies around 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.400
 for the wall is more an experiment the 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.290
 try very well 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.410
 we make it feel like it sounds 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.410
 Go 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.760
 it is presented with a classic straming 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.130
 with a soft pick then go 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.250
 very well 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.250
 no 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.490
 people are better to say doctors than 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.970
 instrument but also of how it comes 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.350
 treated because in short it is thanks to 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.790
 these instruments that then sound 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.620
 manages to come out more faithfully 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.960
 possible therefore we have helium here 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.480
 exhausted from the difficulty of registering 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:33.250
 guitars that we had pushed and on 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:36.700
 sofa in a garbage fashion 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:40.390
 to zoom in i am loosening it from 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:44.190
 warm and dal and lard is unique here 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.190
 that we have set up we reach 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:51.330
 here we are in the recording room yes 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:53.219
 double no guitars as it is 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.710
 done yesterday to give a little taste 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:57.599
 different with the different hand above all 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.080
 the amusing guitar found a pay 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:03.599
 them 214 that this is the vision that 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.629
 we have that acted andrea modo 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:10.249
 then there are expected to be a little bit like 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:10.249
 of cerium the control point 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.120
 you can be a friend, all that 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:20.370
 you want so much revise it and then turn it 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:24.240

 the squad fired 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.680
 I will also ask for fear 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.820
