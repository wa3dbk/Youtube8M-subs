00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.530
 taking things but understood 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.710
 You have to find a good way to get 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.840
 So that's the way the commands go. 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.879
 leave in the video description because I 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.029
 I am not reminded that there are eight commands 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.029

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.770
 people 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.920
 in the last one the people bug to that 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.280
 black bug I investigated 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.370

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:01.630
 not only is it an island cow that of dimba no 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.880

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:12.310
 but the spider also made money 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:14.410
 There's nothing like that , so a pirate is already there. 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:20.140
 I know if this card always pops out 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:23.710
