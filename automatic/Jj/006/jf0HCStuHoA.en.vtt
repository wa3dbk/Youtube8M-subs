career it's watching Rita and Tessa work
together<00:04:50.910> and<00:04:51.390> they<00:04:52.140> really<00:04:52.410> kind<00:04:52.590> of<00:04:52.710> create

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
together and they really kind of create

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.460 
together and they really kind of create
ideas<00:04:53.610> together<00:04:53.850> and<00:04:54.240> be<00:04:54.390> able<00:04:54.540> to<00:04:54.690> say<00:04:54.870> just

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
ideas together and be able to say just

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.260 
ideas together and be able to say just
craziest<00:04:56.130> stuff<00:04:56.340> and<00:04:56.550> somehow<00:04:56.730> test<00:04:57.030> all<00:04:57.210> it

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
craziest stuff and somehow test all it

makes<00:04:57.419> sense<00:04:57.600> of<00:04:57.780> it<00:04:57.840> it<00:04:57.990> would<00:04:59.120> just<00:05:00.120> magic<00:05:01.080> so

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
makes sense of it it would just magic so

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.530 
makes sense of it it would just magic so
it's<00:05:01.620> kind<00:05:01.800> of<00:05:01.830> neat<00:05:02.040> for<00:05:02.370> me<00:05:02.520> sometimes<00:05:03.450> I

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
but I guess what I'm trying to say as we

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.600 
but I guess what I'm trying to say as we

us about I mean it's always changing in
this<00:05:31.550> world<00:05:32.550> I'm<00:05:32.730> sure<00:05:32.820> but<00:05:33.450> as<00:05:34.080> far<00:05:34.320> as<00:05:34.350> the

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
this world I'm sure but as far as the

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.500 
this world I'm sure but as far as the
phileo<00:05:35.250> of<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:35.550> program<00:05:35.940> in<00:05:36.090> the<00:05:36.180> initial

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
phileo of the program in the initial

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.400 
phileo of the program in the initial
process<00:05:37.320> I<00:05:38.540> think<00:05:39.540> price<00:05:39.870> dance<00:05:40.110> is<00:05:40.290> my

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410

process I think price dance is my
parental<00:05:40.680> but<00:05:41.370> like<00:05:41.640> Scott<00:05:41.880> said<00:05:42.060> we're

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
parental but like Scott said we're

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.730 
parental but like Scott said we're
taking<00:05:42.480> a<00:05:42.510> lot<00:05:42.630> more<00:05:42.780> responsibility<00:05:43.440> as<00:05:43.560> you

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
taking a lot more responsibility as you

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.650 
taking a lot more responsibility as you
get<00:05:43.860> older<00:05:44.160> and<00:05:44.280> and<00:05:44.820> what<00:05:45.060> we<00:05:45.180> put<00:05:45.330> up<00:05:45.390> there

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
get older and and what we put up there

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.620 
get older and and what we put up there
and<00:05:45.870> we<00:05:46.290> want<00:05:46.470> to<00:05:46.530> be
