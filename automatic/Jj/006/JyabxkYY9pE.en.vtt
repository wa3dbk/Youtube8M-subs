by 4 plate pieces and one 4 by 4 piece
like<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.980> next<00:00:28.980> what<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.340> want<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.640> get<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.119> a

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
like that next what you want to get is a

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:36.400 
like that next what you want to get is a
single<00:00:31.759> 2<00:00:32.759> by<00:00:32.969> 8<00:00:33.210> piece<00:00:33.540> or<00:00:33.780> two<00:00:34.170> 2<00:00:34.590> by<00:00:34.640> 4<00:00:35.640> pieces

single 2 by 8 piece or two 2 by 4 pieces

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.369 
single 2 by 8 piece or two 2 by 4 pieces
and<00:00:37.410> put<00:00:37.649> them<00:00:37.680> like<00:00:38.420> so<00:00:39.680> next<00:00:40.680> get<00:00:42.110> get<00:00:43.110> two

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
and put them like so next get get two

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.010 
and put them like so next get get two
two<00:00:43.739> by<00:00:43.920> three<00:00:44.160> pieces<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.969> put<00:00:45.270> them<00:00:45.680> so<00:00:48.020> then

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
two by three pieces and put them so then

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.090 
two by three pieces and put them so then
you'll<00:00:49.200> see<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.710> kind<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.280> pattern<00:00:52.100> next

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
you'll see this kind of pattern next

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.810 
you'll see this kind of pattern next
what<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.610> want<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.850> get<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.270> 4<00:00:54.890> 3<00:00:55.890> by<00:00:56.129> 3<00:00:56.340> angle

what you want to get is 4 3 by 3 angle

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.930 
what you want to get is 4 3 by 3 angle
pieces<00:00:57.140> and<00:00:58.250> put<00:00:59.250> them<00:01:00.109> there<00:01:01.640> just<00:01:02.640> keep

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
pieces and put them there just keep

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:11.030 
pieces and put them there just keep
doing<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:04.040> each<00:01:05.040> side<00:01:09.680> next<00:01:10.680> what<00:01:10.890> you

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
doing that for each side next what you

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.070 
doing that for each side next what you
want<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.280> get<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.790> these<00:01:12.630> 2<00:01:13.049> by<00:01:13.229> 2<00:01:13.260> L<00:01:13.920> pieces<00:01:15.080> put

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
want to get is these 2 by 2 L pieces put

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.700 
want to get is these 2 by 2 L pieces put
them<00:01:16.159> like<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:18.950> just<00:01:20.900> do<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.020> for<00:01:22.200> every<00:01:22.680> single

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
them like so just do it for every single

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.819 
them like so just do it for every single
sign<00:01:24.680> so<00:01:26.630> now<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:28.110> basic<00:01:28.530> shape<00:01:28.799> of

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
sign so now that the basic shape of

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.520 
sign so now that the basic shape of
phase<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:30.119> complete<00:01:32.479> this<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.869> kind<00:01:34.409> of

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
phase is complete this is this kind of

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.450 
phase is complete this is this kind of
the<00:01:34.799> secret<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:36.380> why<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.409> call<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.770> phase<00:01:38.130> and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
the secret to why I call it phase and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.800 
the secret to why I call it phase and
why<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.000> don't<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.170> much<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:41.600> as<00:01:42.600> you

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
why I don't like it so much this as you

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.770 
why I don't like it so much this as you
might<00:01:42.990> know<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:44.369> fusion<00:01:45.329> wheel<00:01:45.570> is

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
might know this is this fusion wheel is

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.910 
might know this is this fusion wheel is
inspired<00:01:46.380> by<00:01:46.439> thermal<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.880> add<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.899> kind<00:01:49.829> of

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
inspired by thermal so I add I kind of

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.880 
inspired by thermal so I add I kind of
added<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.490> ability<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.030> kind<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.630> distort<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
added the ability to kind of distort the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.289 
added the ability to kind of distort the
air<00:01:53.430> around<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:55.070> we<00:01:56.070> get<00:01:56.250> these<00:01:56.570> plate<00:01:59.299> tile

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
air around it so we get these plate tile

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.889 
air around it so we get these plate tile
pieces<00:02:00.979> and<00:02:02.000> put<00:02:03.000> them<00:02:03.170> in<00:02:04.170> there<00:02:04.469> like<00:02:04.649> that

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
pieces and put them in there like that

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.010 
pieces and put them in there like that
then<00:02:06.899> do<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.350> for<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.069> rest<00:02:08.720> rest<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.899> the

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
then do that for the rest rest of the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:21.100 
then do that for the rest rest of the
sides

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.040 

notice<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.260> it's<00:02:22.470> actually<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.860> very<00:02:23.280> thin

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
notice that it's actually a very thin

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.630 
notice that it's actually a very thin
thin<00:02:25.050> piece<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:26.390> you<00:02:27.390> can<00:02:27.570> add<00:02:27.980> two<00:02:28.980> by<00:02:29.250> three

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
thin piece and you can add two by three

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.170 
thin piece and you can add two by three
pieces<00:02:30.060> like<00:02:30.570> that<00:02:31.040> like<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.760> prefer

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
pieces like that like so but I prefer

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.660 
pieces like that like so but I prefer
not<00:02:33.420> using<00:02:33.840> them<00:02:34.020> but<00:02:34.290> if<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.590> do<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:35.160> them<00:02:35.430> you

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
not using them but if you do of them you

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.740 
not using them but if you do of them you
still<00:02:35.880> need<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.240> give<00:02:36.900> credit<00:02:37.380> for<00:02:38.360> face<00:02:39.360> and

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
still need to give credit for face and

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.200 
still need to give credit for face and
name<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.230> phase<00:02:40.470> or<00:02:40.770> phase<00:02:41.220> version<00:02:41.970> 10<00:02:42.120> or

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
name it phase or phase version 10 or

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.820 
name it phase or phase version 10 or
something

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
something

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.760 
something
yeah<00:02:44.300> and<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:46.560> phase<00:02:47.030> phases<00:02:48.030> default<00:02:48.770> control

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
yeah and so phase phases default control

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.610 
yeah and so phase phases default control
wheel<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.340> gyro<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.240> I'm<00:02:51.870> just<00:02:52.110> going<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.380> build

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
wheel is gyro so I'm just going to build

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:01.180 
wheel is gyro so I'm just going to build
general<00:02:53.100> right<00:02:53.280> now

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.360 

so<00:03:02.190> there's<00:03:02.580> phase<00:03:03.060> gyro<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.890> it's<00:03:04.890> default

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
so there's phase gyro and it's default

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.870 
so there's phase gyro and it's default
kind<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:06.030> track<00:03:06.300> is<00:03:06.620> 7<00:03:07.620> l<00:03:08.870> 7<00:03:09.870> L<00:03:10.080> and<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:11.220> tip<00:03:11.580> is

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
kind of track is 7 l 7 L and the tip is

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.620 
kind of track is 7 l 7 L and the tip is
s<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.990> W<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:15.240> second<00:03:15.660> version<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:16.910> more<00:03:17.910> smooth

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
s to W the second version of more smooth

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.250 
s to W the second version of more smooth
wide<00:03:19.250> right<00:03:20.250> there<00:03:20.510> there<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.660> go<00:03:21.870> you've

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
wide right there there you go you've

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:32.060 
wide right there there you go you've
made<00:03:22.790> you've<00:03:23.790> made<00:03:24.260> phase<00:03:26.060> phase<00:03:27.060> gyro<00:03:30.260> 7<00:03:31.260> L<00:03:31.470> s

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
made you've made phase phase gyro 7 L s
