blush but this one I used to contouring

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.470 
blush but this one I used to contouring

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.740 

so<00:03:36.159> you'll<00:03:36.310> see<00:03:36.519> I<00:03:36.549> kind<00:03:36.849> of<00:03:36.909> had<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.120> in<00:03:37.390> and

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
so you'll see I kind of had it in and

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.440 
so you'll see I kind of had it in and
then<00:03:37.840> i<00:03:37.959> blend<00:03:38.319> it<00:03:38.640> once<00:03:39.640> I<00:03:39.790> have<00:03:39.970> that<00:03:40.000> color

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450

pigment<00:03:41.200> on<00:03:41.409> my<00:03:42.220> cheek<00:03:42.580> so<00:03:43.330> again<00:03:43.540> I'm<00:03:43.780> going

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
pigment on my cheek so again I'm going

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.720 
pigment on my cheek so again I'm going
to<00:03:44.019> go<00:03:44.170> with<00:03:44.409> the<00:03:44.620> darker<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.250> just<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.580> little

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
to go with the darker and just a little

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.690 
to go with the darker and just a little
bit<00:03:45.940> of<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.150> light<00:03:46.360> and<00:03:47.319> just<00:03:47.920> draw<00:03:48.220> out<00:03:48.459> that

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
bit of the light and just draw out that

00:03:48.700 --> 00:04:00.900 
bit of the light and just draw out that
line<00:03:48.909> and<00:03:49.239> then<00:03:49.629> I<00:03:49.720> begin<00:03:50.019> to<00:03:50.080> blend

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.090 

so<00:04:01.450> there's<00:04:01.900> those<00:04:02.140> treats<00:04:02.470> all<00:04:02.680> lined<00:04:02.920> out

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
then I pull it down a little bit on my

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.830 
then I pull it down a little bit on my
neck<00:04:08.770> so<00:04:09.430> doing<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:09.910> exact<00:04:10.300> same<00:04:10.330> thing<00:04:10.720> I'm

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
around my hairline where the Sun

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.870 
around my hairline where the Sun
naturally<00:04:19.030> would<00:04:19.180> be<00:04:19.360> touching<00:04:20.280> if<00:04:21.280> I<00:04:21.730> were

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
naturally would be touching if I were

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:31.439 
naturally would be touching if I were
outside

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.540 

but<00:04:32.020> you'll<00:04:32.169> see<00:04:32.379> that<00:04:32.559> those<00:04:32.800> to<00:04:33.099> connect

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550
