got the two little mountains they're

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.240 
got the two little mountains they're
restricted<00:00:18.180> key<00:00:18.960> way<00:00:19.109> not<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.410> narrow<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
restricted key way not so narrow on the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.490 
restricted key way not so narrow on the
left<00:00:20.520> as<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.760> was<00:00:21.029> on<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.330> other<00:00:21.449> one<00:00:21.660> but

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
sorry it's a new lock I bought this one

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.610 
sorry it's a new lock I bought this one
in<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:39.030> think<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.930> bought<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.440> Burundi<00:00:41.100> a

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
in I think I bought this in Burundi a

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.740 
in I think I bought this in Burundi a
similar<00:00:43.620> key<00:00:43.829> way<00:00:44.040> kind<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.030> same<00:00:45.270> region

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
similar key way kind of the same region

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.680 
similar key way kind of the same region
of<00:00:46.789> Africa<00:00:47.789> let's<00:00:48.000> see<00:00:48.090> if<00:00:48.149> we<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.420> get<00:00:48.570> into

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
of Africa let's see if we can get into

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.369 
of Africa let's see if we can get into
this<00:00:48.840> thing<00:00:49.050> though<00:00:50.360> I<00:00:51.360> have<00:00:51.899> never<00:00:52.110> picked

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
this thing though I have never picked

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.560 
this thing though I have never picked
this<00:00:52.530> before<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.129> out<00:00:53.280> these<00:00:54.090> locks<00:00:54.420> are

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
this before this is out these locks are

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.380 
this before this is out these locks are
out<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> bottom<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.289> my<00:00:55.320> bucket<00:00:56.239> okay<00:00:57.239> let

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
out of the bottom of my bucket okay let

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.029 
out of the bottom of my bucket okay let
me<00:00:57.480> move<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.260> hear<00:00:58.410> me<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.829> zoom

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
me move this just to hear me we can zoom

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.889 
me move this just to hear me we can zoom
in<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.730> little<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.239> get<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> better<00:01:00.570> look<00:01:00.809> of

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
in a little and you get a better look of

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.750 
in a little and you get a better look of
what<00:01:00.989> I'm<00:01:01.079> doing<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:02.390> think<00:01:03.390> that'll<00:01:03.840> work

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
what I'm doing I think that'll work

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.920 
what I'm doing I think that'll work
okay<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> little<00:01:05.970> bit<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.270> tension<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
okay a little bit of tension on the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.570 
okay a little bit of tension on the
tension<00:01:07.260> wrench<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.770> let's<00:01:08.040> see<00:01:08.189> if<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.400> can

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
tension wrench in let's see if we can

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.070 
tension wrench in let's see if we can
find<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.420> binding<00:01:09.780> pin<00:01:11.630> without<00:01:12.630> getting<00:01:12.900> too

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
find a binding pin without getting too

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.830 
find a binding pin without getting too
stuck

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:25.830 

okay<00:01:17.710> I'm<00:01:17.799> gonna<00:01:17.920> try<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.220> go<00:01:18.400> from<00:01:18.580> this<00:01:18.880> side

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.450 

harder<00:01:26.840> for<00:01:26.990> you<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.320> see<00:01:27.560> I<00:01:27.590> realized<00:01:27.979> that

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
harder for you to see I realized that

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.670 
harder for you to see I realized that
but<00:01:28.790> that<00:01:29.420> other<00:01:29.570> side<00:01:29.840> that<00:01:30.110> pick

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
but that other side that pick

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.910 
but that other side that pick
I<00:01:31.330> just<00:01:32.330> got<00:01:32.540> hung<00:01:32.840> up<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:33.259> rather<00:01:33.409> than<00:01:33.650> go

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
I just got hung up and rather than go

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.950 
I just got hung up and rather than go
through<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:37.210> crap<00:01:38.210> it's<00:01:38.420> really<00:01:38.750> difficult

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
through that crap it's really difficult

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.800 
through that crap it's really difficult
for<00:01:39.380> you<00:01:39.500> I'm<00:01:39.649> going<00:01:39.799> to<00:01:39.860> turn<00:01:39.950> this<00:01:40.159> sideways

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
for you I'm going to turn this sideways

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.830 
for you I'm going to turn this sideways
there<00:01:41.810> we<00:01:41.930> go<00:01:43.090> make<00:01:44.090> this<00:01:44.210> work<00:01:44.450> for<00:01:44.659> both<00:01:44.810> of

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
there we go make this work for both of

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.639 
there we go make this work for both of
us<00:01:45.200> okay<00:01:47.200> I<00:01:48.200> got<00:01:48.409> just<00:01:48.680> got<00:01:48.740> a<00:01:49.100> fault<00:01:49.549> set<00:01:50.649> so

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
us okay I got just got a fault set so

00:01:51.649 --> 00:02:07.990 
us okay I got just got a fault set so
has<00:01:52.009> at<00:01:52.159> least<00:01:52.280> one<00:01:52.549> security<00:01:53.090> pin<00:01:53.270> in<00:01:53.420> there

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.140 

and<00:02:08.600> I'm<00:02:08.899> hung<00:02:09.110> up<00:02:09.290> behind<00:02:09.770> that<00:02:09.979> first<00:02:10.399> pin<00:02:10.880> I

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
and I'm hung up behind that first pin I

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:19.840 
and I'm hung up behind that first pin I
think<00:02:12.220> there<00:02:13.220> we<00:02:13.310> go

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.020 

okay<00:02:20.850> got<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.120> deeper<00:02:21.480> fault<00:02:21.720> set<00:02:21.960> so<00:02:22.730> these<00:02:23.730> two

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
okay got a deeper fault set so these two

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:52.340 
okay got a deeper fault set so these two
security<00:02:24.450> pins

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.920 

so<00:02:53.350> I<00:02:53.380> got<00:02:53.590> some<00:02:53.740> springiness<00:02:54.190> in<00:02:54.460> there

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
so I got some springiness in there

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.720 
so I got some springiness in there
looking<00:02:55.930> for<00:02:56.080> that<00:02:56.170> binding<00:02:56.620> pin<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.220> my<00:02:57.310> fear

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
looking for that binding pin and my fear

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.760 
looking for that binding pin and my fear
is<00:02:57.940> that<00:02:57.970> I<00:02:58.240> pushed<00:02:58.750> them<00:02:58.930> below<00:02:59.350> those<00:02:59.560> two

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
is that I pushed them below those two

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.120 
is that I pushed them below those two
little<00:03:00.040> mountains<00:03:01.320> I'll<00:03:02.320> level<00:03:02.590> with<00:03:02.710> I<00:03:02.860> can't

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
little mountains I'll level with I can't

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.880 
little mountains I'll level with I can't
my<00:03:03.670> pick<00:03:03.910> won't<00:03:04.180> curve<00:03:04.570> down<00:03:05.020> to<00:03:05.410> push<00:03:05.650> them

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
my pick won't curve down to push them

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.360 
my pick won't curve down to push them
