this<00:00:00.870> is<00:00:01.050> my<00:00:01.230> cycle<00:00:01.860> cart<00:00:02.100> for<00:00:02.370> an<00:00:02.460> end<00:00:02.610> the

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
this is my cycle cart for an end the

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.400 
this is my cycle cart for an end the
front<00:00:03.090> end<00:00:03.270> is<00:00:03.360> pretty<00:00:03.540> much<00:00:03.750> complete<00:00:04.200> at

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
front end is pretty much complete at

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.839 
front end is pretty much complete at
this<00:00:04.589> point<00:00:05.569> you<00:00:06.569> see<00:00:06.839> here<00:00:07.109> that<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.440> you

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:07.849 
this point you see here that the you

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.830 
this point you see here that the you
u-joints<00:00:08.849> connecting<00:00:09.210> axle<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:09.900> springs

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
u-joints connecting axle to the springs

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.150 
u-joints connecting axle to the springs
here's<00:00:12.840> my<00:00:13.019> steering<00:00:13.469> mechanism<00:00:15.859> you<00:00:16.859> can<00:00:16.920> see

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
here's my steering mechanism you can see

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.109 
here's my steering mechanism you can see
it<00:00:17.279> finds<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.820> little<00:00:18.060> bit<00:00:18.180> turning<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.109> way

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
it finds a little bit turning this way

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.120 
it finds a little bit turning this way
where's<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.300> way<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.260> not<00:00:22.439> doesn't

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
where's this way but it's not doesn't

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.070 
where's this way but it's not doesn't
make<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.550> much<00:00:23.730> difference<00:00:23.760> really<00:00:24.269> I've

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
make that much difference really I've

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:34.639 
make that much difference really I've
got<00:00:28.939> you<00:00:29.939> can<00:00:30.090> see<00:00:30.269> here<00:00:31.160> how<00:00:33.530> lengthen<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
got you can see here how lengthen the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.139 
got you can see here how lengthen the
steering<00:00:35.070> column<00:00:35.250> by<00:00:35.550> cutting<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.120> half

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
steering column by cutting it in half

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.580 
steering column by cutting it in half
and<00:00:36.540> putting<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.870> pipe<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.290> middle<00:00:37.500> now

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
and putting this pipe in the middle now

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.729 
and putting this pipe in the middle now
that<00:00:37.829> means<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:39.690> little<00:00:39.930> collars<00:00:40.379> can't

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
that means that the little collars can't

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.410 
that means that the little collars can't
pass<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.370> part<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.200> also<00:00:44.180> because<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.270> this

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
pass this part and also because of this

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.290 
pass this part and also because of this
they<00:00:45.750> can't<00:00:45.989> be<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.590> end<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.120> I've<00:00:48.120> got

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
they can't be on this end so I've got

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.479 
they can't be on this end so I've got
these<00:00:48.420> little<00:00:48.480> collars<00:00:49.050> all<00:00:49.289> up<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> top

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
these little collars all up on the top

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.270 
these little collars all up on the top
end<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.539> put<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.840> piece<00:00:52.110> here<00:00:52.559> for<00:00:53.160> them

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
end and I put this piece here for them

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.010 
end and I put this piece here for them
to<00:00:53.370> press<00:00:53.579> against<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.180> side<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.809> then

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
to press against on this side and then

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.080 
to press against on this side and then
the<00:00:55.289> other<00:00:55.410> one<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.590> right<00:00:55.949> there<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.940> that

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the other one is right there so that

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.569 
the other one is right there so that
keeps<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.510> steering<00:00:57.930> column<00:00:58.109> from<00:00:58.620> moving

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
keeps the steering column from moving

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.260 
keeps the steering column from moving
backwards<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.149> forwards<00:01:01.760> if<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.850> ever<00:01:02.969> need<00:01:03.149> to

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
backwards and forwards if I ever need to

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.880 
backwards and forwards if I ever need to
take<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> steering<00:01:03.809> column<00:01:03.960> out<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.739> just

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
take the steering column out I can just

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.770 
take the steering column out I can just
undo<00:01:05.159> these<00:01:05.309> bolts<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.970> comes<00:01:06.210> off<00:01:06.450> and

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
undo these bolts and this comes off and

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.840 
undo these bolts and this comes off and
undo<00:01:07.080> these<00:01:07.409> bolts<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.070> comes<00:01:08.310> off<00:01:08.520> and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
undo these bolts and that comes off and

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.000 
undo these bolts and that comes off and
then<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.180> will<00:01:09.299> just<00:01:09.479> slide<00:01:10.200> out<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:11.340> way<00:01:13.010> to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
then it will just slide out this way to

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.830 
then it will just slide out this way to
the<00:01:14.130> left<00:01:15.619> so<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:17.159> all<00:01:17.400> not<00:01:18.360> locked<00:01:18.600> into

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the left so it's all not locked into

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.170 
the left so it's all not locked into
place<00:01:18.990> or<00:01:19.290> anything<00:01:19.470> um<00:01:20.720> anyway<00:01:22.759> that's<00:01:23.759> uh

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
place or anything um anyway that's uh

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.679 
place or anything um anyway that's uh
that's<00:01:24.900> pretty<00:01:25.290> much<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.360> far

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
that's pretty much it so far

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.730 
that's pretty much it so far
I<00:01:27.770> put<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.920> thing<00:01:28.979> on<00:01:29.340> it's<00:01:29.640> not<00:01:29.820> really<00:01:30.740> kind

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
I put this thing on it's not really kind

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.800 
I put this thing on it's not really kind
of<00:01:31.860> see<00:01:32.100> how<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.549> slides<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.180> it's<00:01:33.390> not<00:01:33.540> really

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
of see how it slides in it's not really

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.510 
of see how it slides in it's not really
held<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.409> haven't<00:01:34.560> figured<00:01:34.829> out<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.130> good<00:01:35.340> way

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
held in I haven't figured out a good way

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.200 
held in I haven't figured out a good way
to<00:01:36.470> really<00:01:37.470> secure<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.340> piece<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.880> got<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
to really secure this piece I got to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.539 
to really secure this piece I got to
figure<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.570> out

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
figure that out

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.270 
figure that out
boom<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:42.360> other<00:01:42.570> than<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:43.159> it's<00:01:44.159> pretty

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
boom but other than that it's pretty

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.130 
boom but other than that it's pretty
much<00:01:44.520> done<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.909> should<00:01:45.240> say<00:01:46.130> what<00:01:47.130> else

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
much done I should say what else

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.050 
much done I should say what else
I<00:01:49.270> redid<00:01:50.270> this<00:01:50.510> spring<00:01:50.870> shackle<00:01:51.200> because

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
I redid this spring shackle because

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
I redid this spring shackle because
originally<00:01:53.060> it<00:01:53.180> was<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.330> little<00:01:53.600> shorter<00:01:53.960> and

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
originally it was a little shorter and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.380 
originally it was a little shorter and
so<00:01:54.170> this<00:01:54.320> axle<00:01:54.770> was<00:01:54.860> tilted<00:01:55.280> a<00:01:55.340> little<00:01:55.550> bit<00:01:55.700> and

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
so this axle was tilted a little bit and

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.240 
so this axle was tilted a little bit and
I<00:01:56.840> at<00:01:57.229> first<00:01:57.470> I<00:01:57.590> thought<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:57.890> didn't<00:01:58.130> matter

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
I at first I thought it didn't matter

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.040 
I at first I thought it didn't matter
but<00:01:58.580> then<00:01:58.700> I<00:01:58.760> started<00:01:59.210> thinking<00:01:59.510> about<00:01:59.600> it<00:01:59.720> was

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
but then I started thinking about it was

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.899 
but then I started thinking about it was
like<00:02:00.080> well<00:02:00.380> probably<00:02:01.159> one<00:02:01.550> of<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.700> wheels

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
like well probably one of the wheels

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.810 
like well probably one of the wheels
will<00:02:02.150> be<00:02:02.180> floating<00:02:02.750> if<00:02:02.930> I<00:02:03.110> don't<00:02:04.040> fix<00:02:04.310> that<00:02:04.580> so

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
will be floating if I don't fix that so

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.219 
will be floating if I don't fix that so
I<00:02:04.850> fixed<00:02:05.300> that<00:02:07.209> anyway<00:02:08.209> I<00:02:08.420> guess<00:02:08.840> that's<00:02:09.080> about

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
I fixed that anyway I guess that's about

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.370 
I fixed that anyway I guess that's about
it<00:02:11.170> maybe<00:02:12.170> this<00:02:12.410> will<00:02:12.500> be<00:02:12.590> helpful<00:02:12.830> somebody
