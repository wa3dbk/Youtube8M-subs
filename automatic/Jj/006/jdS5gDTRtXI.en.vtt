00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.519
 our much time passed with what 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:15.700
 emotions put on the wheel shape again this 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.829
 I am very honest to say I am pleased 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:24.050
 spent in samara 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:27.679
 one of the most turnout of their seasons here 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.640
 for me it's not easy they are just offline 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:33.500
 with her very much connected personally for me 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.989
 how is it that you came to 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.550
 This collection who talked to you 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.140
 whether in principle any 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.360
 cooperation prospects 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:49.820
 well for now we just talk about what i'm 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:53.629
 I will work with the team and if all 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.500
 will be good then in general they will 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:01.010
 cooperate with the wings as before 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.710
 I will be a player of the Samara team last 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.869
 You spent Siberian season now connected 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.270
 some contractual obligations 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.590
 because the wings are not 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.500
 zenith for example which can take and 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.410
 buy players at will 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.899
 I will have to fight for the team 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.360
 I think that this question is enough 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:24.110
 simple because my contract is from the north 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.820
 was calculated for the year but by mutual 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.110
 we terminated consent this winter 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:35.330
 because the club has 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:40.300
 on the third budget cut so the team 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:43.759
 more well can not just pay money 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.940
 a football player to everyone he wants to say 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.940
 So 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.320
 the wings began preparing for the season in 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.390
 samara 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.380
 worked there constantly gym 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.090
 and on the field you somehow here before 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.580
 go to this collection, too, already typed 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.060
 the form maintained condition as worked 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:08.580
 how easy it is to retract 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:13.590
 know for many years how to say in 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:17.580
 professions maximum is somewhere 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.709
 seven to eight days without any exertion 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.230
 physical because he is any 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.989
 a soccer player that after 10 days is just not 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.600
 can rest more definitely 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:31.620
 everyone cooks in their own way everyone 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:36.959
 trains in its own way it is in sport 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.209
 higher achievements and there is no place but 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:43.130
 some unprofessional things no one 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:47.489
 no one will wait for you 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:51.180
 make those discounts on what you on what 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:54.420
 have you been in the appstore for some time or 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.570
 some things need a result near 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.570
 time
