00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.379
 in Italy , there is a lot of coast 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:16.029
 you can see caprice us think in 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.010
 our apartment we have this 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.700
 gigantic outlook over there 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.060
 positive 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.700
 We are here in three years because in 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.660
 this area fishing and lemons that 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.990
 special ones are 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.980
 who has it as an appetizer first time 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.969
 So it would have to calculate ali-t 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.640
 instead of risks now 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:41.440

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.909
 Now here again into the water and 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.649
 Rinse again 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:49.600
 but the great thing is that has me 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:52.239

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.019

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.019
 again briefly 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.160
 you can feel quite fresh, the meat 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.880
 is not at all public 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.470
 or something 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.700
 Of course it's great to fillet with 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.620
 I'm just pushing you apart like that 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.340
 then I can with my thumb under that 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.830

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.940
