00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.440 

it's<00:00:11.920> a<00:00:11.980> very<00:00:12.220> important<00:00:12.700> question<00:00:13.090> what<00:00:13.270> can

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
it's a very important question what can

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.870 
it's a very important question what can
you<00:00:13.600> do<00:00:13.780> to<00:00:13.900> prevent<00:00:14.230> this<00:00:14.440> illness<00:00:14.860> so<00:00:15.670> let<00:00:15.790> me

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:15.880 
you do to prevent this illness so let me

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.480 
you do to prevent this illness so let me
talk<00:00:16.029> a<00:00:16.090> little<00:00:16.180> bit<00:00:16.420> about<00:00:16.450> the<00:00:16.869> story<00:00:17.230> so<00:00:17.680> in

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
talk a little bit about the story so in

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.380 
talk a little bit about the story so in
the<00:00:19.000> army<00:00:19.390> and<00:00:19.570> in<00:00:20.439> other<00:00:20.820> European<00:00:21.820> countries

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
the army and in other European countries

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:29.429 
the army and in other European countries
they<00:00:23.230> keep<00:00:23.560> serum<00:00:24.189> stored<00:00:25.200> over<00:00:26.200> years<00:00:26.950> and<00:00:28.439> so

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
they keep serum stored over years and so

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.280 
they keep serum stored over years and so
you're<00:00:29.590> able<00:00:29.860> to<00:00:29.890> go<00:00:30.160> backwards<00:00:30.759> in<00:00:30.970> time<00:00:31.329> from

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
you're able to go backwards in time from

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.960 
you're able to go backwards in time from
when<00:00:32.380> a<00:00:32.590> person<00:00:33.070> develops<00:00:33.520> rheumatoid

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
when a person develops rheumatoid

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.410 
when a person develops rheumatoid
arthritis<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:35.190> what<00:00:36.190> they<00:00:36.340> found<00:00:36.670> was<00:00:37.030> that

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
arthritis and what they found was that

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.959 
arthritis and what they found was that
if<00:00:38.230> you<00:00:38.410> have<00:00:38.620> rheumatoid<00:00:39.040> arthritis<00:00:39.100> today

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.060 

you<00:00:42.969> have<00:00:43.149> already<00:00:43.449> had<00:00:43.870> Auto<00:00:44.230> antibodies

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
you have already had Auto antibodies

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.750 
you have already had Auto antibodies
like<00:00:45.640> rheumatoid<00:00:46.090> factor<00:00:46.600> in<00:00:46.750> anti-ccp<00:00:47.670> 10<00:00:48.670> to

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
like rheumatoid factor in anti-ccp 10 to

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.880 
like rheumatoid factor in anti-ccp 10 to
15<00:00:49.210> years<00:00:49.239> before<00:00:50.760> ok<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.469> genetic

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
15 years before ok so the genetic

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.709 
15 years before ok so the genetic
predisposition<00:00:54.850> and<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:56.079> autoimmune<00:00:56.559> state

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
predisposition and the autoimmune state

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.119 
predisposition and the autoimmune state
is<00:00:59.219> necessary<00:01:00.219> but<00:01:01.149> not<00:01:01.210> sufficient<00:01:01.390> to<00:01:02.350> cause

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
is necessary but not sufficient to cause

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.330 
is necessary but not sufficient to cause
the<00:01:03.399> illness<00:01:03.820> and<00:01:04.230> that<00:01:05.230> then<00:01:05.500> brings<00:01:05.860> up<00:01:06.159> the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
the illness and that then brings up the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.990 
the illness and that then brings up the
concept<00:01:06.520> of<00:01:07.030> a<00:01:07.840> trigger<00:01:08.250> some<00:01:09.250> environmental

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
concept of a trigger some environmental

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.290 
concept of a trigger some environmental
trigger<00:01:10.680> now<00:01:11.680> for<00:01:11.950> years<00:01:12.370> it<00:01:12.580> was<00:01:12.730> thought<00:01:12.760> and

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
trigger now for years it was thought and

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.580 
trigger now for years it was thought and
is<00:01:13.450> still<00:01:13.689> thought<00:01:14.049> that<00:01:14.579> viral<00:01:15.579> illnesses

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
is still thought that viral illnesses

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.859 
is still thought that viral illnesses
probably<00:01:17.590> trigger<00:01:17.890> this<00:01:18.159> off<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:19.479> you<00:01:19.540> have<00:01:19.840> a

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
probably trigger this off so you have a

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.590 
probably trigger this off so you have a
genetic<00:01:20.320> predisposition<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:22.060> would<00:01:22.210> may<00:01:22.420> not

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
genetic predisposition you would may not

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.560 
genetic predisposition you would may not
necessarily<00:01:22.810> get<00:01:23.680> rheumatoid<00:01:24.220> arthritis<00:01:24.570> but

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
necessarily get rheumatoid arthritis but

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.510 
necessarily get rheumatoid arthritis but
you<00:01:25.719> may<00:01:25.899> come<00:01:26.200> upon<00:01:26.350> at<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:26.860> given<00:01:27.159> point<00:01:27.369> in

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
you may come upon at a given point in

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.969 
you may come upon at a given point in
your<00:01:27.670> life<00:01:27.820> at<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:28.540> given<00:01:28.930> immunological<00:01:29.259> set

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
your life at a given immunological set

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.399 
your life at a given immunological set
point<00:01:30.280> in<00:01:30.460> your<00:01:30.579> life<00:01:30.790> some<00:01:31.659> virus<00:01:32.170> that

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
point in your life some virus that

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:33.679 
point in your life some virus that
triggers<00:01:32.770> at<00:01:32.920> all

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
triggers at all

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.270 
triggers at all
you<00:01:34.689> can't<00:01:34.930> really<00:01:35.079> do<00:01:35.290> much<00:01:35.439> about<00:01:35.500> that<00:01:35.799> but

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
you can't really do much about that but

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.609 
you can't really do much about that but
kind<00:01:36.640> of<00:01:36.759> good<00:01:36.909> clean<00:01:37.119> living<00:01:37.570> and<00:01:37.869> you<00:01:38.500> know

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
kind of good clean living and you know

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.200 
kind of good clean living and you know
that<00:01:38.860> that's<00:01:39.070> something<00:01:39.460> that<00:01:39.640> may<00:01:39.969> happen

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
that that's something that may happen

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.840 
that that's something that may happen
and<00:01:40.689> it's<00:01:41.049> difficult<00:01:41.289> to<00:01:41.649> avoid<00:01:42.509> smoking<00:01:44.850> very

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
and it's difficult to avoid smoking very

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.139 
and it's difficult to avoid smoking very
clearly<00:01:46.390> is<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:47.020> trigger<00:01:47.350> and<00:01:47.789> there<00:01:48.789> been<00:01:48.939> some

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
clearly is a trigger and there been some

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.620 
clearly is a trigger and there been some
very<00:01:49.509> good<00:01:49.869> studies<00:01:50.170> in<00:01:50.530> Sweden<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:51.280> here<00:01:52.180> in

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
very good studies in Sweden and here in

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.920 
very good studies in Sweden and here in
New<00:01:52.810> York<00:01:53.700> demonstrating<00:01:54.700> that<00:01:55.390> if<00:01:55.600> you<00:01:55.719> have

a genetic predisposition and you have

smoking it triggers a disease and

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.139 
smoking it triggers a disease and
