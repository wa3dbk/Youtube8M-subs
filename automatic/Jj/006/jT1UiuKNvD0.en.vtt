the thorax one of the most important and
most<00:01:39.320> difficult<00:01:39.950> things<00:01:40.310> about<00:01:40.369> this<00:01:40.579> fly<00:01:40.790> is

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
most difficult things about this fly is

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.149 
most difficult things about this fly is
getting<00:01:41.630> good<00:01:41.780> quality<00:01:42.049> hair<00:01:42.590> so<00:01:42.890> what<00:01:43.070> I'm

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
getting good quality hair so what I'm

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.859 
getting good quality hair so what I'm
looking<00:01:43.400> for<00:01:43.579> in<00:01:43.670> this<00:01:43.790> compare<00:01:44.270> attend<00:01:44.509> ear

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
looking for in this compare attend ear

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.870 
looking for in this compare attend ear
hair<00:01:45.110> is<00:01:45.320> very<00:01:46.159> very<00:01:46.790> short<00:01:47.450> tips<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:48.880> probably

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
hair is very very short tips so probably

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.969 
hair is very very short tips so probably
hard<00:01:50.030> to<00:01:50.090> see<00:01:50.149> in<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.750> video<00:01:51.049> but<00:01:51.380> when<00:01:51.950> I

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
hard to see in the video but when I

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.080 
hard to see in the video but when I
stack<00:01:52.490> this<00:01:52.790> up<00:01:53.030> they'll<00:01:53.450> be<00:01:53.600> very<00:01:54.579> mostly<00:01:55.610> the

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
stack this up they'll be very mostly the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.590 
stack this up they'll be very mostly the
natural<00:01:56.659> fiber<00:01:57.640> gray<00:01:58.640> that<00:01:58.970> you<00:01:59.030> see<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.390> same

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
natural fiber gray that you see the same

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.620 
natural fiber gray that you see the same
color<00:01:59.840> is<00:02:00.020> that<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.409> hide<00:02:00.649> and<00:02:01.060> very<00:02:02.060> short

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
color is that the hide and very short

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.520 
color is that the hide and very short
dark<00:02:03.530> tips<00:02:04.479> could<00:02:05.479> be<00:02:05.630> lighter<00:02:05.869> tips<00:02:06.170> if<00:02:06.380> that

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
dark tips could be lighter tips if that

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.259 
dark tips could be lighter tips if that
defense<00:02:06.920> works<00:02:07.189> out<00:02:07.399> but<00:02:07.579> it's<00:02:07.700> basically

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
defense works out but it's basically

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:13.690 
defense works out but it's basically
that's<00:02:08.509> uniform<00:02:09.320> tips<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:11.379> not<00:02:12.400> long<00:02:13.400> and

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
that's uniform tips and and not long and

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.760 
that's uniform tips and and not long and

and compared I'm winging in and the
compare<00:05:33.889> down<00:05:34.039> was<00:05:34.159> a<00:05:34.189> different<00:05:34.459> fly<00:05:34.610> I<00:05:34.639> mean

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
compare down was a different fly I mean

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.309 
compare down was a different fly I mean
it<00:05:34.939> has<00:05:35.059> the<00:05:35.300> it<00:05:35.629> has<00:05:35.809> a<00:05:37.779> micro<00:05:38.779> fitted<00:05:39.110> tail

know this could be this could vary from

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.189

relatively thin body with this fly brush
that<00:06:11.599> forward<00:06:14.169> this<00:06:15.169> one's<00:06:15.409> turning<00:06:15.619> out<00:06:15.889> to

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
that forward this one's turning out to

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.629 
that forward this one's turning out to
be<00:06:16.069> a<00:06:16.189> bit<00:06:16.579> thicker<00:06:16.909> than<00:06:17.059> I<00:06:17.299> would<00:06:17.479> like<00:06:18.639> he's

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 
be a bit thicker than I would like he's

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.549 
be a bit thicker than I would like he's
gonna<00:06:19.819> have<00:06:19.999> to<00:06:20.149> work<00:06:22.509> so<00:06:23.509> wrap<00:06:23.899> that<00:06:24.110> behind

00:06:24.549 --> 00:06:24.559 
gonna have to work so wrap that behind

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:25.899 
gonna have to work so wrap that behind
and<00:06:24.829> now<00:06:24.919> I<00:06:24.949> want<00:06:25.099> to<00:06:25.159> come<00:06:25.309> in<00:06:25.429> front<00:06:25.699> of<00:06:25.789> that

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:25.909 
and now I want to come in front of that

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:27.879 
and now I want to come in front of that
wing<00:06:26.179> with<00:06:26.419> the<00:06:26.449> same<00:06:26.779> dubbing<00:06:27.409> rope<00:06:27.589> and<00:06:27.829> I

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:27.889 
wing with the same dubbing rope and I

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:30.459 
wing with the same dubbing rope and I
can<00:06:28.039> again<00:06:28.339> try<00:06:28.759> to<00:06:28.789> pinch<00:06:29.479> that<00:06:29.749> down<00:06:30.110> in

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:30.469 
can again try to pinch that down in

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:34.569 
can again try to pinch that down in
there<00:06:31.749> me<00:06:32.749> trying<00:06:33.349> to<00:06:33.379> keep<00:06:33.559> that<00:06:33.739> dubbing<00:06:34.459> in

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:34.579 
there me trying to keep that dubbing in

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:39.579 
there me trying to keep that dubbing in
front<00:06:34.909> of<00:06:35.629> the<00:06:36.169> thorax<00:06:36.619> and<00:06:38.199> that'll<00:06:39.199> sandwich

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:39.589 
front of the thorax and that'll sandwich

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:41.409 
front of the thorax and that'll sandwich
that<00:06:39.769> wing<00:06:40.069> I<00:06:40.399> mean<00:06:40.579> I<00:06:40.669> think<00:06:40.729> if<00:06:40.999> it<00:06:41.089> once<00:06:41.269> they

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:41.419 
that wing I mean I think if it once they

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:42.540 
that wing I mean I think if it once they
sit<00:06:41.749> back<00:06:42.050> just

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
sit back just

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.940 
sit back just
that<00:06:42.850> that's<00:06:43.240> okay<00:06:43.690> now<00:06:44.470> this<00:06:44.650> fly<00:06:44.860> is

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:44.950 
that that's okay now this fly is

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.620 
that that's okay now this fly is
slightly<00:06:45.430> pregnant<00:06:45.970> or<00:06:46.030> what<00:06:46.120> I<00:06:46.150> mean<00:06:46.330> is<00:06:46.510> it's

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.630 
slightly pregnant or what I mean is it's

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.630 
slightly pregnant or what I mean is it's
it's<00:06:47.440> a<00:06:47.560> little<00:06:47.830> bit<00:06:47.920> thicker<00:06:48.220> than<00:06:48.340> I<00:06:48.520> would

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:48.640 
it's a little bit thicker than I would
