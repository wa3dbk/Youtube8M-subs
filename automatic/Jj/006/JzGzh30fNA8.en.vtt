which<00:00:45.600> are<00:00:45.750> really<00:00:45.900> those<00:00:46.110> two<00:00:46.170> pillars<00:00:46.620> that

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
which are really those two pillars that

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.560 
which are really those two pillars that
I<00:00:46.860> talked<00:00:47.100> about<00:00:47.220> the<00:00:47.400> third<00:00:47.879> one<00:00:48.150> there's<00:00:48.510> a

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
I talked about the third one there's a

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.899 
I talked about the third one there's a
nutritional<00:00:49.170> component<00:00:49.680> very<00:00:50.040> important<00:00:50.670> for

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:50.909 
nutritional component very important for

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:52.670 
nutritional component very important for
endurance<00:00:51.210> athletes<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.110> then<00:00:52.320> finally

endurance athletes and then finally

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.500 
endurance athletes and then finally
there<00:00:52.949> needs<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.190> be<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.339> certain<00:00:53.729> amount<00:00:53.790> of<00:00:54.059> an

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
there needs to be a certain amount of an

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.410 
there needs to be a certain amount of an
exercise<00:00:55.080> regime<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.739> land<00:00:56.159> that's<00:00:56.729> specific
