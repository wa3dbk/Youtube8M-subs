00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
patched it so I don't know that's kind

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.350 
patched it so I don't know that's kind
of<00:01:49.229> unfortunate<00:01:49.439> but<00:01:50.280> it's<00:01:50.610> whatever<00:01:50.939> they

was used over primary weapons a lot of
the<00:03:24.880> time<00:03:25.090> so<00:03:25.360> I<00:03:25.570> don't<00:03:26.080> know<00:03:26.140> maybe<00:03:26.290> that<00:03:26.440> was

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
the time so I don't know maybe that was

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.410 
the time so I don't know maybe that was
a<00:03:26.590> little<00:03:26.650> bit<00:03:26.830> needed<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:27.340> then<00:03:28.150> they<00:03:28.240> also

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
a little bit needed and then they also

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.560 
a little bit needed and then they also
reduced<00:03:28.990> the<00:03:29.080> image<00:03:29.350> on<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.650> b23r<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:30.940> the

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
reduced the image on the b23r and the

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.660 
reduced the image on the b23r and the
b23r<00:03:32.230> dual<00:03:32.470> wield<00:03:32.770> which<00:03:33.130> I<00:03:33.370> don't<00:03:33.490> know<00:03:33.640> I

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
b23r dual wield which I don't know I

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.280 
b23r dual wield which I don't know I
never<00:03:33.820> really<00:03:34.030> thought<00:03:34.240> to<00:03:34.510> be<00:03:34.630> 23<00:03:34.990> hour<00:03:35.080> was

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
never really thought to be 23 hour was

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.260 
never really thought to be 23 hour was
all<00:03:35.560> that<00:03:35.890> good<00:03:36.190> I<00:03:36.220> thought<00:03:36.730> it<00:03:36.850> was<00:03:36.940> just<00:03:37.000> you

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
all that good I thought it was just you

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.760 
all that good I thought it was just you
know<00:03:37.300> I<00:03:37.660> even<00:03:38.020> thought<00:03:38.140> it<00:03:38.410> was<00:03:38.500> a<00:03:38.530> solid

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
know I even thought it was a solid

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.080 
know I even thought it was a solid
weapon<00:03:39.220> but<00:03:39.550> I<00:03:39.640> didn't<00:03:39.820> think<00:03:39.910> it<00:03:40.030> was

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
weapon but I didn't think it was

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.400 
weapon but I didn't think it was
overpowered<00:03:40.600> at<00:03:40.690> all<00:03:40.780> but<00:03:40.990> they<00:03:41.050> did<00:03:41.200> reduce

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
overpowered at all but they did reduce

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.960 
overpowered at all but they did reduce
the<00:03:41.530> damage<00:03:41.620> on<00:03:41.920> that<00:03:41.950> as<00:03:42.340> well<00:03:42.520> as<00:03:42.640> its<00:03:42.790> dual

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
the damage on that as well as its dual

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.449 
the damage on that as well as its dual
wield<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:43.390> they<00:03:44.140> reduced<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.620> b23r<00:03:45.250> dual

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
wield and they reduced the b23r dual

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.030 
wield and they reduced the b23r dual
wield<00:03:45.700> hipfire<00:03:46.120> accuracy<00:03:46.510> so<00:03:46.990> those<00:03:47.680> people

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
wield hipfire accuracy so those people

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.190

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
that thing you can sprint allow around a

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.590 
that thing you can sprint allow around a
little<00:04:06.280> bit<00:04:06.400> faster<00:04:06.580> but<00:04:07.090> i<00:04:07.330> don't<00:04:07.480> know<00:04:07.510> i

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600
