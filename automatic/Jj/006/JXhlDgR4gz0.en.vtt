ridden it for a while so the chain was a

little<00:00:08.670> bit<00:00:08.790> rusty<00:00:09.080> and<00:00:10.080> so<00:00:10.349> I've<00:00:10.500> been

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
little bit rusty and so I've been

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.070 
little bit rusty and so I've been
sitting<00:00:11.070> here<00:00:11.240> just<00:00:12.240> trying<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.690> work<00:00:12.840> the

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
sitting here just trying to work the

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.049 
sitting here just trying to work the
chain<00:00:13.320> in<00:00:13.590> I'm<00:00:14.130> trying<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.490> get<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.700> rustiness

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
chain in I'm trying to get the rustiness

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.410 
chain in I'm trying to get the rustiness
out<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.809> so<00:00:16.529> far<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.130> think<00:00:17.640> I'm<00:00:18.090> almost

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
out of it and so far I think I'm almost

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.230 
out of it and so far I think I'm almost
there<00:00:19.230> like<00:00:20.189> there's<00:00:20.369> still<00:00:20.580> one<00:00:20.789> spot<00:00:20.939> where

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
there like there's still one spot where

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.420 
there like there's still one spot where
it<00:00:21.330> kind<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.660> jumps<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.320> little<00:00:22.560> bit<00:00:22.710> but

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
it kind of jumps just a little bit but

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.009 
it kind of jumps just a little bit but
all<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.580> got<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.910> do<00:00:24.000> now<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.330> just<00:00:24.510> write<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.930> a

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
all I got to do now is just write it a

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.089 
all I got to do now is just write it a
little<00:00:25.199> bit<00:00:25.320> there<00:00:25.500> we'll<00:00:25.590> be<00:00:25.619> good<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.859> go

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
little bit there we'll be good to go

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.009 
little bit there we'll be good to go
look<00:00:26.670> at<00:00:26.760> all<00:00:26.849> like<00:00:27.029> both<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.480> rust<00:00:27.779> that's

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
look at all like both the rust that's

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.720 
look at all like both the rust that's
came<00:00:28.349> out<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.980> it's<00:00:29.099> like<00:00:29.160> sitting<00:00:29.580> on<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
came out and it's like sitting on the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.609 
came out and it's like sitting on the
ground<00:00:29.939> right<00:00:30.119> there<00:00:30.320> yeah

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
ground right there yeah

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.350 
ground right there yeah
I<00:00:31.650> think<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.130> doing<00:00:32.369> good<00:00:32.520> first<00:00:33.090> things

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
I think it's doing good first things

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.120 
I think it's doing good first things
first<00:00:33.450> though<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.079> gotta<00:00:34.290> mow<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.590> grass<00:00:34.620> and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
first though I gotta mow the grass and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.250 
first though I gotta mow the grass and
do<00:00:35.219> some<00:00:35.399> edging<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.910> stuff<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.870> had<00:00:36.989> an<00:00:37.079> ant

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
do some edging and stuff you had an ant

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.910 
do some edging and stuff you had an ant

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.459 
Mountain oh that's a crisp looking lawn
didn't<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.460> there's<00:00:42.239> like<00:00:42.360> golf<00:00:42.780> look<00:00:43.230> at<00:00:43.350> that

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
didn't it there's like golf look at that

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.470 
didn't it there's like golf look at that
I<00:00:43.500> put<00:00:43.649> some<00:00:43.829> tire<00:00:44.219> shine<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.820> my<00:00:44.969> wheels<00:00:45.210> cuz

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
I put some tire shine on my wheels cuz

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.819 
I put some tire shine on my wheels cuz
they<00:00:45.570> were<00:00:45.629> looking<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> little<00:00:45.989> dry<00:00:46.320> rotted<00:00:46.710> so

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
they were looking a little dry rotted so

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.170 
they were looking a little dry rotted so
hopefully<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.280> will<00:00:47.430> slow<00:00:47.850> down<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
hopefully that will slow down the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.970 
hopefully that will slow down the
process<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.780> little<00:00:49.020> bit<00:00:49.260> what<00:00:49.680> do<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.860> guys

that actually looks really good through

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.520 
that actually looks really good through
the<00:00:56.309> camera<00:00:56.610> here<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:57.329> just<00:00:57.480> needs<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.930> like

the camera here it just needs to like
settle<00:00:58.800> down<00:00:58.890> cuz<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.430> all<00:00:59.520> wrinkly<00:00:59.789> from

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
from the ashes and it's the clone of the

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.040 
from the ashes and it's the clone of the
tree<00:05:01.610> that<00:05:01.640> was<00:05:01.850> on<00:05:02.030> that<00:05:02.210> burned<00:05:02.570> down<00:05:02.750> back

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
tree that was on that burned down back

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.590 
tree that was on that burned down back
there<00:05:03.340> and<00:05:04.340> how<00:05:04.430> crazy<00:05:04.700> this<00:05:04.970> is<00:05:05.030> but<00:05:05.360> it's<00:05:05.480> so

funny that this is like this one's
surrounded<00:05:08.330> and<00:05:08.570> I<00:05:08.660> understand<00:05:09.080> it's<00:05:09.200> because

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
surrounded and I understand it's because

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.600 
surrounded and I understand it's because
it's<00:05:09.560> a<00:05:09.620> clone<00:05:09.830> of<00:05:09.980> that<00:05:10.010> one<00:05:10.280> but<00:05:10.430> like

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
it's a clone of that one but like

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.130 
it's a clone of that one but like
there's<00:05:11.330> one<00:05:11.570> right<00:05:11.810> there

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
there's one right there

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.850 
there's one right there
like<00:05:13.060> not<00:05:14.060> surrounded<00:05:14.840> right<00:05:14.990> but<00:05:15.560> I<00:05:15.590> mean

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
neither is this one it is a clone of the

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.130 
neither is this one it is a clone of the
center<00:05:18.770> what<00:05:18.979> does<00:05:19.100> that<00:05:19.130> thing<00:05:19.250> say<00:05:19.430> on<00:05:19.760> it<00:05:19.940> oh
