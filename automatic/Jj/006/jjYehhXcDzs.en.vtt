show<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.460> can<00:00:11.610> braise<00:00:11.849> with<00:00:12.830> hydrogen

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
show you you can braise with hydrogen

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.849 
show you you can braise with hydrogen
being<00:00:14.070> water<00:00:15.320> as<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> fuel<00:00:17.510> so<00:00:18.770> your<00:00:19.770> bubbler

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
being water as a fuel so your bubbler

and<00:00:34.620> then<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> torch<00:00:36.680> I'll<00:00:37.680> be<00:00:37.829> using

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
and then just the torch I'll be using

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.520 
and then just the torch I'll be using
I'm<00:00:40.050> gonna<00:00:40.230> solder<00:00:40.610> sorry<00:00:41.610> freeze<00:00:42.290> these<00:00:43.290> two

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
I'm gonna solder sorry freeze these two

pieces of tin together

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.900 
pieces of tin together
we'll<00:00:45.989> see<00:00:46.110> how<00:00:46.260> they<00:00:46.410> turn<00:00:46.620> out<00:00:46.829> with<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
we'll see how they turn out with the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.209 
we'll see how they turn out with the
water<00:00:48.090> torch<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:49.140> water<00:00:49.379> fuel<00:00:49.770> let's

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
water torch so it's water fuel let's

00:00:50.219 --> 00:01:23.950 
water torch so it's water fuel let's
find<00:00:50.489> out<00:00:50.660> if<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.930> bring<00:00:52.199> these<00:00:52.469> together

I'm out of practice but there's one pass
on<00:01:42.020> that<00:01:42.880> I'm<00:01:43.880> going<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.120> flip<00:01:44.360> it<00:01:44.390> over<00:01:44.570> and

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
on that I'm going to flip it over and

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.000 
on that I'm going to flip it over and
run<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.230> other<00:01:45.320> side<00:01:45.740> right<00:01:47.680> its<00:01:48.680> flipped

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
run to the other side right its flipped

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
this off and let's see how strong it is

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.460 
this off and let's see how strong it is
all<00:03:09.420> right<00:03:09.630> it's<00:03:09.960> cooled<00:03:10.290> off<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:12.470> here's

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
all right it's cooled off and here's

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.760 
all right it's cooled off and here's
what<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.770> finished<00:03:13.800> product<00:03:14.490> looks<00:03:14.550> like

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
what the finished product looks like

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.930 
what the finished product looks like
like<00:03:16.770> I<00:03:16.890> said<00:03:17.130> I'm<00:03:17.250> not<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.490> welder

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.950 

it's<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.000> mechanic<00:03:23.090> it's<00:03:24.090> been<00:03:24.300> many<00:03:24.720> years

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
it's a mechanic it's been many years

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.810 
it's a mechanic it's been many years
since<00:03:25.110> I've<00:03:25.440> had<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.620> weld<00:03:26.070> with<00:03:26.190> this<00:03:26.430> type<00:03:26.790> of

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
since I've had to weld with this type of

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:43.480 
since I've had to weld with this type of
will<00:03:27.200> something<00:03:28.200> so<00:03:28.470> strong<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.130> really<00:03:29.460> is

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.730 

seems<00:03:44.490> to<00:03:44.640> be<00:03:44.670> holding<00:03:44.910> up<00:03:45.150> quite<00:03:45.480> well<00:03:45.740> so

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
seems to be holding up quite well so

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.580 
seems to be holding up quite well so
much<00:03:46.890> for<00:03:46.950> hydrogen<00:03:47.960> River<00:03:48.960> meant<00:03:49.200> causing<00:03:49.560> a

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
much for hydrogen River meant causing a

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.640 
much for hydrogen River meant causing a
problem<00:03:50.040> with<00:03:50.220> welds<00:03:50.870> just<00:03:51.870> blew<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.350> theory

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
problem with welds just blew that theory

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:01.880 
problem with welds just blew that theory
oh<00:03:54.440> yeah<00:03:58.760> twist<00:04:00.200> hey<00:04:01.200> that's<00:04:01.440> not<00:04:01.590> coming

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
oh yeah twist hey that's not coming

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.150 
oh yeah twist hey that's not coming
apart<00:04:02.600> so<00:04:03.600> there<00:04:03.720> you<00:04:03.810> have<00:04:03.840> it<00:04:03.990> a<00:04:04.380> small
