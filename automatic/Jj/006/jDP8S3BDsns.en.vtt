know it's an Altoid not not not a lot of

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.480 
know it's an Altoid not not not a lot of
stuff<00:00:24.000> can<00:00:24.150> go<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.510> here<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.890> was<00:00:26.039> thinking

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
stuff can go in here and I was thinking

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.529 
stuff can go in here and I was thinking
you<00:00:26.820> know<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.210> have<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> little<00:00:28.109> victorinox

you know I have a little victorinox
blade<00:00:30.539> inside<00:00:31.489> and<00:00:32.489> i<00:00:32.820> also<00:00:32.969> have<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:34.160> little

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
blade inside and i also have a little

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.430 
blade inside and i also have a little
surgical<00:00:35.640> blade<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.930> thought<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.410> know

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
surgical blade and I thought you know

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.920 
surgical blade and I thought you know
the<00:00:38.250> surgical<00:00:38.670> blade<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.059> need<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.329> handle<00:00:39.750> it

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930

the surgical blade you need to handle it
you<00:00:40.320> need<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.530> go<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.680> make<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> handle<00:00:41.370> for<00:00:41.399> it

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
you need to go and make a handle for it

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.600 
you need to go and make a handle for it
what<00:00:42.960> if<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.200> could<00:00:43.410> combine<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:44.160> surgical

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
what if I could combine the surgical

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.790 
what if I could combine the surgical
blade<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.180> victorinox<00:00:45.809> together<00:00:46.410> into

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
blade and the victorinox together into

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.360 
blade and the victorinox together into
one<00:00:46.829> blade<00:00:47.629> that<00:00:48.629> will<00:00:48.960> fit<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.379> here<00:00:49.800> inside

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
one blade that will fit in here inside

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.630 
one blade that will fit in here inside
my<00:00:50.430> Altoid<00:00:51.390> can<00:00:51.690> maybe<00:00:52.410> even<00:00:52.680> glue<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.129> or<00:00:53.460> you

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
my Altoid can maybe even glue it or you

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.790 
my Altoid can maybe even glue it or you
know<00:00:53.730> stick<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.500> to<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.129> box

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
know stick it to the to the to the box

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.099 
know stick it to the to the to the box
to<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.829> side<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.399> box<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.760> closes<00:01:00.329> what

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
to the side of the box that closes what

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.810 
to the side of the box that closes what
if<00:01:01.199> i<00:01:01.289> can<00:01:01.469> combine<00:01:01.680> these<00:01:02.070> two<00:01:02.309> into<00:01:02.609> some

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
if i can combine these two into some

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.340 
if i can combine these two into some
some<00:01:03.210> sort<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.979> survival<00:01:04.979> concept<00:01:05.489> knife

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
some sort of a survival concept knife

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.109 
some sort of a survival concept knife
that<00:01:07.350> Yuri<00:01:08.100> handle<00:01:08.520> once<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.240> need<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:10.070> so<00:01:11.070> I

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
that Yuri handle once you need it so I

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.270 
that Yuri handle once you need it so I
started<00:01:12.119> sketching<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.930> went<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.380> got

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
started sketching and I went and got

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.020 
started sketching and I went and got
this<00:01:15.200> design<00:01:16.200> okay<00:01:16.979> which<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
this design okay which is this is the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.200 
this design okay which is this is the
real<00:01:18.180> scale<00:01:18.600> for<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.740> knife<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.729> will<00:01:20.970> fit

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
real scale for the knife it will fit

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.990 
real scale for the knife it will fit
inside<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.750> survival<00:01:22.380> tin<00:01:22.560> can<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.670> idea

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
inside a survival tin can and the idea

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.840 
inside a survival tin can and the idea
is<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.180> have<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.659> know<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.990> small<00:01:25.619> blade<00:01:25.890> which

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
is to have you know a small blade which

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.340 
is to have you know a small blade which
will<00:01:27.030> be<00:01:27.150> strong<00:01:27.479> enough<00:01:27.780> not<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.320> a

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
will be strong enough not like a

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.170 
will be strong enough not like a
surgical<00:01:28.920> blade<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:30.420> we'll<00:01:31.350> have<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.590> tank

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
surgical blade and we'll have a tank

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.030 
surgical blade and we'll have a tank
that<00:01:33.180> will<00:01:33.720> be<00:01:33.930> able<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.740> will<00:01:34.890> be<00:01:34.920> able

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
that will be able that you will be able

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.609 
that will be able that you will be able
to<00:01:35.400> stick<00:01:35.729> inside<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.150> little<00:01:36.869> branch<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.439> you

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
to stick inside a little branch that you

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.800 
to stick inside a little branch that you
make<00:01:37.829> or<00:01:38.100> eat<00:01:38.159> or<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.479> know<00:01:39.600> that

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
make or eat or that you you know that

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.800 
make or eat or that you you know that
you<00:01:39.930> break<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:41.490> will<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.090> kind<00:01:42.659> of

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
you break and it will have this kind of

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.690 
you break and it will have this kind of
a<00:01:42.930> tooth<00:01:43.320> here<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.890> know<00:01:44.009> like<00:01:44.220> kind<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.610> a

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
a tooth here you know like kind of a

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.510 
a tooth here you know like kind of a
serrated<00:01:45.229> part<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.439> wants<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.829> once<00:01:47.399> you

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
serrated part that wants you once you

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.960 
serrated part that wants you once you
stick<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.880> inside<00:01:48.030> um<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:49.860> will<00:01:50.369> stay<00:01:50.640> inside

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
stick it inside um it will stay inside

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.220 
stick it inside um it will stay inside
and<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:52.079> idea<00:01:52.409> for<00:01:52.680> having<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:54.090> groove

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
and the idea for having this groove

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.010 
and the idea for having this groove
this<00:01:55.650> deep<00:01:56.130> groove<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.670> here<00:01:56.910> is<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.690> when

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
this deep groove in here is that when

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.230 
this deep groove in here is that when
you<00:01:58.110> when<00:01:58.470> you<00:01:58.500> work<00:01:58.860> with<00:01:58.890> your<00:01:59.280> knife<00:01:59.490> most

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
you when you work with your knife most

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.210 
you when you work with your knife most
of<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.480> pressure<00:02:00.750> will<00:02:01.050> if<00:02:01.440> this<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.860> well

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
of the pressure will if this is well

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.250 
of the pressure will if this is well
let's<00:02:02.490> say<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.730> know<00:02:02.970> let's<00:02:03.690> say<00:02:03.900> this<00:02:04.050> is<00:02:04.110> the

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
let's say you know let's say this is the

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.220 
let's say you know let's say this is the
blade<00:02:04.590> okay<00:02:05.210> when<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.360> work<00:02:06.600> with<00:02:06.630> your<00:02:06.990> knife

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
blade okay when you work with your knife

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.350 
blade okay when you work with your knife
most<00:02:07.620> of<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:07.890> pressure<00:02:08.130> will<00:02:08.430> try<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.760> push

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
most of the pressure will try to push

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.380 
most of the pressure will try to push
push<00:02:10.290> the<00:02:10.470> knife<00:02:10.650> out<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.010> the<00:02:11.520> tank<00:02:11.910> like<00:02:12.120> so

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
push the knife out of the tank like so

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.360 
push the knife out of the tank like so
so<00:02:13.080> when<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.350> have<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.560> big<00:02:13.770> groove<00:02:13.980> here<00:02:14.250> it

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
so when you have a big groove here it

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.410 
so when you have a big groove here it
will<00:02:14.490> give<00:02:14.730> some<00:02:15.570> some<00:02:16.170> sort<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:18.410> power

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
will give some some sort of a power

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.680 
will give some some sort of a power
power<00:02:21.420> lock<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:22.710> will<00:02:23.210> that<00:02:24.210> will<00:02:24.360> make<00:02:24.540> it

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
power lock that will that will make it

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.200 
power lock that will that will make it
stronger<00:02:24.990> so<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.950> went<00:02:26.340> ahead<00:02:26.460> and<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:27.060> know<00:02:27.180> I

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
stronger so I went ahead and you know I

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.310 
stronger so I went ahead and you know I
played<00:02:27.540> around<00:02:27.690> with<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.170> little<00:02:28.200> bit<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.910> I

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
played around with it a little bit and I

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.640 
played around with it a little bit and I
got<00:02:31.320> this<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:32.010> first<00:02:32.820> little<00:02:33.030> prototype<00:02:33.720> let

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
got this this first little prototype let

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:42.950 
got this this first little prototype let
me<00:02:34.800> just<00:02:35.010> zoom<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.940> in<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.090> bit<00:02:40.970> okay<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.750> is

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
me just zoom it in a bit okay so this is

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.280 
me just zoom it in a bit okay so this is
a<00:02:42.990> this<00:02:43.500> is<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.770> prototype<00:02:44.040> knife<00:02:44.580> oh<00:02:45.080> you<00:02:46.080> can

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
a this is the prototype knife oh you can

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.560 
a this is the prototype knife oh you can
see<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:48.560> it<00:02:49.560> has<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:50.070> little<00:02:50.220> groove<00:02:50.610> in<00:02:51.420> it

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
see that it has the little groove in it

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.940 
see that it has the little groove in it
ah<00:02:52.610> you<00:02:53.610> have<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:54.110> straight<00:02:55.110> blade<00:02:55.290> over<00:02:55.680> here

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
ah you have a straight blade over here

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.070 
ah you have a straight blade over here
it's<00:02:56.580> pretty<00:02:56.880> sharp<00:02:57.150> right<00:02:57.360> now<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.540> didn't<00:02:57.930> uh

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
it's pretty sharp right now I didn't uh

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.949 
it's pretty sharp right now I didn't uh
I<00:02:58.350> didn't<00:02:58.860> bring<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.490> I<00:02:59.760> went<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:00.690> I

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
I didn't bring it to the I went and I

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.850 
I didn't bring it to the I went and I
did<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.500> convex<00:03:02.100> instead<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.120> full<00:03:03.720> flat<00:03:03.959> sorry

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
did it convex instead of full flat sorry

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.560 
did it convex instead of full flat sorry
instead<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.280> us<00:03:05.459> candy<00:03:05.760> because<00:03:06.060> this<00:03:06.420> is

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
instead of us candy because this is

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.910 
instead of us candy because this is
already<00:03:06.750> this<00:03:07.440> is<00:03:07.590> hardened<00:03:07.950> steel<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:09.920> I

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
already this is hardened steel and I

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.400 
already this is hardened steel and I
didn't<00:03:11.340> work<00:03:11.459> with<00:03:11.670> files<00:03:11.970> so<00:03:12.690> it's<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.930> convex

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
didn't work with files so it's a convex

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.780 
didn't work with files so it's a convex
was<00:03:13.650> easier<00:03:13.950> for<00:03:14.010> me<00:03:14.660> you<00:03:15.660> have<00:03:15.780> this<00:03:15.930> little

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
was easier for me you have this little

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.470 
was easier for me you have this little
separator<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.180> it'll<00:03:18.420> be<00:03:18.450> easier<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:18.989> sharpen

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
separator so it'll be easier to sharpen

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.949 
separator so it'll be easier to sharpen
then<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.810> tiny<00:03:22.709> little<00:03:23.390> kind<00:03:24.390> of<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.600> drop<00:03:24.930> point

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
then a tiny little kind of a drop point

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.570 
then a tiny little kind of a drop point
you<00:03:25.830> know<00:03:25.980> ah<00:03:27.320> so<00:03:28.320> you<00:03:28.500> know<00:03:28.620> it'll<00:03:28.830> be<00:03:28.860> it'll

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
you know ah so you know it'll be it'll

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.170 
you know ah so you know it'll be it'll
be<00:03:29.670> ah<00:03:30.320> easy<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.709> skin<00:03:32.010> with<00:03:32.190> in<00:03:32.520> case<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:33.000> need

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
be ah easy to skin with in case you need

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.260 
be ah easy to skin with in case you need
to<00:03:33.360> make<00:03:33.600> some<00:03:33.780> small<00:03:34.080> fine<00:03:34.440> work<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:35.270> of

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
to make some small fine work and of

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.910 
to make some small fine work and of
course<00:03:36.390> this<00:03:36.720> groove<00:03:37.020> which<00:03:37.230> was<00:03:37.380> really<00:03:37.770> hard

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
course this groove which was really hard

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.800 
course this groove which was really hard
to<00:03:38.010> make<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.400> see<00:03:38.580> I<00:03:38.610> really<00:03:38.910> fought<00:03:39.239> my<00:03:39.570> way

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.400 
to make this groove and what I want to
do<00:03:44.130> right<00:03:44.400> now<00:03:44.459> is<00:03:44.670> just<00:03:45.030> stop<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.810> video<00:03:45.959> and

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.060 
start bashing it into another piece of
wood<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:57.300> see<00:03:57.480> if<00:03:57.600> it<00:03:57.750> will<00:03:57.870> work<00:03:58.080> so<00:03:58.650> stay<00:03:58.920> with

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
wood to see if it will work so stay with

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:07.470 
wood to see if it will work so stay with
me

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480

hey guys and thanks for coming back the
the<00:04:13.370> piece<00:04:13.609> of<00:04:13.640> wood<00:04:13.819> that<00:04:13.969> I<00:04:14.150> had<00:04:14.450> was<00:04:14.780> a

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
the piece of wood that I had was a

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.159 
the piece of wood that I had was a
little<00:04:15.530> too<00:04:15.650> thin<00:04:16.000> so<00:04:17.000> I<00:04:17.030> just<00:04:17.359> baton<00:04:17.720> dit<00:04:17.959> in

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
little too thin so I just baton dit in

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.560 
little too thin so I just baton dit in
the<00:04:18.380> middle<00:04:18.709> and<00:04:19.459> then<00:04:19.609> I<00:04:19.669> took<00:04:19.789> a<00:04:20.030> bigger

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
the middle and then I took a bigger

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.120 
the middle and then I took a bigger
piece<00:04:20.840> of<00:04:20.870> wood<00:04:21.199> and<00:04:21.520> it<00:04:22.520> worked<00:04:22.820> really<00:04:23.240> well

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
piece of wood and it worked really well

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.150 
piece of wood and it worked really well
now<00:04:25.130> you<00:04:25.220> can<00:04:25.280> see<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.669> knife<00:04:25.850> is<00:04:26.150> very

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
now you can see the knife is very

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.330 
now you can see the knife is very
secured<00:04:28.160> inside<00:04:28.340> I<00:04:28.850> mean<00:04:29.120> I<00:04:29.270> I<00:04:29.770> can't<00:04:30.770> I<00:04:31.130> can't

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
secured inside I mean I I can't I can't

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.760 
secured inside I mean I I can't I can't
take<00:04:31.789> it<00:04:31.820> out<00:04:32.060> I<00:04:32.389> will<00:04:33.020> have<00:04:33.169> to<00:04:33.199> split<00:04:33.590> the

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
take it out I will have to split the

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.689 
take it out I will have to split the
wood<00:04:33.979> or<00:04:34.840> burn<00:04:35.840> it<00:04:36.020> so<00:04:36.590> I<00:04:36.620> can<00:04:37.280> take<00:04:37.490> it<00:04:37.580> out

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
wood or burn it so I can take it out

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.629 
wood or burn it so I can take it out
i'll<00:04:38.509> probably<00:04:38.810> split<00:04:39.080> it<00:04:39.380> at<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:39.979> end<00:04:40.070> now
