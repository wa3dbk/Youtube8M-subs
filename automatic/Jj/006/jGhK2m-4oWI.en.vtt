00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:11.940
 video about graham car chevrolet aveo 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:15.859
 14 16 valves 2100 year hatchback 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.930
 Well, not on other models are 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:24.210
 video program means it has 16 valves 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.369
 here are two stars two stars 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.730
 tensioner well I have already changed how 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:36.390
 just tell you need to unscrew 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:38.040
 filter removal from and dampers here turn off 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.770
 This sensor is dragging the corpse 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:46.760
 remove me so as not to interfere with unscrew this 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.760
 metal tube 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:57.800
 she screwed here is the yoke 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:02.290
 here it is here he unscrew the schedule 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:10.210
 so that it doesnâ€™t interfere with skin removal 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:13.610
 that's how we set the stars 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.250
 position of the mark on each other they are now 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.890
 are not standing as it should, and we 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.290
 but just for example showed here 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.440
 the way to lock it gears to 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:30.080
 they never offended furniture screed 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:33.289
 long bolt with wide steps locking 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:38.330
 delaying the ticks will not run away like that 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:39.100
 and there will be a scheme for me here 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.800
 scheme 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:46.550
 so here it is necessary to put asterisks here 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.850
 one bypass roller another tensioner here 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:54.340
 below the crankshaft method should be 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.340
 watch here is their day pump 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.270
 in order to 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.740
 change need to be removed means 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.580
 drive belt is all convenient to do 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.929
 rice under the arch 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.810
 need to remove this lateral protection 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.600
 boot here is the tensioner automatically 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.730
 drive belt off his shoulder and 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.140
 throw off the belt 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.950
 unscrew means unscrew the pulley 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.190
 crankshaft 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.040
 here's a bolt back tighten and bring 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.470
 already tags match here is the yellow mark she 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.709
 must be opposite this race 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.720
 she is now two teeth as if well 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:42.690
 and there no tags match again 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:47.550
 just saying that for example here's a pump 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.510
 also changed here is what the whole thing 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:58.550
 The trick is that Gram is pulled to the pump 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:03:02.670
 here are three three hex bolts 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.829
 I remember under the top five here, but if you will 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.370
 change how we own the same course 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.180
 everybody knows 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.970
 just for those who might be the first time 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.630
 will face this information on the net there 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.630
 as if 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.970
 full as I just tell you 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:28.340
 then removed the bolt back spun 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.340
 align the marks fixed asterisks 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:39.930
 unscrew this support so that it does not 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:43.740
 interfered here unscrewed bypass roller here 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:47.930
 This unscrewed tensioner but also ways 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:52.860
 a resident here is drawn to the pump 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:56.820
 tensioner looks like this 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.330
 tensioner here when the pump to stretch 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.160
 it is necessary that this part coincided with this 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:12.500
 pump twist it pull than turn 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:12.500
 the pump made such a device 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.590
 if you can cut the key to size 41 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.160
 this one 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:26.820
 spanner wrench 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:30.510
 41 well and as welded from the ratchet 3 8 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:36.180
 to make it more convenient to back and forth depth 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:40.050
 here is such a tool now 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.900
 when everyone unscrewed the pillow before 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.730
 over under the jack and the engine under the pallet 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.580
 put something bar or something 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:50.460
 or so straight up the jacking then 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.610
 unscrew the pillow and everything you have here 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.770
 it is necessary to change funny eyes 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.490
 videos 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.350
 changed the pump well, and better prizes play 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.270
 and change because banal butt 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.680
 once so that the power of one for the same 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:10.580
 the work does not pay if you do not do it yourself 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.580
 so they pulled 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.030
 it can be seen badly but you can see the teeth match 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:37.090
 before 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:41.830
 seen bad set pomp let down 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:45.100
 matched cloves pulled the pump and you can 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.680
 assembled in the reverse order is such 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.280
 here is a replacement for all the luck 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.280
 until
