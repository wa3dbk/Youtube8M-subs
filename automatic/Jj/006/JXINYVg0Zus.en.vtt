highly<00:00:30.570> recommend<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.610> make<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
highly recommend that you make the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.110 
highly recommend that you make the
templates<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.950> stiff<00:00:34.950> cardboard<00:00:35.370> for<00:00:35.910> your

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
templates in stiff cardboard for your

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.209 
templates in stiff cardboard for your
participants<00:00:36.870> because<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:37.770> easier<00:00:38.190> for

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
participants because it's easier for

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.600 
participants because it's easier for
them<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.660> to<00:00:39.660> do<00:00:39.809> their<00:00:40.020> own<00:00:40.370> tracing<00:00:41.370> and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
them to to do their own tracing and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.170 
them to to do their own tracing and
their<00:00:41.820> own<00:00:41.940> cutting<00:00:43.370> so<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.730> are<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:45.059> to

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
their own cutting so we are going to

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.959 
their own cutting so we are going to
start<00:00:46.079> by<00:00:46.350> folding<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.370> paper<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.730> show<00:00:47.910> you

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
start by folding the paper I show you

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.260 
start by folding the paper I show you
how<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.270> fold<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.870> paper<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.640> we<00:00:50.640> fold<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
how to fold the paper and we fold the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.660 
how to fold the paper and we fold the
the<00:00:51.629> circles<00:00:52.590> four<00:00:53.340> times<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.690> let's<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.670> this

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
the circles four times so let's do this

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.880 
the circles four times so let's do this
one<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.210> fold<00:00:57.660> once<00:00:59.210> twice<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:01.680> more

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
one you fold once twice the more

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.729 
one you fold once twice the more
accurate<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.730> fold<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.930> paper<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.530> better

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
accurate you fold the paper the better

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.179 
accurate you fold the paper the better
the<00:01:05.129> tree<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.780> three<00:01:06.780> times<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:08.420> four<00:01:10.189> went

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
the tree and three times and four went

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.460 
the tree and three times and four went
on<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.580> last<00:01:11.790> one<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.450> get<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.990> end<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.320> a

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
on the last one you get the end of a

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.649 
on the last one you get the end of a
scissors<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.100> flatten<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:17.240> once<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.420> do<00:01:18.630> that

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
scissors and flatten it once you do that

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.140 
scissors and flatten it once you do that
you<00:01:19.290> open<00:01:19.939> the<00:01:20.939> circle<00:01:21.450> completely<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:23.150> you

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
you open the circle completely and you

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.899 
you open the circle completely and you
fold<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:26.360> concertina<00:01:27.530> style<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.369> you

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
fold it concertina style like that you

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.859 
fold it concertina style like that you
do<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.420> batches<00:01:30.680> because<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:31.860> easier

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
do it in batches because it's easier

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.690 
do it in batches because it's easier
just<00:01:33.869> flatten<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> paper<00:01:34.890> as<00:01:35.189> much<00:01:35.400> as<00:01:35.579> you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
just flatten the paper as much as you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.260 
just flatten the paper as much as you
can<00:01:36.680> when<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:38.040> all<00:01:38.310> four<00:01:38.990> circles

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
can when you have all four circles

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.350 
can when you have all four circles
folded<00:01:42.270> you're<00:01:42.899> going<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.229> make<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.710> small<00:01:44.310> hole

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
folded you're going to make a small hole

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.240 
folded you're going to make a small hole
with<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.420> cut<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> small<00:01:46.140> hole<00:01:46.170> at<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.619> top<00:01:46.920> just

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
with a cut a small hole at the top just

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.850 
with a cut a small hole at the top just
to<00:01:47.430> fit<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.149> bamboo<00:01:48.360> skewer

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
a bamboo skewer make sure that the base

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.740 
a bamboo skewer make sure that the base
is<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:03.280> right<00:02:03.640> size<00:02:03.970> for<00:02:04.330> your<00:02:04.810> tree<00:02:06.600> for<00:02:07.600> the
