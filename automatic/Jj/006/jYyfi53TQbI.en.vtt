00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
this is not one of those places with a

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.920 
this is not one of those places with a
fish<00:02:36.520> lay<00:02:36.730> on<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:36.940> front<00:02:37.150> edge<00:02:37.300> of<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.450> pinna

fish lay on the front edge of the pinna
so<00:02:38.560> what<00:02:38.709> they're<00:02:38.860> doing<00:02:38.890> is<00:02:39.220> you're<00:02:39.400> just

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
so what they're doing is you're just

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.100 
so what they're doing is you're just
laying<00:02:39.730> back<00:02:39.880> behind<00:02:40.209> these<00:02:40.480> boulders<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:40.989> it

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
laying back behind these boulders and it

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.690 
laying back behind these boulders and it
just<00:02:41.260> ambushed<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.709> what<00:02:41.830> comes<00:02:42.010> by<00:02:42.190> correct

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
just ambushed and what comes by correct

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.800 
just ambushed and what comes by correct
and<00:02:42.850> there's<00:02:42.970> less<00:02:43.150> current<00:02:43.390> back<00:02:43.630> there

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
and there's less current back there

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.300 
and there's less current back there
because<00:02:43.959> they're<00:02:44.200> below<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.620> right<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.220> you

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
because they're below it right so you

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.380
