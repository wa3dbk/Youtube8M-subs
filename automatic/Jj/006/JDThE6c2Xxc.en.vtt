00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.640
 Hey guys 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.130
 I'll pass on to you, just identify me. 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.160
 some decoder defect 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.130
 you can see if this indicator 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.380
 do the heat show for you 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.710
 in this case justified here is in 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.510
 great state and in this way let's do 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.300
 some tests and when its components 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.440
 are in perfect condition 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.280
 come on then under him there are four 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.140
 screws 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.750
 Let's open, I've removed the four 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.750
 screws with you can see here 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.680
 and we take out contention that it is docking 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.680
 they are seeing 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.390
 and here he dismantled a military one 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.480
 little dirty 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:20.870
 then we will clean it cable 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:25.270
 Here food and close to the engine which is 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.270
 the centerpiece made one 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:47.760
 the case of withdrawing the motor that we take out 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.760
 this protection very well 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.400
 the engine shaft retaining a nut 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.400
 see only 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:12.470
 I know how he accumulated personal dirt. 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:18.220
 seeing here that behind the button 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.220
 selector if you can be there look only 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.420
 we have a common diode and we will test for 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.840
 that you can see if he's good 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.840
 or bad 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.990
 Let's clean it with some cotton 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.990
 alcohol 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.030
 screw holding motor study 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.640
 Look how clean it looks, just look how it looks. 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:26.390
 wet cotton in something as well as 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:26.390
 to the dirt embedded here 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.689
 now the test in the common gold 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:45.290
 Let's give alligators in their terminals. 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:48.250
 only as red is already zeroed and we put 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.250
 on the lesion scale 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.689
 one side with 12 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.859
 now we invert the claws and the task and 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:05.859
 sight scale 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.889
 the pointer does not move, it's fine 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:38.660
 the engine channels that it stays together 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:42.560
 of a power cable cover from the 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:45.310
 the motor terminal stays here you 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.310
 can speak 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.520
 Now the next step is holding the 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:05.700
 alligator cars 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.700
 the unicef motor terminals 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:16.170
 We put in the review scale and indicates 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.170
 For folks, the reels are good. 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.540
 What 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.740
 the rest of the power cord 220 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.900
 volts and alternating current 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.140
 we put an alligator cat in the 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:51.440
 with the other proton tip 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:52.250
 causing the ram screen of 21 shows that with 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.880
 2 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.880
 the good 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.770
 now on the other end of the cable. 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.880
 food 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:11.970
 We do the same thing with humor tract 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:14.790
 we put on the scale of times together 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:18.530
 as you can see also with 2 cable 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.530
 power supply is great. 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:33.080
 and as I have said enough for this engine 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.080
 is in great condition 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.830
 there is just out on the street
