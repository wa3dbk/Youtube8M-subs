what we want to demonstrate in our video

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.179 
what we want to demonstrate in our video
is<00:00:21.230> exactly<00:00:22.230> how<00:00:22.500> we're<00:00:22.710> synchronic

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
is exactly how we're synchronic

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.400 
is exactly how we're synchronic
technology<00:00:23.699> functions<00:00:24.660> as<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:25.080> pressure

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.060 
technology functions as a pressure
relief<00:00:25.859> valve<00:00:26.330> so<00:00:27.330> now<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:27.539> have<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:28.070> synapse

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
relief valve so now we have the synapse

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.310 
relief valve so now we have the synapse
technology<00:00:30.000> integrated<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:31.019> pressure

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
relief valve this pressure relief valve

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.010 
relief valve this pressure relief valve
is<00:00:34.440> characterized<00:00:35.100> by<00:00:35.399> oring<00:00:36.210> seals<00:00:36.600> all<00:00:36.899> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
is characterized by oring seals all the

is characterized by oring seals all the
way<00:00:37.079> around<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:38.040> currently<00:00:38.250> we're<00:00:38.550> running

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
way around so currently we're running

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.639 
way around so currently we're running
relatively<00:00:39.390> low<00:00:39.570> pressures<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.320> such<00:00:40.500> as

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
relatively low pressures in it such as

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.580 
relatively low pressures in it such as
37<00:00:41.370> psi<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.540> can<00:00:42.719> take<00:00:42.930> burst<00:00:43.200> pressures

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
37 psi but it can take burst pressures

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.470 
37 psi but it can take burst pressures

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
respect oring and what we're going to

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.090 
respect oring and what we're going to
demonstrate<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.440> how<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.649> synchronic

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
demonstrate to you is how the synchronic

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.479 
demonstrate to you is how the synchronic
actuator<00:00:50.879> technology<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.600> applied<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.800> this

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
actuator technology is applied in this

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.189 
actuator technology is applied in this
pressure<00:00:53.789> relief<00:00:54.149> valve<00:00:54.420> you've<00:00:54.989> got<00:00:55.170> a

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
pressure relief valve you've got a

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.869 
pressure relief valve you've got a
poppet<00:00:55.620> valve<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.250> controlled<00:00:56.699> by<00:00:56.730> an

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
poppet valve that is controlled by an

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.150 
poppet valve that is controlled by an
actuator<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.629> has<00:00:58.109> pressure<00:00:58.410> operating<00:00:59.039> on

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
actuator that has pressure operating on

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.580 
actuator that has pressure operating on
both<00:00:59.370> sides<00:00:59.670> now<00:01:00.000> what<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:00.960> really<00:01:01.379> different

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
both sides now what is really different

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.310 
both sides now what is really different
is<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> tiered<00:01:02.879> piston<00:01:03.539> actuator<00:01:04.080> in

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
is this is a tiered piston actuator in

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.070 
is this is a tiered piston actuator in
this<00:01:05.189> pressure<00:01:05.700> relief<00:01:06.090> valve<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.780> what<00:01:06.930> we're

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
this pressure relief valve so what we're

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.440 
this pressure relief valve so what we're
doing<00:01:07.110> now<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.830> we're<00:01:08.490> building<00:01:08.850> pressure<00:01:09.090> in

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
doing now is we're building pressure in

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.100 
doing now is we're building pressure in
the<00:01:10.200> pipe<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:11.450> what<00:01:12.450> our<00:01:12.479> valve<00:01:12.780> will<00:01:12.900> do<00:01:13.049> is

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
the pipe and what our valve will do is

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.260 
the pipe and what our valve will do is
it<00:01:13.229> will<00:01:13.260> relieve<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.740> pressure<00:01:14.040> using<00:01:14.970> only

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
it will relieve that pressure using only

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.300 
it will relieve that pressure using only
the<00:01:16.110> same<00:01:16.409> system<00:01:17.280> pressure<00:01:17.630> so<00:01:18.630> there<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:18.900> no

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
the same system pressure so there is no

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.649 
the same system pressure so there is no
regulated<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.610> pressure<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.939> actuate<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
regulated the pressure to actuate the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.080 
regulated the pressure to actuate the
valve<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.020> not<00:01:22.229> regulated<00:01:22.700> there<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.820> not<00:01:24.060> a

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
valve is not regulated there is not a

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.870 
valve is not regulated there is not a
pressure<00:01:24.720> differential<00:01:25.170> between<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:26.009> front

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
pressure differential between the front

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.789 
pressure differential between the front
of<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> actuator<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.350> back<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
of the actuator in the back of the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.460 
of the actuator in the back of the
actuator<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.520> either<00:01:30.270> substrate<00:01:30.930> with

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
actuator on either substrate with

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.600 
actuator on either substrate with
actually<00:01:31.829> happening<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.400> we're<00:01:32.579> just

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
actually happening is we're just

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.749 
actually happening is we're just
creating<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.119> time<00:01:33.390> delay<00:01:33.630> between<00:01:33.990> when<00:01:34.950> this

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
creating a time delay between when this

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.980 
creating a time delay between when this
pressure<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.210> relieved<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.720> when<00:01:36.869> this

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
pressure is relieved and when this

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.020 
pressure is relieved and when this
pressure<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.380> blood<00:01:37.590> down<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.549> we've<00:01:38.790> got<00:01:39.000> a

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
pressure is blood down so we've got a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.420 
pressure is blood down so we've got a
three-way<00:01:39.689> solenoid<00:01:40.229> valve<00:01:40.829> that's

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
three-way solenoid valve that's

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.359 
three-way solenoid valve that's
connected<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.960> back<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:44.009> actuator

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
connected to the back of the actuator

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.450 
connected to the back of the actuator
and<00:01:44.759> what<00:01:44.880> will<00:01:45.030> happen<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.570> when<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.409> vent<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and what will happen is when we vent the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.030 
and what will happen is when we vent the
back<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> actuator<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:49.020> atmosphere<00:01:49.590> it

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
back of the actuator the atmosphere it

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.770 
back of the actuator the atmosphere it
will<00:01:50.189> create<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.520> time<00:01:50.880> difference<00:01:51.180> between

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
will create a time difference between

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.889 
will create a time difference between
the<00:01:52.320> front<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.890> back<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.549> actuator

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
the front and the back of the actuator

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.600 
the front and the back of the actuator
effectively<00:01:54.899> relieving<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.350> pressure<00:01:58.610> and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
effectively relieving the pressure and

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.219 
effectively relieving the pressure and
as<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.149> see<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.509> our<00:02:00.630> gauge<00:02:00.930> here

as you can see on our gauge here

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.030 
as you can see on our gauge here
pressure<00:02:02.130> drops<00:02:02.549> immediately<00:02:03.020> from<00:02:04.020> 37<00:02:04.590> psi

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040

all<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.880> way<00:02:05.969> down<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.180> zero<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.190> this<00:02:08.190> point

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
all the way down to zero and this point

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.390 
all the way down to zero and this point
to<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:08.729> point<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:10.170> time<00:02:10.530> differential<00:02:11.160> so

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
to this point is a time differential so

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.589 
to this point is a time differential so
the<00:02:11.520> amount<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.819> time<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.180> takes<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.450> actually

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
the amount of time it takes to actually

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.839 
the amount of time it takes to actually
event<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.410> pressure<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.890> very<00:02:14.250> very<00:02:14.459> small

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
event that pressure is very very small

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.089 
event that pressure is very very small
so<00:02:15.599> we<00:02:16.379> believe<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.800> some<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.040> the

we're going to do is we're going to

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.090 
we're going to do is we're going to
relieve<00:03:56.960> that<00:03:56.990> pressure<00:03:57.290> using<00:03:57.710> a<00:03:57.770> three-way

relieve that pressure using a three-way
solenoid<00:03:58.160> valve<00:03:58.730> milliseconds<00:03:59.720> faster<00:03:59.930> than

it<00:04:01.550> would<00:04:01.670> be<00:04:01.820> seeing<00:04:02.060> it<00:04:02.300> in<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.600> vessel<00:04:02.810> and

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
it would be seeing it in the vessel and

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.570 
it would be seeing it in the vessel and
you'll<00:04:03.650> see<00:04:03.770> the<00:04:03.860> pressure<00:04:04.070> relief<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:07.370> again

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
you'll see the pressure relief and again

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.310 
you'll see the pressure relief and again
it<00:04:07.700> is<00:04:07.790> amazing<00:04:08.120> how<00:04:08.150> fast<00:04:08.480> that<00:04:08.810> pressure<00:04:09.110> is

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
it is amazing how fast that pressure is

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
discharged for the whole vessel so we

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.260 
discharged for the whole vessel so we
believe<00:04:13.010> that<00:04:13.130> there<00:04:13.400> are<00:04:13.430> some<00:04:13.640> significant

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.870 
four-way remote pilot actuated valve and
once<00:04:40.550> we<00:04:40.610> pressurize<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.270> system<00:04:42.760> we're<00:04:43.760> able

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
once we pressurize the system we're able

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.600 
once we pressurize the system we're able
to<00:04:44.090> reach<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:45.470> control<00:04:46.010> pressure<00:04:46.250> for<00:04:46.550> the

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
to reach the control pressure for the

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.000 
to reach the control pressure for the
valve<00:04:49.540> now<00:04:50.540> the<00:04:50.600> valves<00:04:50.930> control<00:04:51.290> pressure<00:04:51.560> is

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
valve now the valves control pressure is

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.370 
valve now the valves control pressure is
keeping<00:04:52.340> the<00:04:52.430> valve<00:04:52.610> shut<00:04:52.990> once<00:04:53.990> we<00:04:54.110> let<00:04:54.290> this

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
keeping the valve shut once we let this

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.310 
keeping the valve shut once we let this
pressure<00:04:54.650> go<00:04:55.540> the<00:04:56.540> pilot<00:04:56.930> pressure<00:04:57.080> will

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
pressure go the pilot pressure will

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.650 
pressure go the pilot pressure will
disappear<00:04:57.770> it<00:04:58.460> will<00:04:58.610> bring<00:04:58.790> the<00:04:59.030> back<00:04:59.210> of<00:04:59.510> the

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
disappear it will bring the back of the

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.270 
disappear it will bring the back of the
pressure<00:04:59.870> relief<00:05:00.169> valve<00:05:00.440> to<00:05:00.590> atmosphere<00:05:01.100> and

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
pressure relief valve to atmosphere and

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.010 
pressure relief valve to atmosphere and
there<00:05:01.910> will<00:05:02.000> still<00:05:02.180> be<00:05:02.240> pressure<00:05:02.540> in<00:05:02.720> the<00:05:02.810> pipe

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
there will still be pressure in the pipe

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.050 
there will still be pressure in the pipe
and<00:05:03.590> so<00:05:03.740> what<00:05:03.830> will<00:05:03.950> happen<00:05:03.979> is<00:05:04.490> the<00:05:04.820> valve

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
and so what will happen is the valve

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.630 
and so what will happen is the valve
will<00:05:05.300> open<00:05:05.419> up<00:05:05.750> with<00:05:06.590> the<00:05:06.710> same<00:05:06.979> system

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
will open up with the same system

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.350 
will open up with the same system
pressure<00:05:07.850> in<00:05:08.510> order<00:05:08.780> to<00:05:08.900> relieve<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:10.940> buildup

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
pressure in order to relieve the buildup

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.750 
pressure in order to relieve the buildup
in<00:05:11.570> the<00:05:11.800> vessel<00:05:13.810> and<00:05:14.810> it<00:05:15.770> does<00:05:15.950> so<00:05:16.160> quickly<00:05:16.580> and

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
in the vessel and it does so quickly and

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.850 
in the vessel and it does so quickly and
so<00:05:16.820> if<00:05:17.810> you<00:05:18.200> watch<00:05:18.410> some<00:05:18.620> of<00:05:18.680> our<00:05:18.830> other

and<00:06:39.340> what<00:06:40.090> we're<00:06:40.240> doing<00:06:40.270> is<00:06:41.070> we're<00:06:42.070> able<00:06:42.250> to

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
and what we're doing is we're able to

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.710 
and what we're doing is we're able to
actually<00:06:42.670> a<00:06:42.970> valve<00:06:43.300> using<00:06:43.600> only<00:06:43.900> pressure<00:06:44.590> a<00:06:45.720> B

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 
actually a valve using only pressure a B

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.870 
actually a valve using only pressure a B
we're<00:06:47.140> using<00:06:47.320> the<00:06:47.560> same<00:06:47.860> system<00:06:48.700> pressure

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 
we're using the same system pressure

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.090 
we're using the same system pressure
value<00:06:49.360> so<00:06:49.870> there<00:06:50.020> is<00:06:50.110> no<00:06:50.290> pressure<00:06:50.560> regulation

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
value so there is no pressure regulation

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.700 
value so there is no pressure regulation
