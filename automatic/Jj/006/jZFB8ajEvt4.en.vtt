have about 500 square foot to work from

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.690 
have about 500 square foot to work from
which<00:01:24.259> should<00:01:24.409> last<00:01:24.590> us<00:01:24.890> another<00:01:25.280> month<00:01:25.549> or

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
which should last us another month or

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.180 
which should last us another month or
two<00:01:25.759> and<00:01:26.420> then<00:01:26.479> going<00:01:27.080> into<00:01:28.539> 2010<00:01:29.920> now<00:01:30.920> here's

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
two and then going into 2010 now here's

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.100 
two and then going into 2010 now here's
an<00:01:31.310> example<00:01:31.399> of<00:01:31.819> something<00:01:32.090> very<00:01:32.479> funny

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
an example of something very funny

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.070 
an example of something very funny
typically<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.220> thinner<00:01:34.520> they<00:01:34.729> are<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.840> grain

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
typically the thinner they are the grain

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.930 
typically the thinner they are the grain
fenders<00:01:36.440> not<00:01:36.710> as<00:01:36.860> pronounced<00:01:37.250> but<00:01:37.580> this<00:01:37.759> would

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
fenders not as pronounced but this would

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.230 
fenders not as pronounced but this would
definitely<00:01:38.119> be<00:01:38.979> juniors<00:01:39.979> performance<00:01:40.580> not

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
definitely be juniors performance not

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.370 
definitely be juniors performance not
that<00:01:41.450> you<00:01:41.569> couldn't<00:01:41.750> use<00:01:41.840> this<00:01:42.110> it<00:01:42.259> would<00:01:42.350> just

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
that you couldn't use this it would just

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.039 
that you couldn't use this it would just
be<00:01:42.619> a<00:01:42.649> little<00:01:42.799> bit<00:01:42.890> different<00:01:43.220> so<00:01:44.090> basically

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
be a little bit different so basically

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.719 
be a little bit different so basically
you<00:01:45.920> sacrifice<00:01:47.350> less<00:01:48.350> weight<00:01:48.619> meaning<00:01:49.459> less

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
you sacrifice less weight meaning less

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.510 
you sacrifice less weight meaning less
thickness<00:01:50.179> with<00:01:50.869> less<00:01:51.049> grain<00:01:51.289> pattern<00:01:51.649> so<00:01:51.950> you

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
thickness with less grain pattern so you

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.389 
thickness with less grain pattern so you
can<00:01:52.700> have<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:52.940> best<00:01:53.119> of<00:01:53.240> both<00:01:53.270> worlds<00:01:54.399> we

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
can have the best of both worlds we

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.249 
can have the best of both worlds we
don't<00:01:55.549> have<00:01:55.640> many<00:01:55.759> of<00:01:55.880> those<00:01:56.170> majority<00:01:57.170> of

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
don't have many of those majority of

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.930 
don't have many of those majority of
them<00:01:57.350> are<00:01:57.440> of<00:01:57.530> a<00:01:57.590> thicker<00:01:57.860> meeting<00:01:58.640> here<00:01:58.759> ones

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
them are of a thicker meeting here ones

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.979 
them are of a thicker meeting here ones
with<00:01:59.119> an<00:01:59.209> ice<00:01:59.330> cream<00:01:59.539> better<00:02:01.690> so<00:02:02.690> we've<00:02:02.840> gone

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:02.989 
with an ice cream better so we've gone

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:04.690 
with an ice cream better so we've gone
through<00:02:03.050> about<00:02:03.349> 10<00:02:03.590> scans<00:02:04.069> and<00:02:04.310> you'll<00:02:04.399> see

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
through about 10 scans and you'll see

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.119
