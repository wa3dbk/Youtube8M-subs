going<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.010> kind<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.310> carry<00:02:40.520> over<00:02:40.850> going

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
going to kind of carry over going

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.540 
going to kind of carry over going
forward<00:02:41.720> so<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:42.380> we<00:02:42.500> do<00:02:42.620> get<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:42.980> arrival<00:02:43.430> of

gems<00:03:33.230> a<00:03:33.380> little<00:03:33.620> bit<00:03:33.739> more<00:03:33.980> and<00:03:34.329> getting<00:03:35.329> to

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
gems a little bit more and getting to

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.479 
gems a little bit more and getting to
see<00:03:35.480> how<00:03:35.840> some<00:03:36.079> of<00:03:36.110> these<00:03:36.230> characters<00:03:36.530> kind<00:03:37.400> of

see how some of these characters kind of

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.090 
see how some of these characters kind of
came<00:03:37.700> into<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:39.019> ownership<00:03:39.470> of<00:03:39.799> these

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
came into the ownership of these

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.039 
came into the ownership of these
particular<00:03:40.579> energems<00:03:41.030> we<00:03:41.420> don't<00:03:41.510> have<00:03:41.750> a<00:03:41.810> back

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
particular energems we don't have a back

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.080 
particular energems we don't have a back
story<00:03:42.290> yet<00:03:42.590> for<00:03:42.769> Kota<00:03:42.950> or<00:03:43.220> chase<00:03:43.549> but<00:03:43.970> I'm

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
story yet for Kota or chase but I'm

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.039 
story yet for Kota or chase but I'm
pretty<00:03:44.269> sure<00:03:44.390> that's<00:03:44.690> something<00:03:44.870> that

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
pretty sure that's something that

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:46.240 
pretty sure that's something that
they're<00:03:45.260> going<00:03:45.350> to<00:03:45.440> kind<00:03:45.709> of<00:03:45.769> get<00:03:45.980> into

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
they're going to kind of get into

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.789 
they're going to kind of get into
further<00:03:47.000> on<00:03:47.329> down<00:03:47.359> the<00:03:47.690> season<00:03:48.230> as<00:03:48.350> far<00:03:48.560> as<00:03:48.650> how

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
further on down the season as far as how

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.890 
further on down the season as far as how
they<00:03:49.100> found<00:03:49.430> their<00:03:50.030> energems<00:03:50.570> I'm<00:03:50.780> sure

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
they found their energems I'm sure

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.390 
they found their energems I'm sure
there's<00:03:51.079> probably<00:03:51.320> some<00:03:51.500> backstory<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.070> that

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
there's probably some backstory to that

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.710 
there's probably some backstory to that
so<00:03:52.940> I'm<00:03:53.060> pretty<00:03:53.209> sure<00:03:53.359> that<00:03:53.510> will<00:03:53.690> be

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
so I'm pretty sure that will be

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.930 
so I'm pretty sure that will be
explained<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:54.859> also<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:55.130> like<00:03:55.340> to<00:03:55.400> kind<00:03:55.700> of<00:03:55.760> get

to<00:05:00.170> that<00:05:00.380> and<00:05:01.160> again<00:05:01.700> it<00:05:01.880> just<00:05:01.910> has<00:05:02.210> a<00:05:02.240> very

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
to that and again it just has a very

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.900 
to that and again it just has a very
very<00:05:03.020> cool<00:05:03.350> different<00:05:03.950> tone<00:05:04.370> about<00:05:04.700> this

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
very cool different tone about this

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.190 
very cool different tone about this
particular<00:05:05.090> season<00:05:05.570> that<00:05:05.840> I<00:05:05.900> think<00:05:06.080> it's

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
particular season that I think it's

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.350 
particular season that I think it's
going<00:05:06.290> to<00:05:06.380> be<00:05:06.500> great<00:05:06.740> going<00:05:07.250> forward<00:05:07.700> and<00:05:08.270> I

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
going to be great going forward and I

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.210 
going to be great going forward and I
kind<00:05:08.630> of<00:05:08.690> get<00:05:08.870> the<00:05:08.900> idea<00:05:08.990> that<00:05:09.470> maybe<00:05:09.830> each

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
kind of get the idea that maybe each

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.730 
kind of get the idea that maybe each
episode<00:05:11.030> is<00:05:11.240> kind<00:05:11.630> of<00:05:11.720> connected<00:05:12.260> as<00:05:12.410> far<00:05:12.620> as

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
episode is kind of connected as far as

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.040 
episode is kind of connected as far as
like<00:05:12.920> the<00:05:13.850> storyline<00:05:14.330> is<00:05:14.420> going<00:05:14.570> to<00:05:14.630> be<00:05:14.720> one

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
like the storyline is going to be one

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.830 
like the storyline is going to be one
giant<00:05:15.520> continuation<00:05:16.520> even<00:05:17.450> the<00:05:17.510> way<00:05:17.660> that

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
giant continuation even the way that

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.720 
giant continuation even the way that
this<00:05:17.990> particular<00:05:18.200> episode<00:05:18.680> ended<00:05:19.460> while<00:05:19.610> it

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
this particular episode ended while it

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.240 
this particular episode ended while it
didn't<00:05:20.030> say<00:05:20.180> to<00:05:20.240> be<00:05:20.540> continued<00:05:21.170> just<00:05:22.010> the<00:05:22.100> way

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
didn't say to be continued just the way

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.670 
didn't say to be continued just the way
that<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:22.520> episode<00:05:23.000> and<00:05:23.150> it<00:05:23.420> feels<00:05:23.780> like<00:05:24.080> next

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
that the episode and it feels like next

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.230 
that the episode and it feels like next
week's<00:05:24.860> episode<00:05:24.950> is<00:05:25.310> going<00:05:25.490> to<00:05:25.580> pick<00:05:25.790> up<00:05:25.820> right

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
week's episode is going to pick up right

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.600 
week's episode is going to pick up right
where<00:05:26.270> we<00:05:26.480> kind<00:05:26.780> of<00:05:26.870> left<00:05:27.050> off<00:05:27.320> that<00:05:27.680> or<00:05:27.920> at

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
where we kind of left off that or at

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.840 
where we kind of left off that or at
least<00:05:29.710> still<00:05:30.710> continuing<00:05:31.250> following<00:05:31.640> what's

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
least still continuing following what's

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.280 
least still continuing following what's
been<00:05:31.940> happening<00:05:32.420> so<00:05:32.600> for<00:05:32.810> with<00:05:32.930> the<00:05:33.050> power

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
been happening so for with the power

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.380 
been happening so for with the power
just<00:05:33.470> it<00:05:33.770> doesn't<00:05:33.980> feel<00:05:34.250> like<00:05:34.310> each<00:05:34.640> episode

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
just it doesn't feel like each episode

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.260 
just it doesn't feel like each episode
is<00:05:35.570> its<00:05:35.930> own<00:05:36.080> individual<00:05:37.040> like<00:05:37.430> villain<00:05:38.150> of

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
is its own individual like villain of

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.970 
is its own individual like villain of
the<00:05:38.390> week<00:05:38.570> so<00:05:38.780> far<00:05:38.810> but<00:05:39.110> then<00:05:39.230> again<00:05:39.350> I<00:05:39.650> could

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
the week so far but then again I could

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.860 
the week so far but then again I could
be<00:05:40.370> wrong<00:05:40.520> again<00:05:40.760> we've<00:05:40.970> all<00:05:41.210> were<00:05:41.390> only<00:05:41.630> two

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
be wrong again we've all were only two

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.680 
be wrong again we've all were only two
episodes<00:05:42.380> into<00:05:42.980> this<00:05:43.190> particular<00:05:43.670> season<00:05:43.940> but

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
episodes into this particular season but

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.840 
episodes into this particular season but
from<00:05:45.350> what<00:05:45.470> I've<00:05:45.620> seen<00:05:45.650> so<00:05:45.860> far<00:05:46.040> I<00:05:46.310> right<00:05:46.820> to

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
from what I've seen so far I right to

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.910 
from what I've seen so far I right to
get<00:05:47.120> my<00:05:47.240> hopes<00:05:47.510> up<00:05:47.660> too<00:05:47.840> early<00:05:47.870> but<00:05:48.560> I<00:05:48.620> think

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
get my hopes up too early but I think

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.680 
get my hopes up too early but I think
they're<00:05:49.070> definitely<00:05:49.310> on<00:05:49.580> the<00:05:49.850> right<00:05:50.060> track<00:05:50.360> I

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
they're definitely on the right track I

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.500 
they're definitely on the right track I
feel<00:05:51.350> like<00:05:51.560> this<00:05:51.800> is<00:05:52.010> gonna<00:05:52.760> be<00:05:53.030> a<00:05:53.060> Power

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
feel like this is gonna be a Power

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.810 
feel like this is gonna be a Power
