Hi, I'm Jose Luis from Brildor

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.780
if you work with printable vinyl you'll find yourself

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.940
with the need to cut out the material after it's printed

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.720
although a printing and cutting plotter looks like a good solution

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.420
today I'll show you how easy it is to work with two separate machines

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.520
one for printing and another one for cutting

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.000
although investing in a single machine might sound like a good idea

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.420
if you compare production times

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.860
having two machines that work separately gives you more flexibility

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.680
in organizing your workflow

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.080
therefore your investment will be worth it

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.520
our recommendation: Mutoh VJ-628 printing plotter

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.600
and Graphtec CE6000-60 cutting plotter

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.480
both machines communicate thru the expansion of Onyx RipCenter software

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.860
making the process of printing and cutting easy and productive

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.820
in this video I'll show you how to print and cut stickers using this two plotters

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.200
Let's begin

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.530
the first thing we must do is to prepare the image we want to print and cut

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.010
we can do so in Corel, AI, Inkscape or any other vector program

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.820
we must draw the trace lines that we want to cut out

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.300
assign a color that stands out and name it specifically CutContour

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.540
so that the cutting plotter can read where it has to cut

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.080
the color of the line is not printed, you can actually use any color

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.340
but it's advisable to use a conspicuous color

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.040
such as red or magenta

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.249
we save our image in EPS format so it keeps the CutContour

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.279
now we open it on Onyx

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.740
we load the material, in this case we have a roll of vinyl 630 mm wide

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.180
to print and cut stickers

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.749
the configuration of each material can be saved

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:09.629
in this case we configured the vinyl with its size and thickness and we called it "pegatina brillo"

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.360
It's easy! Just click on the configuration botton and change the settings

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.480
if you normally work with various types of material

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.800
this feature will be very useful

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.960
in the display we'll see that we can fit

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.960
3 stickers on the width of the material

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.360
so on the properties window we put the number of copies that we want

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.740
in this case a dozen

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.000
we recommend doing short runs

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.360
in order to minimize posssible shifts when cutting

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:45.469
if you click on the display window you'll see that the software places all the copies

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.300
if you want to make more adjustments such as separation between each image

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.540
click on the button "cambiar" and on the options tab change the values

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.260
once all the adjustments are made we send to the printer

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.420
by selecting the machine first and then clicking on the "print now" button

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.160
when we print something that's going to be cut out we get registration marks

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.020
but in this case we can also see a number, a bar code and an arrow

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.120
the number and bar code is the job number

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.500
the arrow indicates the direction in which the material should be loaded into the cutting plotter

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.520
we load the material

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.080
the plotter will start measuring the material

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.720
now on the RipCenter we click on Cutserver and a list of the jobs

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.820
that have been launched will appear with its codes

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.460
we find the code of our job and we'll see that the software shows us

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:59.139
all the CutContour lines that we did on our vector program

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.680
click on the button cut now and the optical reader begins working

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.180
and searching fo0r the lines to start cutting

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.240
we now have all the cuts

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.160
find our proposal Mutoh-Graphtec

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.220

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.260
or on the links that appear on your screeen

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.760
