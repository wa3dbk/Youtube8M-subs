00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.200
 that year we are going to make a 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.139
 brigadier to take revenge a little bit 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.150
 different with the pan at a glance. 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.179
 little 16 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.119
 I put a can of milk 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.490
 condensed cuiabá and still we go 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.180
 add a tablespoon of butter 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.180
 without salt 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.390
 Cocoa are two tablespoons in 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.390
 fire 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.710
 and that the different status put a 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:49.260
 spoon of honey soup the honey the cocoa it 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.260
 It blends well with him 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.470
 the best 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.439
 when you have so sticking the bottom 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:42.439
 he is already at the point 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:46.149
 I'll still hang up or be evoked 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.149
 treated lightly buttered 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:02.390
 The idea is cool because it can not stuff 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.060
 you can call it light can run from 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.250
 year can do can put together a good 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.800
 test on the same with it lends itself 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.180
 to do various things obviously I 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.640
 I'm making the simplest version here 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.830
 which is the holder so I put with the 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.480
 Dish of annoying day it cool in 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:23.030
 room temperature is working 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.560
 but can put in the refrigerator can can 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.660
 put in the refrigerator it will take a 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.060
 consistency faster but I 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.460
 I particularly prefer to leave it at 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.710
 the top of the counter had to house him 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.740
 will wait and feel free to roll 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:43.820
 do it here do not take a little bit 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:52.520
 the little woman will get more or less the 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:55.310
 measure demonstrates is the little ball 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.540
 brigadeiro he is not - he is maranhão 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.820
 it was cocoa 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:05.230
 this is the grain or the margin 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:08.300
 is anyone who does not find this granulate 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.650
 ready to buy half-bitter chocolate 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.650
 stay on the knife that looks cool 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.550
 to do more, some are ready for fifth 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:24.040

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:27.750
