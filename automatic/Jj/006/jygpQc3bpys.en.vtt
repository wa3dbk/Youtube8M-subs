something that cost a couple hundred

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.020 
something that cost a couple hundred
bucks<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.800> sample<00:01:14.340> base<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.670> probably<00:01:14.910> going

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
bucks that sample base is probably going

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.230 
bucks that sample base is probably going
to<00:01:15.090> be<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> lot<00:01:15.360> better<00:01:15.600> than<00:01:15.690> this<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:17.240> being

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
is without rotator rotator on pretty

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.670 
is without rotator rotator on pretty
sweet<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.160> think<00:01:41.360> so<00:01:42.360> yeah<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.290> pretty<00:01:43.560> much

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
plug-in if I were to rate it as a you

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
know five with five stars five being

stars<00:01:56.280> being<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.090> worst<00:01:57.270> plug<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.960> world

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
stars being the worst plug in the world

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.890 
stars being the worst plug in the world
I'd<00:01:58.650> say<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.159> about<00:01:59.400> three<00:01:59.820> or<00:01:59.909> four<00:02:00.120> it's

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
I'd say this is about three or four it's

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.800 
I'd say this is about three or four it's
pretty<00:02:01.140> good

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
pretty good

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.120 
pretty good
sounds<00:02:03.810> like<00:02:03.900> an<00:02:04.050> organ<00:02:04.350> apply<00:02:04.890> some

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
sounds like an organ apply some

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.040 
sounds like an organ apply some
compression<00:02:05.580> and<00:02:05.850> some<00:02:06.030> reverb<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.570> some<00:02:06.750> EQ

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
compression and some reverb and some EQ

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.090 
compression and some reverb and some EQ
you'll<00:02:07.260> probably<00:02:07.380> get<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.620> really<00:02:07.860> really<00:02:07.890> good

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
you'll probably get a really really good

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.550 
you'll probably get a really really good
sound<00:02:08.489> out<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.940> even<00:02:09.929> run<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.260> through<00:02:10.410> an

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
sound out of it even run it through an

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.580 
sound out of it even run it through an
amp<00:02:10.830> plug-in<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:12.180> know<00:02:12.209> maybe<00:02:12.930> get<00:02:13.170> some<00:02:13.200> cool

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
amp plug-in you know maybe get some cool

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:27.850 
amp plug-in you know maybe get some cool
sounds<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.100> way<00:02:14.250> but<00:02:14.810> all-in-all<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.709> a

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.400 

it's<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.920> good<00:02:29.040> sounding<00:02:29.549> little<00:02:29.940> plugin<00:02:30.410> again

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
it's a good sounding little plugin again

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.370 
it's a good sounding little plugin again
I'm<00:02:31.530> not<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.739> best<00:02:31.980> player<00:02:32.280> but<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:33.170> am<00:02:34.170> pretty

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
I'm not the best player but I am pretty

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.470 
I'm not the best player but I am pretty
picky<00:02:34.739> about<00:02:34.769> sounds<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.640> I'll<00:02:36.209> probably

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
picky about sounds and I'll probably

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.560 
picky about sounds and I'll probably
start<00:02:36.900> using<00:02:37.110> this<00:02:37.940> because<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.120> really<00:02:39.480> don't

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
start using this because I really don't

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.590
