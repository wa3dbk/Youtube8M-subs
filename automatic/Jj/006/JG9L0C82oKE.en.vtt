00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 it's serious with the referrals that are 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.390
 caught flap learned his return to warwick 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.420
 at the wharf where the water came in 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.410
 the year having been returned 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.360
 it looks like they had more 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.840
 been warned but also paul warwick himself 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.340
 picks up and then there encouragement 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.980
 it is the one who lives it on the ground 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.260
 ie all of them so that's not it 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.430
 funny plays at la rochelle last year the 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.080
 kicking his tackle at 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.660
 delaying plating up and more 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.850
 we will exchange between 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.180
 key referees peter alan and the 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.180
 window 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.020
 five yellow cards for you there 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.320
 who will be excluded ten minutes for this 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.320
 plating deemed dangerous on poor mac 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.880
 and Parisians in French blatter's 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.520
 cloud plays in Castres May 14 not to 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.320
 valenciennes that's dangerous 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:08.570
 why and then we come back to a 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.570
 treviso poker penalty everything takes 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.340
 repeating who has fled hugely to 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.260
 its water players or there against that 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.390
 sleep the reims have a card at her 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.220
 Moreover there comes into account because 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.420
 we are and why not the pure height 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.420
 bench behind 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.700
 it's paid cash 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.750
 listen sir call me and wanted me 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.370
 absolutely go to see a scud arrive 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.280
 he will jump over the grouping 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.940
 so he has nothing to do and that's it 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.270
 and that normally it deserves a 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:55.010
 exclusion also of ten minutes 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.010
 so we're going to listen to maximalist sir 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.050
 okay 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.490
 we will call williamson yes it's not 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.650
 do everything in order to rugby cardboard 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:24.200
 red gentlemen no I do not seem to 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:34.280
 off heard what is certain they 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:36.310
 will lead the guinea-bissau penalty but 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.720
 yet regional had precisely this 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.520
 may not be already given cardboard 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.080
 yellow in the meeting the seimat but 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.700
 the ipcc it is clear the carto which would have 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.350
 been for me a deserved moment and we 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.780
 does not necessarily include the decision of the 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.570
 side of the French stadium camp on the 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:58.250
 bench we expected to see out a 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:00.640
 small rusk managed the sepur wind 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.640
 dangerous
