it's<00:00:42.990> kind<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.320> different<00:00:43.500> way<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.740> thinking

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
it's kind of a different way of thinking

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.380 
it's kind of a different way of thinking

and how you get good at that and how you

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.840 
and how you get good at that and how you
start<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.780> train<00:00:46.080> your<00:00:46.260> brain<00:00:46.380> to<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:47.370> get<00:00:47.610> good

start to train your brain to to get good
at<00:00:48.000> doing<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.050> because<00:00:49.350> that's<00:00:49.560> it's<00:00:49.830> pretty

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
at doing that because that's it's pretty

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.580 
at doing that because that's it's pretty
common<00:00:50.310> in<00:00:50.520> most<00:00:50.610> guitar<00:00:51.000> songs<00:00:51.330> as<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.500> do
