here<00:01:35.250> took<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:36.600> wrapped<00:01:36.930> it

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
here took that and just wrapped it

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.620 
here took that and just wrapped it
around<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.740> side<00:01:38.040> as<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.000> can<00:01:39.150> see<00:01:39.360> if<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.570> get

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
around one side as you can see if I get

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.109 
around one side as you can see if I get
close<00:01:39.930> enough<00:01:40.079> up<00:01:40.380> there<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.860> yeah<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.060> it

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
close enough up there and yeah so it

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.240 
close enough up there and yeah so it
just<00:01:42.180> created<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.020> created<00:01:43.710> enough<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.130> that

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
just created this created enough so that

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.440 
just created this created enough so that
then<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.460> could<00:01:44.549> wiggle<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.090> there<00:01:45.329> with<00:01:45.390> a

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
then I could wiggle it on there with a

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.969 
then I could wiggle it on there with a
little<00:01:45.720> little<00:01:46.170> effort<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.649> got<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.890> on

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
little little effort but I got it on

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.249 
little little effort but I got it on
there<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:48.869> there<00:01:48.990> pretty<00:01:49.170> good

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
there and it's on there pretty good

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.190 
there and it's on there pretty good
works<00:01:50.009> good<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:51.000> put<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.689> raced<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.960> couple

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
works good I put it on it raced a couple

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.109 
works good I put it on it raced a couple
of<00:01:52.259> races<00:01:52.380> man<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.399> struggled<00:01:53.880> with<00:01:53.939> that

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
of races man and I struggled with that

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.670 
of races man and I struggled with that
just<00:01:54.299> wasn't<00:01:54.570> used<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.810> using<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.470> know<00:01:55.590> if

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
just wasn't used to using it you know if

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.260 
just wasn't used to using it you know if
I<00:01:55.770> start<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.159> use<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.430> again<00:01:56.759> I'll<00:01:57.030> have<00:01:57.240> to

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
I start to use this again I'll have to

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.149 
I start to use this again I'll have to
do<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.509> again<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:58.020> great<00:01:58.290> for<00:01:58.560> you

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
do it again but it's great for you

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.260 
do it again but it's great for you
essentially<00:01:59.520> don't<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.000> put<00:02:00.149> any

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
essentially don't have to put any

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.420 
essentially don't have to put any
pressure<00:02:00.509> down<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.680> know<00:02:01.799> on<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.219> thumb

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
pressure down you know on the thumb

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.030 
pressure down you know on the thumb
stick<00:02:02.700> here<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.600> can<00:02:03.780> just<00:02:03.960> use<00:02:04.170> side<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.770> side

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
stick here you can just use side to side

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.100 
stick here you can just use side to side
type<00:02:05.549> movements<00:02:06.180> here<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:06.780> do<00:02:06.869> real

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
type movements here and you can do real

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.029 
type movements here and you can do real
fine<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.799> really<00:02:08.429> gives<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.729> gives<00:02:09.390> you

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
fine and really gives you gives you

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.309 
fine and really gives you gives you
just<00:02:10.970> that<00:02:11.090> little<00:02:11.360> little<00:02:11.930> small

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
just that little little small

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.740 
just that little little small
controllability<00:02:13.310> in<00:02:13.430> there<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:13.849> so<00:02:14.329> yeah<00:02:14.480> so

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
controllability in there so so yeah so

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.630 
controllability in there so so yeah so
that's<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:15.439> I'm<00:02:15.650> gonna<00:02:15.769> take<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.129> off<00:02:16.189> and

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
that's that I'm gonna take that off and

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.699 
that's that I'm gonna take that off and
show<00:02:17.299> you<00:02:17.360> what<00:02:17.689> I've<00:02:17.810> actually<00:02:18.049> been<00:02:18.409> using<00:02:18.590> a

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
show you what I've actually been using a

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.770 
show you what I've actually been using a
little<00:02:18.890> bit<00:02:18.980> more<00:02:19.159> because<00:02:19.220> it<00:02:19.430> felt<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:20.299> little

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
little bit more because it felt a little

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.850 
little bit more because it felt a little
bit<00:02:21.019> better<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.409> me<00:02:21.439> these<00:02:21.739> are<00:02:22.659> FPS<00:02:23.860> rings

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
bit better to me these are FPS rings

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.280 
bit better to me these are FPS rings
yeah<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.400> FPS<00:02:25.760> freak<00:02:26.090> ultras<00:02:26.629> from<00:02:26.930> control

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
yeah the FPS freak ultras from control

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.860 
yeah the FPS freak ultras from control
freak<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.739> what<00:02:28.129> these<00:02:28.310> are<00:02:28.840> these<00:02:29.840> are

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
freak and what these are these are

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.569 
freak and what these are these are
typically<00:02:30.440> made<00:02:30.650> for<00:02:30.860> first-person<00:02:31.310> shooter

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
typically made for first-person shooter

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:32.979 
typically made for first-person shooter
games<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:32.030> they're<00:02:32.360> made<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.510> be<00:02:32.750> able<00:02:32.810> to

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
games and they're made to be able to

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.170 
games and they're made to be able to
control<00:02:33.319> your<00:02:33.500> aim<00:02:33.739> better<00:02:34.459> they<00:02:34.940> then

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
control your aim better they then

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.180 
control your aim better they then
basically<00:02:35.690> make<00:02:36.079> the<00:02:36.260> thumbstick<00:02:36.769> longer<00:02:37.099> and

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
basically make the thumbstick longer and

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.059 
basically make the thumbstick longer and
I'll<00:02:37.250> pull<00:02:37.489> one<00:02:37.730> out<00:02:37.970> here<00:02:38.799> we'll<00:02:39.799> get<00:02:39.890> this

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
I'll pull one out here we'll get this

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.369 
I'll pull one out here we'll get this
out<00:02:40.280> so<00:02:40.459> what<00:02:40.609> it<00:02:40.700> is<00:02:40.790> it's<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.150> little<00:02:41.379> nada

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
out so what it is it's a little nada

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.229 
out so what it is it's a little nada
basically<00:02:43.069> fits<00:02:43.340> on<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.849> top<00:02:44.030> of<00:02:44.209> your

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
basically fits on the top of your

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.660 
basically fits on the top of your
controller<00:02:44.720> now<00:02:44.930> for<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.500> racing<00:02:45.769> game<00:02:46.159> where

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
controller now for a racing game where

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.220 
controller now for a racing game where
this<00:02:46.879> can<00:02:47.060> come<00:02:47.209> in<00:02:47.239> handy<00:02:47.359> as<00:02:47.690> you<00:02:47.780> put<00:02:47.989> it<00:02:48.079> on

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
this can come in handy as you put it on

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.649 
this can come in handy as you put it on
your<00:02:48.500> you<00:02:48.889> know<00:02:49.310> on<00:02:49.340> your<00:02:49.579> left<00:02:49.909> thumbstick<00:02:50.150> on

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
your you know on your left thumbstick on

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:52.479 
your you know on your left thumbstick on
your<00:02:50.900> on<00:02:51.019> your<00:02:51.049> driving<00:02:51.530> one<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:51.980> now<00:02:52.280> if<00:02:52.400> you

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
your on your driving one and now if you

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.129 
your on your driving one and now if you
take<00:02:52.639> a<00:02:52.700> look<00:02:52.940> now<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.180> one<00:02:53.510> is<00:02:53.540> longer<00:02:53.989> now

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 
take a look now that one is longer now

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.020 
take a look now that one is longer now
if<00:02:54.409> you<00:02:54.470> can<00:02:54.620> imagine<00:02:54.829> what<00:02:55.069> that<00:02:55.190> does<00:02:55.549> it

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
if you can imagine what that does it

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.009 
if you can imagine what that does it
basically<00:02:56.299> gives<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:57.290> more<00:02:58.420> more<00:02:59.420> movement

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
basically gives you more more movement

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.690 
basically gives you more more movement
you<00:03:00.500> know<00:03:00.620> we're<00:03:00.950> gonna<00:03:01.099> get<00:03:01.250> into<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.489> screen

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
you know we're gonna get into the screen

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.410 
you know we're gonna get into the screen
here<00:03:01.879> more<00:03:02.299> movement<00:03:02.780> up<00:03:02.930> here<00:03:02.959> at<00:03:03.409> the<00:03:03.560> top<00:03:03.739> so

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
here more movement up here at the top so

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.330 
here more movement up here at the top so
it<00:03:05.420> gives<00:03:05.690> you<00:03:05.840> again<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:06.739> same<00:03:07.010> thing<00:03:07.250> that

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
it gives you again the same thing that

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.500 
it gives you again the same thing that
kind<00:03:07.549> of<00:03:07.579> the<00:03:07.670> other<00:03:07.790> ones<00:03:07.970> do<00:03:08.090> but<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.359> makes

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
kind of the other ones do but it makes

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.879

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.530
