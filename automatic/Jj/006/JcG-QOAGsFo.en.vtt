I<00:01:56.649> mean<00:01:56.799> he's<00:01:57.130> bigger<00:01:58.139> yeah<00:01:59.139> so<00:01:59.319> here<00:01:59.439> they<00:01:59.530> all

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
I mean he's bigger yeah so here they all

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.879 
I mean he's bigger yeah so here they all
are<00:01:59.679> and<00:02:00.359> we've<00:02:01.359> already<00:02:01.509> seen<00:02:01.780> them<00:02:02.049> so<00:02:02.770> we'll

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:02.889 
are and we've already seen them so we'll

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:05.129 
are and we've already seen them so we'll
go<00:02:02.979> ahead<00:02:03.009> and<00:02:03.369> focus<00:02:03.549> on<00:02:03.850> chase<00:02:04.659> and<00:02:04.869> Boulder

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:05.139 
go ahead and focus on chase and Boulder

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:06.719 
go ahead and focus on chase and Boulder
here<00:02:05.319> now<00:02:05.709> boulders<00:02:06.069> got<00:02:06.219> a<00:02:06.249> little<00:02:06.459> gimmick

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
here now boulders got a little gimmick

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.449 
here now boulders got a little gimmick
or<00:02:06.759> if<00:02:06.850> you<00:02:06.909> push<00:02:07.119> his<00:02:07.240> tail<00:02:07.950> he<00:02:08.950> kind<00:02:09.160> of<00:02:09.220> Rams

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
or if you push his tail he kind of Rams

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.150 
or if you push his tail he kind of Rams
his<00:02:09.640> horns<00:02:10.319> would<00:02:11.319> you<00:02:11.410> make<00:02:11.560> sense<00:02:11.800> for<00:02:12.040> his

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
his horns would you make sense for his

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.220 
his horns would you make sense for his
big<00:02:12.370> construction<00:02:13.000> Bob<00:02:13.180> he's<00:02:13.720> even<00:02:13.959> got<00:02:14.110> the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
big construction Bob he's even got the

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.620 
big construction Bob he's even got the
little<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:15.130> know<00:02:15.250> warning<00:02:15.720> stripes<00:02:16.720> on<00:02:16.959> him

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
little you know warning stripes on him

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.460 
little you know warning stripes on him
chase<00:02:19.630> has<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.709> push<00:02:21.700> on<00:02:21.849> his<00:02:22.140> spikes<00:02:23.140> here<00:02:23.349> and

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
chase has a push on his spikes here and

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.699 
chase has a push on his spikes here and
he<00:02:23.530> slams<00:02:23.830> his<00:02:23.950> tail<00:02:24.190> down<00:02:24.400> I<00:02:25.319> don't<00:02:26.319> know<00:02:26.470> what

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
he slams his tail down I don't know what

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.020 
he slams his tail down I don't know what
I<00:02:26.740> did<00:02:27.160> although<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:27.520> doesn't<00:02:27.670> go<00:02:27.820> all<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:27.940> way

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
I did although it doesn't go all the way

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.390 
I did although it doesn't go all the way
down<00:02:28.270> so<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:28.480> don't<00:02:28.540> know<00:02:28.750> what<00:02:28.870> effect<00:02:29.400> maybe

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
down so I don't know what effect maybe

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.840 
down so I don't know what effect maybe
maybe<00:02:31.060> maybe<00:02:31.570> hit<00:02:31.870> really<00:02:32.020> hard<00:02:32.110> in<00:02:32.350> my

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
maybe maybe hit really hard in my

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.110 
maybe maybe hit really hard in my
all<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.180> way<00:02:33.270> down<00:02:33.300> hit<00:02:33.630> something<00:02:33.960> but

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
all the way down hit something but

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.850 
all the way down hit something but
that's<00:02:36.120> his<00:02:36.300> little<00:02:36.390> action<00:02:36.810> much<00:02:37.260> like<00:02:37.500> he

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
that's his little action much like he

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.670 
that's his little action much like he
wave<00:02:38.040> just<00:02:38.460> reiterate<00:02:39.120> had<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.650> kind<00:02:40.650> of

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
wave just reiterate had the kind of

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.390 
wave just reiterate had the kind of
pecking<00:02:40.920> action<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.580> blades<00:02:42.450> had<00:02:42.870> the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
pecking action and blades had the

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.110 
pecking action and blades had the
flapping<00:02:44.400> wings<00:02:44.610> in<00:02:45.120> dinosaur<00:02:45.570> mode<00:02:47.120> and

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
flapping wings in dinosaur mode and

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.780 
flapping wings in dinosaur mode and
again<00:02:48.240> very<00:02:48.900> simple<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.320> transform<00:02:49.830> in<00:02:50.640> the

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
again very simple to transform in the

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.430 
again very simple to transform in the
case<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.330> chase<00:02:51.630> you<00:02:51.810> just<00:02:51.990> kind<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.170> grabbed

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
case of chase you just kind of grabbed

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.790 
case of chase you just kind of grabbed
these<00:02:52.770> parts<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.280> leg<00:02:53.460> pull<00:02:54.120> them<00:02:54.240> down

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
these parts of the leg pull them down

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.590 
these parts of the leg pull them down
snap<00:02:55.800> them<00:02:55.950> into<00:02:56.040> place<00:02:56.130> bring<00:02:57.120> his<00:02:57.210> arms<00:02:57.420> down

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
snap them into place bring his arms down

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.680 
snap them into place bring his arms down
he's<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.470> robot<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.430> it's<00:03:00.210> pretty<00:03:00.390> much<00:03:00.540> the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
he's a robot and it's pretty much the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.150 
he's a robot and it's pretty much the
same<00:03:00.840> with<00:03:01.020> Boulder<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.770> kind<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.010> have<00:03:02.130> to

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
same with Boulder you kind of have to

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.820 
same with Boulder you kind of have to
unsnap<00:03:02.490> his<00:03:02.910> thing<00:03:03.180> but<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:04.320> just<00:03:04.500> grab<00:03:04.680> his

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
unsnap his thing but you just grab his

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.100 
unsnap his thing but you just grab his
Dino<00:03:05.070> head<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.430> his<00:03:05.520> back<00:03:05.730> here<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.960> this

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
Dino head and his back here and this

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.420 
Dino head and his back here and this
whole<00:03:07.320> Peter<00:03:07.530> actually<00:03:07.800> just<00:03:08.040> kinda<00:03:08.220> grab<00:03:08.310> him

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430

by the back legs and the front legs and
pull<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:12.690> snapping<00:03:13.110> but<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.290> just<00:03:13.410> fold<00:03:13.650> the

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
pull and snapping but you just fold the

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.160 
pull and snapping but you just fold the
legs<00:03:13.920> down<00:03:14.130> so<00:03:14.850> his<00:03:14.970> feet<00:03:15.120> come<00:03:15.360> down<00:03:15.630> bring

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
his arms down and there you've got

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.290 
his arms down and there you've got
Boulder<00:03:18.690> as<00:03:18.990> a<00:03:19.340> rescue<00:03:20.340> Dino<00:03:20.550> bots<00:03:20.790> in<00:03:20.970> robot

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
Boulder as a rescue Dino bots in robot

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.530 
Boulder as a rescue Dino bots in robot
mode<00:03:22.370> he's<00:03:23.370> got<00:03:23.550> this<00:03:23.640> whole<00:03:23.820> Triceratops

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
mode he's got this whole Triceratops

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.200 
mode he's got this whole Triceratops
head<00:03:24.720> on<00:03:24.870> his<00:03:24.960> back<00:03:25.580> and<00:03:26.580> again<00:03:26.880> says<00:03:27.060> they're

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
head on his back and again says they're

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.140 
head on his back and again says they're
so<00:03:27.360> simple<00:03:27.660> we'll<00:03:27.780> just<00:03:27.960> show<00:03:28.470> these<00:03:28.620> guys<00:03:28.770> off

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
so simple we'll just show these guys off

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.620 
so simple we'll just show these guys off
right<00:03:30.150> down

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
right down

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.670 
right down
there's<00:03:31.350> blades<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:33.410> then<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.650> course

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
there's blades and then of course

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.650 
there's blades and then of course
heatwave<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.370> just<00:03:35.550> split<00:03:35.760> his<00:03:36.210> dinosaur

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
heatwave you just split his dinosaur

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.960 
heatwave you just split his dinosaur
head<00:03:37.100> yeah<00:03:38.100> when<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.310> fold<00:03:38.460> that<00:03:38.610> down<00:03:38.670> his

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
head yeah when you fold that down his

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.370 
head yeah when you fold that down his
legs<00:03:39.150> come<00:03:39.360> down<00:03:39.830> fold<00:03:40.830> his<00:03:40.980> tail<00:03:41.190> down<00:03:41.400> and

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
legs come down fold his tail down and

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.870 
legs come down fold his tail down and
then<00:03:43.380> you<00:03:43.470> have<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.800> four<00:03:44.010> main<00:03:44.280> RESCUE<00:03:44.700> BOTS

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
then you have the four main RESCUE BOTS

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.410 
then you have the four main RESCUE BOTS
as<00:03:45.470> Dinobots<00:03:46.550> they're<00:03:47.550> fun<00:03:47.760> little<00:03:47.910> kids<00:03:48.180> toys

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.820 
they're nothing spectacular but with all
the<00:03:51.510> Dinobot<00:03:51.870> craze<00:03:52.170> they're<00:03:52.410> fun<00:03:52.620> little

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
the Dinobot craze they're fun little

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:53.990 
the Dinobot craze they're fun little
down<00:03:52.980> they<00:03:53.160> are<00:03:53.250> they<00:03:53.400> are<00:03:53.550> fun<00:03:53.850> little
