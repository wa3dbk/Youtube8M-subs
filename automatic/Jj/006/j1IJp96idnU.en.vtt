 league of legends so special its 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.530

 totally free or it 's late when 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.800
 the yeses started was an opportunity to 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.869
 me to become a salaried player 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.260
 and it gave me the option to choose a style 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.350
 of different life in california 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.660
 Currently a professional gamer player 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.970
 Video Game Professional Wins Dozens 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.580
 of thousands of dollars a year but here 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.310
 is the question how the league is played 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.280
 of legends it is a meeting 5 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.990
 against 5 or 6 as a basis what could 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.540
 be done in the game has to work 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.670
 the equipment to destroy the structures 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.190
 of the enemy team and destroy the throne 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.860
 as well as the nexus that are called game 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.230
 and is the ultimate goal but the 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.370
 game you have to make several plays 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.410
 and there's a lot of strategy the popularity 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.540
 international the league of legends is 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.970
 so big that the corporation itself 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.460
 rights the creators of this game 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.250
 requested the state department- 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:36.290
 Special visas in order to bring 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.290
 players from other countries to compete 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.910
 what we did with quads he is a 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.790
 phenomenal player was to help him to 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.770
 apply for a p-1 visa that is the same 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.530
 visa that athletes get when they 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.970
 they attend for example to the Olympics and 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.730
 although for some this discipline 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.200
 sporty look 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.510
 surreal these youngsters are 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.660
 aware that they are a role model 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.230
 as well as sports heroes for a whole 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.910
 generation that admires the snout 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.250
 you are affecting their lives 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.840
 positively in some way you have to 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.590
 help them to be in their lives 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.260
 successful 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.630
 juas is a young Venezuelan who 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.330
 principle, his mother limited him to the use of 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.160
 the computer and I doubted that this was 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.130
 favorable for him and then to oppose 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.860
 openly to his decision to devote himself 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.290
 to play video games as a profession today 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.739
 which enjoys the full support of his mother 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:35.100
 who has become his fan number 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.480
 one called a fanatic gets to see 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.160
 the games so you do not understand much 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.170
 about the game he gets to see it and I 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.630
 you tell me I should not have done 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.120
 this and if you can not you can not do this do not you 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.310
 stop killing by this guy in the game 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.730
 then something before you get to have 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.950
 the presence quite 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.470
 as the right mother many have already 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.150
 understood that this is a reality and 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.980
 that these games are more than a simple 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.810
 distraction so the next time 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.819
 you see one of your children in the 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.489
 computer playing does not rush in 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.799
 avoid it because maybe he or she could 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.629
 be the next superstar in the world 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.930
