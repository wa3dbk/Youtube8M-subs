00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.850
 hi it's voc is today we're going 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.240
 talk about cube centers make up the 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.960
 hunters 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.960
 What is it 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.160
 q you enders is a minecraft event 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.689
 and it's primarily based on an old 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.610
 of my projects called 4g tunes 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.200
 after some worries and decisions 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.059
 who did not like me I decided to 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.710
 resume the project to rename with a 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.360
 concept a little more worked and a 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.010
 new team which will allow us 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.360
 to have greater freedom in 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.710
 level of team choice and 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.970
 dates 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.890
 let's get on with the talking subject 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.090
 of the concept of cube centers in this 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.340
 first season that will take place on 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.900
 Saturday, May 30, 168 players will be at 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.199
 meet you in the form of 28 teams of 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.019
 6 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.760
 the goal of the game is super simple help from 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.290
 catalog and pickup you will have to 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.710
 have a maximum of points in a minimum 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.600
 of time 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.309
 every thing existing on minecraft 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.449
 see a number of points there 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.460
 varies depending on the difficulty 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.570
 getting the thing over she is 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.030
 simple and easy to find 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.350
 - it is worth two points against more 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.530
 and the rare and hard to find 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.119
 the more your weight but be careful the 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.619
 weight gain per object is unique 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.220
 there is no point in bringing back booms 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.420
 only one copy of each suffi 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.710
 to gain a few more points that 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.470
 will definitely make the difference 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.180
 there are the goals they will not know 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.490
 extremely complicated what was not 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.840
 since it is optional 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.880

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.729
