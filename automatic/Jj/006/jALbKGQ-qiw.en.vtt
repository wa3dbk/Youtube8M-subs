almost<00:02:05.310> sloughing<00:02:05.819> off<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.179> first<00:02:06.420> little

00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:06.599 
almost sloughing off that first little

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:10.789 
almost sloughing off that first little
layer<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:07.190> foam<00:02:09.079> drawing<00:02:10.079> it<00:02:10.200> back<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.709> then

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
layer of foam drawing it back and then

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.289 
layer of foam drawing it back and then
carefully<00:02:11.250> drawing<00:02:11.549> a<00:02:11.670> very<00:02:11.790> thin<00:02:12.090> line

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
carefully drawing a very thin line

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:17.150 
carefully drawing a very thin line
through<00:02:14.390> that's<00:02:15.390> how<00:02:15.569> you<00:02:15.629> do<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.840> Rosetta<00:02:16.290> the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
through that's how you do a Rosetta the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.890 
through that's how you do a Rosetta the
wiggle<00:02:17.489> motion<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:17.940> very<00:02:18.180> slight<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.720> don't

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
wiggle motion is very slight you don't

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.780 
wiggle motion is very slight you don't
actually<00:02:19.049> move<00:02:19.379> your<00:02:19.440> arm<00:02:19.829> you<00:02:20.430> move<00:02:20.640> your

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
actually move your arm you move your

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.059 
actually move your arm you move your
wrist<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.230> just<00:02:22.410> carefully<00:02:22.799> would<00:02:22.920> draw

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
wrist and you just carefully would draw

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.500 
wrist and you just carefully would draw
it<00:02:23.160> back<00:02:23.310> as<00:02:23.579> you<00:02:23.700> go<00:02:23.730> through<00:02:25.730> all<00:02:26.730> right<00:02:27.030> and

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
it back as you go through all right and

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.819 
it back as you go through all right and
now<00:02:27.690> we're<00:02:27.989> going<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.379> pour<00:02:28.799> a<00:02:29.010> heart<00:02:30.829> pretty

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
now we're going to pour a heart pretty

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.740 
now we're going to pour a heart pretty
much<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.099> same<00:02:32.280> concept<00:02:32.910> as<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.180> Rosetta

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
much the same concept as a Rosetta

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.270 
much the same concept as a Rosetta
except<00:02:34.319> you're<00:02:34.410> going<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.590> hold<00:02:34.799> the<00:02:35.010> wiggle

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
except you're going to hold the wiggle

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.539 
except you're going to hold the wiggle
in<00:02:35.400> place<00:02:36.109> so<00:02:37.109> I<00:02:37.440> am<00:02:37.709> making<00:02:38.099> sure<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.400> any

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
in place so I am making sure that any

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.250 
in place so I am making sure that any
white<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:38.940> comes<00:02:39.120> up<00:02:39.269> I'm<00:02:39.450> pouring<00:02:39.959> over

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
white that comes up I'm pouring over

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.160 
white that comes up I'm pouring over
with<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.440> thin<00:02:40.920> stream<00:02:41.690> filling<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.780> cup<00:02:42.930> about

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
with a thin stream filling the cup about

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.210 
with a thin stream filling the cup about
halfway<00:02:43.410> for<00:02:43.590> full<00:02:44.280> pushing<00:02:45.180> forward<00:02:46.220> just

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
halfway for full pushing forward just

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.069 
halfway for full pushing forward just
allowing<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.760> settle<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:48.450> then<00:02:48.599> drawing

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
allowing it to settle and then drawing

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.120 
allowing it to settle and then drawing
through<00:02:49.470> at<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.680> very<00:02:49.709> end<00:02:51.829> and<00:02:52.829> that's<00:02:53.010> how

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
through at the very end and that's how

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.800 
through at the very end and that's how
to<00:02:53.190> do<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.400> heart<00:02:56.150> alright<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.389> now<00:02:57.540> we<00:02:57.599> are

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
to do a heart alright and now we are

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.339 
to do a heart alright and now we are
going<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.230> pour<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.829> wave<00:02:59.790> heart<00:03:00.329> and<00:03:00.660> how<00:03:01.019> we<00:03:01.079> do

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
going to pour a wave heart and how we do

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.129 
going to pour a wave heart and how we do
this<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:01.829> just<00:03:02.220> fill<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.489> up<00:03:02.549> again<00:03:02.730> as<00:03:03.139> we

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
this is just fill it up again as we

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:05.690 
this is just fill it up again as we
normally<00:03:04.260> do<00:03:04.590> half<00:03:04.889> way<00:03:05.099> full<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.400> then<00:03:05.609> I'm

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
normally do half way full and then I'm

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.879 
normally do half way full and then I'm
actually<00:03:05.880> going<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.299> start<00:03:06.810> spinning<00:03:07.650> the

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
actually going to start spinning the

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.309 
actually going to start spinning the
espresso<00:03:08.400> around<00:03:08.760> gently<00:03:09.450> doing<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.840> wave<00:03:10.019> back

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
espresso around gently doing a wave back

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.949 
espresso around gently doing a wave back
and<00:03:10.500> forth<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:11.329> then<00:03:12.329> finish<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.690> with<00:03:12.840> a

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
and forth and then finish it with a

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.270 
and forth and then finish it with a
heart<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:13.319> here<00:03:13.650> I'm<00:03:13.739> going<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:16.130> force<00:03:17.130> it

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
heart so here I'm going to force it

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.580 
heart so here I'm going to force it
around<00:03:17.609> bring<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.870> center<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.470> then

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
around bring it to the center and then

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.420 
around bring it to the center and then
doing<00:03:19.799> a<00:03:20.130> little<00:03:20.519> heart<00:03:21.889> and<00:03:22.889> that<00:03:23.069> is<00:03:23.220> how<00:03:23.370> you

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
doing a little heart and that is how you

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.750 
doing a little heart and that is how you
do<00:03:23.669> a<00:03:23.700> wave<00:03:24.030> heart

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.850 

all<00:03:28.760> right<00:03:29.210> and<00:03:29.450> now<00:03:29.660> we<00:03:29.690> are<00:03:30.290> going<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.620> pour<00:03:30.830> a

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
all right and now we are going to pour a

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.490 
all right and now we are going to pour a
to<00:03:31.010> us<00:03:31.660> basic<00:03:32.660> idea<00:03:32.960> is<00:03:33.170> that<00:03:33.200> you<00:03:33.380> are

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
to us basic idea is that you are

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.840 
to us basic idea is that you are
layering<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.550> blooms<00:03:35.770> that<00:03:36.770> you<00:03:37.040> create<00:03:37.520> by

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
layering the blooms that you create by

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.450 
layering the blooms that you create by
pushing<00:03:38.300> forward<00:03:38.720> so<00:03:39.590> again<00:03:39.920> just<00:03:39.950> kind<00:03:40.250> of

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
pushing forward so again just kind of

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.010 
pushing forward so again just kind of
starting<00:03:40.730> out<00:03:40.820> that<00:03:40.850> same<00:03:41.240> way<00:03:41.450> filling<00:03:41.930> up

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
starting out that same way filling up

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.100 
starting out that same way filling up
the<00:03:42.140> cup<00:03:42.320> half<00:03:42.530> way<00:03:42.710> full<00:03:43.420> then<00:03:44.420> stream<00:03:44.870> not

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
the cup half way full then stream not

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.630 
the cup half way full then stream not
breaking<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.650> crust<00:03:46.720> pushing<00:03:47.720> forward

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
breaking the crust pushing forward

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.740 
breaking the crust pushing forward
there's<00:03:49.640> the<00:03:49.820> first<00:03:50.000> layer<00:03:50.980> second<00:03:51.980> layer<00:03:52.750> and

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
there's the first layer second layer and

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.520 
there's the first layer second layer and
third<00:03:54.560> layer<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.870> that's<00:03:56.960> how<00:03:57.170> you<00:03:57.230> pour<00:03:57.500> a

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
third layer and that's how you pour a

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:28.700 
third layer and that's how you pour a
tulip

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.499 

didn't<00:04:29.340> work<00:04:29.430> out<00:04:29.610> quite<00:04:29.880> as<00:04:30.000> well<00:04:30.180> as<00:04:30.419> it

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509 
didn't work out quite as well as it

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:32.689 
didn't work out quite as well as it
normally<00:04:30.800> it's<00:04:31.800> been<00:04:31.949> a<00:04:31.979> while<00:04:32.190> it<00:04:32.400> says<00:04:32.580> it

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
normally it's been a while it says it

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:43.590 
normally it's been a while it says it
there<00:04:32.729> though<00:04:33.410> get<00:04:34.410> the<00:04:34.500> impression

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.660
