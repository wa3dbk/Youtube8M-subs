00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
jailbreak and you don't want it you can

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.670 
jailbreak and you don't want it you can
always<00:03:50.790> restore<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:52.049> it<00:03:52.200> will<00:03:52.290> go<00:03:52.440> back<00:03:52.650> to

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
always restore it and it will go back to

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.520 
always restore it and it will go back to
its<00:03:52.890> original<00:03:53.160> form<00:03:53.850> so<00:03:54.390> that's<00:03:54.690> really<00:03:55.140> cool

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
its original form so that's really cool

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.530 
its original form so that's really cool
so<00:03:55.860> if<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.130> really<00:03:56.459> do<00:03:56.640> mess<00:03:56.880> up<00:03:56.910> just<00:03:57.120> go

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
so if you really do mess up just go

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.900 
so if you really do mess up just go
ahead<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:57.750> restore<00:03:58.350> and<00:03:58.530> try<00:03:58.769> again<00:03:59.100> it's<00:03:59.640> not
