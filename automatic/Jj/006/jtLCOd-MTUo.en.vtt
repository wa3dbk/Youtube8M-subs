today<00:00:01.500> I<00:00:01.560> thought<00:00:01.920> I<00:00:01.979> would<00:00:02.129> try<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.840> explain

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:03.980 
today I thought I would try to explain

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.670 
today I thought I would try to explain
exposure<00:00:04.980> compensation<00:00:06.230> because<00:00:07.230> our

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
exposure compensation because our

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.259 
exposure compensation because our
digital<00:00:08.099> camera<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.670> whether<00:00:08.910> you<00:00:09.090> have<00:00:09.240> a

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
digital camera is whether you have a

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.890 
digital camera is whether you have a
DSLR<00:00:10.019> or<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.460> point<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.550> shoot<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:12.480> doesn't

DSLR or a point and shoot it doesn't

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.259 
DSLR or a point and shoot it doesn't
matter<00:00:13.080> they<00:00:13.559> all<00:00:13.769> have<00:00:14.070> light<00:00:14.639> meters<00:00:15.059> in

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
matter they all have light meters in

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.150 
matter they all have light meters in
them<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:16.400> almost<00:00:17.400> all<00:00:17.760> cameras<00:00:18.529> read<00:00:19.529> scenes

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
them and almost all cameras read scenes

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.080 
them and almost all cameras read scenes
wrong<00:00:20.730> if<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.930> have<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> lot<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.470> dark<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.490> a

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
wrong if you have a lot of dark in a

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.050 
wrong if you have a lot of dark in a
scene<00:00:24.410> your<00:00:25.410> camera<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:25.980> going<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.550> read<00:00:26.849> that

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
scene your camera is going to read that

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.109 
scene your camera is going to read that
wrong<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.720> if<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:28.769> have<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> lot<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.369> light<00:00:29.820> in

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
wrong and if you have a lot of light in

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.510 
wrong and if you have a lot of light in
the<00:00:30.449> scene<00:00:30.769> it's<00:00:31.769> going<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.009> do<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.309> same

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
the scene it's going to do the same

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.610 
the scene it's going to do the same
thing<00:00:32.880> it's<00:00:33.120> going<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.300> read<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.719> wrong<00:00:33.930> you're

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
thing it's going to read it wrong you're

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.380 
thing it's going to read it wrong you're
going<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.309> that's<00:00:35.730> why<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.180> there

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
going to have to that's why it's there

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.700 
going to have to that's why it's there
that's<00:00:36.690> why<00:00:36.840> they<00:00:36.960> have<00:00:36.989> exposure

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
that's why they have exposure

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.440 
that's why they have exposure
compensation<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.860> as<00:00:40.860> photographers<00:00:41.730> can

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
compensation so we as photographers can

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.990 
compensation so we as photographers can
see<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.930> scene<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.440> adjust<00:00:44.340> our<00:00:44.489> cameras

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
see the scene and adjust our cameras

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.069 
see the scene and adjust our cameras
because<00:00:45.660> even<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> best<00:00:46.710> metering<00:00:47.370> systems

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
because even the best metering systems

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.569 
because even the best metering systems
can't<00:00:49.079> get<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.289> right<00:00:49.590> every<00:00:49.770> time<00:00:49.920> they<00:00:50.399> do<00:00:50.460> a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
can't get it right every time they do a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.160 
can't get it right every time they do a
good<00:00:50.820> job<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.360> they<00:00:51.510> can't<00:00:51.750> get<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:51.989> right

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
good job but they can't get it right

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.979 
good job but they can't get it right
every<00:00:52.320> time<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:53.219> let's<00:00:53.430> take<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> look<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.270> set<00:00:54.960> up

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
every time so let's take a look I set up

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.170 
every time so let's take a look I set up
a<00:00:55.199> little<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.590> couple<00:00:56.010> little<00:00:56.129> scenes<00:00:56.579> here<00:00:56.969> and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
a little a couple little scenes here and

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.590 
a little a couple little scenes here and
i'll<00:00:57.690> try<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.989> show<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.320> how<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.829> works<00:00:59.600> so

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
i'll try to show you how it works so

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.910 
i'll try to show you how it works so
let's<00:01:00.899> say<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.140> are<00:01:01.469> going<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.680> take<00:01:01.890> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
let's say you are going to take a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.170 
let's say you are going to take a
picture<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:03.080> dark<00:01:04.080> object<00:01:04.549> like<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.580> group

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
picture of a dark object like this group

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.800 
picture of a dark object like this group
of<00:01:06.420> objects<00:01:07.220> all<00:01:08.220> these<00:01:08.820> objects<00:01:09.299> here<00:01:09.540> are

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
of objects all these objects here are

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.480 
of objects all these objects here are
black<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:11.130> color<00:01:11.750> so<00:01:12.920> what<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.070> need<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.280> do

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
black in color so what do we need to do

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.340 
black in color so what do we need to do
to<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.210> look<00:01:15.390> right<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.170> going

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
to get this to look right this is going

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.580 
to get this to look right this is going
to<00:01:16.409> throw<00:01:16.619> our<00:01:16.860> camera<00:01:17.430> meter<00:01:17.670> off<00:01:18.320> well<00:01:19.320> i'll

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
to throw our camera meter off well i'll

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.219 
to throw our camera meter off well i'll
show<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.860> yet<00:01:20.159> under<00:01:20.610> expose<00:01:21.210> if<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:21.810> dark

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
show you yet under expose if it's dark

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.030 
show you yet under expose if it's dark
and<00:01:22.970> overexposed<00:01:23.970> if<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.600> light<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.890> let's

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
and overexposed if it's light so let's

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.130 
and overexposed if it's light so let's
take<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> look<00:01:26.610> at<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.970> digital<00:01:27.390> SLR<00:01:27.900> hair

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
take a look at the digital SLR hair

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.100 
take a look at the digital SLR hair
here's<00:01:28.560> our<00:01:28.770> group<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.280> dark<00:01:30.210> objects<00:01:30.900> that

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
here's our group of dark objects that

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.630 
here's our group of dark objects that
we're<00:01:31.290> going<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.500> photograph<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.520> look

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
we're going to photograph so if you look

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.399 
we're going to photograph so if you look
at<00:01:32.759> their<00:01:32.970> light<00:01:33.180> meter<00:01:33.479> down<00:01:33.780> towards<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
at their light meter down towards the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.190 
at their light meter down towards the
bottom<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.979> frame<00:01:35.250> right<00:01:35.520> here<00:01:35.869> that<00:01:36.869> is

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
bottom of the frame right here that is

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.590 
bottom of the frame right here that is
the<00:01:37.470> what<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.340> camera<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:38.939> saying<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the what the camera is saying is the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.010 
the what the camera is saying is the
correct<00:01:39.960> exposure<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:41.250> these<00:01:41.460> cameras<00:01:42.020> can't

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
correct exposure but these cameras can't

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.039 
correct exposure but these cameras can't
think<00:01:43.439> as<00:01:43.680> much<00:01:44.040> as<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> human<00:01:44.700> being<00:01:44.820> can<00:01:45.049> so

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
think as much as a human being can so

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.450 
think as much as a human being can so
let's<00:01:46.200> take<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.439> look<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.770> see<00:01:46.829> what<00:01:46.920> happens

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
let's take a look and see what happens

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.030 
let's take a look and see what happens
here<00:01:47.700> at<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.049> correct<00:01:49.049> exposure<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
here at the correct exposure that the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.340 
here at the correct exposure that the
camera<00:01:50.490> thinks<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.659> what<00:01:51.840> most<00:01:52.020> people

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
camera thinks this is what most people

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.450 
camera thinks this is what most people
are<00:01:52.439> going<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.649> get

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.990 

take<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.060> shot<00:01:58.360> and<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:59.770> I<00:01:59.920> just<00:02:00.190> change<00:02:00.610> that

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
take a shot and if I just change that

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.440 
take a shot and if I just change that
that<00:02:01.960> is<00:02:03.630> great<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:05.380> objects<00:02:05.800> look<00:02:06.010> great<00:02:06.450> if

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
that is great the objects look great if

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.380 
that is great the objects look great if
i<00:02:07.540> look<00:02:07.720> at<00:02:07.900> it<00:02:07.930> with<00:02:08.110> my<00:02:08.289> eyes<00:02:09.000> it's<00:02:10.000> that's

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
i look at it with my eyes it's that's

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.430 
i look at it with my eyes it's that's
nothing<00:02:10.750> with<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.050> objects<00:02:11.530> look<00:02:11.740> like<00:02:12.120> so

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
nothing with the objects look like so

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.120 
nothing with the objects look like so
what<00:02:14.440> we<00:02:14.530> need<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.770> do<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:15.540> under<00:02:16.540> expose<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:18.010> if

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
what we need to do is under expose so if

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.530 
what we need to do is under expose so if
you<00:02:18.250> look<00:02:18.340> at<00:02:18.489> your<00:02:18.640> light<00:02:18.850> meter<00:02:19.090> there<00:02:19.330> I'm

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
you look at your light meter there I'm

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.680 
you look at your light meter there I'm
moving<00:02:20.020> my<00:02:20.050> exposure<00:02:20.590> wheel<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:22.120> underexposed

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
moving my exposure wheel is underexposed

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.010 
moving my exposure wheel is underexposed
by<00:02:23.170> one<00:02:23.890> stop<00:02:24.400> let's<00:02:24.640> try<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:24.970> two-thirds<00:02:25.840> of

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
by one stop let's try a two-thirds of

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.710 
by one stop let's try a two-thirds of
the<00:02:26.140> stop<00:02:27.420> take<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.450> shower

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.110 

now<00:02:32.650> that's<00:02:32.860> getting<00:02:33.040> closer<00:02:33.490> to<00:02:33.820> what<00:02:33.970> my

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
now that's getting closer to what my

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:43.860 
now that's getting closer to what my
eyes<00:02:34.360> see<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:36.610> I'm<00:02:36.970> going<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.180> go<00:02:39.090> try<00:02:42.510> one<00:02:43.510> and

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
eyes see so I'm going to go try one and

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:51.110 
eyes see so I'm going to go try one and
a<00:02:43.960> third<00:02:43.990> stop

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.000 

now<00:02:52.120> that's<00:02:52.390> almost<00:02:52.750> exactly<00:02:52.989> what<00:02:53.500> my<00:02:53.800> eye<00:02:53.830> is

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
now that's almost exactly what my eye is

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.140 
now that's almost exactly what my eye is
seeing<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.920> can<00:02:57.069> see<00:02:57.250> there<00:02:57.459> that<00:02:57.489> there's

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
seeing so you can see there that there's

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.040 
seeing so you can see there that there's
quite<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:58.930> big<00:02:59.170> difference<00:02:59.590> and<00:02:59.830> I'll<00:03:00.670> show<00:03:00.970> you

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
quite a big difference and I'll show you

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.040 
quite a big difference and I'll show you
because<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.560> video<00:03:03.129> camera<00:03:03.610> is<00:03:03.700> actually

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
because the video camera is actually

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:14.140 
because the video camera is actually
trying<00:03:05.050> to<00:03:05.200> compensate<00:03:05.590> for<00:03:06.099> it

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:21.990 

you

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.390 

now<00:03:23.000> let's<00:03:23.390> say<00:03:23.630> you<00:03:23.690> were<00:03:24.140> trying<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.860> shoot<00:03:25.130> a

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
now let's say you were trying to shoot a

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.810 
now let's say you were trying to shoot a
picture<00:03:26.030> of<00:03:26.330> a<00:03:26.450> white<00:03:26.840> object<00:03:27.490> now<00:03:28.490> this<00:03:28.670> is

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
picture of a white object now this is

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.190 
picture of a white object now this is
the<00:03:30.040> nearest<00:03:31.040> white<00:03:31.610> object<00:03:32.300> I<00:03:32.450> can<00:03:32.480> find<00:03:32.870> it's

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
the nearest white object I can find it's

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.510 
the nearest white object I can find it's
an<00:03:33.320> umbrella<00:03:33.740> but<00:03:34.670> anything<00:03:35.330> white<00:03:35.600> snow<00:03:36.520> any

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
an umbrella but anything white snow any

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.810 
an umbrella but anything white snow any
white<00:03:37.940> scene<00:03:38.480> now<00:03:39.470> let's<00:03:40.130> take<00:03:40.370> a<00:03:40.430> look<00:03:40.520> at

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
white scene now let's take a look at

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.420 
white scene now let's take a look at
exactly<00:03:41.330> the<00:03:41.870> same<00:03:41.900> thing<00:03:42.440> as<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:43.010> dark

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
exactly the same thing as the dark

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.960 
exactly the same thing as the dark
object<00:03:44.120> but<00:03:44.870> in<00:03:45.140> Reverse<00:03:45.620> now<00:03:46.580> let's<00:03:46.790> take<00:03:46.910> a

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
object but in Reverse now let's take a

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.840 
object but in Reverse now let's take a
look<00:03:47.060> at<00:03:47.270> that<00:03:47.330> on<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:48.230> digital<00:03:48.860> SLR<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:49.580> here

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
look at that on the digital SLR and here

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.720 
look at that on the digital SLR and here
we<00:03:49.970> are<00:03:50.120> with<00:03:50.330> our<00:03:50.390> light<00:03:51.230> object<00:03:51.950> could<00:03:52.550> be<00:03:52.610> a

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
we are with our light object could be a

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.690 
we are with our light object could be a
wedding<00:03:53.150> dress<00:03:53.420> could<00:03:53.780> be<00:03:53.840> snow<00:03:54.700> anything

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
wedding dress could be snow anything

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.910 
wedding dress could be snow anything
light<00:03:56.420> in<00:03:56.720> the<00:03:56.990> light<00:03:57.260> end<00:03:57.500> of<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.710> spectrum

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
light in the light end of the spectrum

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.370 
light in the light end of the spectrum
so<00:03:58.760> you<00:03:58.850> can<00:03:59.060> see<00:03:59.270> our<00:03:59.390> arm<00:03:59.660> light<00:03:59.930> meter<00:04:00.140> down

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
so you can see our arm light meter down

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.340 
so you can see our arm light meter down
here<00:04:00.709> on<00:04:00.830> the<00:04:00.890> bottom<00:04:01.340> is<00:04:01.930> saying<00:04:02.930> that's<00:04:03.200> the

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
here on the bottom is saying that's the

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.330 
here on the bottom is saying that's the
correct<00:04:03.800> exposure<00:04:04.280> so<00:04:05.240> I've<00:04:05.690> pre<00:04:06.080> focused<00:04:06.590> and

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
correct exposure so I've pre focused and

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.430 
correct exposure so I've pre focused and
I'll<00:04:07.550> take<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.790> shot

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.460 

now<00:04:12.440> that<00:04:12.800> actually<00:04:13.280> looks<00:04:13.520> gray<00:04:14.510> looks<00:04:15.290> like

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
now that actually looks gray looks like

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.360 
now that actually looks gray looks like
gray<00:04:15.860> so<00:04:16.850> what<00:04:17.360> we<00:04:17.480> need<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.630> do<00:04:17.870> is<00:04:18.140> take<00:04:19.130> our

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
gray so what we need to do is take our

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.970 
gray so what we need to do is take our
exposure<00:04:19.760> up<00:04:20.090> as<00:04:20.360> you<00:04:20.720> can<00:04:20.870> see<00:04:21.049> there<00:04:21.260> the

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
exposure up as you can see there the

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.760 
exposure up as you can see there the
meter<00:04:22.250> is<00:04:22.340> moving<00:04:22.910> i<00:04:23.090> am<00:04:23.210> now<00:04:23.450> we'll<00:04:24.350> try<00:04:24.650> it

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
meter is moving i am now we'll try it

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.370 
meter is moving i am now we'll try it
the<00:04:24.890> same<00:04:25.160> way<00:04:25.400> we'll<00:04:26.090> try<00:04:26.330> it<00:04:26.360> two-thirds<00:04:27.170> of

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
the same way we'll try it two-thirds of

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.130 
the same way we'll try it two-thirds of
a<00:04:27.500> stop<00:04:27.800> over<00:04:28.360> exposed<00:04:29.360> like<00:04:29.720> we<00:04:29.930> did

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
a stop over exposed like we did

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.830 
a stop over exposed like we did
underexposed<00:04:31.070> for<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.460> dark<00:04:31.670> subject<00:04:32.000> so

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
underexposed for the dark subject so

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.300 
underexposed for the dark subject so
there<00:04:32.990> we<00:04:33.140> are<00:04:33.170> two-thirds<00:04:33.770> of<00:04:33.830> a<00:04:34.040> stop

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
there we are two-thirds of a stop

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.920 
there we are two-thirds of a stop
overexposed<00:04:35.590> take<00:04:36.590> a<00:04:36.620> shot

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.770 

and<00:04:40.490> that's<00:04:41.490> starting<00:04:41.910> to<00:04:41.940> look<00:04:42.030> a<00:04:42.449> little

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
and that's starting to look a little

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.860 
and that's starting to look a little
more<00:04:42.960> like<00:04:43.380> what<00:04:43.650> my<00:04:43.830> eye<00:04:43.860> sees<00:04:45.590> now<00:04:46.590> we'll<00:04:46.979> try

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
more like what my eye sees now we'll try

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:55.629 
more like what my eye sees now we'll try
say<00:04:48.979> one<00:04:49.979> and<00:04:50.340> a<00:04:51.240> third<00:04:51.560> stop<00:04:53.570> overexposed

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
say one and a third stop overexposed

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.070 
say one and a third stop overexposed
take<00:04:56.639> a<00:04:56.669> shot

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.809 

and<00:05:00.699> that<00:05:01.699> is<00:05:02.030> pretty<00:05:02.240> close<00:05:02.569> to<00:05:03.580> exactly<00:05:04.580> what

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
and that is pretty close to exactly what

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:09.999 
and that is pretty close to exactly what
my<00:05:05.000> eye<00:05:05.030> sees<00:05:07.000> real<00:05:08.000> time<00:05:08.330> so<00:05:09.139> that<00:05:09.710> can<00:05:09.889> be

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
my eye sees real time so that can be

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.700 
my eye sees real time so that can be
used<00:05:10.280> either<00:05:10.669> way<00:05:10.939> for<00:05:11.419> dark<00:05:11.990> or<00:05:12.229> light

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
used either way for dark or light

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:21.839
