always<00:00:53.999> going<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.269> be<00:00:54.359> a<00:00:54.449> next<00:00:54.749> one<00:00:54.870> -<00:00:55.260> there's

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
always going to be a next one - there's

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.969 
always going to be a next one - there's
so<00:00:56.100> much<00:00:56.249> pressure<00:00:56.839> just<00:00:57.839> catching<00:00:58.679> the<00:00:58.799> wave

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979 
so much pressure just catching the wave

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:01.489 
so much pressure just catching the wave
first<00:00:59.639> off<00:00:59.909> and<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.359> making<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.959> right<00:01:01.409> if

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
first off and then making it right if

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:04.369 
first off and then making it right if
you<00:01:01.620> don't<00:01:01.739> make<00:01:01.979> the<00:01:02.129> wave<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:03.209> next<00:01:03.539> four

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
you don't make the wave the next four

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.260 
you don't make the wave the next four
sometimes<00:01:04.769> are<00:01:05.190> right<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.580> your<00:01:05.729> head<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.210> you

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
sometimes are right on your head and you

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.260 
sometimes are right on your head and you
can<00:01:06.810> basically<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.469> stand<00:01:07.920> up<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.399> the<00:01:09.030> reef

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
can basically just stand up on the reef

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.109 
can basically just stand up on the reef
as<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:10.320> they<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:11.009> crash<00:01:11.340> right<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.820> your<00:01:11.939> head

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
as as they just crash right on your head

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.580 
as as they just crash right on your head
there's<00:01:12.420> nowhere<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.840> go<00:01:14.930> every<00:01:15.930> single<00:01:16.259> wave

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
there's nowhere to go every single wave

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.120 
there's nowhere to go every single wave
that<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.070> go<00:01:17.310> for<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:18.329> have<00:01:18.539> to<00:01:18.689> be<00:01:19.130> mentally

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
that you go for you have to be mentally

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.510 
that you go for you have to be mentally
ready<00:01:20.479> if<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.750> let<00:01:21.990> all<00:01:22.170> those<00:01:22.350> factors<00:01:22.829> get

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
ready if you let all those factors get

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.090 
ready if you let all those factors get
in<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.759> way<00:01:23.939> then<00:01:24.240> you're<00:01:24.659> either<00:01:24.780> gonna

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
hesitate and go over the falls or you're

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:30.980 
hesitate and go over the falls or you're
gonna<00:01:28.590> you're<00:01:29.130> gonna<00:01:29.189> pull<00:01:29.549> back<00:01:29.850> at<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.719> last

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
and trying to just make it through that

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.230 
and trying to just make it through that
tunnel<00:03:25.270> and<00:03:25.720> when<00:03:26.140> when<00:03:27.040> you<00:03:27.160> do<00:03:27.400> make<00:03:27.640> it<00:03:27.910> you

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
tunnel and when when you do make it you

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.060 
tunnel and when when you do make it you
