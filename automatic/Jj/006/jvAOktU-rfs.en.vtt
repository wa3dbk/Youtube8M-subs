00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.870 
up the black version of the belt as well
just<00:02:20.350> because<00:02:20.470> black<00:02:20.890> goes<00:02:21.130> with<00:02:21.160> basically

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
just because black goes with basically

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.240 
just because black goes with basically
everything<00:02:22.360> whereas<00:02:22.660> with<00:02:22.959> brown<00:02:23.260> you're<00:02:24.220> a

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250

the second ring like that and then you
pull<00:02:46.989> it<00:02:47.080> tight<00:02:53.670> so<00:02:55.050> that's<00:02:56.050> what<00:02:56.320> it<00:02:56.410> would

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
pull it tight so that's what it would

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.520 
pull it tight so that's what it would
look<00:02:56.680> like<00:02:56.739> when<00:02:57.190> it's<00:02:57.340> being<00:02:57.550> worn<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:59.230> as

you can see it picks up fingerprints
really<00:03:01.900> easily<00:03:02.410> just<00:03:02.530> because<00:03:03.010> it's<00:03:03.160> so<00:03:03.340> shiny
