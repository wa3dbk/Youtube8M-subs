laminate flooring is a multi-layered
synthetic<00:00:35.820> flooring<00:00:36.710> now<00:00:37.710> pretty<00:00:38.010> much<00:00:38.129> what

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
synthetic flooring now pretty much what

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.240 
synthetic flooring now pretty much what
that<00:00:38.760> means<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.540> made<00:00:40.200> up<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:42.530> a<00:00:43.530> resin

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
that means is it's made up of a resin

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.840 
that means is it's made up of a resin
which<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.539> core<00:00:45.809> which<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.829> kind<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.760> a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
which is the core which is kind of a

which is the core which is kind of a
plastic<00:00:48.510> type<00:00:48.719> material<00:00:49.440> then<00:00:50.399> there<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:51.030> a

speak of a wood like or in some cases of
stone<00:01:04.640> like<00:01:05.640> surface<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.570> then<00:01:07.080> there's<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
stone like surface and then there's a

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.679 
stone like surface and then there's a
finish<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.549> finish<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:08.909> usually<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.390> hard

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
finish and the finish is usually a hard

finish and the finish is usually a hard
finish<00:01:10.159> like<00:01:11.159> aluminum<00:01:11.760> oxide<00:01:12.210> which<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.600> a

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
finish like aluminum oxide which is a

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.940 
finish like aluminum oxide which is a
real<00:01:14.189> popular<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:15.229> most<00:01:16.229> commonly<00:01:16.710> used

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
finish on a laminate flooring these

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.870 
finish on a laminate flooring these
floors<00:01:20.729> are<00:01:21.830> also<00:01:22.830> known<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.130> floating<00:01:23.430> floors

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
floors are also known as floating floors

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.480 
floors are also known as floating floors
because<00:01:24.630> they<00:01:24.990> aren't<00:01:25.200> glued<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.159> slab

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
because they aren't glued to the slab

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.700 
because they aren't glued to the slab
and<00:01:26.850> they<00:01:27.450> are<00:01:27.630> nailed<00:01:28.049> down

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
and they are nailed down

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.030 
and they are nailed down
they<00:01:29.220> are<00:01:29.400> interlocked<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.439> one<00:01:31.439> another<00:01:31.740> and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
they are interlocked to one another and

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.920 
they are interlocked to one another and
they<00:01:32.880> get<00:01:33.240> their<00:01:33.450> structure<00:01:34.049> by<00:01:35.930> connecting

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
they get their structure by connecting

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.289 
they get their structure by connecting
the<00:01:37.829> connecting<00:01:38.250> mechanism<00:01:38.820> locking<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.210> in

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
the connecting mechanism locking it in

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.230 
the connecting mechanism locking it in
to<00:01:39.390> each<00:01:39.540> other<00:01:39.810> also<00:01:40.470> by<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.640> quarter-round

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
to each other also by the quarter-round

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.120 
to each other also by the quarter-round
and<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.720> transition<00:01:43.320> pieces<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.920> room

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
and the transition pieces in the room

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.740 
and the transition pieces in the room
help<00:01:44.939> keep<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:46.020> place<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:48.119> actually

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
help keep it in place and it's actually

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.990 
help keep it in place and it's actually
a<00:01:48.990> shock<00:01:49.619> absorbing<00:01:50.280> because<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.790> is

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
a shock absorbing because it is

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.899 
a shock absorbing because it is
installed<00:01:51.600> over<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:52.020> padding<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.159> walks<00:01:53.579> pretty

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
installed over a padding so walks pretty

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.730 
installed over a padding so walks pretty
good<00:01:54.149> there's<00:01:54.509> different<00:01:54.869> type<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.049> pads<00:01:55.439> you

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
good there's different type of pads you

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.969 
good there's different type of pads you
can<00:01:55.770> get<00:01:56.070> down<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.390> discussion

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
can get down but for this discussion

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.260 
can get down but for this discussion
we're<00:01:58.979> going<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.130> focus<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.850> finish

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
we're going to focus on the finish

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.999 
we're going to focus on the finish
and<00:02:00.479> again<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.200> finishing<00:02:01.680> on<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.890> is

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
and again the finishing on it is

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.859 
and again the finishing on it is
aluminum<00:02:02.460> oxide<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:04.170> does<00:02:05.180> get<00:02:06.180> slight

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
aluminum oxide and it does get slight

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.320 
aluminum oxide and it does get slight
scratched<00:02:07.409> even<00:02:07.799> though<00:02:07.890> it's<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.670> very<00:02:09.000> hard

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
scratched even though it's a very hard

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.620 
scratched even though it's a very hard
surface<00:02:09.629> it's<00:02:10.349> several<00:02:10.709> times<00:02:11.069> harder

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
surface it's several times harder

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.800 
surface it's several times harder
and<00:02:11.720> polyurethane<00:02:12.820> it<00:02:13.820> does<00:02:14.120> get<00:02:14.420> scratched

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
and polyurethane it does get scratched

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.940 
and polyurethane it does get scratched
it<00:02:15.050> does<00:02:15.260> get<00:02:15.560> dull<00:02:15.830> it<00:02:16.820> does<00:02:17.180> show<00:02:17.570> a<00:02:17.950> pet

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
it does get dull it does show a pet

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.360 
it does get dull it does show a pet
prints<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.610> footprints<00:02:20.410> so<00:02:21.520> what<00:02:22.520> do<00:02:22.670> we<00:02:22.730> do

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
prints and footprints so what do we do

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.160 
prints and footprints so what do we do
because<00:02:25.370> we're<00:02:25.700> limited<00:02:26.210> because<00:02:26.480> this<00:02:26.870> is<00:02:27.140> a

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
because we're limited because this is a

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.390 
because we're limited because this is a
synthetic<00:02:27.830> flooring<00:02:28.640> it's<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.860> plastic<00:02:30.860> floor

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
synthetic flooring it's a plastic floor

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.200 
synthetic flooring it's a plastic floor
for<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.820> most<00:02:32.030> part<00:02:32.860> there<00:02:33.860> is<00:02:33.890> no<00:02:34.250> real

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
for the most part there is no real

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.300 
for the most part there is no real
sanding<00:02:35.870> that<00:02:35.900> can<00:02:36.200> be<00:02:36.320> done<00:02:36.560> because<00:02:36.860> once

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
sanding that can be done because once

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.020 
sanding that can be done because once
you<00:02:37.430> get<00:02:37.670> past<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:39.100> finish<00:02:40.100> of<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:40.460> then

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
you get past the finish of it then

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.750 
you get past the finish of it then
