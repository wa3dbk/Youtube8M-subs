00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
and clear and the wax is solidified

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.780 
and clear and the wax is solidified
they're<00:01:07.080> sliding<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.500> top<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:08.700> I'll

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
they're sliding on the top so I'll

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.980 
they're sliding on the top so I'll
probably<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.150> check<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.510> tomorrow

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
probably have to check is tomorrow

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.570 
probably have to check is tomorrow
afternoon<00:01:10.170> if<00:01:10.560> we<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> sunny<00:01:11.010> day<00:01:11.189> tomorrow

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
afternoon if we get a sunny day tomorrow

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.020 
afternoon if we get a sunny day tomorrow
I<00:01:15.950> didn't<00:01:16.950> think<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.310> get<00:01:17.460> melted<00:01:17.820> today

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
I didn't think this is get melted today

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.130 
I didn't think this is get melted today
started<00:01:18.750> off<00:01:18.840> feeling<00:01:18.990> overcast<00:01:20.420> but<00:01:21.420> good

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
started off feeling overcast but good

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.039 
started off feeling overcast but good
after<00:01:22.380> midday<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.740> came<00:01:22.920> out<00:01:23.100> fairly<00:01:23.369> sunny

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
after midday it came out fairly sunny

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.210 
after midday it came out fairly sunny
and<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:27.290> wax<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.470> melting<00:01:28.860> have<00:01:28.950> been<00:01:29.070> able

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
and so the wax is melting have been able

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.160 
and so the wax is melting have been able
to<00:01:29.310> separate<00:01:29.670> from<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.939> honey<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.930> let's<00:01:31.079> have

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
to separate from the honey so let's have

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:44.710 
to separate from the honey so let's have
a<00:01:31.229> look<00:01:31.320> see<00:01:31.560> what<00:01:31.590> we've<00:01:31.770> got

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.719 

this<00:01:45.720> one<00:01:45.900> here<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.560> got<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.830> honey<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.130> it

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.000 

so<00:01:50.729> I'll<00:01:50.820> take<00:01:51.000> all<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.330> inside<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.890> we'll

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
so I'll take all this inside and we'll

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.700 
so I'll take all this inside and we'll
fill<00:01:53.190> it<00:01:53.250> we<00:01:53.340> end<00:01:53.490> up<00:01:53.640> with<00:01:57.409> all<00:01:58.409> right<00:01:58.440> so

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
fill it we end up with all right so

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.999 
fill it we end up with all right so
let's<00:01:58.860> have<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.010> look<00:01:59.100> at<00:01:59.220> this<00:02:01.130> one<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.340> a

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
let's have a look at this one is a

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.210 
let's have a look at this one is a
little<00:02:05.009> bit<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.340> waxy<00:02:06.800> not<00:02:07.800> too<00:02:07.979> worried<00:02:08.160> about

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
little bit of waxy not too worried about

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:20.110 
little bit of waxy not too worried about
it<00:02:08.399> they'll<00:02:08.610> come<00:02:08.640> out<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.030> strainer

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.210 

so<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:20.810> just<00:02:20.930> hasn't<00:02:21.170> had<00:02:21.349> enough<00:02:21.590> time<00:02:22.069> to

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
so it just hasn't had enough time to

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:37.090 
so it just hasn't had enough time to
cool<00:02:22.400> yet

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:47.290 

that's<00:02:38.100> right<00:02:42.170> that's<00:02:43.170> what<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.410> quick<00:02:43.680> smile

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:56.240 

so<00:02:48.300> just<00:02:48.480> strain<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:48.840> me<00:02:49.050> out<00:02:54.890> now<00:02:55.890> this<00:02:56.040> back

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
so just strain it me out now this back

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.990 
so just strain it me out now this back
in<00:02:56.370> here<00:02:56.400> I'm<00:02:56.840> keeping<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.960> separate<00:02:58.320> from<00:02:59.000> the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
in here I'm keeping it separate from the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.850 
in here I'm keeping it separate from the
stuff<00:03:00.240> that<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.420> culled<00:03:00.720> extracted<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.620> has

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
stuff that I culled extracted this has

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:12.180 
stuff that I culled extracted this has
been<00:03:02.010> here<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.220> little<00:03:02.610> bit

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.650 

obviously<00:03:12.880> that's<00:03:13.090> training<00:03:13.300> for<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.510> few

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
obviously that's training for a few

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.840 
obviously that's training for a few
minutes<00:03:15.510> it'll<00:03:16.510> be<00:03:16.600> done
