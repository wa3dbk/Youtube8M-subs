00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.160
 you are very well to be welcome a 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.230
 more time again to the channel and good today is 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.390
 day monday when stretching this day 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.580
 after the official revelation of 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.810
 trailer of black ops 3 but in this case 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.009
 as you will have seen in the video I'm not going to 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.779
 tell you about all things 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.939
 have shown all the data that has been 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.769
 revealed good and specifically about a 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.050
 data that many of us 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.070
 worries may it attacks many of 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.570
 you dont 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.699
 but well I wanted to give my opinion or 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.360
 explain a little and spend what I 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.680
 I think and good to tell you that good I was not going 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.000
 to upload information videos and all that 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.980
 I think you've all seen the 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.020
 typical videos of angels what serious and 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.370
 things like that and I did not have to throw myself 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.590
 eight hours to upload a video that 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.190
 Finally, few people were going to see it 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.340
 because people had already seen it good 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.340
 start today 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:06.590
 but it's getting a little 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.330
 overacting but I'm not 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.950
 getting in someone will appear 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.060
 I do not know what it sounds to me that I saw a video 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.400
 yesterday nothing the same outside of cunts today came 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.790
 to talk to you about the topic that is black 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.470
 ops 3 if it will be in old games or if it will come out 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.450
 only for in the 100 neighbors that 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.520
 yesterday they had many news that as 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.710
 well they said that the game only 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.810
 it would go for good and then the test 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.330
 culminating one could say is that 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.530
 you could only reserve other than the 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.420
 beta the game for plate play 4 and xbox 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.250
 that is, you are the play player 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.930
 3 I do not have enough money to 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.910
 buy me a movie 4 even if it's a year 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.890
 and peak saving this two that have 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.110
 until 2017 to be able to get the movie 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.760
 4 and it would be impossible to continue with the channel 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.740
 unable to play in the new car 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.880
 then he is reflecting a lot and 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.150
 well there I was thinking too much 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.400
 until today on twitter I got involved 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.100
 seen that a news has come out that 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.900
 how to say what several online stores 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.690
 have announced the game as being 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.280
 depended to play 3 with the cover 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.860
 paper and teresita in a basket make a 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.530
 cover of a game for play 3 and xbox 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.680
 360 is very simple you take the one from xbox one 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.660
 click 4 the copy is pasted on top 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.430
 I really hope that this is 1% 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.480
 of possibilities that they are going to remove it 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.550
 for the yen 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.860
 Sincerely there are several things and there 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.530
 several indications that show that 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.700
 you can possibly go to 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.970
 develop then I'm going to talk a 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.590
 little of that then there are many people who 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.300
 he prefers not to leave for 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.830
 someone to see your person who has 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.750
 explained 4 and you do not want it to be done for 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.640
 someone first everything tell you what else 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.500
 it gives you if you are going to have your game that 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.540
 come out in play 3 does not affect you for 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.520
 nothing then most say is that 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.760
 so that it is full of wuxi full of such 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.650
 and with bad graphics because I do not prefer 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.380
 that does not come first of all is that 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.450
 besides warfare does not have some graphics in 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.459
 play 3 and it's full of loops I do not know yo 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.020
 from my point of view I think that a 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.819
 game have good graphics does not mean 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.499
 that by having 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.959
 you're not seeing used graphically 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:08.730
 to have to have many uses be me 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.920
 it seems to me it would seem normal to me 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.930
 correct vision in a game not so 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.120
 graphically advanced as white the two 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.920
 of the same level but yes and that 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.989
 simply did not have to go now 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.510
 the fact of doing so come to all 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.370
 books and total sincerely then the 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.079
 people who do not want to leave joderse 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.909
 because a lot of people there are almost 100,000 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.590
 people playing the most warfare in 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.689
 ps3 I do not know how many in teams but there is a 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.700
 lots of people and people who do not have 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.859
 money people who do not have to spend 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.099
 they measured themselves only to be able to continue 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.480
 playing with the elbow or the god if it is 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.099
 obvious and some movement had to 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.340
 pass or we will not continue here until 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.049
 the end of the world with play 3 I think 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.540
 great have happened to other consoles but 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.459
 Of course, if people start saying 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.719
 that's why I did not take it out for myself 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.189
 that they take it out even if they do not have the 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.139
 best graphics in the world because I do not 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.489
 I can be a call of duty never the 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.520
 it was incredible graphics 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.530
 but at least you can enjoy 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.080
 a little white star to say goodbye 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.550
 the console so that more then 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.250
 we know about this game that takes 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.160
 developing from I think it's three years 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.470
 three years ago we were by ghost I think 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.960
 that was and I think that then yes that 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.600
 I was say dump not fully but 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.220
 yes much in what is the tooth 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.260
 remember that the goal was the first 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.030
 game that came out for play 4 and also 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.580
 it was well optimized for play 3 is 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.580
 let's say it was 50% and 50% for 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.220
 console then already in advanced warfare already 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.250
 it's gone we say an 80 for enel and 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.080
 20% quality could be said to 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.150
 the wind I think that as they carry 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.880
 Working from ghost is possible 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.470
 normal that maybe they did not do them 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.380
 that a company is responsible for doing is 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.390
 what is the black ops 3 for today who 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.910
 I really like it 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.280
 I feel very sorry for the people who passed 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.690
 three and four of these edit eyelet 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.940
 simply that people who get by 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.680
 with you with a moment with you for not 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.780
 d have the money 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.009
 catch and be able to buy a pipe another the 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.630
 people believe that the people that we are 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:05.850
 in the good is because we prefer to play 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.190
 with some fucking graphics and we prefer 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.320
 play with a game that lends itself to a 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.699
 console that is already very slow and what 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.919
 we do for pleasure I think that most 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.320
 of people I will not say all but 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.460
 that we are there because we do not have 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.930
 let's say the money or we had it 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.479
 spend 400 evolution my case I do not have 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.190
 the money but well then I came 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.690
 talk about this topic about more than 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.460
 nothing to give a hopeful message a 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.139
 message of support for all those who 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.360
 they think white 3 is not going to leave for 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.699
 someone is quite possible I do during 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.550
 these weeks will be enough videos of 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:37.830
 information so I ask that you calm down that 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.419
 relax the tits that you do not 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.580
 worry and what good do not you say more 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:43.530
 turns then I want I said it 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.780
 I said was thinking yesterday many 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.699
 hasty things um even the subject of 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.190
 close the channel and everything if you simply 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:52.169
 by the fact that I could not continue with 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.210
 the saga of co2 in images you 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.880
 imagine torsional decoud that they play 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.800
 in play 3 and most even if you have a 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.270
 pri 4 all those who do not have money to him 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.280
 I said I'm focusing a lot that 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.150
 that part but all that can not 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.890
 buy the play 4 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.620
 so what's the matter, what do you see in my 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.780
 case to take for ass as well I'm 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.970
 I'm thinking a lot, hopefully I'll come out 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.370
 April three and hopefully within two fucking 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:18.640
 years then change the thing and you can 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.780
 buy me a console nexgen then not 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.280
 I wanted to talk to you about the other topics 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.770
 that we already talked a bit about my point 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.140
 view on today's subject in a message 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.820
 for people who have or for the 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.530
 people who do not have it is a bit to 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.530
 everyone and I hope that I have 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.940
 of course the video I hope that 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.590
 vote with a like and if you can 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.070
 share it with more people who have or 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:41.080
 well he does not have it with friends who 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.790
 like the code tell you that although 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.530
 he appeared there he was and a little sad or 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.200
 I do not know why in the end it's still 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.220
 relaxing me too much is to say is that 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.860
 I will continue to butt with advanced 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.840
 warfighter I will try to take out what 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.610
 maximum of myself and good then already in 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.360
 the future when things arise 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:01.050
 it will look like this is a greeting 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.050
 goodbye
