00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
the left and also a regular version

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.849 
the left and also a regular version
which<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:18.960> one<00:00:19.230> you're<00:00:19.410> looking<00:00:19.439> on<00:00:19.770> the

which is the one you're looking on the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.609 
which is the one you're looking on the
right<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.430> again<00:00:21.390> for<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.960> back<00:00:22.109> here<00:00:22.410> we've

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
right and again for the back here we've

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.259 
right and again for the back here we've
got<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.800> case<00:00:23.010> optimized<00:00:23.519> version<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.029> left

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
got a case optimized version on the left

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.960 
got a case optimized version on the left
and<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.779> regular<00:00:25.350> version<00:00:25.529> on<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.949> right<00:00:26.220> and

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
and a regular version on the right and

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.019 
and a regular version on the right and
they<00:00:27.750> also<00:00:27.900> have<00:00:28.199> glossy<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.250> matte<00:00:29.849> finishes

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
they also have glossy and matte finishes

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.780 
they also have glossy and matte finishes
as<00:00:30.689> well<00:00:30.720> on<00:00:31.080> there<00:00:31.230> scream<00:00:31.439> tectors<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
as well on there scream tectors so the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.880 
as well on there scream tectors so the
differences<00:00:33.300> between<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.870> case<00:00:34.380> optimized

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
differences between a case optimized

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.220 
differences between a case optimized
version<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:36.210> brayla<00:00:36.540> version<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.020> that

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
version and a brayla version is that

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.900 
version and a brayla version is that
their<00:00:37.410> cutouts<00:00:37.829> are<00:00:37.980> little<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.489> little<00:00:38.760> bit

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
their cutouts are little a little bit

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.610 
their cutouts are little a little bit
more<00:00:39.120> deep<00:00:39.360> here<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:40.320> see<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
more deep here so you can see the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.340 
more deep here so you can see the
proximity<00:00:40.920> sensor<00:00:41.430> cut<00:00:41.820> out<00:00:41.940> as<00:00:42.120> shown<00:00:42.540> also

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
proximity sensor cut out as shown also

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.880 
proximity sensor cut out as shown also
the<00:00:43.710> home<00:00:43.890> button<00:00:44.190> color<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.000> also<00:00:45.180> shown

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
the home button color is also shown

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.490 
the home button color is also shown
versus<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:49.820> smaller<00:00:50.820> cut<00:00:51.149> out<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.360> guess<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.840> a

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
versus a smaller cut out I guess on a

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.229 
versus a smaller cut out I guess on a
burglar<00:00:52.829> version<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.489> also<00:00:54.079> there<00:00:55.079> are<00:00:56.239> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
burglar version and also there are the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.930 
burglar version and also there are the
width<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:58.079> scrim<00:00:58.469> textures<00:00:58.829> for<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.340> case

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
width of the scrim textures for the case

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.910 
width of the scrim textures for the case
optimized<00:01:00.420> versions<00:01:00.870> are<00:01:01.199> also<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.680> little

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
optimized versions are also a little

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.780 
optimized versions are also a little
more<00:01:02.660> skinnier<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.379> our<00:01:04.830> cases<00:01:05.339> will<00:01:05.549> fit

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
more skinnier so that our cases will fit

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.420 
more skinnier so that our cases will fit
so<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:07.020> installed<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.740> front<00:01:07.890> here<00:01:08.310> a

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
so I have installed on the front here a

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.649 
so I have installed on the front here a
glossy<00:01:09.030> case<00:01:09.600> optimized<00:01:10.430> version<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.659> with

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
glossy case optimized version and with

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.810 
glossy case optimized version and with
the<00:01:12.780> glossy<00:01:12.990> it's<00:01:13.470> very<00:01:13.710> clear<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.400> very<00:01:14.430> nice

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
the glossy it's very clear and very nice

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.210 
the glossy it's very clear and very nice
colors<00:01:15.360> are<00:01:15.479> also<00:01:15.659> very<00:01:15.930> precise<00:01:16.290> keep<00:01:17.070> in

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
colors are also very precise keep in

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.429 
colors are also very precise keep in
mind<00:01:17.400> if<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.759> do<00:01:18.090> purchase<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.840> matte<00:01:19.049> finish

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
mind if you do purchase a matte finish

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.580 
mind if you do purchase a matte finish
for<00:01:19.680> your<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.880> front<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.210> your<00:01:21.330> screen<00:01:21.590> your

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
for your the front of your screen your

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.499 
for your the front of your screen your
screen<00:01:22.619> will<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.130> pixelated<00:01:23.880> because<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
screen will be pixelated because of the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.780 
screen will be pixelated because of the
matte<00:01:24.689> finish<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.710> that's<00:01:26.250> one<00:01:26.580> thing<00:01:26.759> that

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
matte finish so that's one thing that

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.499 
matte finish so that's one thing that
you<00:01:27.150> had<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.530> be<00:01:28.530> aware<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:28.979> because<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:30.270> does

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
you had to be aware of because that does

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.359 
you had to be aware of because that does
make<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.720> huge<00:01:30.840> difference<00:01:31.439> with<00:01:31.619> your<00:01:32.040> screen

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
make a huge difference with your screen

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.609 
make a huge difference with your screen
your<00:01:32.700> screen<00:01:32.729> quality<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.689> onto<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.500> back

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
your screen quality and onto the back

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.940 
your screen quality and onto the back
here<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.400> installed<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.570> matte<00:01:36.950> case

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
here I have installed the matte case

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.359 
here I have installed the matte case
optimized<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.790> version<00:01:39.680> for<00:01:40.680> back<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
optimized the version for back and the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.670 
optimized the version for back and the
colors<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:41.909> are<00:01:42.090> actually<00:01:42.680> insanely

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
colors here are actually insanely

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.130 
colors here are actually insanely
precise<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.640> can't<00:01:44.939> even<00:01:45.149> find<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.750> cutout<00:01:45.960> of

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
precise you can't even find a cutout of

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.740 
precise you can't even find a cutout of
the<00:01:46.290> camera<00:01:46.740> because<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.340> exactly<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.509> size

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
the camera because it's exactly the size

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.440 
the camera because it's exactly the size
of<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.020> camera<00:01:49.350> hole<00:01:49.790> you<00:01:50.790> can<00:01:50.939> only<00:01:51.119> see

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
of the camera hole you can only see

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.450 
of the camera hole you can only see
there's<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.930> cutout<00:01:52.259> for<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.829> speaker<00:01:53.280> in

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
there's a cutout for the speaker in

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.450 
there's a cutout for the speaker in
flash<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.270> that's<00:01:54.450> pretty<00:01:54.659> awesome<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.460> where

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
flash so that's pretty awesome and where

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.149
