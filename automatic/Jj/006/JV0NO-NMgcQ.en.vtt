00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
would have got to I think we've been

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.789 
would have got to I think we've been
fine<00:01:05.510> LeBron<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:07.140> fours<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.619> fives

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
fine LeBron the the fours and fives

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.530 
fine LeBron the the fours and fives
seemed<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.250> blend<00:01:08.490> very<00:01:08.670> well<00:01:08.820> together

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
seemed to blend very well together

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.840 
seemed to blend very well together
tonight<00:01:10.049> seem<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.500> be<00:01:10.619> very<00:01:10.650> active<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.490> was

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
tonight seem to be very active it was

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.390 
tonight seem to be very active it was
that<00:01:12.030> time<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.750> guess<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.979> depth<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
that time I guess that the depth and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.280 
that time I guess that the depth and
versatility<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:15.060> your<00:01:15.509> fours<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.930> fives<00:01:16.110> or

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
versatility of your fours and fives or

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.859 
versatility of your fours and fives or
was<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.560> smaller<00:01:17.159> smaller<00:01:18.150> opponent

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
was that a smaller smaller opponent

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.030 
was that a smaller smaller opponent
playing<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.170> small<00:01:19.290> lineup<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.860> took

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
playing a small lineup you took

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.410 
playing a small lineup you took
advantage<00:01:20.130> oh<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.729> think<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.299> was<00:01:21.360> a

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
advantage oh I think it was a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.749 
advantage oh I think it was a
combination<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.930> both<00:01:22.100> you<00:01:23.100> know<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.220> think<00:01:23.340> CB

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
combination of both you know I think CB

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.390 
combination of both you know I think CB
came<00:01:23.970> out<00:01:24.150> very<00:01:24.299> aggressive<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.900> start<00:01:25.170> and

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
came out very aggressive to start and

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.469 
came out very aggressive to start and
when<00:01:26.400> she<00:01:26.549> become<00:01:26.820> outage<00:01:27.060> aggressive<00:01:27.360> his

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
when she become outage aggressive his

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.410 
when she become outage aggressive his
ears<00:01:27.659> I'm<00:01:27.960> definitely<00:01:28.350> helps<00:01:28.680> us<00:01:28.770> out<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.950> lot<00:01:29.130> I

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
ears I'm definitely helps us out a lot I

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.530
