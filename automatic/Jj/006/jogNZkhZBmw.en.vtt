now<00:02:18.480> certainly<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.990> Finnish<00:02:19.380> tourist<00:02:19.710> that<00:02:20.160> was

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
now certainly a Finnish tourist that was

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.580 
now certainly a Finnish tourist that was
better<00:02:20.670> but<00:02:21.360> still<00:02:21.510> not<00:02:21.630> quite<00:02:21.960> good<00:02:22.320> now<00:02:22.530> so

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
better but still not quite good now so

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.440 
better but still not quite good now so
I'm<00:02:22.920> just<00:02:22.950> going<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.250> pull<00:02:23.460> them<00:02:23.550> around<00:02:23.670> go

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
off the other way I think as you'll

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.450 
off the other way I think as you'll
notice<00:02:27.930> each<00:02:28.170> time<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.770> do<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:29.220> with<00:02:29.430> the

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
notice each time I do this with the

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.050 
notice each time I do this with the
source<00:02:29.820> its<00:02:30.450> top<00:02:30.780> improves<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.650> little<00:02:31.860> bit

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
source its top improves a little bit

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.310 
source its top improves a little bit
that<00:02:33.060> was<00:02:33.210> better<00:02:33.480> yet<00:02:34.340> now<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.550> time<00:02:35.820> I<00:02:35.850> just

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
that was better yet now that time I just

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.960 
that was better yet now that time I just
made<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.350> little<00:02:37.650> soft<00:02:38.100> kind<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.640> an<00:02:38.760> easy

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
made a little soft kind of an easy

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.600 
made a little soft kind of an easy
rollback<00:02:39.600> because<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.560> stop<00:02:40.830> really<00:02:41.400> was

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
rollback because the stop really was

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.930
