00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.460
 discover more sense of movement and 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.800
 lightness in the saddle 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.570
 with the exercises of this dvd they become too 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.720
 more harmony and fun on your horse 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.920
 comes balance is the key to everything 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.660
 Let us focus on the core 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.550
 Start the upright seat there 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.949
 but even here she tests herself without 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.699
 a second person can do one 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.770
 possibility 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.960
 We grasp her finger a little bit 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.560
 Mane and pull the girls vertically 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.660
 up 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.969
 in the neutral basin will be yours 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.100
 Do not change position if you want to 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.840
 they will have a lot of tension in the body 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.340
 pull yourself out or notice that 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.199
 Muscle groups harness themselves 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.780
 The next lesson is about us 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.210
 with the topic of foot and compliance 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.489
 lower heel let hips open 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.480
 long leg are the many instructions 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.370
 hear again and again 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.230
 in that case it is a little bit wrong 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.699
 I understood the teacher I will teach you 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.609
 a few tips on how they pave their 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.199
 make better use of your foot 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.910
 leonie maybe you do a little bit 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.070
 and show us in the easy and 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.080
 sit back is a seat at the moment 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.960
 stability and agility with this 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.710
 foot posture I'm laying mine now 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.150
 finger down as if I were the stirrup 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.100
 swing was now and so for the place 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.829
 The lower basin is thus shoulder 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.640
 Basin and foot in a line are glad 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:29.380
 if I miss or can go up now 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.140
 you can see very well how ankle 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.780
 swinging the knee joint and hip joint 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.780
 can make it again entered implement 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.900
 fleeting now the seat essential 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.520
 more stable an ok you can too 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.070
 Imagine being around your feet 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.470
 little more to bring back that 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.070
 your feet are on the skateboard and 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.080
 you push the skateboard back 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.380
 If you are not in balance you have the trend 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.000
 to cramp on the feet 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.569
 a way to change it yourself 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.770
 you have feline paws to introduce them 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.170
 can stretch 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.730
 and in this step make a whole 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.620
 to get elastic foot 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.810
 always this picture with purely leon me 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.540
 Imagine that cat's paws very much 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.620
 beautiful 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.910
 Can you make the difference in the back 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.160
 feel like a horse if you 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.260
 cat paws what do you feel what changes 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.480
 his horse he gets it right 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.430
 nice over the back to the front very 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.080
 easy yes and now try it 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.970
 on the contrary krall this time with the toes 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.590
 firmly as if you were sure to be very good 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.989
 Do not you like wonderful anymore? 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.120
 the horses are our best teachers you 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.180
 reflect very exactly where in our body 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.610
 we build up tension and how good you are 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.720
 can move with it 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.730
 of course you can also learn with 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.690
 to run after a strained rider yet 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.700
 they look very good 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.170
 as soon as you change something you need 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.450
 actually only to feel into the drive 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.850
 and you get the effect 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.650
 that is good and not good now 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.870
 training times let your hands go to the right 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.720
 it could come to the clock 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.120
 and then keep it to begin there now 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.269
 with your hands circles especially in the 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.910
 air slowly when we ear now be the 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.500
 Glue the shoulder together and then the 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.690
 circles in the other direction what 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.049
 slow and watch what is comfortable as 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.209
 big can make it uncomfortable without it 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:35.510
 will we come to the step and in 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:37.400
 the middle again to hold one 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.319
 Use in a good connection to 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.030
 ride and the horse really one 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.069
 beautiful curve pretend 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.510
 It makes sense to have a good relationship 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.510
 to have outer reins 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.590
 many as well as you now 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.960
 give a parade on the outer rein 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.790
 but then lose the attachment again 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.650
 you can just go back now 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.430
 connect to the outer rein 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.980
 if you're on wright then enable one 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.380
 inner thigh to offer the horse 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.150
 and the moment you rotate when you 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.250
 you realize you when you realize that trees 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.000
 you're singing to the left, you imagine 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.799
 that his right foot anchor raises many 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.730
 riders have difficulties hand 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.739
 keep still 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.630
 the nodding movement of the horse to follow 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.190
 or to give soft help 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.870
 We are going to do a few things now 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.180
 experiment with how we do it 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.890
 a little bit better can be a thing 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.840
 to be able to remember that better 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.330
 if you say I keep mine 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.430
 elbow with me yes you can 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.620
 as yourself as a command give if the 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.200
 Poor down here you can only 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.180
 down and then you fall right when 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.890
 You can see the poor here a lot 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.120
 softer and lighter in the helmet 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.060
 give in can feel 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.610
 very good we always speak all of the 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.160
 connection that we have elastic trains 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.390
 have connection and this elastic too 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.100
 get and tee before 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.960
 This elastic bridle connection like 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.030
 we can be sony 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.919
 actually in our wrists 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.370
 figuring out that makes im 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:08.560
 moment in rampant so many riders 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.070
 tend to bend your hand so 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.690
 Do you know that when they do it like that? 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.020
 I play horse here now 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.940
 Now watch the wrist then 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.780
 i can see the wrist is very much 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.140
 very strong 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.520
 But if I have the idea here 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.680
 a bit high we lift ours 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.370
 rubber band just and the thumb shows 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.800
 below 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.070
 then a rubber can turn it like that 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.210
 Now let's see how 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.460
 we can change that 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.560
 bring the buttocks to you less 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.690
 felt good on the chair to the side like that 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.970
 that she hangs completely free when she is here 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.950
 Sitting let you sit on properly at 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.630
 lower and pick it up again 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.710
 the height 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.470
 Repeat this movement a few 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:55.560
 let's see if she would be the one 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.560
 Allow to breathe in or exhale
