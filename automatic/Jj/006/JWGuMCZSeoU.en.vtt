00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.070 

so<00:03:29.700> snapping<00:03:30.120> on<00:03:30.210> this<00:03:30.300> games<00:03:30.540> probably<00:03:30.780> I'd

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
so snapping on this games probably I'd

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.260 
so snapping on this games probably I'd
say<00:03:31.110> easier<00:03:31.680> than<00:03:31.830> c.o.d<00:03:32.310> in<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.790> sense<00:03:33.030> they

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
say easier than c.o.d in the sense they

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.980 
say easier than c.o.d in the sense they
don't<00:03:33.510> have<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:33.690> hold<00:03:33.870> l3<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:36.060> breathe<00:03:36.420> but

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
don't have to hold l3 to breathe but

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.360 
don't have to hold l3 to breathe but
then<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:37.260> have<00:03:37.380> got<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.590> bit<00:03:37.740> of<00:03:37.830> bullet<00:03:38.130> drop

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
then you have got a bit of bullet drop

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.770 
then you have got a bit of bullet drop
to<00:03:38.490> worry<00:03:38.670> about<00:03:38.790> so<00:03:39.210> you<00:03:39.300> got<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.510> take<00:03:39.630> that

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
to worry about so you got to take that

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.940 
to worry about so you got to take that
into<00:03:39.960> account<00:03:42.080> but<00:03:43.080> if<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.410> like<00:03:43.530> school<00:03:43.920> a
