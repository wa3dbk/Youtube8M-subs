00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
button is clicked then go to the last

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.870 
button is clicked then go to the last
frame<00:06:00.560> next<00:06:01.560> change<00:06:01.800> next<00:06:02.100> frame<00:06:02.400> to<00:06:02.610> pre

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
frame next change next frame to pre

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.670 
frame next change next frame to pre
frame<00:06:03.210> so<00:06:03.510> that<00:06:03.630> the<00:06:03.750> previous<00:06:04.140> button<00:06:04.350> will

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
frame so that the previous button will

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.410 
frame so that the previous button will
by<00:06:04.920> default<00:06:04.980> take<00:06:05.640> you<00:06:05.760> to<00:06:05.910> the<00:06:06.000> previous

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:06.420 
by default take you to the previous

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.570 
by default take you to the previous
frame<00:06:06.720> so<00:06:07.530> now<00:06:07.650> our<00:06:07.680> gallery<00:06:08.130> should<00:06:08.460> be

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
frame so now our gallery should be

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.360 
frame so now our gallery should be
working<00:06:09.000> test<00:06:09.780> it<00:06:09.960> by<00:06:10.050> going<00:06:10.290> to<00:06:10.380> control<00:06:10.740> test

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
working test it by going to control test

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.549 
working test it by going to control test
movie<00:06:11.460> test

00:06:13.549 --> 00:06:13.559 
movie test

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:15.499 
movie test
so<00:06:14.399> now<00:06:14.519> you<00:06:14.579> can<00:06:14.759> see<00:06:14.939> that<00:06:15.029> you<00:06:15.149> can<00:06:15.269> click

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
so now you can see that you can click

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:17.149 
so now you can see that you can click
through<00:06:15.719> the<00:06:15.809> gallery<00:06:16.229> with<00:06:16.589> both<00:06:16.829> buttons

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:17.159 
through the gallery with both buttons

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:20.570 
through the gallery with both buttons
and<00:06:17.549> it<00:06:17.819> is<00:06:17.969> looping<00:06:18.299> properly

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
and it is looping properly

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.460 
and it is looping properly
so<00:06:21.270> there<00:06:21.450> we<00:06:21.570> have<00:06:21.750> it<00:06:21.780> now<00:06:21.990> you<00:06:22.170> have<00:06:22.440> a

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
so there we have it now you have a

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.620 
so there we have it now you have a
simple<00:06:22.770> next<00:06:23.220> and<00:06:23.430> previous<00:06:23.640> gallery<00:06:24.150> made<00:06:24.420> in

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
simple next and previous gallery made in

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.320 
simple next and previous gallery made in
