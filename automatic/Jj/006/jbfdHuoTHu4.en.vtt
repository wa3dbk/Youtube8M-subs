the<00:00:42.239> operation<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.410> somewhat<00:00:44.070> different<00:00:44.280> than

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
the operation is somewhat different than

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.860 
the operation is somewhat different than
many<00:00:45.329> other<00:00:45.690> engines<00:00:47.420> you'll<00:00:48.420> notice<00:00:48.720> that

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
many other engines you'll notice that

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.439 
many other engines you'll notice that
the<00:00:48.989> exhaust<00:00:49.350> rocker<00:00:49.650> arm<00:00:50.040> is<00:00:50.309> actuated<00:00:51.090> off

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
the exhaust rocker arm is actuated off

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.189 
the exhaust rocker arm is actuated off
of<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.780> cam<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> side<00:00:52.620> shaft<00:00:53.780> but<00:00:54.780> what<00:00:55.050> is

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
of a cam on the side shaft but what is

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.470 
of a cam on the side shaft but what is
unique<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:56.300> that<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:58.199> speed<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.129> governed<00:00:59.760> via

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
unique is that the speed is governed via

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.890 
unique is that the speed is governed via
the<00:01:00.720> intake<00:01:01.199> valve<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.940> intake<00:01:03.360> valve<00:01:03.600> rocker

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
the intake valve the intake valve rocker

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.940 
the intake valve the intake valve rocker
arm<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:05.180> actuated<00:01:06.180> off<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.170> cam<00:01:07.410> on<00:01:07.440> the<00:01:07.710> side

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
arm is actuated off of a cam on the side

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.020 
arm is actuated off of a cam on the side
shaft<00:01:08.220> as<00:01:08.490> well<00:01:09.350> but<00:01:10.350> what<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.250> special<00:01:11.610> is

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
shaft as well but what is special is

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.400 
shaft as well but what is special is
that<00:01:12.410> the<00:01:13.410> governor<00:01:14.360> when<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.690> to<00:01:15.720> speed

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
that the governor when up to speed

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.510 
that the governor when up to speed
moves<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.670> Pam<00:01:18.600> out<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> way<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.310> when<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
moves the Pam out of the way so when the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.580 
moves the Pam out of the way so when the
governor<00:01:20.789> is<00:01:20.880> up<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.090> speed<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.840> cam<00:01:22.110> is

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
governor is up to speed the cam is

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.380 
governor is up to speed the cam is
pulled<00:01:22.920> aside<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.640> no<00:01:24.210> longer<00:01:24.509> operates<00:01:26.390> the

one of our easiest earnings

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.240 
one of our easiest earnings
so<00:02:32.650> let's<00:02:33.250> see<00:02:33.880> if<00:02:33.970> that's<00:02:34.150> true<00:02:34.830> first<00:02:35.830> we'll

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
so let's see if that's true first we'll

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.400 
so let's see if that's true first we'll
turn<00:02:36.550> on<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.820> drip<00:02:37.030> boilers<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:38.050> provide

i'll<00:02:44.070> actuate<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.250> compression<00:02:45.850> release<00:02:46.180> so

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
i'll actuate the compression release so

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.660 
i'll actuate the compression release so
the<00:02:46.960> engine<00:02:47.380> is<00:02:47.620> easier<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.190> pull<00:02:48.460> through

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
the engine is easier to pull through

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.890 
the engine is easier to pull through
compression<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:50.820> then<00:02:51.820> I'll<00:02:52.060> push<00:02:52.330> down<00:02:52.570> on

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
compression and then I'll push down on

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.870 
compression and then I'll push down on
the<00:02:53.050> intake<00:02:53.410> valve<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.830> little<00:02:54.040> bit<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.760> allow

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
the intake valve a little bit to allow

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.390 
the intake valve a little bit to allow
some<00:02:55.210> fuel<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.480> flow<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.650> it'll<00:02:57.100> be<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.220> little

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
some fuel to flow so it'll be a little

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.460 
some fuel to flow so it'll be a little
bit<00:02:57.550> easier<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:57.910> start<00:02:58.209> it's<00:02:59.140> sort<00:02:59.290> of<00:02:59.320> like

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
bit easier to start it's sort of like

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.360 
bit easier to start it's sort of like
choking<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.340> engine<00:03:01.680> okay<00:03:02.680> now<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.130> should<00:03:03.280> be

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
choking the engine okay now it should be

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:10.100 
choking the engine okay now it should be
easy<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:03.730> start<00:03:04.060> let's<00:03:04.630> see<00:03:04.720> what<00:03:04.810> happens

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.380 

there<00:03:11.110> you<00:03:11.260> go
