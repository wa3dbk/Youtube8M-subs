00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.180
 partly 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.820
 i 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.530
 i 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.530
 no tie because 77 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.130
 in this competition remember we can not 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.369
 have spaces in less than ten years 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.340
 we are then at seven points speak 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:22.470
 of seven points in red we continue with 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.470
 the manitos sources in flavor in 1 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.970
 or two 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.580
 3 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.689
 Four. Five 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.040
 clearly declares gentlemen gentlemen 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.470
 drivers that terrorist countries 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.190
 the lord of red stepped on the line when 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.190
 you mentioned he 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.400
 and this time it means invalid seconds 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.670
 behind the line 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.050
 I have reached him by the hand to put the 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.050
 Whales 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.600
 very well are fully protected by 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.110
 those beautiful spectacular keeps 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.060
 few each team have to continue 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.790
 because the first reaches 10 points 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.640
 climb 3 passengers and get a little closer 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.520
 more to the grand finale of this Thursday until 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.420
 today 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.420
 hear my teacher 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.250
 so 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:54.950
 I think it was red together for the 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:57.200
 rafa red car to 8.7 this is going 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:02.500
 approaching number 10 is worried 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.500
 for the love of God no longer okay 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:10.250
 the wave we started brother had 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.250
 I dared to get kneepad 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.100
 very well we keep up the red team 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.990
 one 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.390
 two 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.390
 3 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.459
 Four. Five 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.760
 Red 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:45.130
 7 points the green 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.130
 from the Canary Islands 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:55.709
 34 escardÃ³ de san francisco 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:58.920
 we're going to see how any 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:02.010
 howitzer could be a finalist this Thursday 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.219
 let's see what is the team that arrives 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.719
 to the final this Thursday of the last 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:10.829
 passenger if red wins there will be 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:13.939
 automatically won from weeks up 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:17.759
 and three passengers could go up 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:20.299
 automatically red would have won the 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.299
 picture above 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.060
 we effectively see that it touches us 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.500
 quite interesting since the team 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.810
 green at that time has three 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.880
 bus passengers is correct so that 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.770
 it was ready then we continue 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.380
 little hands to their places you already know 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.539
 think of the stripe essence attentive and 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.420
 I start telling a lot of luck to both 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:45.800
 this could be the last account 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.300
 he could 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.300
 for the two comets 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:55.659
 3 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:55.659
 everything to make maicon 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.910
 4 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:19.570
 care 7 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.080
 with very low 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.380
 January 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.480
 share communication 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.660
 9 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.660
 sloth 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:51.350
 eleven 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.350
 I had a good time after 12-13 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.979
 we go with the 1 then a could 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.820
 two 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.560
 3. 4 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.020
 at last 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.790
 one 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.440
 I know there are drops for red 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.330
