00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:05.580
 in engineering and 3 minutes as I think of it the apostle Peter is with a 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.320
 doubt the Lord how many times death of the German up to seven times 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:13.389
 to understand Peter's question, one needs to understand the meaning of the 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:14.609
 numbers in the bible 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:18.769
 the number 1 obviously means unit 2 is the number of witnesses 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:23.609
 necessary in anything loop 3 is a perfect testimony 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.569
 the minimum number of pro legs on the table 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:31.029
 for the inter is enough in itself number 3 god amon 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.690
 but there are also three 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:33.770
 three people 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.850
 Father Son and Holy Spirit 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.040
 I do not try to understand this god. 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.490
 four years ago he speaks of the symmetry of the four corners of the earth, for example 5 a 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.820
 responsibility is the action 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.409
 What you run with five fingers of the hand 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:50.310
 6 is a number 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.880
 which does not reach seven 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.170
 in full 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.350
 set and therefore is something complete it appears in profusion in the book of 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.180
 apocalypse completing the revelation of God 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.700
 so Pedro was asking if seven times 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.820
 the full number 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.090
 was enough to forgive someone jesus responds that he should forgive seventy 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.130
 times seven 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.540
 which is equivalent to forgiving 70 times always 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.400
 but this also is not a law as in the law of the Christian 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.140
 in the old testament God gave 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.340
 ten commandments and hundreds of gifts that only served to prove that we are 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.939
 unable to meet expectations 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.510
 far from the debt required by God 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.039
 Then God revealed His grace. 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.170
 let's forgive unconditionally 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.009
 what you'll see it's unfair to forgive someone 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.009
 without a repair without paying for what you did 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.150
 and that's what jesus came to do and pay for sins the sinner with covers and paid 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.100
 date that forgiveness can now be 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.500
 sandra breast 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.329
 once saved by grace that is a little and deserved Christian 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.060
 goes against my life still according to the will of God 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.020
 This will show that he is Saul by grace. 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.640
 he will forgive not for the obligation to receive something in return but because 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.270
 god made it run 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.679
 it was understood that the Christian does not come to impose laws or rules more by reflex 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:15.689
 he must reflect and with what he sees in Christ 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.859
 When I forgive, I do it because I was forgiven. 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.409
 When I give someone something I do it because Jesus opened it 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.219
 today everything for me 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:26.349
 when year 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.589
 It's because I went absurdly now. 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:32.589
 There's nothing I can do for God, He loves me more. 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:37.579
 He could not do anything my godmother for years. 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:38.519
 after all 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.729
 when he found 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:43.979
 he loved me and saved me and I saw how I was going 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:47.739
 I was a sinner Enemy file request complete ruin 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:51.579
 You will not be forgiven for loving God so much. 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.040
 you can only be forgiven for being much loved per month 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:03:00.299
 your life is impossible for you to pick up with your own means 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.420
 moved from the story 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.359
 in the next three minutes 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.019
 genish integrated into the truth because three minutes when grandson
