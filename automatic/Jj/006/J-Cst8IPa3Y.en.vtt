00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.950
 of new account of 2013 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.860
 a problem that many people have 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.330
 that always bobbin or but he stopped 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.330
 work this is the problem 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.960
 can not see here 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.970
 and the image 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.779
 Well, let's give that we can be the 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.779
 original improvement 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.450
 this is the error that seems to many 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.590
 when they play in friendly mode and we can 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.670
 tell you 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.340
 for me, there are missing files that 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.430
 needs to be played so that it 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:55.120
 play in a friendly 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:58.980
 the files what the pee edits 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.980
 Yes or if you need to descend 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.570
 sir, do not make mistakes 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.460
 the myth about 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:16.400
 about 2013 that is that you do not need 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.440
 the present is this one of properties that 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.409
 mark in soria reading the computable already 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.080
 be by the windows xp is totally 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.110
 false but I'm not insuring we're not 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.840
 because I have experience what they should 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.090
 do is download bis edith that about 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.190
 left description of the video should 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.770
 show the installation if you want to 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.409
 installation I will show you in company 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.140
 motels 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.149
 and that is what they must do for themselves 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.039
 one pesito you I'm so was the 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:50.549
 a student's horror the folder that 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.549
 clog the pc of this this and 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.990
 the ll point relay if you 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.990
 they want they have some markers they have 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.430
 those who hold two phases things for 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.370
 your process that I recommend you that is 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.770
 copy in this folder and paste it when 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.780
 your 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.910
 be in the position that I will leave 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.760
 description and disappear the fifth 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.080
 again you delete this folder and 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.560
 they stick theirs and then they're done and there 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.980
 they have the PC installed and the honor goes 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.980
 to dissapear 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.560
 you still have the same 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.739
 problem 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.330
 or you who enter the production 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.330
 only when you had to finish they will be 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.840
 in the patch and he keeps saying that 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.690
 search stopped working and you are 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.060
 about to give up and 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.819
 uninstall the progress they have faith 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.260
 that the solution is optimal well again 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.730
 to the folder where your 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.730
 project what would not be with me 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.739
 and the manager run as administrator 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.120
 that this is for good good eyes 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.569
 windows 7 and windows 8 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.569
 and 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.600
 we enter we fight we have deputies 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.690
 ministers we give him yes and here they are going to 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.390
 appear this mind this tab does not 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.400
 we give here and we give the second 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.360
 option that would be that 2013 point we demand 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.640
 to touch and let's accept we close 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.450
 we come back and then we give it to the border 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.220
 run as administrator or open for 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.140
 good team and we will appear this 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:39.690
 tab then I do not think so everything is 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:42.420
 market stop here here here and here it 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.520
 I recommend them that they said 14 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.810
 and if you have it under them 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.180
 I recommend that you generate almost I have a 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.500
 low web computer does not have much 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.380
 graphic but they're fed up that you see the 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.910
 very bad extension court is going to see 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.120
 perfectly the court and if you have a 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.160
 normal computer I recommend here 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:03.270
 this for him he left that I recommended them 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.990
 see it from gm 1280 x 720 so that the super 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:09.710
 wilson sugar look 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.900
 h of you and I was and now I try in 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:16.540
 open again from now and they get out 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:18.970
 or not on the desk and that's it 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.480
 well here I had the tutorial I hope 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.620
 that those tastes and what you do not have 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.080
 put also what would 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.410
 show them the installer this is the 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.510
 binder 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.850
 we click here and good to appear 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.460
 these two files what they are going to do is 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:39.080
 double click 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:42.229
 and they will install it in the folder I would 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.150
 I said a little bit that they need 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.729
 remove the server kit the product 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.000
 Sugar that brings the PC from the folder 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:53.630
 preceded the psd icon and the ere of the 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.130
 point that they eliminate all that and if 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:03.789
 they want to do it if they have tools 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:03.789
 on the desk 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:13.810
 and after that they make inscriptions 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:21.490
 I showed that first they want to be 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:21.490
 and then wonders 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.650
