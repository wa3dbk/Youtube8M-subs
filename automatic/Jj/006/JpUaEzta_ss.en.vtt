00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.700
[HAWAIIAN LANGUAGE]

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.950
Each year, the world's top big wave surfers
gather at Waimea Bay to remember Eddie Aikau,

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.070
a
Hawaiian surfer and lifeguard who gave his

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.640
life to save the crew of the ill-fated 1978
Hokulea

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.990
voyage. The Quiksilver In Memory of Eddie
Aikau surf competition honors this legendary

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.090
waterman. For North Shore local, Makua Rothman,
this event holds special meaning.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.059
My first event was made over here; I was born.
So, I've pretty much been to every one. I

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.480
don't
remember the first few, but I always remembered,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.840
you know, the music, the food, the circle,
all the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.860
surfers coming together, and just a great
feeling of being a big wave rider when you're

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.440
at that event.
My favorite memory, personal memory from the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.690
Eddie Aikau was getting caught inside with
Andy

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.239
Irons, and it happened to be a really, really
big set that was gonna close out the whole

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.000
Waimea Bay,
like one of the biggest sets of the day. And

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.210
Kai Garcia came in and picked Andy up, and
left me.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.790
And they got out the back, and I got cleaned
out by a closeout set. But when I got out

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.420
the back, I
was laughing so hard. Now, Andy's not around,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.610
and you know, we miss him very much. That
has

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.100
to be my favorite memory of the Eddie Aikau.
I remember going down to all the contests,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.270
the
Eddie Aikau contests. My dad was actually

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.580
one of the founders of the Eddie Aikau event.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.000
The first contest was at Sunset. It was the
hui's idea to do it. We brought it to Bob

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.979
McKnight at
Quiksilver, and they took it from there to

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.330
Waimea and it evolved.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.920
As someone that might have a voice with some
of the kids, and nowadays with the music and

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.520
stuff,
I really want to stress that, you know, remember

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.130
your culture, remember your language, remember
how it is to embody or embrace the Hawaiian

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.770
spirit.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.310
The contest is a celebration of his life.
A lot of people put a lot of effort into it,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.540
like George
Downing, who's a key person there that has

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.549
kept the thing going with a lot of integrity
that it could

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.640
have lost.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.869
Some of us definitely carry on some stuff,
like Eddie. I mean, we'll never be as great

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.509
as him, I
don't think. He's one of the greatest Hawaiians

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.009
that ever lived, but you know, we try our
best to

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.540
carry on some of the values and things that
he wanted to push forward in his life.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.180
This is Kuulei Quintal from Waialua High and
Intermediate School, for HIKI NÅŒ.
