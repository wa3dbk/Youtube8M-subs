00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.460
 He is currently the strongest in series 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:16.770
 tractor produced worldwide the square 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:19.870
 620 of casey h 6 192ps maximum power 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.450
 nearly 3000 newton meters maximum 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.440
 torque and up to 32 tons 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.500
 total weight 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.760
 that's just three of the almost 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.010
 Dizzying corner data of the new 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.420
 tugs from fargo north dakota usa 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.940
 had the new international 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.970
 exhaust standard Tier 4 final 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.100
 and sent three new quads at the end of 2013 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.010
 raab and steiger kink handlebars into the race 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.900
 Outwardly, little has happened under the 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.280
 bonnet, on the other hand, is the one or the other 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.160
 others came to it 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.950
 So got the cursor 13 engine from Fiat 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.630
 powertrain a second intercooler 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.220
 missed and the existing one 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.160
 Cooling circuit for the two turbochargers 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.230
 was around a heat exchanger and his 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.320
 second cooling circuit with separate 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.979
 pump adds to the exhaust gas emissions 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.200
 throttle 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.900
 where the oxidation surface in the diesel 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.000
 Oxidation catalyst increases so that 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.040
 the adblue solution implemented more efficiently 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.299
 becomes 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.880
 as before, the engine comes without 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.950
 exhaust gas recirculation and particle filter off 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.500
 However, now was a sputtering catalyst 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.880
 according to manufacturer, the integrated 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.190
 Consumption by two grams each 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.580
 kilowatt hour lower than when 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.380
 predecessor quarter 600 with it could 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.979
 the tank contents at still 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.770
 be left to the state in 1881 liters 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.049
 a gear sets casey h in the 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.570
 new kink handlebar generation on the 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.640
 Japanese mechanical engineer Fuji the 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.860
 already since the introduction of the 1000 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.220
 series at staiger at the beginning of the 80s 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.320
 years the powershift packages delivered that 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.720
 as robust 16 times two times 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.580
 Full load manual could be in the main 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.570
 workspace a little bit better 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.330
 be matched 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.250
 however, the 12.9 liters has six 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.049
 countries have enough reserves around 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.880
 neatly into the press down to 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.400
 become 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.070
 37 km 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.260
 End speed are in there 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.260
 automatic switching and with introduction 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.640
 the new models also the automatic 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.740
 Productivity Management cpm 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.650
 the scroll wheel at the multi 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.550
 controller is controlled 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.890
 this gives a top speed 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.350
 to which the gearbox the 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.780
 Translation adapts accordingly 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.069
 Engine speed is still as a hand 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.439
 Gas specified with the multi controller 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.719
 little has happened in the cabin 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.010
 For the first time, a seat can be added for an extra charge 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:41.139
 Ventilation can be ordered 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.120
 as in the luxury equipment with the 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.879
 but legendary red leather seats 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.040
 already included 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.930
 new is an activation button for that 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.030
 car guide steering system at multi 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.939
 controller previously in the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.170
 Armrest was needed to encompass 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.569
 so not anymore 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.090
 the view to the front is surprisingly good 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.040
 despite the wide bonnet and the 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.010
 again enlarged exhaust 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.230
 End pipes to the rear is the view 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.450
 as before restricted under handlebars and 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.189
 train can be commuted when coupling 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.290
 Devices only after feeling and experience 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.159
 or by means of a reversing camera 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.129
 control 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.079
 The driving comfort has changed with the 2011 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.280
 introduced cab suspension already 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.379
 to improve something 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.650
 it still works on lanes 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.310
 street and right at the front yard 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.250
 bumpy too 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.879
 the contract is definitely not for 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.370
 sissies 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:36.129
 but that too makes a legend 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.439
 of traction in things especially in 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.659
 lower speed range is the 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:41.079
 articulated giant still the measure of all 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.629
 things 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.609
 even if the concept is like everyone else 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.609
 tractors in addition to a series of 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:51.340
 advantages also disadvantages runs the 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:54.939
 full post to the case ihk truck 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.450
 In 620 they let him traction issue march 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:00.120
 april 2014 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.120
