the sheath it's probably not the

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
but after looking at it is actually if I

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.570 
but after looking at it is actually if I
get<00:01:34.410> a<00:01:34.440> better<00:01:34.650> holster<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.190> it<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.340> wouldn't

will say is the grips on it it fits my
fists<00:01:47.520> pretty<00:01:47.820> well<00:01:48.090> I'm<00:01:48.660> a<00:01:48.870> decently<00:01:49.560> big<00:01:49.830> guy

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
fists pretty well I'm a decently big guy

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.700 
fists pretty well I'm a decently big guy
but<00:01:50.400> it<00:01:51.030> has<00:01:51.210> some<00:01:51.450> sharp<00:01:51.750> edges<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.410> it<00:01:52.440> it's

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
but it has some sharp edges on it it's

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.290 
but it has some sharp edges on it it's
not<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.040> most<00:01:53.190> comfortable<00:01:53.520> thing<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.180> can

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
not the most comfortable thing you can

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.590 
not the most comfortable thing you can
always<00:01:54.390> get<00:01:54.570> some<00:01:55.790> sandpaper<00:01:56.790> something<00:01:57.480> and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
always get some sandpaper something and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.810 
always get some sandpaper something and
narrow<00:01:57.990> down<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.380> edge<00:01:58.560> has<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.370> little

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
narrow down the edge has a little

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.660 
narrow down the edge has a little
retention<00:02:00.780> strap<00:02:01.710> on<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:01.980> so<00:02:02.220> I<00:02:02.280> suppose<00:02:02.550> you

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
retention strap on it so I suppose you

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.770 
retention strap on it so I suppose you
could<00:02:02.790> even<00:02:02.910> put<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> end<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.660> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
could even put it on the end of the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.590

throw for throwing knives in my opinion

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.970 
throw for throwing knives in my opinion
that's<00:03:22.640> kind<00:03:22.939> of<00:03:22.970> where<00:03:23.120> I<00:03:23.150> like<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.980> throw

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.349 
that's kind of where I like to throw
them<00:03:25.099> because<00:03:25.310> then<00:03:25.430> I<00:03:25.519> can<00:03:25.670> take<00:03:25.819> a<00:03:25.879> handle

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
them because then I can take a handle

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.199 
them because then I can take a handle
stance<00:03:26.689> or<00:03:27.049> a<00:03:27.400> blade<00:03:28.400> stance<00:03:28.819> when<00:03:29.090> I'm
