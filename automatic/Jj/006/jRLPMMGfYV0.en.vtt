00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:10.570
 bitcoin is a new digital currency and 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.130
 Perhaps this is the best form of money in our 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.539
 bitcoin history is important because 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.720
 most of us don't understand money well 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.670
 and the most difficult for perception properties 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.690
 money is that money has always been and 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.580
 remain 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.029
 accounting tool people often 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.830
 interested in what money backed up and 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.109
 the truth is that money is not backed up 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.449
 nothing and never been backed up 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:36.789
 the euro is not supported by anything concrete 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:38.949
 and all other currencies in the world and gold 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:42.190
 if nato has gone too nothing 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.809
 backed up by some believe that gold 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.859
 valuable because we make of it 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.449
 decorations but in fact the opposite is true 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:52.299
 gold is valuable because it is small a 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.399
 since its not enough she has become the best 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:57.699
 accounting tool for the last 5000 years 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.769
 so bitcoin is not the worst tool 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.690
 accounting 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:06.760
 than gold its amount too 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.570
 limited to the network will be a maximum of 21 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.360
 million bitcoins 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.710
 he is even limited gold but 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.870
 historic compromise formed 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.630
 between things that keep efficient 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.280
 capital for example gold and things 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.940
 which is convenient to pay 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.280
 for example for example portuguese escudos 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.080
 american dollar air mile american 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.210
 airlines facebook credits 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.510
 it is convenient to pay them but how 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.860
 capital repository they don't work a 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.330
 effective capital repositories the same 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.160
 gold inconvenient to pay and 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.200
 bitcoin is the first ever sample 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.460
 universal capital repository and 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.390
 payment instrument 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.980
 which are more convenient than all predecessors and 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.220
 it's hard to debate about bitcoin without 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.630
 understanding the concept of money and the most 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.150
 easy way to understand money 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.890
 learn the history of money anthropologists 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.900
 agree that there was not one 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.430
 tribe not to mention civilization 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.350
 which would be based on natural 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.420
 exchange he's a barter no none 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.190
 evidence of barter was not but for us 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.229
 it's a paradox because at school they said that 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.060
 first was barter then we came up 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.819
 money because barter has become too 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.590
 complicated so here's the barter wasn't this one 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.110
 from the myths about money 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.849
 then the question is an anthropologist well 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.959
 let's say how then we traded up to 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.980
 appearance of money if there was no velvet 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.200
 it turns out that there was no trade 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.110
 trade was and she was active as 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.440
 it was well let's say a hunter from ours 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.840
 the tribe killed the buffaloes I walk up to him and 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.720
 I can tell me a piece of meat 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.060
 he says no or good avensis hold 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.890
 here is your meat then you come to 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.650
 ask him if you can give me a piece of meat 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:46.269
 He says well, take it and in fact 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.360
 it was necessary to remember that we should 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.709
 to other people and what they owe us then 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.390
 someone will approach me will tell you to 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.670
 listen give me firewood i'm burning of course 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.940
 I need you to remember firewood 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.970
 owes this man a little and what he 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.470
 a bit should I needed to walk with 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.610
 account book in memory 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.290
 who owes us and who we owe it 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.239
 very subjective system often 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.840
 debts did not return or returned 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:16.299
 but not both sides were pleased then 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.880
 about 25 thousand years ago one very 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.000
 smart man came up with a new technology 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.470
 which has become very popular man 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.389
 does not fit says listen give me firewood 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.220
 and the answer is good, here's your firewood 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:30.519
 says let's try something new 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.829
 here are a few beads I say a 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.810
 Why do I need these beads I do not need beads I 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.310
 I don't want them , because that's not the point. 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.489
 we will use beads like 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.530
 an objective tribal record book instead 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.919
 so that everyone remembers that they should 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.049
 it will be remembered for us 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:48.579
 objective debt book this 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.319
 it was so convenient technology that 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.959
 she stuck and after a couple of thousand years 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.700
 almost no tribes or civilization left 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.919
 without own objective account 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.130
 some of them were shells 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:01.090
 wampum in others salt in third is stones 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.209
 or beads 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.769
 but the main thing is that this form of objective 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.049
 debt accounting has become the norm 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:11.139
 anthropologists also concluded that 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:13.630
 describing in detail the habitat of the tribe 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:16.209
 you can guess what will be objective 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.880
 money for these people because it 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.950
 always material with six properties from 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.409
 which is the most important 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.730
 scarcity is logical if he is not 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.650
 limited if we on at 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.400
 used tree leaves then you can 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.170
 it would create debt yourself on an even 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.580
 place it would be bad it would be 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.760
 bad accounting tool is another 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.470
 wear resistance requirement if material 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.390
 decays or deteriorates it will not 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.540
 store information it should be 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.550
 divisible mobile recognizable and measurable 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.920
 and this system worked until the period 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.660
 about 5,000 years ago when geography 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.760
 trade began to grow and began 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.800
 trade between tribes from different tribes 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.900
 there were different accounting tools that 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.900
 meant the impossibility of trading therefore 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:03.100
 about 5,000 years ago gold became 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:06.460
 first universal accounting tool 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.100
 debt is gold because its 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.840
 all there was little it was the main quality 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.030
 but besides that she was very 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.510
 wear resistant relatively divisible 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.700
 mobile recognizable and measurable exactly 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.350
 so the last 5,000 years gold has been 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.150
 for us is the best repository of capital 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.010
 it's amazing that today if you want 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.310
 leave 5,000 dollars to my daughter 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.440
 not even daughters or granddaughters of their great 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.160
 great great great great granddaughter through forty 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.480
 generations 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.250
 in 900 years we will not be able to do it 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.680
 if you leave them in dollars they will eat 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.660
 inflation is no such long-lived value 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.330
 papers the only way we know 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.510
 save capital for so long it 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.220
 buy gold for five thousand dollars 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.130
 lock it in the vault and leave the key 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.830
 this man after 900 years is amazing 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.860
 that in the 21st century this is the best answer 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.540
 this is why bitcoin is so important for the first time. 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.350
 in five thousand years we found a tool 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:04.600
 which is superior to gold in all six 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:06.640
 its characteristics are much less than 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.920
 gold in the world will not be more than twenty 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:12.820
 one million bitcoins it is much 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.930
 divisible gold every bitcoin consists of 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.210
 million units 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.880
 which are called satoshi he is much 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.250
 more divisible mobile stand i can 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.040
 call skype from here from new york 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.110
 man in jakarta I'll see him in 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.360
 real time to hear and he me too 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.800
 will see and hear this amazing 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.290
 technological achievement 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.140
 but if after the call I want to send 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.790
 he djakarta 1 cent which lies with me 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:40.150
 in the pocket that I easily gave 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:41.650
 we personally will not succeed in 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.420
 twenty first century impossible 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.550
 send 1 cent to jakarta 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.950
 Firstly shipping will cost 50 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:51.130
 cents second surgery will take a week 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:53.320
 and in the third there is no suitable system 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.180
 bitcoin solves this problem with it 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.160
 You can easily send jakarta 1 cent 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.990
 or 1 million dollars and to bitcoins 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.270
 can attach to myself with or 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:04.050
 email and send them to 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:06.250
 real time to the other end of the world and 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.960
 payment is very easy to check by 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.750
 getting bitcoin will know it right away 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.640
 that he is real ie he possesses 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.890
 all the properties of excellent digital 

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:18.450
 accounting tools and so he 

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:18.450
 perhaps the best form of money in history
