00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:25.900
 Something every year 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:28.250
 More and more I'd think that it is too hot or rather steadily southward warming 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.619
 I wonder everyone something something 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.350
 I have not heard that the story of saying "I'm sorry" 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.930
 It's okay, so far 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.220

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.250

 Well I do not know what happens seasonally 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.810
 It feels like it, but I feel like I want to do my best and do my best without losing to that heat. 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.720

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.720

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.450
 This is it 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.770
 I think I will introduce this 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:21.480
 Horror was also leg purchase pull the vortex of it is all of you LOL 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.650
 That's why vocalist Oh no that house 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:30.950
 It's already a feeling of crazy dance 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:33.530
 Deetto Well, people can be seen, or rather as you might guess is I think that can be seen but this that 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.880
 Thing called vocal effector 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.320
 Vocal effector Ney 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.680
 so 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:45.400
 It is these things 8 snow each Well also Well 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.450
 Yes, something heavy It's heavy 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.380
 Hmm 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.280
 Heide also a liquid crystal 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.800
 Huh 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.830
 Of liquid crystal 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:59.150
 Super high grade 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:02.530
 Is what some in to the in Yes It is monochromatic display 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.530
 So basically 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:13.430
 The first is recording as a big big application with two 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:19.210
 Because vocals are voice live in recording 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:22.660
 It will be an effect of vocals , so it's time to sing 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:26.069
 Well it is your favorite thing as either a previously put several types 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:30.720
 For example, sometimes songs and songs 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:34.200
 It sometimes becomes Toka Raj Oppoi voice singing and clanging 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.200
 It may be time or not b Melo 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.780
 I would like to go to Sabi 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.830
 Such a pattern 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.200
 And 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.440
 The other it is if the other is this 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.640
 Though I do not know it in the process well by foot 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.730
 It is a feeling that you can easily 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.720
 Yes 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.940
 In after 8 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.290
 It is a recording and live even live 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.380
 Oh dear 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.700
 At least 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:11.010
 In that vocalist person 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:15.660
 It's a concert live with the correct pa 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.330
 It is good for people who are stuck with me properly but rappers 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.820
 club's 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.690
 Not you or was already so much careless in Toka or the air Baku level Toka wrapper and a small box 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.760
 Is it 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:33.740
 I think that if there is no such a thing in front of me wonder what 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:37.319
 It is totally different if there is such a thing by vocalist or idiot 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:43.170
 For example, if there is something like acoustic guitar playing and talking 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:44.120
 I want to be seen you in this Anybody sweet after all the difference at all 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.930
 so 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:51.310
 Than you will suddenly that professional Ppoku If there is that these things 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.319
 Would like to introduce Well by all means these things because 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.910
 I will tell you today that 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:03.400
 I want to think you Heide and 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:07.110
 In fact, the number of turns is 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.280
 Come true that it is 200 child 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.210
 I'm really into it 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.840
 I am really in it 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.639
 Oh well I counted and I counted as one also is written 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.180
 8 years 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.560
 If it contains only 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.150
 Yes 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.200
 I wonder if it looks good 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.840
 Many times 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:34.240
 Because channel of 234 units or last blank 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:37.330
 It means that there are 134 pieces in 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:42.160
 Migration is actually in 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:44.790
 Because I think it is the best to try to experience 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.310
 Or let's actually doing Yes 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:51.410
 To in 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.410
