00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.160
 how to cheer 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
 I read bed as the character 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.400
 the first that we have to do 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.810
 have a drawing 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.600
 obviously 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.140
 then for that 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.550
 Let's do 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.550
 one piece yes 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.860
 a very simple basic drawing 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.860
 I remember that you do not have to overturn us 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.270
 the motto of this part but everything was again 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.110
 dy was left 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.110
 and we're going to start to draw the ccoo diner 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.440
 because he is part of the association when death counts the thing goes to 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.510
 corner 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.640
 now let's moderate 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.390
 ace 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.280
 this movement p 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.280
 i do not draw the other part of the h 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.329
 ecopark to draw a necessary evil 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.129
 oo a tablet right now I'm looking for treaties 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.430
 inés in two d 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.430
 It is a strong arm 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.540
 then she in osaka our statute 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.380
 I have caused for barreda visited park the caribbean humacao are widened little 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:33.559
 since we have them 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:38.259
 we are going to choose the color of the color that we want to be painted, I watch them 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.959
 cursor 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.609
 earth and sports 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.349
 and we are going to paint 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.349
 ago so 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:49.569
 not very wide awaits us is that I go out a lot 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.189
 and now with what we leave 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.159
 in another through tunnels I will teach how to put shadows and these costs 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:03:01.209
 is going to select everything and press eight to turn into a symbol to be 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.359
 a customer peliculeros to put names perasso 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.079
 we enter the arm 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.909
 i do not know what you think if I lived this in two layers x control to cut 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:13.809
 new stage 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:17.119
 and control v to paste 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:20.119
 well our arm there looks pretty good 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.739
 i do not think that basically hold lorenzo knows quite well 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.959
 now as an animal or question the diary 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.300
 let's see section to this tool that the form is released 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.490
 but not to cover mostly but to be able to pivot 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:40.359
 this martino has to be here 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:41.330
 where 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.700
 and days according to the bone technique 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.289
 I do not know if they remember Chinese percent and turia 

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:50.470
 this is the point d in each gender and hunger 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.499
 He cited efe in this together 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.499
 and there they can see with pogo wounds or 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.259
 frankly there is no person 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:02.659
 today there is a detail that I am going to solve that for example if they have noticed 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.799
 when I move this 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.730
 this is rubbed in May so I'm going to press 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:08.879
 f 8 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.949
 and what power can one name 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.819
 and here this 8 names 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.609
 on the recommendation that being a character do the same thing 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.409
 thing that is so they avoid problems of lost xl 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.309
 or that part or have to move the night 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:27.279
 Lets put 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:30.279
 a frame the decade of 2010 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.539
 I do not know this hug side shakira a little bit 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.729
 remove the lime twig so that your most natural movements 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.499
 that is, softer 

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:46.300
 and although this house of the hawks 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.020
 yes we do this creates demo interpolation in this growing pressure of 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.699
 muimenta the flash cc 4 6 and 5 creates classic interposition 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:57.599
 and once we have it high 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.190
 we want it to fall 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.939
 twenty 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:03.409
 down 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:04.550
 to her 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.770
 two frames 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.110
 then what are we going to do after this one for the frame to do 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.379
 he hoarded jo let's tour this 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.860
 according to the pivot they were going to see how 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.379
 segi to perfectly now sows the terror to fall depends how cocker 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:23.589
 concept wind character so that does not happen much 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.630
 low cook said nava 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.630
 but we are going to try to accommodate the east 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.159
 there it looks pretty good 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:35.550
 no longer know everything 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.550
 and there it has a quite natural movement in the arm 

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:42.809
 i nothing simply seems to me that 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.919
 been pretty good 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.339
 Here you can see a 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:50.559
 A lot of options of what is the movement is home 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.370
 well then this one can already see that 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:06:00.159
 inkoom the sahara alter things a lot of acceleration can see it 

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:03.330
 then when little 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.199
 between being different 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:07.060
 but I want to leave it 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.400
 guevara norm 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.400
 so that al qaeda another corner 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.150
 now advice then 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.400
 let's go sometimes to one 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.400
 they were going to see that we have an error 'at some point 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.069
 with this decade 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.569
 the g8 is not separated to create a keyframe 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:32.039
 and he knows 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:33.129
 here 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:36.629
 it would be nothing but there is a part that there is never a black line 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:40.219
 only July 7 and unintentionally twelve articles 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:44.970
 we select father to the filter and an illuminated filter 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:48.779
 crazy house black color 

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:51.830
 the intention of your beautiful as much as we can 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.210
 and said chan 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.729
 we have a full edge on our arm 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:59.729
 They hunt them down or about 3 

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:03.189
 for lump mor of a little more than two 

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:06.189
 they were going to see hours 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:11.419
 his excellent photo deia 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.349
 my mistake 

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:15.889
 in the spokesman or accidents 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:17.810
 adrienne bailón hairstyle 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.779
 everything with the 9 hs 4 it seems to me that the cease will to copy it 

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:23.840
 and what to give 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.879
 and sometimes and if kobe west too 

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:29.879
 and he put you on the street here we want 

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:32.819
 or miller tastings that 

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:33.939
 or a small 

00:07:33.939 --> 00:07:36.369
 a misunderstanding said with this 

00:07:36.369 --> 00:07:37.199
 and in 

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:39.399
 and those our arm as you can see 

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:41.599
 with a coarse january perfect 

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:47.039
 that always adapts to the movements then how was it necessary to planters 

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:48.800
 exterior 

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.889
 yes no more in the interior but I can do this if you want 

00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:55.069
 That one who 

00:07:55.069 --> 00:07:59.169
 a simple animation can live several pieces and this becomes more 

00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:04.300
 complex but well this basic animation of rows I hope you have them 

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.259
 liked tutorial soon more hurts
