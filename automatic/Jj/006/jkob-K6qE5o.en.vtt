we can go from 24 and this goes all the
way<00:01:15.600> up<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.860> 720<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.159> absolutely<00:01:17.909> massive

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
way up to 720 so it's absolutely massive

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
flash all the different functions on

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.350 
flash all the different functions on
here<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.640> screen<00:01:26.640> will<00:01:26.850> actually<00:01:27.150> come<00:01:27.330> out

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
here the screen will actually come out

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.679 
here the screen will actually come out
so<00:01:27.869> I'll<00:01:28.829> come<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.250> load<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.610> different<00:01:29.939> in

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
so I'll come on a load of different in

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.420 
so I'll come on a load of different in
change<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> load<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.650> different<00:01:32.040> ways<00:01:32.189> I

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
change like a load of different ways I

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.340 
change like a load of different ways I
mean<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.270> actually<00:01:33.720> better<00:01:33.930> than<00:01:34.049> some

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
mean this is actually better than some

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.370 
mean this is actually better than some
of<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.560> other<00:01:34.680> bridge<00:01:35.400> cameras<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.900> zoom<00:01:37.170> is

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
of the other bridge cameras the zoom is

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.219 
of the other bridge cameras the zoom is
actually<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.950> lens<00:01:38.250> itself<00:01:38.810> so<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:39.990> a

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
actually on the lens itself so it's a

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.420 
actually on the lens itself so it's a
step<00:01:40.740> closer<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> DSLR<00:01:42.770> we<00:01:43.770> just<00:01:43.950> open<00:01:44.280> this
