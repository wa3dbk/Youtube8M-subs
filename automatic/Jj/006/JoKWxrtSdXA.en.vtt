anything I come so far out soft and I
came<00:00:29.720> off<00:00:29.929> with<00:00:30.199> home<00:00:30.439> so<00:00:31.189> that's<00:00:31.609> like<00:00:31.820> a<00:00:31.880> show

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
came off with home so that's like a show

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.420 
came off with home so that's like a show
me<00:00:32.480> the<00:00:32.570> North<00:00:32.719> Pole<00:00:32.960> unless<00:00:33.350> I<00:00:34.449> had<00:00:35.449> it<00:00:35.570> before

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
me the North Pole unless I had it before

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.009 
me the North Pole unless I had it before
you<00:00:37.430> gotta<00:00:37.640> be<00:00:37.699> straight<00:00:38.269> lookin<00:00:38.750> straight

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
you gotta be straight lookin straight

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.290 
you gotta be straight lookin straight
over<00:00:39.440> and<00:00:39.739> I'm<00:00:40.220> not<00:00:40.399> doing<00:00:40.550> it<00:00:40.760> right<00:00:40.879> now<00:00:40.940> hard

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
over and I'm not doing it right now hard

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.389 
over and I'm not doing it right now hard
to<00:00:41.540> try<00:00:41.780> it<00:00:41.839> again

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.360 

okay<00:00:47.210> I<00:00:47.480> got<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:48.230> North<00:00:48.410> Pole<00:00:48.710> again<00:00:49.039> now<00:00:49.340> I

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
okay I got the North Pole again now I

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.229 
okay I got the North Pole again now I
come<00:00:49.730> out

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
come out

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.840 
come out
we've<00:00:51.020> got<00:00:51.290> us<00:00:51.469> to<00:00:51.649> get<00:00:51.829> this<00:00:52.040> to<00:00:52.250> work<00:00:52.280> I<00:00:52.640> think

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
we've got us to get this to work I think

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.910 
we've got us to get this to work I think
you<00:00:52.969> have<00:00:53.059> to<00:00:53.210> be<00:00:53.329> directly<00:00:53.960> over<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:54.710> North

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
you have to be directly over the North

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.430 
you have to be directly over the North
Pole<00:00:55.250> and<00:00:55.579> there<00:00:56.000> comes<00:00:56.360> a<00:00:56.600> forms<00:00:57.019> the<00:00:57.199> black

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
Pole and there comes a forms the black

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.869 
Pole and there comes a forms the black
hole<00:00:57.769> on<00:00:58.760> Google<00:00:59.239> Earth<00:01:00.339> which<00:01:01.339> means<00:01:01.640> is

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
hole on Google Earth which means is

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.430 
hole on Google Earth which means is
that's<00:01:02.000> probably<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.570> time<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:02.989> program<00:01:03.409> is

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
that's probably the time the program is

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.040 
that's probably the time the program is
the<00:01:03.739> game<00:01:04.220> of<00:01:04.369> you<00:01:04.460> going<00:01:04.970> look<00:01:05.239> but<00:01:05.540> that<00:01:05.780> is

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
the game of you going look but that is

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.290 
the game of you going look but that is
the<00:01:06.470> whole<00:01:06.649> get<00:01:07.460> closer<00:01:07.729> to<00:01:08.119> it

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
it starts to come in I don't know if

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.020 
it starts to come in I don't know if
anybody<00:01:11.659> else<00:01:11.720> has<00:01:11.930> discovered<00:01:12.050> this<00:01:12.820> come<00:01:13.820> on

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
now what I like to see is what straight

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.180 
now what I like to see is what straight
above<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.640> North<00:01:49.850> Pole<00:01:50.590> so<00:01:51.590> I<00:01:51.620> got<00:01:51.830> my<00:01:51.980> black

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
above the North Pole so I got my black

00:01:52.190 --> 00:02:01.010 
above the North Pole so I got my black
hole<00:01:54.010> that<00:01:55.010> goes

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.120 

gets<00:02:01.560> closer<00:02:01.920> closer<00:02:02.790> closer<00:02:03.680> it's<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.920> red

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
gets closer closer closer it's the red

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.900 
gets closer closer closer it's the red
hole<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.960> red<00:02:07.200> hole<00:02:07.440> is<00:02:07.700> can't<00:02:08.700> get<00:02:08.820> any

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
hole the red hole is can't get any

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.580 
hole the red hole is can't get any
closer<00:02:09.119> than<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.420> when<00:02:09.810> we<00:02:09.960> can<00:02:10.200> they<00:02:10.350> can

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
closer than that when we can they can

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
closer than that when we can they can
maybe<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.490> can<00:02:11.730> hope<00:02:12.630> this<00:02:12.840> for<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.580> so<00:02:14.580> I

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.890 
maybe you can hope this for you so I
don't<00:02:14.730> have<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.060> type<00:02:15.270> lens<00:02:15.570> I'll<00:02:15.750> get<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
don't have to type lens I'll get a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.199 
don't have to type lens I'll get a
campaign<00:02:16.530> but<00:02:16.770> that's<00:02:16.950> Mercer<00:02:17.700> one<00:02:18.510> zero<00:02:19.320> one

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
about the pinwheel galaxy etc so now you

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.040 
about the pinwheel galaxy etc so now you
know<00:02:29.340> what's<00:02:29.940> right<00:02:30.150> above<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.570> North<00:02:30.780> Pole

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
know what's right above the North Pole

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.320 
know what's right above the North Pole
according<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.590> Google<00:02:31.890> Earth<00:02:32.100> is<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.790> pin

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
according to Google Earth is the pin

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.110 
according to Google Earth is the pin
