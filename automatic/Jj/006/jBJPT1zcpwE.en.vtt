00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.089 

no<00:00:09.719> doubt<00:00:09.960> that<00:00:10.200> one<00:00:10.410> of<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.650> major<00:00:10.920> problems

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
no doubt that one of the major problems

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.930 
no doubt that one of the major problems
in<00:00:11.700> golf<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.750> slice<00:00:13.340> so<00:00:14.340> let's<00:00:14.580> look<00:00:14.670> at<00:00:14.910> a

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
in golf is the slice so let's look at a

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.800 
in golf is the slice so let's look at a
typical<00:00:15.529> slicer<00:00:16.529> scenario<00:00:17.310> here<00:00:17.609> okay<00:00:18.510> first

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
typical slicer scenario here okay first

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.230 
typical slicer scenario here okay first
we<00:00:19.109> would<00:00:19.289> have<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.529> weak<00:00:19.859> grip<00:00:20.220> which<00:00:20.580> produces

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
we would have a weak grip which produces

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.320 
we would have a weak grip which produces
an<00:00:21.390> open<00:00:21.779> clubface<00:00:22.109> at<00:00:22.500> impact<00:00:23.119> number<00:00:24.119> one

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
an open clubface at impact number one

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.250 
an open clubface at impact number one
problem<00:00:25.400> second<00:00:26.400> we<00:00:27.000> would<00:00:27.210> see<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.510> slicer

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
problem second we would see the slicer

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.240 
problem second we would see the slicer
having<00:00:29.039> an<00:00:29.330> open<00:00:30.330> alignment<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.529> for<00:00:32.219> a

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
having an open alignment so for a

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.270 
having an open alignment so for a
right-handed<00:00:32.850> person<00:00:33.600> aligned<00:00:34.320> way<00:00:34.950> left

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
right-handed person aligned way left

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.130 
right-handed person aligned way left
with<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.610> shoulders<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.420> hips<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.930> this

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
with the shoulders and the hips and this

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.569 
with the shoulders and the hips and this
is<00:00:37.350> not<00:00:37.620> good<00:00:38.180> okay<00:00:39.559> so<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.770> would<00:00:40.980> be<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
is not good okay so that would be the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.580 
is not good okay so that would be the
two<00:00:42.000> most<00:00:42.030> common<00:00:42.750> things<00:00:42.989> we'd<00:00:43.170> seen<00:00:43.410> their

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
two most common things we'd seen their

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.209 
two most common things we'd seen their
set<00:00:43.860> up<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.660> counteract<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.739> want<00:00:46.980> to

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
set up so to counteract that we want to

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.209 
set up so to counteract that we want to
get<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.940> perfect<00:00:48.239> grip<00:00:48.690> or<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> better<00:00:49.110> grip<00:00:49.500> two

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
get a perfect grip or a better grip two

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.150 
get a perfect grip or a better grip two
knuckles<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.910> stronger<00:00:51.570> okay<00:00:52.559> on<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.739> strong

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
knuckles so stronger okay on the strong

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.660 
knuckles so stronger okay on the strong
side<00:00:53.510> then<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:54.719> want<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.170> aim<00:00:55.520> parallel<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
side then we want to aim parallel the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.279 
side then we want to aim parallel the
target<00:00:57.059> line<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.719> my<00:00:57.840> target<00:00:58.109> line

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
target line so this is my target line

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.389 
target line so this is my target line
here<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.399> want<00:00:59.670> my<00:00:59.789> feet<00:01:00.149> knees<00:01:00.840> hips

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
here so I want my feet knees hips

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.359 
here so I want my feet knees hips
shoulders<00:01:02.399> forearms<00:01:02.879> eyes<00:01:04.159> parallel<00:01:05.159> that

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
shoulders forearms eyes parallel that

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.440 
shoulders forearms eyes parallel that
line<00:01:05.720> like<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:07.310> ok<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.369> both<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.939> grip<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
line like this ok so both the grip and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.620 
line like this ok so both the grip and
the<00:01:09.689> alignment<00:01:09.990> should<00:01:10.439> help<00:01:10.740> promote<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:12.030> path

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the alignment should help promote a path

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.560 
the alignment should help promote a path
that<00:01:12.869> comes<00:01:13.170> more<00:01:13.500> from<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.430> inside<00:01:14.909> so

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
that comes more from the inside so

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.590 
that comes more from the inside so
remember<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.130> slicer<00:01:17.790> with

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
remember that for the slicer with

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.520 
remember that for the slicer with
shoulders<00:01:19.170> open<00:01:19.580> hips<00:01:20.580> open<00:01:21.090> eyes<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.470> that

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
shoulders open hips open eyes on that

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.480 
shoulders open hips open eyes on that
same<00:01:23.490> line<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.299> club<00:01:24.570> wants<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.409> swing<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
same line the club wants to swing to the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.840 
same line the club wants to swing to the
left<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.299> make<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> divot<00:01:28.170> left<00:01:28.490> so<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> person

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
left and make a divot left so the person

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.140 
left and make a divot left so the person
is<00:01:30.240> making<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.659> divot<00:01:31.079> left<00:01:31.380> looks<00:01:31.979> up<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
is making a divot left looks up and the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.969 
is making a divot left looks up and the
ball<00:01:33.329> slices<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> right<00:01:34.409> because<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
ball slices to the right because of the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.690 
ball slices to the right because of the
open<00:01:35.159> clubface<00:01:36.170> so<00:01:37.170> again<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:38.070> would<00:01:38.220> correct

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
open clubface so again we would correct

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.090 
open clubface so again we would correct
with<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.180> stronger<00:01:39.630> grip<00:01:39.960> proper<00:01:40.860> alignment

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
with a stronger grip proper alignment

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.600 
with a stronger grip proper alignment
and<00:01:41.840> proper<00:01:42.840> path<00:01:43.110> coming<00:01:43.439> from<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.009> inside

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
and proper path coming from the inside

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.190 
and proper path coming from the inside
to<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:46.049> target<00:01:46.549> swinging<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.759> target<00:01:48.200> so

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
to the target swinging to the target so

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.270 
to the target swinging to the target so
on<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.920> driving<00:01:50.189> range<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.939> work<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:52.280> you

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
on the driving range to work on this you

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.510 
on the driving range to work on this you
could<00:01:53.490> use<00:01:53.759> head<00:01:54.600> cover<00:01:55.399> an<00:01:56.399> empty<00:01:56.820> box<00:01:58.520> okay

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
could use head cover an empty box okay

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.080 
could use head cover an empty box okay
so<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.420> should<00:02:00.689> leave<00:02:00.950> about<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.009> finger<00:02:02.549> here

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
so you should leave about a finger here

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.480 
so you should leave about a finger here
finger<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.960> half<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.530> plenty<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.040> room<00:02:05.250> for

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
finger and a half so plenty of room for

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.660 
finger and a half so plenty of room for
the<00:02:05.520> club<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.850> fit<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:07.220> get<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.429> good

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
the club to fit and you get in a good

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.720 
the club to fit and you get in a good
setup<00:02:09.000> with<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.509> proper<00:02:09.929> grip<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:11.220> basically

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
setup with the proper grip and basically

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.610 
setup with the proper grip and basically
you<00:02:11.940> swing<00:02:12.270> trying<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.810> avoid

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
you swing trying to avoid

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.250 
you swing trying to avoid
that<00:02:14.519> box<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.209> that<00:02:15.390> head<00:02:15.569> cover<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:16.049> will

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
that box in that head cover it will

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.369 
that box in that head cover it will
force<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.799> to<00:02:16.830> swing<00:02:17.190> from<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.610> inside<00:02:18.060> more

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
force you to swing from the inside more

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.199 
force you to swing from the inside more
otherwise<00:02:19.379> if<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.830> get<00:02:20.159> into<00:02:20.489> the

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
otherwise if you get into the

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.380 
otherwise if you get into the
over-the-top<00:02:21.890> across<00:02:22.890> you'll<00:02:23.580> hit<00:02:23.849> that<00:02:24.090> box

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
over-the-top across you'll hit that box

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.979 
over-the-top across you'll hit that box
in<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:24.720> end<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.049> head<00:02:25.230> cover<00:02:25.760> okay<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.540> at

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
in the end the head cover okay so at

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.809 
in the end the head cover okay so at
first<00:02:28.049> it<00:02:28.500> will<00:02:28.620> feel<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:28.980> setup<00:02:29.430> will<00:02:29.610> feel

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
first it will feel the setup will feel

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.149
