00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.200
 In the years of distant childhood, when I was still in the fifth grade, 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.460
 I seemed mediocre to all the other guys. 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.640
 Everyone saw me, sitting at the desk, attentively listening to the teacher, 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.860
 but did not know that when I returned home, I became a savior hero! 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.200
 I served in the squad STARS, we took refuge in a mansion, 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.440
 and we had to fight people infected with the "T" virus! 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.660
 I was a secret agent, looking for terrorists by country, 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.020
 From the hands of a crazy dock more than once I rescued my beloved Tavna. 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.140
 I looked for my only daughter in the fog of the streets, 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.440
 saved the world from the meteor that madman had sent on him! 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.740
 I worked for an old friend and saved the hostages from the island, 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.880
 I was looking for answers to questions, but only found echoes of the past. 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.780
 In the hands of squeezing the gamepad, I got into other worlds, 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.360
 where I was so necessary that the most severe villain lost! 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.400
 I was afraid, anxious, washed with tears of grief, 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.760
 experienced love and pain, but fun and joy was the sea. 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.040
 For you, dear friends, Sony Playstation! 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.320
 Let your creative path be as unbroken! 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.580
 Give us the same vivid emotions, because our recognition does not count! 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.160
 Thank you for making us what we are!
