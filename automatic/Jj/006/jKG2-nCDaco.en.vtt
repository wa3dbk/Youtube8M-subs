my opinion like they're just these cute
little<00:05:00.610> illustrations<00:05:01.510> on<00:05:01.900> each<00:05:02.410> page<00:05:02.650> and

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
little illustrations on each page and

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.020 
little illustrations on each page and
then<00:05:03.490> it<00:05:03.790> has<00:05:04.090> a<00:05:04.690> question<00:05:05.350> or<00:05:05.830> category<00:05:06.460> like

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
starts with really simple ones like my

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.460 
starts with really simple ones like my
favorite<00:05:19.000> authors<00:05:19.360> and<00:05:19.660> what's<00:05:20.110> made<00:05:20.380> me

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
favorite authors and what's made me

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.290 
favorite authors and what's made me
laugh<00:05:20.590> look<00:05:20.919> you<00:05:21.070> made<00:05:21.220> me<00:05:21.370> cry<00:05:21.640> and<00:05:22.030> then<00:05:22.180> it

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
laugh look you made me cry and then it

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.780 
laugh look you made me cry and then it
gets<00:05:22.479> a<00:05:22.600> little<00:05:22.720> more<00:05:22.990> difficult<00:05:23.490> to<00:05:24.490> fill<00:05:24.669> out

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
gets a little more difficult to fill out

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.370 
gets a little more difficult to fill out
which<00:05:25.030> is<00:05:25.180> really<00:05:25.419> really<00:05:25.540> cool<00:05:25.780> and<00:05:25.840> again<00:05:26.260> of

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
which is really really cool and again of

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.540 
which is really really cool and again of
course<00:05:26.530> you<00:05:26.710> don't<00:05:26.830> do<00:05:26.950> this<00:05:27.100> every<00:05:27.250> day<00:05:27.490> you

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
course you don't do this every day you

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.370 
course you don't do this every day you
can<00:05:27.820> pick<00:05:28.000> it<00:05:28.090> up<00:05:28.180> whenever<00:05:28.360> you<00:05:28.630> want<00:05:28.870> and<00:05:29.140> I

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
really good interesting categories and

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.130 
really good interesting categories and
questions<00:05:36.340> to<00:05:36.940> think<00:05:37.150> about<00:05:37.330> and<00:05:37.630> my<00:05:37.750> number<00:05:37.990> 5

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
questions to think about and my number 5

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.680 
questions to think about and my number 5

things<00:05:40.930> to<00:05:41.140> draw<00:05:41.320> or<00:05:41.590> the<00:05:42.160> things<00:05:42.460> to<00:05:42.790> do<00:05:42.940> the

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
things to draw or the things to do the

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.120 
things to draw or the things to do the
whole<00:05:43.630> things<00:05:43.870> to<00:05:44.020> do<00:05:44.140> series<00:05:44.560> there<00:05:44.979> is<00:05:45.100> a

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
whole things to do series there is a

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.490 
whole things to do series there is a
couple<00:05:45.490> different<00:05:45.790> things<00:05:46.030> to<00:05:46.300> draw<00:05:46.540> activity

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
couple different things to draw activity

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.780 
couple different things to draw activity
journals<00:05:47.830> and<00:05:48.010> then<00:05:48.100> there's<00:05:48.250> things<00:05:48.460> to

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
journals and then there's things to

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.610 
journals and then there's things to
write<00:05:49.030> I<00:05:49.330> really<00:05:49.540> want<00:05:50.020> to<00:05:50.080> get<00:05:50.169> one<00:05:50.320> of<00:05:50.440> those

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
write I really want to get one of those

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.659 
write I really want to get one of those
but<00:05:51.390> basically<00:05:52.390> it's<00:05:53.169> not<00:05:53.470> like<00:05:53.830> every<00:05:54.370> single

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
but basically it's not like every single

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.610 
but basically it's not like every single
page<00:05:54.850> is<00:05:55.090> just<00:05:55.300> a<00:05:55.419> blank<00:05:55.660> page<00:05:55.930> sometimes<00:05:56.260> it's

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
page is just a blank page sometimes it's

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.290 
page is just a blank page sometimes it's
sectioned<00:05:57.130> into<00:05:57.310> different<00:05:57.669> things<00:05:57.760> so<00:05:58.240> you

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
sectioned into different things so you

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.790 
sectioned into different things so you
can<00:05:58.390> draw<00:05:58.660> it's<00:05:59.110> not<00:05:59.260> like<00:05:59.350> a<00:05:59.410> whole<00:05:59.560> page

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
can draw it's not like a whole page

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.890 
can draw it's not like a whole page
every<00:06:00.070> time<00:06:00.100> which<00:06:00.460> I<00:06:00.550> think

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
every time which I think

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.870 
every time which I think
nice<00:06:01.080> and<00:06:01.320> it<00:06:01.979> has<00:06:02.130> different<00:06:02.460> little

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
nice and it has different little

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.400 
nice and it has different little
categories<00:06:03.660> and<00:06:03.810> not<00:06:03.930> just<00:06:04.110> your<00:06:04.229> typical

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
categories and not just your typical

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.629 
categories and not just your typical
like<00:06:04.889> draw<00:06:05.520> a<00:06:05.759> house<00:06:06.030> draw<00:06:06.870> a<00:06:07.320> tree<00:06:08.130> it's<00:06:08.400> like

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
like draw a house draw a tree it's like
