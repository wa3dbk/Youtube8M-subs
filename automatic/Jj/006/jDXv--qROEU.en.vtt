00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
know if it was that but it's shedding a

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.290 
know if it was that but it's shedding a
lot<00:04:34.780> so<00:04:35.020> my<00:04:35.890> hair<00:04:36.070> look<00:04:36.280> very<00:04:36.520> full<00:04:36.850> on<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.060> top

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
lot so my hair look very full on the top

and the ends look very stringy and

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:45.300 
and the ends look very stringy and
that's<00:04:39.880> not<00:04:40.660> a<00:04:40.930> cute<00:04:41.440> look<00:04:41.590> so<00:04:42.250> I<00:04:43.110> cut<00:04:44.110> it<00:04:44.310> back

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
that's not a cute look so I cut it back

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.370 
that's not a cute look so I cut it back
into<00:04:45.580> like<00:04:45.880> a<00:04:45.910> little<00:04:46.180> Bob<00:04:46.420> you<00:04:46.690> know<00:04:46.720> my<00:04:46.990> go-to

into like a little Bob you know my go-to
haircut<00:04:48.160> um<00:04:48.400> but<00:04:49.180> a<00:04:49.240> little<00:04:49.510> longer<00:04:49.720> in<00:04:49.930> the

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
haircut um but a little longer in the

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:56.100 
haircut um but a little longer in the
front<00:04:50.020> and<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:52.330> actually<00:04:53.260> my<00:04:53.620> hair<00:04:54.040> um<00:04:55.110> curls

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
front and and actually my hair um curls

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.050 
front and and actually my hair um curls
up<00:04:56.320> better<00:04:56.560> with<00:04:56.740> this<00:04:56.980> length<00:04:57.220> so<00:04:57.670> it<00:04:57.700> kind<00:04:58.030> of

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
up better with this length so it kind of

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.490 
up better with this length so it kind of
matches<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.570> extension<00:04:59.020> here<00:04:59.260> can<00:04:59.380> like

matches the extension here can like

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.160 
matches the extension here can like
takes<00:04:59.740> the<00:04:59.890> form<00:05:00.130> of<00:05:00.220> extensions<00:05:00.790> so<00:05:01.510> I<00:05:01.900> don't
