00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
biggest problem with Westerville is we

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.960 
biggest problem with Westerville is we
not<00:00:48.070> biggest<00:00:48.340> problem<00:00:48.670> one<00:00:48.820> of<00:00:48.910> our

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970

international we also have some support
units<00:01:10.630> we<00:01:10.810> have<00:01:10.930> so<00:01:11.770> we<00:01:11.800> use<00:01:12.009> the<00:01:12.160> obd2<00:01:12.520> or<00:01:13.060> we

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
units we have so we use the obd2 or we

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.900 
units we have so we use the obd2 or we
plan<00:01:13.660> to<00:01:13.900> so<00:01:14.470> all<00:01:14.590> these<00:01:14.740> units<00:01:15.130> that<00:01:15.369> we<00:01:15.729> have

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
plan to so all these units that we have

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.340 
plan to so all these units that we have
all<00:01:16.060> these<00:01:16.180> options<00:01:16.420> hard<00:01:16.930> to<00:01:17.020> buy<00:01:17.110> software

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
all these options hard to buy software

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.820 
all these options hard to buy software
for<00:01:17.740> everything<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:19.479> know<00:01:19.540> we<00:01:19.690> have<00:01:19.840> some

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
for everything you know we have some

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.890 
for everything you know we have some
thirty<00:01:21.100> one-year-old<00:01:21.400> 30<00:01:22.030> year<00:01:22.240> old<00:01:22.390> veterans

thirty one-year-old 30 year old veterans

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.210 
thirty one-year-old 30 year old veterans
that<00:01:23.460> really<00:01:24.460> are<00:01:24.610> against<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.150> computer<00:01:25.630> age

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
that really are against the computer age

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.150 
that really are against the computer age
but<00:01:27.300> they<00:01:28.300> really<00:01:28.540> have<00:01:29.170> taken<00:01:29.590> on<00:01:29.710> to<00:01:29.979> this

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
but they really have taken on to this

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.999 
but they really have taken on to this
and<00:01:30.450> are<00:01:31.450> really<00:01:31.690> trying<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.140> use<00:01:32.380> it<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:32.680> just

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
and are really trying to use it and just

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.160 
and are really trying to use it and just
trying<00:01:33.790> a<00:01:33.910> little<00:01:34.060> bit<00:01:34.330> has<00:01:34.570> really<00:01:34.899> helped

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
trying a little bit has really helped

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.980 
trying a little bit has really helped
because<00:01:36.009> it<00:01:36.580> is<00:01:36.910> a<00:01:36.970> pretty<00:01:37.240> simple<00:01:37.509> system

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
because it is a pretty simple system

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:46.790 
because it is a pretty simple system
just<00:01:38.140> click<00:01:38.440> and<00:01:38.710> drag

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.320 

a<00:01:48.230> lot<00:01:49.230> of<00:01:49.260> times<00:01:49.560> we'll<00:01:49.740> have<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> full<00:01:50.760> code<00:01:51.060> or

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
a lot of times we'll have a full code or

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.180 
a lot of times we'll have a full code or
a<00:01:51.360> problem<00:01:51.840> with<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> bus<00:01:52.290> maybe<00:01:52.680> once<00:01:53.010> in<00:01:53.100> a

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
a problem with a bus maybe once in a

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.970 
a problem with a bus maybe once in a
while<00:01:53.630> it<00:01:54.630> acts<00:01:54.930> up<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.380> not<00:01:55.560> all<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.740> time

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
while it acts up it's not all the time

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.590 
while it acts up it's not all the time
well<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.310> could<00:01:56.610> be<00:01:56.730> really<00:01:56.940> expensive<00:01:57.210> if

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
well that could be really expensive if

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.450 
well that could be really expensive if
you<00:01:57.750> take<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.260> a<00:01:58.290> engine<00:01:58.800> manufacturer<00:01:59.340> or

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
you take it to a engine manufacturer or

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.170 
you take it to a engine manufacturer or
a<00:01:59.580> vendor<00:01:59.940> with<00:02:00.480> that<00:02:00.690> problem<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.730> take

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
a vendor with that problem so you take

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.810 
a vendor with that problem so you take
it<00:02:03.330> to<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.480> take<00:02:04.050> it<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:05.100> know<00:02:05.190> another<00:02:05.490> shop

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
it to a take it to you know another shop

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.630 
it to a take it to you know another shop
have<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.900> repaired<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.470> they<00:02:08.070> can't<00:02:08.280> find<00:02:08.490> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
have it repaired and they can't find the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.640 
have it repaired and they can't find the
problem<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.240> it's<00:02:09.630> really<00:02:09.840> beneficial<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.440> us

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
problem so it's really beneficial to us

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.520 
problem so it's really beneficial to us
because<00:02:10.970> we<00:02:11.970> can<00:02:12.150> actually<00:02:12.380> troubleshoot<00:02:13.380> it

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
because we can actually troubleshoot it

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.460 
because we can actually troubleshoot it
here<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.730> know<00:02:14.970> if<00:02:15.180> it's<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.540> bluebird<00:02:16.020> problem

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
here and know if it's a bluebird problem

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.990 
here and know if it's a bluebird problem
if<00:02:16.620> it's<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.860> comments<00:02:17.250> problem<00:02:17.610> or<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.790> cat

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
if it's a comments problem or a cat

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.470 
if it's a comments problem or a cat
problem

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.789 

we<00:02:25.200> use<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.610> cf-30<00:02:26.610> Panasonic<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:28.440> one<00:02:28.620> thing

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
we use the cf-30 Panasonic and one thing

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.710 
we use the cf-30 Panasonic and one thing
I<00:02:28.890> would<00:02:28.950> recommend<00:02:29.040> we<00:02:30.000> actually<00:02:30.390> purchase

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
I would recommend we actually purchase

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.970 
I would recommend we actually purchase
it<00:02:30.840> through<00:02:30.870> our<00:02:31.110> schools<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.769> then<00:02:32.700> we<00:02:32.819> had

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
it through our schools and then we had

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.039 
it through our schools and then we had
jaypro<00:02:34.980> actually<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.879> know<00:02:36.000> set<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:36.900> up<00:02:37.019> for

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
jaypro actually you know set it up for
