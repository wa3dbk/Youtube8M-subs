I pulled it in at stade but what I got

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.560 
I pulled it in at stade but what I got
to<00:01:24.340> do<00:01:24.400> is<00:01:24.520> back<00:01:24.760> up<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.120> take<00:01:25.270> some<00:01:25.300> the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
to do is back up and take some the

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.430 
to do is back up and take some the
pressure<00:01:25.780> off

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
pressure off

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.109 
pressure off
they<00:01:26.800> were<00:01:26.860> just<00:01:27.070> slightly<00:01:27.340> off<00:01:27.520> in<00:01:27.909> their

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
they were just slightly off in their

okay<00:01:41.860> we<00:01:42.130> moved<00:01:42.369> everything<00:01:42.700> around<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:45.090> now

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090

we've<00:01:46.270> got<00:01:46.509> the<00:01:47.220> tandem<00:01:48.220> configuration<00:01:49.060> and

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
we've got the tandem configuration and

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.670 
we've got the tandem configuration and
as<00:01:49.390> soon<00:01:49.630> as<00:01:49.780> I<00:01:49.900> got<00:01:50.050> all<00:01:50.229> done

I just turned that black valve back down
let<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:53.890> air<00:01:54.100> down<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.869> everything<00:01:56.380> was<00:01:56.470> good

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
let the air down so everything was good

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.330 
let the air down so everything was good
to<00:01:56.770> go

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.120 

and<00:02:00.340> luckily<00:02:00.640> everything<00:02:01.619> when<00:02:02.619> it's<00:02:02.800> raised

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
and luckily everything when it's raised

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.699 
and luckily everything when it's raised
it<00:02:03.580> does<00:02:03.789> clear<00:02:04.330> I<00:02:07.050> had<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:08.170> come<00:02:08.380> in<00:02:08.410> between

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
it does clear I had to come in between

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.620 
it does clear I had to come in between
the<00:02:09.039> video<00:02:09.369> what<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:09.640> did<00:02:09.940> is<00:02:10.030> I<00:02:10.149> had<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.420> come

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
the video what I did is I had to come

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.710 
the video what I did is I had to come
and<00:02:10.660> move<00:02:10.989> these<00:02:11.260> guys<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:13.239> put<00:02:13.420> them<00:02:13.570> right

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
and move these guys and put them right

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.750 
and move these guys and put them right
back<00:02:13.780> where<00:02:14.290> they<00:02:14.410> were<00:02:14.440> that's<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.459> only

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
back where they were that's the only

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.750 
back where they were that's the only
bummer<00:02:15.970> about<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.570> is<00:02:16.870> happened<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.350> unbolt

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
bummer about it is happened to unbolt

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.300 
bummer about it is happened to unbolt
slip<00:02:18.760> them<00:02:18.880> off<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.510> then<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:20.830> know<00:02:20.950> put<00:02:21.130> them

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
slip them off and then you know put them

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.550 
slip them off and then you know put them
back<00:02:21.459> on<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:22.239> it's<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.870> only<00:02:23.110> thing<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.350> had<00:02:23.530> to

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
back on so it's the only thing I had to

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.150 
back on so it's the only thing I had to
do<00:02:23.829> when<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:24.790> have<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.120> camera<00:02:25.329> off<00:02:26.160> squared

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
do when I have the camera off squared

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.240 
do when I have the camera off squared
away

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.490 

makes<00:02:33.250> for<00:02:33.460> a<00:02:33.520> different<00:02:35.160> turning<00:02:36.160> radius<00:02:36.520> and

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
makes for a different turning radius and

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.310 
makes for a different turning radius and
definitely<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.650> lot<00:02:38.950> quicker<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:40.900> have<00:02:41.110> to

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
definitely a lot quicker and I have to

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.010 
definitely a lot quicker and I have to
pull<00:02:41.590> up<00:02:41.800> for<00:02:42.310> my<00:02:42.520> customer<00:02:43.030> here<00:02:43.300> I<00:02:43.510> got<00:02:43.930> to

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
pull up for my customer here I got to

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.840 
pull up for my customer here I got to
pull<00:02:44.200> up<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.530> I<00:02:44.560> got<00:02:44.710> a<00:02:44.740> back<00:02:44.980> around<00:02:45.310> into

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
pull up and I got a back around into

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.130 
pull up and I got a back around into
that<00:02:46.000> door<00:02:46.210> so<00:02:47.020> I<00:02:47.550> like<00:02:48.550> this<00:02:48.760> flexibility<00:02:49.570> to

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
that door so I like this flexibility to

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.950 
that door so I like this flexibility to
allow<00:02:50.230> me<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.650> change<00:02:51.310> my<00:02:51.690> radius<00:02:52.690> just<00:02:52.900> a

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
allow me to change my radius just a

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.050

little bit and give me a little bit more

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.760 
little bit and give me a little bit more
room<00:02:55.270> and<00:02:55.600> lower<00:02:55.840> wheelbase<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:59.650> know

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770

seal and that kind of thing so we're

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.270 
seal and that kind of thing so we're
gonna<00:04:33.680> leave<00:04:33.860> that<00:04:33.889> alone

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.480 

shipping<00:04:37.280> cradle<00:04:38.440> it's<00:04:39.440> not<00:04:39.680> as<00:04:39.860> wide<00:04:40.070> as<00:04:40.340> I

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
shipping cradle it's not as wide as I

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.540 
shipping cradle it's not as wide as I
would<00:04:40.700> like<00:04:40.880> it<00:04:41.180> so<00:04:41.650> you<00:04:42.650> know<00:04:42.770> if<00:04:42.860> it<00:04:42.979> had<00:04:43.160> wide

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
would like it so you know if it had wide

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.219 
would like it so you know if it had wide
as<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:43.880> trailer<00:04:43.910> it<00:04:44.360> would<00:04:44.450> be<00:04:44.600> a<00:04:44.840> lot<00:04:45.200> more

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
as the trailer it would be a lot more

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.029 
as the trailer it would be a lot more
stable<00:04:45.820> so<00:04:46.820> that's<00:04:47.539> why<00:04:47.690> I<00:04:47.720> did<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:48.020> cross<00:04:48.830> to

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
stable so that's why I did the cross to

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.100 
stable so that's why I did the cross to
thank<00:04:49.850> put<00:04:50.000> all<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.150> pressure<00:04:50.330> down<00:04:50.630> I<00:04:50.690> want

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
thank put all the pressure down I want

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.620 
thank put all the pressure down I want
but<00:04:51.320> there's<00:04:51.470> nothing<00:04:51.889> to<00:04:52.130> attach<00:04:53.030> to<00:04:53.360> that

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
but there's nothing to attach to that

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.420 
but there's nothing to attach to that
you<00:04:54.320> know<00:04:54.380> that's<00:04:54.710> all<00:04:54.889> thread<00:04:55.220> and<00:04:55.370> that's

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
you know that's all thread and that's

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.240 
you know that's all thread and that's
sharp<00:04:55.760> she<00:04:56.030> can't<00:04:56.240> put<00:04:56.389> straps<00:04:57.229> away<00:04:57.620> okay

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
sharp she can't put straps away okay

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.040 
sharp she can't put straps away okay
think<00:04:58.850> about<00:04:59.030> that<00:04:59.210> you<00:04:59.270> put<00:04:59.479> your<00:04:59.570> hands<00:04:59.930> on

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
think about that you put your hands on

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.190 
think about that you put your hands on
it<00:05:00.220> check<00:05:01.220> it<00:05:01.370> out<00:05:01.570> now<00:05:02.570> just<00:05:02.780> put<00:05:02.930> a<00:05:02.960> few

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
it check it out now just put a few

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.510 
it check it out now just put a few
straps<00:05:03.590> to<00:05:03.800> kind<00:05:03.979> of<00:05:04.010> get<00:05:04.160> out<00:05:04.310> of<00:05:04.430> the

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
straps to kind of get out of the

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.730 
straps to kind of get out of the
building<00:05:04.910> then<00:05:05.539> I<00:05:05.630> strut<00:05:05.960> a<00:05:05.990> couple<00:05:06.380> now<00:05:06.530> it's

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
building then I strut a couple now it's

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.960 
building then I strut a couple now it's
the<00:05:06.830> reason<00:05:07.039> while<00:05:07.160> these<00:05:07.310> things<00:05:07.370> are<00:05:07.700> on<00:05:07.820> an

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
the reason while these things are on an

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.930 
the reason while these things are on an
angle<00:05:08.360> because<00:05:08.780> there<00:05:09.050> isn't<00:05:09.350> anything

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
angle because there isn't anything

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.960 
angle because there isn't anything
hook<00:05:10.120> this<00:05:10.630> trailer<00:05:10.960> so<00:05:11.680> I've<00:05:12.520> got<00:05:12.700> a<00:05:12.730> couple

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
hook this trailer so I've got a couple

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.210 
hook this trailer so I've got a couple
of<00:05:13.150> change<00:05:14.020> they're<00:05:14.260> slightly<00:05:14.500> on<00:05:14.770> an<00:05:14.890> angle

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
of change they're slightly on an angle

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.210 
of change they're slightly on an angle
but<00:05:15.450> just<00:05:16.450> to<00:05:16.570> kind<00:05:16.750> of<00:05:16.870> keep<00:05:17.050> it<00:05:17.260> in<00:05:17.440> place

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
but just to kind of keep it in place

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.610 
but just to kind of keep it in place
because<00:05:18.610> it's<00:05:18.760> right<00:05:19.060> over<00:05:19.600> the<00:05:19.720> trailer<00:05:20.020> axle

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
because it's right over the trailer axle

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.150 
because it's right over the trailer axle
and<00:05:21.120> I<00:05:22.120> had<00:05:22.420> no<00:05:22.660> more<00:05:22.930> places<00:05:23.470> to<00:05:23.650> stick<00:05:23.890> a

strap where I'd get a good pull so I

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.140 
strap where I'd get a good pull so I

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.410 
just threw some steel and nothing else I
can<00:05:31.210> do<00:05:31.450> about<00:05:31.690> it<00:05:32.670> you<00:05:33.670> see<00:05:33.880> everything<00:05:34.300> is
