programmer and then you plug it into the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.709 
programmer and then you plug it into the
diagnostic<00:00:38.489> port<00:00:38.700> which<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.120> usually<00:00:39.540> on<00:00:39.660> the

after you plug in the Max Energy power
programmer<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.489> will<00:00:48.000> verify<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:48.989> is

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
programmer it will verify that this is

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.260

the<00:00:49.289> correct<00:00:49.469> vehicle<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.280> then<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.000> will<00:00:51.090> run

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
the correct vehicle and then it will run

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.729 
the correct vehicle and then it will run
through<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.660> diagnostics<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.500> we'll<00:00:52.590> make

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
through the diagnostics and we'll make
