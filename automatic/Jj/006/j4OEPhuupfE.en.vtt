 Try out the machine and listen in 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.080
 what you spit out for sounds catching there 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.299
 we are at the very front 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:24.050
 with the classic carnival style like that 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:24.050
 will that get rid of the avalanche 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.740
 completely black the lutz cuckoo 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:51.130

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.130

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.409
 Yes 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.439

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.060
 there 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.430
 it seems clear second to tell the how 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.430
 we 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.290
 she must not be missing viva colonia 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.290
 me 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.930
 that's just a whistle and bye bye 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.930
 my life 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.500
 the team is so loud that you're on the go 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.970
 in the open probably already there 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.489
 some on the alarm goes with at least 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.970
 if you use it too much and not 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.180
 sparingly but otherwise much fun of 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.180
