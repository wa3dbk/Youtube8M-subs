00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.379
 hello dear friends are you on the channel 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.950
 sorcerer unit boats themselves tanks today 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:19.620
 we will first see the battle where 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.230
 stage is at the bottom of the list in the second 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.890
 let's talk about any problems at all 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.040
 there are st-1 yes as in the tankad and here 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.900
 touch on the issue that was raised that 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.899
 we are from 4 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.660
 better to put on level 9 because 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.870
 101 in all its better so on and so forth 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.270
 Well, let's start with the fact that 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.739
 of 4 why he was not just like that 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.190
 set at level 10 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.500
 the fact is he is more 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.190
 compact machine firstly secondly 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.320
 him in principle booking more in 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.020
 In general, she has more reservations at the tower 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.790
 well i don't mean frontal armor mind 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.660
 total armor that is he and the rear 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.530
 side armor is generally more powerful and the most 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.180
 probably the main thing 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:13.150
 is that he is much stronger 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.540
 bead that is there is 160 millimeters by 140 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.280
 millimeters plus there as far as I know 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.619
 there is more powerful screening and 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.320
 respectively, four sides tanks 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.149
 much better than st1 st1 has explicit 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.380
 the advantage is that it has a tower 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:33.340
 monolithic, that is, he has this roof 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.009
 the towers it is protected very well here it is 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.509
 flat absolutely nothing protrudes 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:42.220
 of 4 there is such a freedom cutout then 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.909
 that is, where was the weapon 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.940
 here and this part of it closed here 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.580
 directly collapsed top 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.619
 bronelist he who is very thin there 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.950
 what a few tens of millimeters there 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.960
 small actually and its this 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.000
 the top part is perfectly flashing in 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.920
 difference from st-1 which pierce in the forehead 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.679
 practically into the tower impossible even 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.990
 cumulative here are maxims that can be 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.540
 this is a hit with some kind of explosive 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.519
 well even get into the tower and com 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.430
 punching is very hard because she is 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:19.239
 low yes here such here it is very 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.810
 low and she's in the form of a summer tower 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:26.110
 very strong that is the structure itself and 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.209
 her defense is very powerful and pierce a lot 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.920
 heavier than a similar tower of the same 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.920
 there 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.080
 let's say t-34 to american which 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.450
 generally distinguished by mighty towers with 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.160
 powerful front booking 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.320
 Article 1 in this regard probably has the most 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.670
 perfect tower 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.000
 but the only thing that likely side 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:51.020
 armor and rear of 4 is still more powerful 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.420
 plus of the 4 tower below she has these same 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.460
 edges and they are made under sharper 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.520
 angles respectively the river is shocking in 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:02.090
 the tower side there happen more often than mine 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.160
 v-1's except it turns out there 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.400
 this is the smaller tower we are there 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.970
 accordingly in my opinion it is easier and yes 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.710
 it spins faster than 100 and 1 out of 101 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.910
 very slowly turns around its 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:20.150
 tower besides and stitch ester that is from 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.890
 4 he is generally a bit more dynamic again 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.200
 same because of its more compact 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.140
 size and the 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.460
 In general, if you think so, yes by and large 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.270
 account well, as if St-1 that mouth 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.130
 unity of 4 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.970
 mechanic water hatch makes its way approximately 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.970
 same yes that is it is 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.550
 weak point of the tank is indisputable here and 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.660
 deny it is stupid here is the same 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.850
 problem and month 4 ie st-1 here 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.330
 has no advantage over c 4 and 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:57.150
 4, respectively, before Article 1, but also 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.220
 of 4 can get a tanked side yes 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.200
 that is , the lower armor she has 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.000
 stronger that is repeatedly it 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:09.780
 replaced in shootouts from 4 to this is obvious 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.170
 advantage factor that is if you don't sing 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.450
 the praises of 101 everyone knows that 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.930
 along with a very very powerful tower st-1 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.600
 Nubsky has a good body protection 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:26.420
 indisputable but not so good 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:30.150
 how has it of 44 its best times 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.910
 when we don't know maybe he was a period 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.980
 add-it and fleet even really behind 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.400
 punch do not pray that is when he got 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.380
 in the top it was just such a monolith 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.090
 comparable probably with the mouse even in 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.370
 something is probably his better because he 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.680
 There was a very akash of this type besides charter 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.380
 not really ricocheting country there armor under 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.480
 straight angles from 4 it was just 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.330
 monster in the side 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.950
 detailed especially what you say and 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.350
 it wasnâ€™t even possible in a day 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.110
 punch that is even if they came across 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.330
 tanks there are eighth level really nothing 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.230
 couldn't do with it especially considering 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.150
 that then there was no gold like yes and 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.430
 very tanks of the seventh level then 6 then 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.490
 I donâ€™t generally speak 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.490
 dragged just tough very dragged there and 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.100
 it was difficult for someone to compare with him 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.800
 that is why from and fourth was 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.750
 a lot of them were just so populated 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.680
 incredible measure like right now 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.170
 borscht and even in fran e100 although their 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.480
 less already after the nerf in general 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:38.950
 it was very very popular not here 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.530
 looked at a set of characteristics and 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.500
 comparing with art-1 what by and large how 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.720
 would st-1 have a tangible advantage 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.760
 before of 4 only that he has 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.940
 monolithic tower that cannot be pierced 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.550
 in the roof and 4 can be pierced in the roof 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.910
 but again this is from 9 my opinion is not so 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.390
 just because there you need to fidget 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.980
 shy away and here's this part like 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.480
 hard enough to get from that one 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.010
 here dad give at least we do not fall and all 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.140
 equally rarely bounce 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.710
 punch here so in general i think 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:13.780
 which is a solution with placement on 4 on 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:18.770
 top position is correct 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:21.199
 possible if art-1 slightly apn crush 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.770
 make approximate figures for 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:26.509
 stability hit side armor 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.550
 especially lower armor list date then 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:29.419
 maybe it could be put on 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.879
 10th level 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:34.099
 but still I would probably still 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:34.699
 preferred it then on the tenth 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:36.740
 level 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:38.659
 only if it appears 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:42.530
 some kind of new heavy Soviet branch 

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:43.520
 tanks here we are on this we have everything if 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.199
 did you like the likes 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.560
 subscribe to the channel and to new 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:47.560
 meetings yet
