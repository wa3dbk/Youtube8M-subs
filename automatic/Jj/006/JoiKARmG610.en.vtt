to<00:00:39.239> d3<00:00:39.360> but<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.899> game<00:00:40.079> flopped<00:00:40.530> because<00:00:40.739> they

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
to d3 but that game flopped because they

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.280 
to d3 but that game flopped because they
designed<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:42.059> vehicle<00:00:42.660> based<00:00:42.870> game

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.780 
is the Infinity care package glitch
which<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.950> realize<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.280> they<00:01:08.460> fixed<00:01:08.760> some

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
which I realize that they fixed some

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.690 
which I realize that they fixed some
glitches<00:01:09.180> but<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.409> one<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.740> very<00:01:11.040> much<00:01:11.340> still

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
I feel like an affinity award got a

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.490 
I feel like an affinity award got a
little<00:01:15.030> cocky<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.479> overconfident<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.320> their

game making abilities they should have

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.100 
game making abilities they should have
had<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.840> beta<00:01:19.140> period<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:21.450> fourth<00:01:21.659> one<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:21.930> the

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
weeks of after launch they did patch it

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.490 
weeks of after launch they did patch it
from<00:03:24.819> it's<00:03:24.970> ridiculous<00:03:25.569> state<00:03:25.900> but<00:03:26.109> once

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
from it's ridiculous state but once

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.370 
from it's ridiculous state but once
people<00:03:26.709> figure<00:03:26.980> out<00:03:27.160> that<00:03:27.370> even<00:03:27.639> and<00:03:27.790> just<00:03:27.910> add

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
people figure out that even and just add

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.830 
people figure out that even and just add
FMJ<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:29.620> akimbo<00:03:30.010> it'll<00:03:30.849> be<00:03:30.940> just<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.299> same<00:03:31.569> so

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
FMJ and akimbo it'll be just the same so

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.479 
FMJ and akimbo it'll be just the same so
just<00:03:32.200> like<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.560> tactile<00:03:32.950> insertion<00:03:33.430> I

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
just like the tactile insertion I

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.370 
just like the tactile insertion I
suggest<00:03:33.880> you<00:03:33.970> take<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:34.359> out<00:03:34.480> replace<00:03:35.170> it<00:03:35.290> with

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
suggest you take it out replace it with

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.800 
suggest you take it out replace it with
something<00:03:35.560> else<00:03:35.739> possibly<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.849> W<00:03:37.180> 1200<00:03:37.660> from

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
something else possibly the W 1200 from

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.680 
something else possibly the W 1200 from
Cod<00:03:37.989> for<00:03:38.319> the<00:03:39.250> gun<00:03:39.430> is<00:03:39.549> just<00:03:39.700> too<00:03:39.910> powerful<00:03:40.480> and

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
Cod for the gun is just too powerful and

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.229 
Cod for the gun is just too powerful and
has<00:03:41.139> to<00:03:41.440> longer<00:03:41.799> arrange<00:03:42.099> to<00:03:42.400> have<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.760> akimbo

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
has to longer arrange to have the akimbo

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.300 
has to longer arrange to have the akimbo
feature<00:03:43.599> available<00:03:44.440> much<00:03:44.739> like<00:03:44.950> all<00:03:45.160> the

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
feature available much like all the

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.520 
feature available much like all the
other<00:03:45.430> guns<00:03:45.669> with<00:03:45.849> the<00:03:45.940> low<00:03:46.120> recoil<00:03:46.389> and<00:03:46.930> lack

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
other guns with the low recoil and lack

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.949 
other guns with the low recoil and lack
of<00:03:47.560> idle<00:03:48.190> sway<00:03:48.430> this<00:03:49.120> gun<00:03:49.359> is<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.599> only<00:03:49.810> one

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
of idle sway this gun is the only one

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.110 
of idle sway this gun is the only one
that<00:03:50.109> I<00:03:50.169> believe<00:03:50.500> is<00:03:50.829> truly<00:03:51.280> overpowered

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
that I believe is truly overpowered

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.259 
that I believe is truly overpowered
compared<00:03:52.810> to<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:52.959> rest<00:03:53.139> of<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.349> guns<00:03:53.530> and

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
compared to the rest of the guns and

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.830 
compared to the rest of the guns and
last<00:03:55.269> but<00:03:55.569> not<00:03:55.690> least<00:03:56.049> the<00:03:56.709> commando<00:03:57.430> perk

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
last but not least the commando perk

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.599 
last but not least the commando perk
from<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:58.930> first<00:03:59.200> moment<00:03:59.829> I<00:03:59.859> heard<00:04:00.069> about<00:04:00.220> it<00:04:00.459> I

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
from the first moment I heard about it I

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.759 
from the first moment I heard about it I
didn't<00:04:00.880> really<00:04:01.030> understand<00:04:01.630> because<00:04:02.440> I<00:04:02.620> had

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
didn't really understand because I had

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.460 
didn't really understand because I had
thought<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.849> knife<00:04:04.389> brain<00:04:04.720> was<00:04:04.930> already<00:04:05.109> too

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
thought the knife brain was already too

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.500 
thought the knife brain was already too
long<00:04:05.709> I<00:04:05.889> liked<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:06.280> knife<00:04:06.430> range<00:04:06.700> in<00:04:07.030> world<00:04:07.359> of

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
long I liked the knife range in world of

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.390 
long I liked the knife range in world of
war<00:04:07.630> which<00:04:07.810> most<00:04:08.019> people<00:04:08.319> thought<00:04:08.470> was<00:04:09.190> you

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
war which most people thought was you

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.879 
war which most people thought was you
know<00:04:09.489> just<00:04:09.669> useless<00:04:10.150> but<00:04:10.989> commando<00:04:11.410> adds<00:04:11.560> just

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
know just useless but commando adds just

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.670 
know just useless but commando adds just
too<00:04:12.280> long<00:04:12.790> of<00:04:13.030> a<00:04:13.120> melee

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
too long of a melee

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.310 
too long of a melee
range<00:04:14.099> increase<00:04:14.719> especially<00:04:15.719> when<00:04:16.019> you<00:04:16.079> slap

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
range increase especially when you slap

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.529 
range increase especially when you slap
down<00:04:16.530> with<00:04:16.859> marathon<00:04:17.459> lightweight<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:18.449> a

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
down with marathon lightweight and a

down with marathon lightweight and a
ridiculous<00:04:18.989> care<00:04:19.440> package<00:04:19.859> speed<00:04:20.820> those<00:04:21.299> you
