see<00:01:42.539> now<00:01:43.539> here's<00:01:44.020> a<00:01:44.139> another<00:01:44.619> view<00:01:44.889> of<00:01:44.920> it<00:01:45.159> from

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
see now here's a another view of it from

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.349 
see now here's a another view of it from
a<00:01:45.369> few<00:01:45.520> different<00:01:45.609> angles<00:01:45.969> just<00:01:46.090> so<00:01:46.209> you<00:01:46.270> can

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
a few different angles just so you can

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.419 
a few different angles just so you can
see<00:01:46.420> how<00:01:46.600> it<00:01:46.749> looks<00:01:46.959> I<00:01:47.229> mean<00:01:47.920> it's<00:01:48.279> good<00:01:48.399> it's

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
see how it looks I mean it's good it's

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.730 
see how it looks I mean it's good it's
clean<00:01:48.579> it<00:01:49.090> looks<00:01:49.299> nice<00:01:49.539> and<00:01:49.929> it<00:01:50.020> again<00:01:50.499> it<00:01:50.590> does

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
clean it looks nice and it again it does

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.169 
clean it looks nice and it again it does
the<00:01:50.829> job<00:01:50.979> very<00:01:51.189> well<00:01:51.249> you<00:01:51.999> get<00:01:52.149> some

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
the job very well you get some

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:53.760 
the job very well you get some
fingerprints<00:01:52.869> but<00:01:53.049> they're<00:01:53.289> easy<00:01:53.469> enough<00:01:53.619> to

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
fingerprints but they're easy enough to

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.149 
fingerprints but they're easy enough to
wipe<00:01:54.009> off<00:01:54.189> so<00:01:54.399> that's<00:01:54.549> no<00:01:54.670> big<00:01:54.819> deal<00:01:54.969> with<00:01:56.159> next

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
wipe off so that's no big deal with next

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.279 
wipe off so that's no big deal with next
we're<00:01:57.249> moving<00:01:57.459> on<00:01:57.549> to<00:01:57.579> the<00:01:57.729> Spuyten<00:01:58.289> because

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
we're moving on to the Spuyten because

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:01.069 
we're moving on to the Spuyten because
the<00:01:59.409> ultra<00:01:59.799> hybrid<00:02:00.009> is<00:02:00.369> what<00:02:00.490> it's<00:02:00.609> called

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
the ultra hybrid is what it's called

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.719 
the ultra hybrid is what it's called
will<00:02:02.079> pump<00:02:02.439> that<00:02:02.619> backward<00:02:03.009> on<00:02:03.130> here<00:02:03.310> this<00:02:03.549> one

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
will pump that backward on here this one

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:04.800 
will pump that backward on here this one
I<00:02:03.759> think<00:02:03.849> it<00:02:04.119> Mac<00:02:04.240> would<00:02:04.389> be<00:02:04.539> my<00:02:04.659> favorite

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
I think it Mac would be my favorite

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.349 
I think it Mac would be my favorite
actually<00:02:05.319> because<00:02:06.189> it<00:02:06.819> looks<00:02:06.999> pretty<00:02:07.119> nice

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
actually because it looks pretty nice

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:10.320 
actually because it looks pretty nice
and<00:02:07.689> it<00:02:08.560> takes<00:02:09.099> you<00:02:09.369> know<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.700> good<00:02:09.880> shape<00:02:10.179> of

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
and it takes you know the good shape of

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.150 
and it takes you know the good shape of
the<00:02:10.420> phone<00:02:10.599> takes<00:02:11.319> a<00:02:11.440> nice<00:02:11.590> curve<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.069> it

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
the phone takes a nice curve and it

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.920 
the phone takes a nice curve and it
keeps<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.640> pretty<00:02:12.790> well<00:02:13.030> not<00:02:13.420> that<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.690> slim

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
keeps it pretty well not that the slim

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.150 
keeps it pretty well not that the slim
didn't<00:02:14.319> but<00:02:14.470> this<00:02:14.560> one<00:02:14.620> just<00:02:14.740> has<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:14.980> better

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
didn't but this one just has a better

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.920 
didn't but this one just has a better
job

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
job

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.899 
job
and<00:02:17.019> more<00:02:17.620> importantly<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.280> protects<00:02:18.790> the

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
and more importantly it protects the

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.640 
and more importantly it protects the
entire<00:02:19.120> phone<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:19.780> that's<00:02:20.019> kind<00:02:20.409> of<00:02:20.439> a<00:02:20.530> big

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
entire phone so that's kind of a big

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.050 
entire phone so that's kind of a big
deal<00:02:21.480> easy<00:02:22.480> pop<00:02:22.719> I<00:02:22.840> didn't<00:02:22.989> I<00:02:23.049> go<00:02:23.170> bottom<00:02:23.439> first

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
deal easy pop I didn't I go bottom first

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.720 
deal easy pop I didn't I go bottom first
there<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.180> go<00:02:25.269> stop<00:02:25.840> fighting<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.739> also

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
there you go stop fighting and also

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.000 
there you go stop fighting and also
selfishly<00:02:28.450> just<00:02:28.900> show<00:02:29.049> up<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.319> Nexus<00:02:29.680> logo<00:02:29.980> a

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
selfishly just show up the Nexus logo a

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.220 
selfishly just show up the Nexus logo a
little<00:02:30.280> bit<00:02:30.400> more<00:02:30.670> so<00:02:30.969> that's<00:02:31.180> kind<00:02:31.989> of<00:02:32.019> a<00:02:32.109> nerd

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
little bit more so that's kind of a nerd

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.520 
little bit more so that's kind of a nerd
thing<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:34.150> looks<00:02:34.299> really<00:02:34.450> nice<00:02:34.629> this<00:02:35.349> is

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
thing so it looks really nice this is

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.140 
thing so it looks really nice this is
definitely<00:02:36.069> my<00:02:36.250> favorite<00:02:36.639> case<00:02:36.819> out<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.030> the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
definitely my favorite case out of the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.750 
definitely my favorite case out of the
mall<00:02:37.680> until<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.859> put<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.129> slim<00:02:39.370> one<00:02:39.400> on<00:02:39.609> because

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
mall until I put the slim one on because

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.550 
mall until I put the slim one on because
I'm<00:02:39.939> not<00:02:40.030> only<00:02:40.180> because<00:02:40.359> my<00:02:40.510> favorite<00:02:40.870> but

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
I'm not only because my favorite but

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.080 
I'm not only because my favorite but
this<00:02:42.129> one<00:02:42.280> truly<00:02:42.519> would<00:02:42.730> be<00:02:42.849> my<00:02:42.939> favorite

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
this one truly would be my favorite

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.530 
this one truly would be my favorite
because<00:02:43.719> it's<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.799> lot<00:02:45.010> easier<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:46.180> take<00:02:46.389> on

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
because it's a lot easier to take on

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.000 
because it's a lot easier to take on
easier<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.019> take<00:02:47.109> off<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.469> don't<00:02:47.709> feel<00:02:47.859> bad

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
easier to take off I don't feel bad

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.440 
easier to take off I don't feel bad
about<00:02:48.129> damaging<00:02:48.579> anything<00:02:48.730> doing<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.239> and

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
about damaging anything doing that and

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.080 
about damaging anything doing that and
it<00:02:50.349> feels<00:02:50.590> really<00:02:50.739> nice<00:02:50.980> it's<00:02:51.730> not<00:02:51.909> really

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
it feels really nice it's not really

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.670 
it feels really nice it's not really
slick<00:02:52.510> believe<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:52.930> or<00:02:52.989> not<00:02:53.079> it<00:02:53.260> looks<00:02:53.439> like

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
slick believe it or not it looks like

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.259 
slick believe it or not it looks like
but<00:02:54.340> it's<00:02:54.459> not<00:02:54.579> it<00:02:54.790> doesn't<00:02:54.819> get<00:02:55.060> scratched

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
but it's not it doesn't get scratched

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.300 
but it's not it doesn't get scratched
it's<00:02:56.049> smudged<00:02:56.379> but<00:02:56.650> that's<00:02:56.829> just<00:02:57.010> from<00:02:57.220> the

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
it's smudged but that's just from the

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.690 
it's smudged but that's just from the
inside<00:02:57.609> relief<00:02:58.290> but<00:02:59.290> overall<00:02:59.680> really<00:03:00.040> nice

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
inside relief but overall really nice

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.599 
inside relief but overall really nice
case<00:03:01.409> so<00:03:02.409> here's<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:02.650> few<00:03:02.799> eons<00:03:03.040> couple<00:03:03.459> more

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
case so here's a few eons couple more

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.399 
case so here's a few eons couple more
shots<00:03:04.359> of<00:03:04.569> it<00:03:04.659> from<00:03:04.780> different<00:03:04.900> angles<00:03:05.079> it

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
shots of it from different angles it

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:06.839 
shots of it from different angles it
does<00:03:05.650> maintain<00:03:06.069> more<00:03:06.400> or<00:03:06.489> less<00:03:06.639> the<00:03:06.819> same

what I heard that bear motion does is

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.559 
what I heard that bear motion does is
they<00:03:20.590> kind<00:03:20.799> of<00:03:20.829> make<00:03:20.979> cases<00:03:21.400> with<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:22.209> similar

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
they kind of make cases with a similar

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.469 
they kind of make cases with a similar
texture<00:03:23.049> to<00:03:23.290> that<00:03:23.470> of<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:24.090> back<00:03:25.090> of<00:03:25.359> the

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:25.479 
texture to that of the back of the

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.539 
texture to that of the back of the
oneplus<00:03:25.840> one<00:03:25.989> and<00:03:26.440> that<00:03:26.799> would<00:03:26.889> be<00:03:27.010> kinda<00:03:27.459> like

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
oneplus one and that would be kinda like

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.110 
oneplus one and that would be kinda like
a<00:03:27.579> sandstone<00:03:29.370> smooth<00:03:30.370> finish<00:03:30.639> it<00:03:30.909> feels

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
a sandstone smooth finish it feels

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.390 
a sandstone smooth finish it feels
really<00:03:31.389> nice<00:03:31.690> apparently<00:03:32.199> and<00:03:32.379> it's<00:03:33.159> not<00:03:33.250> to

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
really nice apparently and it's not to

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.189 
really nice apparently and it's not to
say<00:03:33.519> that<00:03:33.609> this<00:03:33.699> one<00:03:33.849> feels<00:03:34.000> bad<00:03:34.299> but<00:03:35.049> it

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:35.199 
say that this one feels bad but it

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:36.420 
say that this one feels bad but it
definitely<00:03:35.379> wasn't<00:03:35.769> as<00:03:35.949> nice<00:03:36.069> as<00:03:36.250> I<00:03:36.340> was

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
definitely wasn't as nice as I was

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.300 
definitely wasn't as nice as I was
feeling<00:03:36.760> is<00:03:37.049> it<00:03:38.049> just<00:03:38.199> feels<00:03:38.379> like<00:03:38.530> a<00:03:38.560> soft<00:03:39.010> ish

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
feeling is it just feels like a soft ish

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.429 
feeling is it just feels like a soft ish
plastic<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.269> was<00:03:40.419> expecting<00:03:40.599> like<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:41.019> soft

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.439 
plastic I was expecting like a soft

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:44.339 
plastic I was expecting like a soft
touch<00:03:41.879> almost<00:03:42.879> velvety<00:03:43.389> because<00:03:43.989> that's<00:03:44.139> what

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
touch almost velvety because that's what

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.069 
touch almost velvety because that's what
it's<00:03:44.709> been<00:03:44.889> described<00:03:45.340> as<00:03:45.549> I<00:03:45.900> really<00:03:46.900> don't

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
it's been described as I really don't

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.179 
it's been described as I really don't
even<00:03:47.109> want<00:03:47.259> to<00:03:47.379> put<00:03:47.560> this<00:03:47.650> on<00:03:47.709> because<00:03:48.069> it's

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:48.189 
even want to put this on because it's

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.219 
even want to put this on because it's
such<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.459> major<00:03:48.909> pain<00:03:49.389> but<00:03:49.689> I'm<00:03:49.989> going<00:03:50.079> to<00:03:50.139> try

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:50.229 
such a major pain but I'm going to try

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:53.219 
such a major pain but I'm going to try
to<00:03:50.290> do<00:03:50.739> it<00:03:50.799> anyway<00:03:51.329> so<00:03:52.329> again<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:52.870> like<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.109> go

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:53.229 
to do it anyway so again I like to go

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:58.530 
to do it anyway so again I like to go
button<00:03:53.409> first<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:56.879> so<00:03:57.879> it<00:03:58.000> clips<00:03:58.239> in<00:03:58.359> pretty

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
button first and so it clips in pretty

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.479 
button first and so it clips in pretty
well<00:03:58.689> it<00:03:58.930> does<00:03:59.139> cover<00:03:59.409> the<00:03:59.650> edges<00:03:59.769> as<00:04:00.189> you<00:04:00.340> can

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
well it does cover the edges as you can

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.409 
well it does cover the edges as you can
see<00:04:00.699> here<00:04:00.970> in<00:04:01.120> of<00:04:01.870> strat<00:04:02.759> it<00:04:03.759> leaves<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.209> top
