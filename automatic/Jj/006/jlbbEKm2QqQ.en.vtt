00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.030 
might be dimming down video is just a
bit<00:03:58.070> just<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:58.460> I<00:03:58.550> find<00:03:58.820> out<00:03:59.030> on<00:03:59.470> what<00:04:00.470> classes

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
bit just so I find out on what classes

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.580 
bit just so I find out on what classes
as<00:04:01.190> to<00:04:01.310> look<00:04:01.490> out<00:04:01.670> for<00:04:01.700> all<00:04:02.120> that<00:04:02.300> stuff<00:04:02.660> I'm

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
as to look out for all that stuff I'm

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.840 
as to look out for all that stuff I'm
going<00:04:03.830> to<00:04:03.920> be<00:04:03.980> a<00:04:04.010> sophomore<00:04:04.340> in<00:04:04.640> high<00:04:04.820> school
