00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.450
 very bad 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.570
 hello everyone and welcome to retro 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.100
 trainer good but all apologize 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.610
 for having raised lives in so long 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.610
 we have many problems because in addition 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.490
 but like all these problems and not 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.380
 I could make videos so far very much 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.300
 He has left a lot of information about 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.550
 pokemon x and the documentary now another 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.710
 little bit during the computer and we're going to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.710
 account quickly I guess many 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.110
 hours commented the same even if the country arrived 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.460
 because they are very curious and is that the most 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.040
 important I think that it has appeared 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.170
 during this week is the announcement of 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.400
 four new pokÃ©mon specifically 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.290
 are the names in Japanese so 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.690
 I'm seeing why they are not translated 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.330
 I suppose they have Japanese names and good 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.440
 of any image while commenting 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.409
 these four few have not appeared 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.020
 the first would be the liquid usa that is 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.299
 a little a normal electric type like 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.190
 we assume this pokemon is below the 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.980
 little more like prevention 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.990
 good 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.400
 or are simply type pokemon 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.500
 normal electrical I think there was no 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.570
 no little normal there was still no 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.790
 none so good new guys 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.840
 it seems that at least it is interesting with 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.540
 new assets 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.930
 then there is dust in birds by 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.580
 example he asked the car of these 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.590
 he touched a bird this generation that 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.270
 call in Japanese already have coma 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.890
 as another group as they lowered the 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.710
 generations are types of flying sea like this 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.140
 that nothing else is said and put here that 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.850
 was maybe the flame flame movement 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.770
 on the outside is called flame church 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.270
 here in English and the load can be 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.520
 although if not normal flight time not 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.250
 injury fire attack and will then 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.750
 then pokemon we believe and personally 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.270
 in almost the one that I like most part 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:03.610
 the next is jan chan who is 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.540
 it's a pokÃ©mon skirt is a little compact 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.800
 and well, it says here that fight type 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.750
 the truth is that it has a wiring channel 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.910
 to be a real fight type and 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.370
 well he also has a new movement 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.750
 understand that it is in English it is also 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.490
 flame sea party that I do not know what 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.540
 you mean exactly you can see the 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.120
 translation I do not want to get involved 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.400
 translations that later it is not but yes 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.520
 that is has already said the effect of that 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.340
 attack 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.460
 it seems that it makes the statistics 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.770
 of the rival go down and transmit change of 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.610
 paste download statistics only 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:41.010
 and finally it's like a diego what is 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.840
 the goat this we have here and 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.540
 also it seems that arrived the same is going to give 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.730
 very much game since I was watching 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.860
 images I put them here for the video 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.270
 worthy meters all this there are pictures in 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.280
 which seems that we can mount something 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.960
 beat the villages at least I do not know here in 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.910
 this image is clearly seen as the 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.500
 character can climb on top of waldo 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.930
 out there around the city and there are more people 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.480
 who will also comment as more on 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.850
 this image that the main character 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.920
 of the game we got a girl goes to 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.120
 be able to be customizable at least one 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.500
 little because there are excellent images 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.820
 different from how we want guys 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.740
 three totally different images 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.810
 although you can not customize much 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.150
 but it's something I do not know if later 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.040
 to portray more or they'll leave us though 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.330
 let's also see that they can be 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.400
 have now in the game 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.800
 let's see manning diagonally is not only 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.960
 a grid for the right but that 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.780
 finally after 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.520
 we can move sideways this 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.200
 it is very interesting the truth that you 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.850
 I had to do something like that for the 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.360
 style because if not with three times 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.940
 take advantage of the movement in good crusade 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.170
 so that you see the new trailer with all 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.270
 the information because it has come out but not 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.890
 they let me publish it on my channel I leave you 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.850
 the description so that you have it equal 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.340
 watch the video 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.810
 of everything that basically is the 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.350
 information that I am saying too 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.670
 the pokemon boxes have been revealed 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.290
 xy because we have personally seen me 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.880
 they like many are very cool about 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.680
 everything about pokemon and what if I do not 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.140
 like clearer because man x that is a 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.360
 little more daring but good and has also 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.560
 been revealed 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.170
 the new one for the region that also 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.450
 you have here because mont xy review that 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.950
 Carlos is the region of Carlos with 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.510
 Field least the Japanese are 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.239
 dollars that markets have here in 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.370
 map and well I do not know very well what will be 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.520
 every thing appears once quite 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.150
 It does not look quite varied and I have a 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.400
 A little of all 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.130
 we see because I do not know what there is as a 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.050
 kind of site here up the tower 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.980
 eiffel in the middle of the data because I've already 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.570
 said that is in the shan state 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.460
 franciosa that if this the eiffel tower 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.390
 we see what seems to be the league little more 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.120
 to the right 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.620
 the police do not know what will be but good a 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.080
 shortly after also by dÃ©nia and it seems 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.889
 be a town like that rather for the 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.689
 mountain a water village 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.689
 there are many good looks a lot 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:56.900
 but I do not know when you have it here and how 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.099
 I tell you then you do not have there too 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.499
 If you want to see it, he left it in the 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.090
 description and good basically it seems 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:03.860
 that little by little infant the decalogues 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.389
 because it's very good that they said 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.939
 this announcement of the four because 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:09.469
 monologues and not sometimes the mission or more 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:10.849
 these same health guaguas as os 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:13.069
 I say the pokemon this we can see 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.229
 over him is not good because more was 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:17.150
 simply this is the game that stands out 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.590
 If, for example, we can 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.229
 ride in this as with the cast few 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.969
 it is not known so I have no idea but 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.620
 is very curious the truth is very is very 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:26.569
 curious our of guaguas to see to know 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.250
 the names in the western names 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:30.259
 in English in Spanish because it would be 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.029
 You can know the names of these PokÃ©mon 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.620
 so good at the moment there are not many 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:35.389
 neither more nor have x and pokemon and 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.069
 but I think this is later with 5 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.409
 to comment as I say 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:41.120
 I'm so sorry for not uploading 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.040

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.280

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.500
 upload videos and more 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.510

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.010

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.600

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.400
 it will interest many so nothing 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.360
 I hope you see it and as always
