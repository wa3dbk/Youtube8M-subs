00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
opinion is not the biggest month but

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.099 
opinion is not the biggest month but
it's<00:00:23.130> not<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.279> smallest<00:00:23.550> either<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.720> mug

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
it's not the smallest either is a mug

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.370 
it's not the smallest either is a mug
very<00:00:25.590> that's<00:00:26.369> just<00:00:26.609> one<00:00:26.970> line<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.570> there's

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
very that's just one line and there's

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.349 
very that's just one line and there's
just<00:00:28.650> two<00:00:28.830> sides<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> map<00:00:29.699> there's<00:00:30.119> no

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
just two sides to the map there's no

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.799 
just two sides to the map there's no
like<00:00:30.630> left<00:00:31.170> corner<00:00:31.740> or<00:00:32.090> people<00:00:33.090> fight<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.600> this

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
like left corner or people fight on this

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.270 
like left corner or people fight on this
added<00:00:34.110> muffled<00:00:34.500> outside<00:00:34.920> there's<00:00:35.130> only

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
added muffled outside there's only

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.910 
added muffled outside there's only
basically<00:00:35.880> two<00:00:36.120> sides<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:37.079> you're<00:00:37.530> either<00:00:37.559> in

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
basically two sides so you're either in

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.830 
basically two sides so you're either in
the<00:00:38.040> middle<00:00:38.370> or<00:00:38.550> you're<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.120> edges<00:00:39.690> so

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
the middle or you're on the edges so

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.840 
the middle or you're on the edges so
basically<00:00:40.440> three<00:00:40.710> sides<00:00:40.950> but<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.520> muck<00:00:41.730> is

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
basically three sides but this muck is

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.330 
basically three sides but this muck is
really<00:00:42.180> sick<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.510> my<00:00:42.540> opinion<00:00:42.899> it's<00:00:43.829> more<00:00:44.219> of

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
really sick in my opinion it's more of

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.279 
really sick in my opinion it's more of
an<00:00:44.430> assault<00:00:44.700> rifle<00:00:44.789> map<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.600> there<00:00:45.750> are<00:00:45.899> lines

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
an assault rifle map but there are lines

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.229 
an assault rifle map but there are lines
of<00:00:46.500> sight<00:00:46.680> where<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.190> need<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> submachine<00:00:48.000> gun

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
of sight where you need a submachine gun

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.389 
of sight where you need a submachine gun
you<00:00:48.510> don't<00:00:48.690> exactly<00:00:49.020> need<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.070> helps

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
you don't exactly need it but it helps

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.430 
you don't exactly need it but it helps
for<00:00:50.670> those<00:00:50.820> going<00:00:51.149> fast<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:51.960> here<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.260> can

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
something right so the edge of this side

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.670 
something right so the edge of this side
i<00:01:17.970> climbed<00:01:18.540> onto<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:18.930> because<00:01:19.290> I've<00:01:19.409> seen<00:01:19.439> an

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
i climbed onto this because I've seen an

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.960 
i climbed onto this because I've seen an
enemy<00:01:19.950> doing<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.520> should<00:01:20.670> have<00:01:20.700> seen<00:01:20.909> that

enemy doing it you should have seen that
before<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.780> decided<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.500> go<00:01:22.740> for<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.250> no

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
before so I decided to go for it and no

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.090 
before so I decided to go for it and no
one<00:01:23.759> actually<00:01:24.150> knows<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.840> place<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.320> didn't

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
one actually knows that place I didn't

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.550 
one actually knows that place I didn't
notice<00:01:26.430> anyone<00:01:26.939> climbing<00:01:27.840> up<00:01:28.080> there<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.409> this

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
notice anyone climbing up there and this

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.280 
notice anyone climbing up there and this
is<00:01:28.710> just<00:01:28.829> my<00:01:28.979> first<00:01:29.220> game<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.840> I<00:01:30.840> don't<00:01:31.079> think

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
is just my first game and I don't think

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.440 
is just my first game and I don't think
if<00:01:31.380> I'd<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.710> position<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.340> probably<00:01:33.090> wouldn't

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
if I'd that position I probably wouldn't

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.020 
if I'd that position I probably wouldn't
have<00:01:33.540> done<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.810> code<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.650> yeah<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.520> could<00:01:35.939> have

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
have done this code so yeah I could have

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.130 
have done this code so yeah I could have
got<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> nuclear<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.689> game<00:01:36.869> but<00:01:37.020> my

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
got a nuclear this game but my

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.020 
got a nuclear this game but my
killstreaks<00:01:37.380> did<00:01:37.770> too<00:01:37.920> much<00:01:38.100> work<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:38.970> I

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
killstreaks did too much work and so I

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.490 
killstreaks did too much work and so I
could<00:01:39.240> get<00:01:39.329> too<00:01:39.509> aggressive<00:01:39.600> at<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.049> end<00:01:40.290> and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
could get too aggressive at the end and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.060 
could get too aggressive at the end and
it<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:41.700> went<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:43.229> complete<00:01:43.380> opposite<00:01:43.860> way

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
it just went the complete opposite way

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.859 
it just went the complete opposite way
so<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.790> anyways<00:01:45.060> I'm<00:01:45.180> really<00:01:45.479> proud<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.689> this

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
so but anyways I'm really proud of this

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.149 
so but anyways I'm really proud of this
gameplay<00:01:46.110> because<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:46.619> something<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.040> show

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
gameplay because it's something to show

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
best ways to play this map so I'll

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.749 
best ways to play this map so I'll
couple<00:02:07.229> more<00:02:07.409> games<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.979> like<00:02:08.340> three<00:02:08.640> or

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
couple more games on it like three or

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.750 
couple more games on it like three or
four<00:02:08.819> more<00:02:09.090> games<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.629> on<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.679> map<00:02:11.160> yeah<00:02:11.580> I

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
four more games on it on the map yeah I

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.250 
four more games on it on the map yeah I
figured<00:02:12.090> out<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.959> best

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
figured out that is the best

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.770 
figured out that is the best
hold<00:02:13.650> down<00:02:13.860> on<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.360> right-hand<00:02:15.360> side<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.569> the

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
hold down on the right-hand side of the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.220 
hold down on the right-hand side of the
map<00:02:15.930> works<00:02:16.200> as<00:02:16.470> well<00:02:16.530> but<00:02:17.209> it's<00:02:18.209> not<00:02:18.659> that<00:02:18.959> good

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
map works as well but it's not that good

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.289 
map works as well but it's not that good
another<00:02:20.159> spot<00:02:20.430> which<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.790> really<00:02:20.970> good<00:02:21.150> is

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
another spot which is really good is

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.789 
another spot which is really good is
where<00:02:21.480> I'm<00:02:21.629> going<00:02:21.810> now<00:02:21.959> on<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.290> ground<00:02:22.530> here

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
where I'm going now on the ground here

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.920 
where I'm going now on the ground here
if<00:02:23.129> you<00:02:23.340> stay<00:02:23.549> on<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.819> ground<00:02:23.970> here<00:02:24.180> there's

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
if you stay on the ground here there's

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.240 
if you stay on the ground here there's
that<00:02:25.110> some<00:02:25.319> really<00:02:25.560> good<00:02:25.680> head<00:02:25.860> which<00:02:26.099> is

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
that some really good head which is

that some really good head which is
right<00:02:26.400> behind<00:02:26.549> this<00:02:26.819> Count<00:02:27.090> for<00:02:27.269> example<00:02:27.720> if

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
right behind this Count for example if

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.020 
right behind this Count for example if
you<00:02:28.170> go<00:02:28.319> down<00:02:28.470> for<00:02:29.189> there's<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.519> couple<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.879> more

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
you go down for there's a couple of more

you go down for there's a couple of more
cans<00:02:30.299> and<00:02:30.620> you<00:02:31.620> can<00:02:31.799> climb<00:02:32.010> on<00:02:32.159> the<00:02:32.250> side<00:02:32.459> of

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
cans and you can climb on the side of

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.149 
cans and you can climb on the side of
this<00:02:32.760> as<00:02:32.940> well<00:02:33.060> i'm<00:02:33.209> pretty<00:02:33.510> sure<00:02:33.769> not<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:34.950> show

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
this as well i'm pretty sure not to show

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.589 
this as well i'm pretty sure not to show
but<00:02:35.340> i'm<00:02:35.610> pretty<00:02:35.790> sure<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.060> can<00:02:36.329> because<00:02:36.480> i've

I always say that with the maps but then

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.000 
I always say that with the maps but then
it<00:03:28.620> comes<00:03:29.069> to<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.370> on<00:03:29.810> exes<00:03:30.810> people<00:03:31.530> find<00:03:31.739> ways

it comes to it on exes people find ways

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.550 
it comes to it on exes people find ways
to<00:03:32.220> wreck<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.609> map<00:03:32.819> they<00:03:33.060> do<00:03:33.180> something<00:03:33.840> on<00:03:34.139> at

to wreck the map they do something on at

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.199 
to wreck the map they do something on at
the<00:03:34.799> moment<00:03:34.949> though<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.489> maps<00:03:35.669> really<00:03:36.030> good
