 years I use 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.900
 shooter is not so convenient to play for the fact that 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.380

 well, yes , this one is also lying here 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:50.100
 remarkably the most dumbest 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:53.410
 the keyboard is very small straight 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.340
 small is connected only by 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.930
 bluetooth 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.700
 but I managed to play on it Dothan 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.480
 true wild lags were nothing 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.030
 loaded you ask that this here 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:12.840

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.609
 we put 7 on the concert who canceled 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.609
 because of the situation in Ukraine 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.380
 but it will take place in July or June 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:28.030
 I have a man who gives me all this 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:31.750
 will also say some asked about 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:36.070
 my voice sometimes gets a voice 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:38.620
 so specific how would i be here 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.930
 can be seen so specific only because of 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.640
 the fact that I process it I mean 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.530
 have to remove the noise and my 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.020
 computers which are naturally not 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:52.900
 new who is standing there right 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:55.360
 now i will try ikonochka here it is there 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.900
 I remove the computer from the noise 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.430
 constantly that is it is very noisy straight 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.250
 impossible noisy 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.070
 I will embed as far as possible 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.370
 footage from my video camera 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:11.460
 true they are not very good quality but 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.220
 what is that there is also here still lies 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.990
 such a wonderful soap dish 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.060
 which is me for some holiday 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.010
 gave 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.110
 unfortunately I wanted to put it here 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.270
 here 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.290
 and write but for some reason she doesn't 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:31.440
 supports flash drive which was 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:33.600
 Nikon cell I do not know why but not 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.260
 supports she does not want to work and 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.070
 Record normal video on this camera 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:43.280
 but on this flash drive 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:47.610
 and everything works for me 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:50.370
 screwdriver we and a bunch of different all 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.780
 different bolts is all from the company 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.460
 there are these walls 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:59.420
 side and from the previous cooler yes I 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.530
 the class hit the cooler with a finger 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:07.250
 so what else is there 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.250
 various sources this for cameras this 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.780
 quietly shorter that is i mean nick for 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.900
 cameras and you think for now I wanted 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:18.900
 I thought that I had 2 unnecessarily to 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.730
 you can't see it it's connected by computer i 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.700
 thought it was shorter 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:26.010
 I have time to my phone or even to something 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.600
 it turns out it was a camera in general I 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.850
 disconnected own camera and me 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.370
 I had to reboot the records for gluing 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:38.070
 And so on 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:40.260
 yes here and so about system 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:45.330
