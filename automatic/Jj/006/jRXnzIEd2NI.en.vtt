fluently the Granada is honestly the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.199

most beautiful city I've ever been to
and<00:02:18.310> that's<00:02:19.310> probably<00:02:19.849> my<00:02:20.209> favorite<00:02:20.720> place

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.270 
I've I felt extremely happy in Granada
and<00:02:24.319> I<00:02:24.470> think<00:02:24.769> that<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.280> very<00:02:25.880> close<00:02:26.180> second<00:02:26.750> is

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
and I think that a very close second is

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.880 
and I think that a very close second is
Valencia<00:02:28.280> which<00:02:28.640> is<00:02:28.790> also<00:02:28.940> in<00:02:29.269> Spain<00:02:29.890> but

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
Valencia which is also in Spain but

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.430 
Valencia which is also in Spain but
obviously<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:32.000> have<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.599> say<00:02:32.780> that<00:02:32.810> port<00:02:33.319> of

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
obviously I have to say that port of

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.590 
money to go I worked at a bank and so
going<00:04:44.260> to<00:04:44.320> Spain<00:04:44.620> with<00:04:44.650> my<00:04:45.010> gap<00:04:45.250> year<00:04:45.280> and<00:04:46.120> I

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
going to Spain with my gap year and I

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.080 
going to Spain with my gap year and I
think<00:04:46.900> that<00:04:47.169> if<00:04:47.350> money<00:04:47.950> is<00:04:48.160> an<00:04:48.190> issue<00:04:48.430> you<00:04:48.880> can

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
think that if money is an issue you can

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.680 
think that if money is an issue you can
always<00:04:49.690> sort<00:04:50.200> that<00:04:50.289> out<00:04:50.380> you<00:04:50.590> can<00:04:50.800> work<00:04:51.100> if
