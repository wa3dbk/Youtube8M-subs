turbo<00:00:09.960> diesel<00:00:10.769> how<00:00:11.370> it<00:00:11.519> can<00:00:11.670> pump<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:12.030> bunch<00:00:12.240> of

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
turbo diesel how it can pump a bunch of

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.930 
turbo diesel how it can pump a bunch of

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
sludge into your fuel bowl we are at

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.369 
sludge into your fuel bowl we are at
they<00:00:15.059> decided<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.599> clean<00:00:15.870> out<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.170> fuel

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
they decided to clean out the fuel

they decided to clean out the fuel
filter<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.699> believe<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.300> can<00:00:18.359> see<00:00:18.660> just

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
filter and I believe you can see just

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.650 
filter and I believe you can see just
why<00:00:19.460> it's<00:00:20.460> still<00:00:20.699> ran<00:00:20.880> if<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.330> can<00:00:21.480> imagine

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
why it's still ran if you can imagine

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.769 
why it's still ran if you can imagine
this<00:00:21.960> ran<00:00:22.350> fairly<00:00:22.680> well<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:23.070> consider<00:00:23.779> problem

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
this ran fairly well to consider problem

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.029 
this ran fairly well to consider problem
would<00:00:24.869> come<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.140> go<00:00:25.320> on<00:00:25.529> intermediate

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
would come and go on intermediate

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.560 
would come and go on intermediate
occasions<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.820> look<00:00:26.939> at<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.150> glob<00:00:27.390> right

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
occasions and look at that glob right

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.950

there<00:00:27.720> folks<00:00:27.900> but<00:00:28.109> basically<00:00:29.840> truck<00:00:30.840> would

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
there folks but basically truck would

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.870 
there folks but basically truck would
run<00:00:31.140> fine<00:00:31.380> for<00:00:31.679> an<00:00:31.740> interval<00:00:32.070> get<00:00:32.460> warmed<00:00:32.759> up

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
run fine for an interval get warmed up

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.610 
run fine for an interval get warmed up
and<00:00:33.059> then<00:00:33.180> have<00:00:33.540> occasional<00:00:33.989> losses<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.380> power

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
and then have occasional losses of power

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.440 
and then have occasional losses of power

I<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:41.040> see<00:00:41.190> here<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:41.969> we<00:00:42.570> believe<00:00:42.840> why

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
I can see here it's just we believe why

to have developed sentients at some

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.709 
to have developed sentients at some
point<00:00:50.219> or<00:00:50.340> another<00:00:50.370> probably<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.390> think<00:00:51.629> for
