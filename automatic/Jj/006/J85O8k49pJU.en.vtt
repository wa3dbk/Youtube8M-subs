00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.230
 yes a bit legally wrong 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.469
 but okay and I should get the sound 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.610
 make quieter has my box would be the 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.260
 old wants the hole jesus a boy 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:48.000
 well that is set up in the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:49.260
 items and managed yes I should the map 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.550
 do not mention that and that 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.000
 I respect even when we do 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.920
 does not want to be mentioned 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.539
 but what do you do if you do not feel like it 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.570
 on the exercise has increased slightly 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.000
 but he still finds the gold wing 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.290
 a description is not lacking 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.720
 the downloadlink in the description too 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:14.310
 put 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:15.600
 and zack and zack and physicality 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.009
 I relish the exercise I should just 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.210
 continue to use okay I have no desire 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.850
 I almost have that on jerman 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.040
 never be that adventurous anyway 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.869
 but made well so first time 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.400
 we are fair, we play very by 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.930
 wrong right okay we already had 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.360
 times a map wood print will be right 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:39.030
 stone pressure plate wrong you have been 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:47.149
 the 18th third on youtube was right 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:47.149
 wooden boards stone plate no since the 17th 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.049
 which is not true I am 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.509
 actually since the 5 march on 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.399
 youtube from 2011 but of course you can 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.439
 you still give if you lp channel for 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.070
 others ultimately except minecraft though 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:09.060
 well for minecraft channel that's right 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:12.830
 right there are three different ones 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.830
 types super flat 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:19.010
 bavaria xl is only in the dings in 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:25.569
 In the snapshot I do not know 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.569
 Quarry plate was fall fast pre 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:34.159
 types spring which warns for that 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:38.720
 I would like to super flat and now 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:39.829
 which does not matter but I do not have any 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.819
 if ever seen that you first 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.379
 with built-in 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.129
 it is clear that we are too boring 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:48.700
 but well I hope my first band has 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.700
 she likes 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:57.799
 ok yes that was extremely short 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.150
 that my bed is looking for me with it 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:07.480
 always my problems with finding the 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:16.639
 new codes here had right there and 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:24.560
 pure pc village juhu a npc there it is 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:26.949
 so wonderful where i think that will be 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.949
 go air 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:34.790
 who would have thought it and now somewhere 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:42.639
 in nowhere, yes, and then I have myself 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:46.389
 into the earth and we are counting now 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.389
 horror stories of this darkness 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.889
 So once it was a map that was short 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.199
 and not long 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.090
 that was played through quickly because I 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:02.780
 was so short and not long 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.849
 that's why she does not get one like that 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.799
 good note because she was not short either 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.810
 complain 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.879
 I have to think about what was in there 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.419
 this map because she was short and not 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.629
 long 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:16.970
 There was a job at Rheinpark Zwei 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:21.330
 Quiz questions that were tuned to me 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.919
 at least one of them and then 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.810
 there was still a tnt explosions one 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.150
 little my rider and this room 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:32.530
 where you want him a quartz from 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:35.259
 minecraft went to minecraft went to 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.470
 danny webb was short and had to click 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.340
 not long 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.710
 what do we learn from this 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.770
 the man was short i lay on with 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.470
 the shit I'll be yes that 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.060
 Gabmann portillo it believes two ask 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.620
 nobody has ever really had such a thing 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.630
 good christmann is already there 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.180
 was two people against chris was 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.669
 also great but yes so christa marx 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.229
 that the world was for me yes that was 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.970
 Great there is a plus point we were one 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.370
 Quiz that's what a question if really 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.419
 was tailored to me 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.669
 but spelling errors everything was okay 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.080
 there you have what you have there 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.729
 somewhere where a krad was always 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.520
 the map now may be one still has 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:16.870
 like my law firms are supposed to fill 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.060
 and yes tnt in the end was quite okay that 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.930
 Do not bring them back to you 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:28.270
 Michael was taken out of the chest 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:29.320
 saying good-bye back out 44 was 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.880
 not exciting is there was one 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.800
 another part is for me you have 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.220
 realized that there was for a second couple 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.690
 the mine kartfahren was okay I mean 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.460
 It was not a story but it is better than that 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.590
 if only one jump does not just get 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.789
 I just do not like that and 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.740
 I said that too, but let's say yes 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.570
 graciously , five or six are forgiven 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.880
 Since I really only from Japan 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.610
 insist or the map is not for me 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.919
 There's 04 and who he means by that 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.530
 that is unfair and someone says yes 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:01.210
 actually earned or so because of the 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.440
 possible wing I was indeed still my 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.699
 I do not give much that 's mine 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.840
 Opinion for that is the comments there 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:07.539
 can you express your opinion 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.190
 i would say those with few and short ones 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:12.900
 not long and until next time 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.900
 mistake and see and ciao
