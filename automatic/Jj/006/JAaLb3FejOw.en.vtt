00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.980 
believe it's called the dragon something
I'm<00:03:35.890> not<00:03:36.010> too<00:03:36.160> sure<00:03:36.400> well<00:03:37.330> chicken<00:03:37.570> out<00:03:37.780> today

because<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.650> I've<00:03:38.830> Scotty<00:03:39.310> still<00:03:40.180> hasn't

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
because the I've Scotty still hasn't

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.030 
because the I've Scotty still hasn't
been<00:03:40.540> released<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:41.170> I<00:03:41.380> believe<00:03:41.680> that's<00:03:41.830> going

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
been released and I believe that's going

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.320 
been released and I believe that's going
to<00:03:42.160> be<00:03:42.250> released<00:03:42.610> before<00:03:42.820> the<00:03:43.030> end<00:03:43.180> of<00:03:43.240> the

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
to be released before the end of the

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.820 
to be released before the end of the
tournament<00:03:43.570> so<00:03:43.960> I'm<00:03:44.230> really<00:03:44.500> looking<00:03:44.590> forward

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
tournament so I'm really looking forward

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:51.780 
tournament so I'm really looking forward
to<00:03:45.190> that<00:03:45.220> I<00:03:49.050> think<00:03:50.050> I'll<00:03:50.200> probably<00:03:50.350> do<00:03:50.560> a<00:03:50.790> quite

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:59.900 
to that I think I'll probably do a quite
a<00:03:51.820> large<00:03:52.060> opening<00:03:52.540> for<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:52.930> for<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.440> next<00:03:53.680> one
