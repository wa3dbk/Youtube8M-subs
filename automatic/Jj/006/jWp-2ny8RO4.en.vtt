if you you pull that back you'll see the

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.650 
if you you pull that back you'll see the
RAM<00:01:35.830> module<00:01:36.280> right<00:01:36.490> in<00:01:36.640> there<00:01:36.880> this<00:01:37.480> is

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
RAM module right in there this is

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.720 
RAM module right in there this is
actually<00:01:37.840> already<00:01:38.260> the<00:01:38.620> upgraded<00:01:39.100> module<00:01:39.520> I'm

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
actually already the upgraded module I'm

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.090 
actually already the upgraded module I'm
upgraded<00:01:40.630> this<00:01:40.750> one<00:01:40.960> from<00:01:41.170> one<00:01:41.470> gig<00:01:41.710> to<00:01:41.920> two

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
upgraded this one from one gig to two

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.370 
upgraded this one from one gig to two
gigs<00:01:42.400> which<00:01:42.880> is<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.330> maximum<00:01:43.660> and<00:01:43.930> supports

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
gigs which is the maximum and supports

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.470 
gigs which is the maximum and supports
but<00:01:44.920> I'm<00:01:45.130> just<00:01:45.430> to<00:01:45.550> give<00:01:45.700> you<00:01:45.820> an<00:01:45.910> idea<00:01:46.030> of<00:01:46.360> the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
but I'm just to give you an idea of the

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.190 
but I'm just to give you an idea of the
process<00:01:48.450> when<00:01:49.450> you<00:01:49.540> get<00:01:49.690> in<00:01:49.810> there<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.020> you

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
process when you get in there and you

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.540 
process when you get in there and you
see<00:01:50.410> your<00:01:50.530> RAM<00:01:50.710> module<00:01:51.070> in<00:01:51.130> there<00:01:51.280> you'll<00:01:51.430> see

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
see your RAM module in there you'll see

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.010 
see your RAM module in there you'll see
these<00:01:51.700> two<00:01:51.760> little<00:01:52.090> clips<00:01:52.360> right<00:01:52.720> here<00:01:52.900> and

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
these two little clips right here and

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.500 
these two little clips right here and
you<00:01:53.110> want<00:01:53.260> to<00:01:53.350> push<00:01:53.860> those<00:01:54.160> out<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:55.210> away<00:01:55.450> from

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
you want to push those out and away from

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.240 
you want to push those out and away from
the<00:01:55.810> RAM<00:01:55.990> module<00:01:56.500> and<00:01:57.330> it<00:01:58.330> will<00:01:58.479> flip<00:01:58.810> up<00:01:59.250> like

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
the RAM module and it will flip up like

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.390 
the RAM module and it will flip up like
so<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:01.540> once<00:02:02.020> it<00:02:02.140> flips<00:02:02.410> up<00:02:02.560> you<00:02:03.070> can<00:02:03.220> simply

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
so and once it flips up you can simply

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.790 
so and once it flips up you can simply
pull<00:02:03.940> it<00:02:03.970> out<00:02:04.180> and<00:02:04.870> then<00:02:05.380> you'll<00:02:05.500> take<00:02:05.650> your

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
pull it out and then you'll take your

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.730 
pull it out and then you'll take your
new<00:02:05.860> one<00:02:06.220> and<00:02:07.090> you'll<00:02:07.870> stick<00:02:08.140> it<00:02:08.260> in<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.500> same

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
new one and you'll stick it in the same

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.640 
new one and you'll stick it in the same
way<00:02:08.950> you<00:02:09.010> took<00:02:09.280> that<00:02:09.460> one<00:02:09.520> out<00:02:10.350> slide<00:02:11.350> it<00:02:11.380> into

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
way you took that one out slide it into

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.300 
way you took that one out slide it into
the<00:02:11.860> slots<00:02:12.130> make<00:02:13.030> sure<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.360> seated<00:02:13.690> firm<00:02:14.310> you

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
the slots make sure to seated firm you

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.979 
the slots make sure to seated firm you
can<00:02:15.489> you<00:02:15.790> can<00:02:15.940> give<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:16.239> a<00:02:16.300> pretty<00:02:16.480> good<00:02:16.570> push

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
can you can give it a pretty good push

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.540 
can you can give it a pretty good push
actually<00:02:17.500> you'd<00:02:17.650> be<00:02:17.680> surprised<00:02:20.250> once<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.370> got

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
actually you'd be surprised once you got

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.770 
actually you'd be surprised once you got
it<00:02:21.700> once<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.000> got<00:02:22.150> it<00:02:22.239> seat<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.540> in<00:02:22.630> there

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
it once you got it seat it in there

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.990 
it once you got it seat it in there
pretty<00:02:22.930> well<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:23.290> push<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.680> down<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.790> those

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
pretty well you push it down and those

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.810 
pretty well you push it down and those
two<00:02:25.239> clips<00:02:25.480> should<00:02:25.780> lock<00:02:25.989> right<00:02:26.230> in<00:02:26.350> place<00:02:26.820> let

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
two clips should lock right in place let

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.059 
two clips should lock right in place let
that<00:02:28.000> flip<00:02:28.300> back<00:02:28.510> on<00:02:28.720> over

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
that flip back on over

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:36.690 
that flip back on over
and<00:02:30.670> put<00:02:31.329> the<00:02:31.420> cover<00:02:31.629> back<00:02:31.719> on<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:36.040> that's<00:02:36.219> all

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
and put the cover back on and that's all

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:50.089 
and put the cover back on and that's all
there<00:02:36.969> is<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.390> it

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.770 

and<00:02:51.099> you<00:02:51.220> want<00:02:51.819> to<00:02:51.879> stick<00:02:52.120> your<00:02:52.150> battery<00:02:52.599> back

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
and you want to stick your battery back

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.940 
and you want to stick your battery back
in<00:02:52.930> place

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.430 

lock<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.330> and<00:03:00.330> then<00:03:00.630> test<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.110> out<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.290> make

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
lock it and then test it out to make

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:09.660 
lock it and then test it out to make
sure<00:03:01.800> everything<00:03:02.430> went<00:03:02.610> okay

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.910 

and<00:03:10.660> we<00:03:10.840> have<00:03:10.990> a<00:03:11.020> boot<00:03:11.230> screen<00:03:11.530> that's<00:03:11.800> a

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
and we have a boot screen that's a

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.900 
and we have a boot screen that's a
pretty<00:03:12.160> good<00:03:12.370> sign

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
pretty good sign

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.270 
pretty good sign
sometimes<00:03:13.690> it's<00:03:13.959> easy<00:03:14.319> to<00:03:14.590> just<00:03:14.740> go<00:03:14.920> into<00:03:15.100> the

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
sometimes it's easy to just go into the

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.970 
sometimes it's easy to just go into the
BIOS<00:03:15.670> and<00:03:15.700> on<00:03:16.209> check<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.810> see<00:03:17.020> if<00:03:17.260> if<00:03:17.800> the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
BIOS and on check the see if if the

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.250 
BIOS and on check the see if if the
memory<00:03:18.280> has<00:03:18.340> been<00:03:18.520> added<00:03:18.819> up<00:03:18.970> in<00:03:19.120> there<00:03:19.330> but<00:03:19.510> I

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
memory has been added up in there but I

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.900 
memory has been added up in there but I
already<00:03:20.860> know<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:21.010> this<00:03:21.280> was<00:03:21.459> going<00:03:21.640> to<00:03:21.730> work

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
already know that this was going to work

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:29.640 
already know that this was going to work
so<00:03:22.270> I'm<00:03:22.810> pretty<00:03:23.130> confident<00:03:24.130> with<00:03:24.190> that<00:03:24.400> effect

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.280 

and<00:03:30.650> there<00:03:30.950> you<00:03:31.099> have<00:03:31.280> it<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:32.810> um<00:03:33.050> that

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
and there you have it that um that

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.650 
and there you have it that um that
upgrade<00:03:33.709> by<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:33.950> way<00:03:34.190> probably<00:03:34.580> at<00:03:35.269> least<00:03:35.510> a

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
upgrade by the way probably at least a

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.500 
upgrade by the way probably at least a
double<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.140> boot<00:03:36.319> time<00:03:36.530> on<00:03:36.860> this<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:37.370> most<00:03:38.360> of

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
double the boot time on this and most of

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.420 
double the boot time on this and most of
applications<00:03:39.200> on<00:03:39.379> here<00:03:39.560> start<00:03:39.980> up<00:03:40.129> much

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
applications on here start up much

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.880 
applications on here start up much
faster<00:03:40.940> now<00:03:41.090> even<00:03:41.510> to<00:03:42.019> include<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.739> web

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
faster now even to include the web

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.830 
faster now even to include the web
browser<00:03:43.190> comes<00:03:43.670> open<00:03:43.910> comes<00:03:44.269> open<00:03:44.569> a<00:03:44.690> lot
