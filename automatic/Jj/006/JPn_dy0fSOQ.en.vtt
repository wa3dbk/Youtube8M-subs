00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Hi, people today. I'll show you. 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.839
 A homemade way for us to shine 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.450
 furniture for use on furniture that 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.120
 we usually use the lustra 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.809
 furniture bought at the supermarket furniture 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.250
 of wood or those with a 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.439
 wood look 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.560
 usually when the Olympus furniture here 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.779
 At home I use only a microfiber cloth 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.029
 How is it here, and a little water 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.250
 gives to dust and gives a little 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.189
 corn but when they get very 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.410
 blurry that is when the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.620
 People want to give that special shine. 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.530
 I started using this formula zinha 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.200
 simple way in which people use the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.140
 olive oil that we buy 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.910
 to use at home even in food and 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.730
 alcohol vinegar 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.070
 the white vinegar if you do not have the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.140
 alcohol vinegar can be vinegar 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.329
 White you have at home I prefer 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.760
 use this vinegar of something here 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.789
 fully transparent for cleaning 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.580
 so you will make a good mixture 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:13.549
 simple people are very practical 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:24.259
 it's just you put look at two parts of 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:24.259
 olive oil and a part of the vinegar 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.350
 you do not have to do too much, right? 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:37.790
 is a product that we will use 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:39.590
 daily puts frei students if you 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.680
 do not have a spray it does not hurt to put 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.140
 in a pot makes less amount places 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.930
 into a pot then use the 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.909
 spray makes it easy to apply after 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.759
 just when it's time to use it, we have to 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.090
 mix saadi is just in time 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:59.390
 Spray you will use with a 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.369
 cloth preferably a cotton cloth 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.610
 in this case do not use a 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:08.090
 Microfiber The microfiber cloth is best 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.420
 without any product to use our 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.819
 polish- day homemade olive oil and 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.920
 vinegar 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.190
 you're preferably using one like this 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.920
 of cotton can be that sack pole 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.200
 It could be a little piece of some sheet. 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.989
 Do you want to enjoy some shirt? 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.959
 Husband is what has already been hurt and does not 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.570
 To give or to enjoy, you cut and 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.870
 makes a cotton cloth is for power 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.000
 shampoo the furniture and when applying the 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.400
 your wooden furniture is only you spray 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.200
 in the cloth is not directly on the 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.329
 wood and apply 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.850
 I'll show you how it is. 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.769
 what do i do here then people shine 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.989
 furniture is not a product that we should 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.640
 use daily or purchased in the 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.989
 supermarket nor the homemade 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.600
 then you first take the powder 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.549
 the excess mobile point with a cloth of 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.540
 microfiber cloth you use 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.540
 in your house 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:15.859
 then take your cotton cloth 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:19.430
 mix comes with real estate and applies 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:23.239
 on the priest does not take much not 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.870
 I need to apply water on the cloth and 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.870
 after 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:34.280
 passes on his property in vinegar 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:38.750
 help remove the dirt and oil is that 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.870
 will give the shine we apply spreads 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.300
 well in the property 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:49.180
 We wait a few seconds or a little bit, right? 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:53.660
 to beat the way the mobile will absorb 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:58.960
 and then with another side of the cloth or with 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:02.590
 another dry cloth we pull the shine 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.590
 pass again 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.290
 You can do this process. 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.020
 monthly 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:18.620
 if you have a mobile that does not know if it is 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:21.200
 an antique furniture or some type of wood 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.100
 that has not been treated does not have 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.050
 varnish 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.990
 then you test in a small area 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.910
 to see how it's going to stay in your 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.780
 property is not to run the risk of 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.870
 screw up 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.840
 People, I think it works well, it's a 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.730
 Easy product for us to make cheap 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.580
 this way I'm showing here he is 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.650
 has ancient 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.500
 You see, I'll try to visualize 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.650
 he has some marks for being old 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.360
 but for you to see the brightness that remains and 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.940
 this is it folks stay here with us 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.680
