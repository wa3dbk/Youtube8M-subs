00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.629 

this<00:00:00.450> trick<00:00:00.719> is<00:00:00.900> called<00:00:01.199> leg<00:00:01.530> orbits<00:00:01.979> and<00:00:02.250> it

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
this trick is called leg orbits and it

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:14.419 
this trick is called leg orbits and it
looks<00:00:02.790> like<00:00:02.850> this<00:00:03.060> so<00:00:12.440> an<00:00:13.440> orbit<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:13.950> any<00:00:14.190> time

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
looks like this so an orbit is any time

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.939 
looks like this so an orbit is any time
a<00:00:14.580> yo-yo<00:00:14.730> goes<00:00:14.880> around<00:00:15.509> your<00:00:15.690> body<00:00:15.890> part<00:00:16.890> of

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
a yo-yo goes around your body part of

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.240 
a yo-yo goes around your body part of
your<00:00:17.039> body<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:18.230> it's<00:00:19.230> very<00:00:19.380> similar<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.800> a

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
your body and it's very similar to a

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.470 
your body and it's very similar to a
trick<00:00:20.490> we've<00:00:20.640> already<00:00:20.820> learned<00:00:21.060> just<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
trick we've already learned just the

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.720 
trick we've already learned just the
barrel<00:00:21.720> rolls<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.010> case<00:00:23.250> instead<00:00:23.490> of

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
barrel rolls and in this case instead of

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.730 
barrel rolls and in this case instead of
the<00:00:23.910> yo-yo<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.539> around<00:00:24.810> your<00:00:24.990> finger<00:00:25.289> it's

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
the yo-yo going around your finger it's

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.620 
the yo-yo going around your finger it's
going<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.010> go<00:00:26.160> around<00:00:26.279> your<00:00:26.519> leg<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.480> when

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
going to go around your leg and so when

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.019 
going to go around your leg and so when
you're<00:00:27.750> first<00:00:27.869> working<00:00:28.349> on<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.500> trick

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
you're first working on this trick

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.939 
you're first working on this trick
probably<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.330> easiest<00:00:30.689> way<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.929> do<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.439> to

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
probably the easiest way to do it is to

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.500 
probably the easiest way to do it is to
just<00:00:31.980> put<00:00:32.309> your<00:00:32.489> leg<00:00:32.669> right<00:00:32.850> over<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.210> yo-yo

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
just put your leg right over the yo-yo

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.959 
just put your leg right over the yo-yo
and<00:00:34.469> just<00:00:35.040> like<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> barrel<00:00:35.520> rolls<00:00:35.760> you're

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
and just like the barrel rolls you're

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.370 
and just like the barrel rolls you're
just<00:00:36.120> going<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.300> swing<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.690> yo-yo<00:00:36.719> back<00:00:37.140> and

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
just going to swing the yo-yo back and

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.260 
just going to swing the yo-yo back and
forth<00:00:37.649> when<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.010> gets<00:00:38.190> under<00:00:38.520> your<00:00:38.760> opposite

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
forth when it gets under your opposite

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
forth when it gets under your opposite
hand<00:00:39.420> you're<00:00:39.600> just<00:00:39.629> going<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.899> pull<00:00:40.079> up<00:00:40.230> a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
hand you're just going to pull up a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.319 
hand you're just going to pull up a
little<00:00:40.440> bit<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.790> should<00:00:42.059> cause<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
little bit and that should cause the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.330 
little bit and that should cause the
yo-yo<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.899> go<00:00:43.020> right<00:00:43.200> over<00:00:43.410> your<00:00:43.530> leg<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
yo-yo to go right over your leg and and

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.860 
yo-yo to go right over your leg and and
of<00:00:44.489> course<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.059> catch<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.420> with<00:00:45.539> your

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
of course you have to catch it with your

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.529 
of course you have to catch it with your
yo-yo<00:00:46.289> hand<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.940> then<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.300> bring<00:00:48.420> it

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
yo-yo hand and then you just bring it

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.000 
yo-yo hand and then you just bring it
back<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.200> that's<00:00:49.500> pretty<00:00:49.710> much<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
back and and that's pretty much the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.680 
back and and that's pretty much the
trick<00:00:50.280> if<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.550> want<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.360> look<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.600> little

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
trick if you want it to look a little

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.970 
trick if you want it to look a little
bit<00:00:51.870> more<00:00:52.050> interesting<00:00:52.590> what<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.829> can

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
bit more interesting what you can

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.010 
bit more interesting what you can
actually<00:00:53.129> do<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.210> whip<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.719> string

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
actually do is you can whip the string

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.510 
actually do is you can whip the string
underneath<00:00:55.469> your<00:00:55.800> leg<00:00:55.949> instead<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.430> just

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
underneath your leg instead of just

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.400 
underneath your leg instead of just
moving<00:00:56.699> your<00:00:56.969> leg<00:00:57.180> over<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> top<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
moving your leg over the top of the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.010 
moving your leg over the top of the
yo-yo<00:00:59.270> so<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.390> looks<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.870> you're

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
yo-yo so that looks like this you're

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.080 
yo-yo so that looks like this you're
just<00:01:01.050> going<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.289> pop<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.530> up<00:01:01.770> whip<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.850> string

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
just going to pop it up whip the string

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.850 
just going to pop it up whip the string
underneath<00:01:03.449> your<00:01:03.750> leg<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.140> then<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.739> can

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
underneath your leg and then you can

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.260 
underneath your leg and then you can
actually<00:01:04.979> bring<00:01:05.339> your<00:01:05.489> hands<00:01:05.729> together<00:01:05.939> and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
actually bring your hands together and

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.219 
actually bring your hands together and
pull<00:01:06.450> apart<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:08.330> to<00:01:09.330> grab<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.659> string<00:01:09.810> and

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
pull apart to to grab the string and

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.710 
pull apart to to grab the string and
open<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.650> up<00:01:10.850> if<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:12.180> want<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.360> work<00:01:12.510> on

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
open it up if you just want to work on

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.600 
open it up if you just want to work on
the<00:01:12.900> whipping<00:01:13.320> motion<00:01:13.470> without<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.490> know

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the whipping motion without you know

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.190 
the whipping motion without you know
worrying<00:01:14.939> about<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.299> orbit<00:01:15.630> that's<00:01:15.810> probably

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
worrying about the orbit that's probably

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.010 
worrying about the orbit that's probably
a<00:01:16.290> good<00:01:16.439> idea<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:17.189> all<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.420> need<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:18.780> is

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
a good idea and all you need to do is

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.410 
a good idea and all you need to do is
toss<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.740> yo-yo<00:01:19.770> up<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.460> then<00:01:21.000> with<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
toss the yo-yo up and then with the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.749 
toss the yo-yo up and then with the
string<00:01:21.659> around<00:01:22.250> you're<00:01:23.250> going<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.430> bring<00:01:23.610> your

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
string around you're going to bring your

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.730 
string around you're going to bring your
hands<00:01:23.970> together<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.540> grab<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.110> string<00:01:25.470> and

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
hands together and grab the string and

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.789 
hands together and grab the string and
then<00:01:26.400> pull<00:01:26.700> your<00:01:26.820> hands<00:01:27.060> apart<00:01:27.500> just<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.619> catch

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
then pull your hands apart just to catch

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.469 
then pull your hands apart just to catch
the<00:01:28.979> yo-yo<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.549> then<00:01:29.729> when<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.270> want<00:01:30.360> to

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
the yo-yo and then when you want to

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.330 
the yo-yo and then when you want to
bring<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.720> back<00:01:30.840> into<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.140> orbit<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
bring it back into the orbit it's the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.010 
bring it back into the orbit it's the
same<00:01:32.549> thing<00:01:32.850> except<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.329> whip<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.540> string

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
same thing except you whip the string

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.590 
same thing except you whip the string
right<00:01:34.320> under<00:01:34.590> your<00:01:34.680> leg<00:01:35.390> now<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.450> can

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
right under your leg now you can

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.499 
right under your leg now you can
actually<00:01:36.840> do<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.590> reverse<00:01:37.710> motion<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:39.360> get

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
actually do the reverse motion to get

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.550 
actually do the reverse motion to get
the<00:01:39.750> orbit<00:01:40.290> back<00:01:41.250> from<00:01:41.579> under<00:01:41.850> your<00:01:41.939> leg<00:01:42.560> so

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
the orbit back from under your leg so

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.010 
the orbit back from under your leg so
all<00:01:43.680> you're<00:01:43.799> going<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.950> do<00:01:44.360> again<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.509> start

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
all you're going to do again you start

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.139 
all you're going to do again you start
it<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.470> going<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.920> you're<00:01:47.880> actually

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
it you get it going and you're actually

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.090 
it you get it going and you're actually
going<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.299> toss<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.899> yo-yo<00:01:48.930> up<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
going to toss the yo-yo up on the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.280 
going to toss the yo-yo up on the
outside<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.610> your<00:01:50.670> body<00:01:50.930> let<00:01:51.930> go<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
outside of your body let go of the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.780 
outside of your body let go of the
string<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.860> then<00:01:53.310> bring<00:01:53.490> your<00:01:53.579> hands

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
string and then bring your hands

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.280 
string and then bring your hands
together<00:01:54.000> again<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.570> open<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.869> up<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.110> catch

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
together again and open it up to catch

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.039 
together again and open it up to catch
it<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.189> it's<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.119> same<00:01:57.299> concept<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:57.990> it

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
it and it's just the same concept and it

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.330 
it and it's just the same concept and it
kind<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.290> completes<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.860> trick<00:01:59.130> where<00:01:59.310> you

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
kind of completes the trick where you

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.740 
kind of completes the trick where you
whip<00:01:59.520> under<00:01:59.820> and<00:01:59.939> then<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.090> whip<00:02:00.240> over<00:02:00.570> and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
whip under and then you whip over and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.690 
whip under and then you whip over and
that's<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:01.680> one<00:02:01.890> variation<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.610> can

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
that's just one variation that you can

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.490 
that's just one variation that you can
do<00:02:02.969> with<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.270> orbit<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.780> works<00:02:04.140> with<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.350> lot

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
do with the orbit that works with a lot

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.929 
do with the orbit that works with a lot
of<00:02:04.590> different<00:02:04.860> orbits<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.549> good<00:02:05.700> idea

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
of different orbits so it's a good idea

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.969 
of different orbits so it's a good idea
to<00:02:06.090> learn<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.390> for<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.659> trick<00:02:06.899> but<00:02:07.530> once<00:02:07.890> you

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
to learn it for this trick but once you

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.199 
to learn it for this trick but once you
get<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.160> down<00:02:08.280> it's<00:02:08.489> not<00:02:08.610> too<00:02:08.819> hard

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
get it down it's not too hard

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.289 
get it down it's not too hard
those<00:02:09.509> are<00:02:09.690> leg<00:02:09.869> orbits
