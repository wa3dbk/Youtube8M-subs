00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.340
 so let's understand why any 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.810
 high number to 0 is equal to one is and for 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.759
 This we have to give a reminder 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:24.529
 on the property is power division 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.480
 and less of the same base nÃ© 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:32.390
 for example when we were here is the 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:34.820
 high is the 4 / two elevators 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.790
 this is what we know how they are 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.100
 power but it just us 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.690
 about this, we just have to repeat the 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.570
 here repeat that the base would be 2 and 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:51.110
 subtracted the exponents ie 4 - 2 that 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.299
 here is equal to 2 square beauty 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.510
 then using this property here 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:59.119
 we can explain why any 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.519
 high number is the same so let's go 

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:03.350
 Let's get the same two right here. 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:08.409
 we could take base two as 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:12.590
 power then we know that 2/2 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:15.560
 this here is good any number / it 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.750
 even is the same and we know then 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.280
 taking that part that using the 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.780
 property is the power division 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.499
 combined with the same base 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.179
 Let's just get this part then 2/2 

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:31.490
 we know that two have as exponent 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.390
 11 and 12 in the denominator also as 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.240
 continuous 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.520
 this here is like the division of the same base 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.859
 we repeat the same basis as the people 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.499
 made here and subtracted the customers as the 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:43.869
 people did in this way that then with 

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:48.729
 minus one 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.880
 here it will be 2-0 and we saw and 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.640
 2002 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.880
 this is good here then this explanation 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.520
 very simple because any number 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.899
 high at 0 is equal to the touch 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.479
 so you guys I took the example here 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.969
 of Chile for two goals but could get 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.499
 you can pick up any other number 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:09.350
 then this simpler explanation 

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:10.700
 there is a rather empirical explanation 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.690
 through observation 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.770
 you can get here for example number 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.750
 4 16 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.570
 if you continue if you take it 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.660
 16 and make up the prime factor then 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:29.630
 we are going to have 16 here due for 2 to 1 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:32.000
 08 or 24 the two on t2 and for two let's 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:37.430
 have mine and end here 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:43.870
 All right, we know it's 16, it's nothing. 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:46.970
 more than 2 high 48 is 12 high 34 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.640
 it's 2 high two then realize that 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.680
 realize that you are decreasing unity 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.230
 attacked every time we come down here 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.950
 we are decreasing unity 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.670
 then 2 in the case here is two took or 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.610
 whether 11 is the last here gives the divisions 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.120
 nothing is more that two is decreasing 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.310
 each unit 1 - 1 is zero 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.170
 this is the middle explanation that implies 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.660
 through observation 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.190
 only by the property of the power of the 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.920
 division of power the same margin 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.050
 can also show this same staff 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.140
 I hope you have understood is the 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.140
 right to want the market to 0 is equal and 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.470
 I hope you another chance node 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.470
 thanks
