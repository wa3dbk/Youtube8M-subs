and<00:00:00.750> now<00:00:00.870> we're<00:00:01.020> going<00:00:01.170> to<00:00:01.290> take<00:00:01.469> the<00:00:01.650> template

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
and now we're going to take the template

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.510 
and now we're going to take the template
again<00:00:03.350> line<00:00:04.350> it<00:00:04.560> up<00:00:04.650> on<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:04.980> center<00:00:05.310> line<00:00:05.490> of

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
again line it up on the center line of

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.490 
again line it up on the center line of
the<00:00:05.700> center<00:00:06.060> block<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:07.670> fit<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.849> side<00:00:09.120> in<00:00:11.150> and

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
the center block and fit the side in and

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.660 
the center block and fit the side in and
make<00:00:13.500> sure<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.160> lines<00:00:14.460> up<00:00:14.880> with<00:00:16.670> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
make sure that it lines up with the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:31.220 
make sure that it lines up with the
template<00:00:18.210> on<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.949> outside<00:00:29.689> and<00:00:30.689> then<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:30.960> want

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
template on the outside and then I want

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.630 
template on the outside and then I want
to<00:00:31.320> mark<00:00:31.619> where<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:31.980> center<00:00:32.430> block<00:00:32.700> edge<00:00:34.640> hits

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
to mark where the center block edge hits

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.810 
to mark where the center block edge hits
the<00:00:36.180> side<00:00:39.230> they<00:00:40.230> using<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.800> as<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> guide<00:00:41.129> I'm

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the side they using that as a guide I'm

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.119 
the side they using that as a guide I'm
then<00:00:42.690> going<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.050> mark<00:00:43.379> on<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.860> side<00:00:45.890> at<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
then going to mark on the side at the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.660 
then going to mark on the side at the
bottom<00:00:47.579> where<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.969> center<00:00:48.329> line<00:00:48.539> crosses<00:00:49.200> it

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.160 

do<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> same<00:00:54.030> thing<00:00:54.329> with<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.629> other<00:00:54.750> side

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.979 

and<00:00:58.609> now<00:00:59.609> we<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> point<00:01:00.359> where<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.780> two

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
and now we have the point where the two

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:13.179 
and now we have the point where the two
sides<00:01:01.020> will<00:01:01.530> meet

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.289 

then<00:01:14.189> I'm<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.399> going<00:01:14.609> to<00:01:14.700> cut<00:01:14.909> those<00:01:15.119> off

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
then I'm just going to cut those off

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.190 
then I'm just going to cut those off
with<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> coping<00:01:16.049> saw<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.659> then<00:01:21.929> I<00:01:21.960> want<00:01:22.140> to

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
with a coping saw and then I want to

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.260 
with a coping saw and then I want to
take<00:01:22.320> some<00:01:22.530> 150<00:01:23.490> grit<00:01:23.700> sandpaper<00:01:25.520> I'm<00:01:26.520> going

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
take some 150 grit sandpaper I'm going

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.480 
take some 150 grit sandpaper I'm going
to<00:01:27.360> sand<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:29.549> edges<00:01:29.789> of<00:01:30.149> that<00:01:30.329> bottom<00:01:30.719> joint

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
to sand the edges of that bottom joint

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:44.809 
to sand the edges of that bottom joint
to<00:01:32.490> where<00:01:32.729> they're<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.450> good<00:01:34.200> perfect<00:01:34.709> fit<00:01:43.819> make

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
to where they're a good perfect fit make

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.289 
to where they're a good perfect fit make
sure<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.179> keep<00:01:45.360> them<00:01:45.509> nice<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.720> square<00:01:47.299> just

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
sure you keep them nice and square just

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.639 
sure you keep them nice and square just
keep<00:01:48.509> adjusting<00:01:48.659> them<00:01:49.140> till<00:01:49.349> you<00:01:49.470> get<00:01:49.590> a

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
keep adjusting them till you get a

00:01:49.649 --> 00:02:14.020 
keep adjusting them till you get a
really<00:01:49.979> good<00:01:50.159> fit

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.210 

then<00:02:15.030> just<00:02:15.210> double-check<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:16.080> fit<00:02:16.410> up

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
then just double-check that fit up

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.380 
then just double-check that fit up
against<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:17.940> center<00:02:18.270> block<00:02:19.940> make<00:02:20.940> sure<00:02:21.180> your

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
against the center block make sure your

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.460 
against the center block make sure your
sides<00:02:21.660> fit<00:02:22.020> together<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:25.230> they're

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
sides fit together and that they're

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:37.330 
sides fit together and that they're
seated<00:02:25.950> well<00:02:26.160> against<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.760> block

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.360 

and<00:02:37.910> now<00:02:38.090> that<00:02:38.300> you<00:02:38.450> have<00:02:38.599> that<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:39.080> can<00:02:39.370> put

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
and now that you have that you can put

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.190 
and now that you have that you can put
the<00:02:40.520> bottom<00:02:40.880> up<00:02:41.090> against<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.690> line<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:42.110> the

use one of the long bar clamps with a
wood<00:04:51.020> block<00:04:51.200> at<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.650> top

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.650 

and<00:04:59.300> now<00:04:59.480> I've<00:04:59.630> got<00:04:59.660> the<00:05:00.160> bottom<00:05:01.390> part<00:05:02.390> of<00:05:02.540> the

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
and now I've got the bottom part of the

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:09.190 
and now I've got the bottom part of the
side<00:05:03.940> glued<00:05:04.940> in<00:05:07.270> wipe<00:05:08.270> off<00:05:08.480> any<00:05:08.690> excess<00:05:08.810> glue

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
side glued in wipe off any excess glue

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:24.250 
side glued in wipe off any excess glue
there<00:05:17.050> and<00:05:18.050> then<00:05:18.290> go<00:05:18.530> ahead<00:05:18.860> and<00:05:20.440> glue<00:05:21.440> up<00:05:23.260> the

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
there and then go ahead and glue up the

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:30.070 
there and then go ahead and glue up the
top<00:05:24.560> section<00:05:25.190> at<00:05:25.400> the<00:05:25.550> cutaway<00:05:28.930> again<00:05:29.930> it's

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
top section at the cutaway again it's

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.820 
top section at the cutaway again it's
kind<00:05:30.350> of<00:05:30.440> an<00:05:30.560> awkward<00:05:31.540> curve<00:05:32.540> to<00:05:32.870> clamp<00:05:33.230> and

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
kind of an awkward curve to clamp and

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:41.550 
kind of an awkward curve to clamp and
you<00:05:34.330> can<00:05:35.330> use<00:05:35.480> whatever<00:05:36.580> scrap<00:05:37.580> wood<00:05:38.680> you<00:05:39.680> can

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
you can use whatever scrap wood you can

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:51.070 
you can use whatever scrap wood you can
salvage<00:05:42.560> to<00:05:42.860> make<00:05:43.010> that<00:05:43.250> work

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.720 

and<00:05:52.080> because<00:05:52.470> of<00:05:52.710> the<00:05:52.800> difficulty<00:05:53.490> in<00:05:53.520> that

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
and because of the difficulty in that

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.830 
and because of the difficulty in that
clamping<00:05:54.330> I<00:05:54.510> just<00:05:55.440> do<00:05:55.650> one<00:05:55.919> side<00:05:56.220> at<00:05:56.430> a<00:05:56.550> time

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
clamping I just do one side at a time

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.350 
clamping I just do one side at a time
and<00:05:57.840> once<00:05:58.050> the<00:05:58.199> first<00:05:58.470> side<00:05:58.710> stride<00:05:59.360> will

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
and once the first side stride will

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.409 
and once the first side stride will
remove<00:06:00.690> the<00:06:00.870> clamps<00:06:01.350> and<00:06:01.669> glue<00:06:02.669> up<00:06:02.820> the<00:06:03.000> second

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
remove the clamps and glue up the second

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:40.999 
remove the clamps and glue up the second
side

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:41.009 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:43.290 

here<00:06:42.009> again<00:06:42.129> I'm<00:06:42.340> using<00:06:42.460> a<00:06:42.610> little<00:06:42.729> piece<00:06:43.030> of

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
here again I'm using a little piece of

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:49.110 
here again I'm using a little piece of
scrap<00:06:43.810> wood<00:06:43.930> to<00:06:44.530> make<00:06:45.520> that<00:06:45.819> cutaway<00:06:47.879> clamp<00:06:48.879> in

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
scrap wood to make that cutaway clamp in

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.300 
scrap wood to make that cutaway clamp in
a<00:06:49.150> little<00:06:49.389> easier<00:06:49.780> and<00:06:50.560> now<00:06:50.740> with<00:06:50.919> the<00:06:51.069> other

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
a little easier and now with the other

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.800 
a little easier and now with the other
side<00:06:51.930> already<00:06:52.930> attached<00:06:54.270> again<00:06:55.270> it<00:06:55.629> makes

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
side already attached again it makes

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.070 
side already attached again it makes
that<00:06:56.580> clamping<00:06:57.580> there<00:06:57.789> at<00:06:57.909> the<00:06:58.060> top<00:06:58.300> a<00:06:58.629> little

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 
that clamping there at the top a little

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:08.360 
that clamping there at the top a little
more<00:06:59.229> difficult<00:06:59.770> and<00:07:06.539> now<00:07:07.539> that's<00:07:07.780> secured

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
more difficult and now that's secured

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:15.510 
more difficult and now that's secured
we're<00:07:09.370> going<00:07:09.610> to<00:07:09.669> move<00:07:09.819> to<00:07:09.849> the<00:07:10.090> bottom<00:07:14.520> here

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 
we're going to move to the bottom here

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.159 
we're going to move to the bottom here
not<00:07:15.729> only<00:07:15.849> do<00:07:16.180> we<00:07:16.300> need<00:07:16.419> to<00:07:16.479> make<00:07:16.689> sure<00:07:16.719> that<00:07:17.050> we

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:17.169 
not only do we need to make sure that we

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:21.269 
not only do we need to make sure that we
get<00:07:17.319> it<00:07:18.719> square<00:07:19.719> and<00:07:20.050> secure<00:07:20.650> to<00:07:20.830> the<00:07:20.949> center

00:07:21.269 --> 00:07:21.279 
get it square and secure to the center

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:23.879 
get it square and secure to the center
block<00:07:21.550> but<00:07:22.210> we<00:07:22.360> also<00:07:22.509> have<00:07:22.930> that<00:07:23.169> joint<00:07:23.529> with

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:23.889 
block but we also have that joint with

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:29.749 
block but we also have that joint with
the<00:07:24.069> other<00:07:24.219> side<00:07:24.610> that<00:07:24.909> we<00:07:25.029> have<00:07:25.210> to<00:07:25.389> get<00:07:25.539> flush

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:32.010 

so<00:07:30.759> make<00:07:30.939> sure<00:07:30.969> you<00:07:31.240> push<00:07:31.509> those<00:07:31.779> together

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.020 
so make sure you push those together

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.689 
so make sure you push those together
really<00:07:32.529> well<00:07:32.650> and<00:07:33.360> that<00:07:34.360> you've<00:07:35.110> got<00:07:35.289> a<00:07:35.319> nice

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:35.699 
really well and that you've got a nice

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:39.449 
really well and that you've got a nice
snug<00:07:36.699> fit<00:07:36.729> there
