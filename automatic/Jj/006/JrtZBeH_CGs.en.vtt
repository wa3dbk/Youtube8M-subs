00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:03.800
 three times the best 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.780
 once gold and the rest has the value of the scrap iron 

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:14.209
 exactly how do you see this relocated failed mission at Bart 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:15.649
 keeps requirements 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.419
 gamers still in the bronze medal race 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.509
 that is not where you are and where you are 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.509
 you have that he revised nothing 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.519
 yes that is big hour 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.220
 where did it go wrong 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.250
 after after so good cause 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.230
 we start we had two worth the first time 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.590
 the brabanders on screens would like some more smoothly than 14 below 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.390
 but after that it went wrong due to miscommunication and 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.660
 landis only gave bigger 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.050
 who gave off together but did not give occasionally 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.050
 then he thought of my head up 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.070
 van mark actually op of jan what is not going well here and says marc de 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.440
 but the customer must go that kid 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.260
 and that afterwards 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.710
 completely wrong a day after that the eu that was translating 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.770
 but that was, I think, yes, and the friese just way too much 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.520
 asked 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.760
 it struck you 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.300
 too few were in the lead 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.340
 others we have no chance at all 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.680
 Well that is not so bad I had I started others I started with his 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.270
 different 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.420
 walt disney and warner 2 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.600
 the southern neighbors had taken a wife at half past eight and that is okay in itself 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.340
 but certainly good with three people 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.510
 only and 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.930
 nails or behind these 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.820
 if you do then the group becomes the decline and also active around it 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.060
 could not 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.060
 had another team here together on the best ones that were not here 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.110
 waste falls to her nothing takeover 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.480
 but this was his 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.480
 he left the team baja 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.130
 so not in people were very much won in the last three years but good 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.810
 that this was not the dream 10 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.810
 after rest it wasn't easy and 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.740
 the rule 2 but after they finished with eleven but that we have to do with this team 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.829
 yes there you have afterwards you should not be everywhere anymore 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.489
 cooperated 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.019
 residents of this team have to do team and have participated 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.729
 and that's just 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:15.019
 they had cloned 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.129
 what struck me the first race I did well with simon coopers 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.129
 good money for years 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.669
 that was then there was also no one on the cutting edge about it 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:30.129
 days right the cupboard was good from the end 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.989
 at the end of the whole body behind schedule so a place in the 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.999
 new chassis comes in the last round more than I can save as in fact quite 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.399
 went well 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:40.969
 in the second there was a drama 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:42.289
 this delayed 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:44.439
 one hundredth gold medal 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:45.170
 you just have that 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.170
 today is not supposed to be a reliable year 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.449
 but I am also the way of working 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:53.249
 ing loses and 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:55.549
 we need that team pursuit 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.709
 come delete the future and then that little more can what we who it 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.249
 to have it everywhere after once not getting in the way or for teams in Utrecht 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.749
 please part 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:08.129
 but it must be one of his sons 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.379
 then the riders must come who are actually doing well 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:16.379
 well maybe you know so now yes 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.379
 well a motion not even very good for half the judgments 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:24.040
 a bit are other ways to be busy too 

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:28.099
 a little wider gen other people put that first and that was this year 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.219
 year not in 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.219
 how good they are then you should expect the fia 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.979
 was a process 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:36.279
 she says so 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:38.789
 I've done so much for it 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:40.329
 I have 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:41.949
 In recent years 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:44.279
 and every team trains 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:47.779
 day in day out just every minute were the people you met with these two weeks 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:49.439
 been busy and 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:51.239
 barcelona house from my stomach 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.239
 A medal is that a gold medal is that 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:57.519
 nothing from where not what you like from resignation 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.010
 I am the best three times 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.939
 and it's not his
