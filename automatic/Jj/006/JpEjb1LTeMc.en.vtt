00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.130 

I<00:00:02.209> think<00:00:03.209> that<00:00:03.449> there<00:00:03.840> are<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:03.989> lot<00:00:04.110> of

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
I think that there are a lot of

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.570 
I think that there are a lot of
similarities<00:00:04.950> between<00:00:05.900> writing<00:00:06.900> and

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
similarities between writing and

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.610 
similarities between writing and
coaching<00:00:08.580> sports<00:00:08.969> and<00:00:09.509> being<00:00:09.749> an<00:00:09.959> athlete<00:00:10.110> and

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
coaching sports and being an athlete and

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.470 
coaching sports and being an athlete and
it<00:00:10.919> doesn't<00:00:11.400> seem<00:00:11.639> like<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:12.120> when<00:00:12.269> you<00:00:12.389> know

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
it doesn't seem like it when you know

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.089 
it doesn't seem like it when you know
when<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:12.690> first<00:00:12.870> throw<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.259> out<00:00:13.379> there<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.860> I

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
when you first throw it out there and I

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.379 
when you first throw it out there and I
talked<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.549> lot<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.759> kids<00:00:15.059> around<00:00:15.179> the

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
talked to a lot of kids around the

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.660 
talked to a lot of kids around the
country<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.500> say<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.740> know<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.160> want

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
those things seem like they don't go

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.610 
those things seem like they don't go
together<00:00:23.250> at<00:00:23.610> all<00:00:23.730> but<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.600> fact<00:00:24.810> they're<00:00:25.350> very

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:25.620 
together at all but in fact they're very

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.130 
together at all but in fact they're very
similar<00:00:25.920> because<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.730> become<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.480> professional
