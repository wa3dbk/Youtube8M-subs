on their colors but michigan won so
that's<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.220> look<00:00:35.430> i'm<00:00:35.610> going<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.820> do<00:00:35.940> today

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
that's the look i'm going to do today

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.439 
that's the look i'm going to do today
i'm<00:00:36.600> basically<00:00:37.379> taking<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.340> really<00:00:38.610> matte<00:00:39.030> look

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
i'm basically taking a really matte look

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:41.660 
i'm basically taking a really matte look
and<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:40.080> throwing<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.650> a<00:00:40.769> little<00:00:41.040> bit<00:00:41.580> of

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
and just throwing in a little bit of

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.990 
and just throwing in a little bit of
some<00:00:41.850> shimmery<00:00:42.269> smokiness<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:43.290> with<00:00:44.190> some<00:00:44.910> of

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
some shimmery smokiness in with some of

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.910 
some shimmery smokiness in with some of
the<00:00:45.059> outer<00:00:45.239> V<00:00:45.570> action<00:00:46.110> there<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:46.680> really

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
the outer V action there so it's really

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.940 
the outer V action there so it's really
not<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.309> hard<00:00:47.760> look<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.180> recreate<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.960> had<00:00:49.710> fun

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
not a hard look to recreate I had fun

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.979 
not a hard look to recreate I had fun
using<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.489> pop<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.910> yellow<00:00:50.940> with<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.719> look

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
using the pop of yellow with this look

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.360 
using the pop of yellow with this look
and<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.200> think<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.469> really<00:00:52.680> brightens<00:00:52.980> up<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
and I think it really brightens up the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.760 
and I think it really brightens up the
eyes<00:00:53.610> as<00:00:53.940> well<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.290> were<00:00:55.440> interested

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
eyes as well and if you were interested

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.680 
eyes as well and if you were interested
in<00:00:56.160> seeing<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> Iowa<00:00:56.910> look<00:00:57.120> which<00:00:57.329> would<00:00:57.539> be

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
in seeing the Iowa look which would be

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.180 
in seeing the Iowa look which would be
black<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.289> yellow<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:59.010> definitely

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
black and yellow you can definitely

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.369 
black and yellow you can definitely
instead<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.059> using<00:01:00.270> blue<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:01.110> some<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.320> these

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
instead of using blue for some of these

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.779 
instead of using blue for some of these
look<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.829> could<00:01:01.950> use<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> matte<00:01:02.460> black

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
look so you could use a matte black

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.670 
look so you could use a matte black

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
we're going to kind of go between two of

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.889 
we're going to kind of go between two of
these<00:02:05.220> different<00:02:05.460> blue<00:02:05.880> shades<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.570> we<00:02:06.689> have

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
these different blue shades that we have

these different blue shades that we have
right<00:02:07.170> down<00:02:07.380> here<00:02:07.799> in<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.820> bottom<00:02:08.970> corner<00:02:09.290> one

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
right down here in the bottom corner one

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.560 
right down here in the bottom corner one
is<00:02:10.590> more<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:11.070> a<00:02:11.280> true<00:02:11.730> it's<00:02:11.880> coming<00:02:12.150> off<00:02:12.239> just<00:02:12.480> a

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
is more of a true it's coming off just a

is more of a true it's coming off just a
little<00:02:12.600> bit<00:02:12.840> turquoise<00:02:13.320> I<00:02:13.440> feel<00:02:13.590> like<00:02:13.680> on

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
I'm going to put that

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.350 
I'm going to put that
down<00:02:24.870> on<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.380> outer<00:02:25.590> part<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.430> my<00:02:26.790> lid<00:02:27.030> here<00:02:29.360> so

down on the outer part of my lid here so
we're<00:02:30.540> just<00:02:30.720> really<00:02:30.990> getting<00:02:31.320> you<00:02:31.500> know<00:02:31.650> that

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
we're just really getting you know that

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.870 
we're just really getting you know that
primary<00:02:33.540> color<00:02:33.930> type<00:02:34.590> look<00:02:35.100> here<00:02:35.520> with<00:02:35.670> the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
primary color type look here with the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.510 
primary color type look here with the
yellow<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:36.540> then<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.200> blue<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.830> then<00:02:38.400> I'm

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
yellow and then the blue and then I'm

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.580 
yellow and then the blue and then I'm
just<00:02:38.670> going<00:02:38.880> I'm<00:02:39.390> just<00:02:39.510> lightly<00:02:39.900> taking<00:02:40.440> that

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
just going I'm just lightly taking that

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.020 
just going I'm just lightly taking that
up<00:02:42.080> up<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.560> crease<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.280> as<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:44.880> can<00:02:45.000> see

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
up up to the crease and as you can see

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.720 
up up to the crease and as you can see
I'm<00:02:45.300> not<00:02:45.510> really<00:02:46.080> buffing<00:02:46.680> heavily<00:02:47.250> between

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
I'm not really buffing heavily between

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.060 
I'm not really buffing heavily between
these<00:02:47.940> two<00:02:48.210> shades<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:48.990> mean<00:02:49.800> you<00:02:49.920> might

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
these two shades I mean you might

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.430 
these two shades I mean you might
overlap<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.970> just<00:02:51.240> a<00:02:51.390> little<00:02:51.420> bit<00:02:51.750> but<00:02:52.200> don't

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
overlap it just a little bit but don't

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.590 
overlap it just a little bit but don't
do<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.740> much<00:02:53.070> because<00:02:53.370> we<00:02:53.730> want<00:02:53.910> as<00:02:54.000> much<00:02:54.300> of

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
do that much because we want as much of

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.630 
do that much because we want as much of
the<00:02:54.780> color<00:02:55.080> of<00:02:55.230> these<00:02:55.500> shades<00:02:55.800> stand<00:02:56.310> out<00:02:56.460> as

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
the color of these shades stand out as

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.950 
the color of these shades stand out as
possible<00:02:58.910> alrighty<00:02:59.910> then<00:03:00.300> I'm<00:03:00.420> kind<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.690> like

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
possible alrighty then I'm kind of like

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.840 
possible alrighty then I'm kind of like
working<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.650> into<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:02.040> little<00:03:02.400> bit<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.760> an

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
working that into a little bit of an

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.700 
working that into a little bit of an
outer<00:03:03.030> V<00:03:03.360> shape<00:03:03.660> just<00:03:03.870> by<00:03:03.990> instead<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.500> turning

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
outer V shape just by instead of turning

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.080 
outer V shape just by instead of turning
my<00:03:04.890> brush<00:03:05.100> like<00:03:05.310> this<00:03:05.340> where<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.730> was<00:03:05.850> packing

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
my brush like this where I was packing

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.290 
my brush like this where I was packing
it<00:03:06.390> on<00:03:06.560> turning<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.650> little<00:03:07.830> bit<00:03:08.070> out<00:03:08.490> that<00:03:08.970> way

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
it on turning a little bit out that way

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.110 
it on turning a little bit out that way
and<00:03:09.540> just<00:03:10.500> using<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.190> shape<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.700> area

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
and just using it to shape that area

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.510 
and just using it to shape that area
there<00:03:12.420> then<00:03:13.260> I'm<00:03:13.350> going<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.500> overlap<00:03:13.890> that

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
there then I'm going to overlap that

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.330 
there then I'm going to overlap that
with<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:15.000> darker<00:03:15.630> of<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.870> two<00:03:16.290> blue<00:03:16.860> shades

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
with the darker of the two blue shades

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.720 
with the darker of the two blue shades
and<00:03:18.800> this<00:03:19.800> is<00:03:19.950> going<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.160> be<00:03:20.220> really<00:03:20.370> pretty

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
and this is going to be really pretty

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.610 
and this is going to be really pretty
and<00:03:21.000> I'm<00:03:21.360> kind<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:21.720> concentrating<00:03:22.410> that<00:03:22.590> a

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
and I'm kind of concentrating that a

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.520 
and I'm kind of concentrating that a
little<00:03:22.920> bit<00:03:23.010> more<00:03:23.190> on<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.460> lower<00:03:23.670> part<00:03:24.030> and

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
little bit more on the lower part and

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.920 
little bit more on the lower part and
then<00:03:25.530> using<00:03:26.190> this<00:03:26.460> brush<00:03:26.820> using<00:03:27.360> that<00:03:27.600> same

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
then using this brush using that same

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.580 
then using this brush using that same
technique<00:03:28.440> I<00:03:28.590> used<00:03:28.800> on<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.070> other<00:03:29.190> side

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
technique I used on the other side

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.030 
technique I used on the other side
taking<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.709> blue<00:03:32.040> shade<00:03:32.400> just<00:03:32.850> under<00:03:33.510> the

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
taking that blue shade just under the

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.850 
taking that blue shade just under the
lower<00:03:35.040> lash<00:03:35.430> line<00:03:35.820> using<00:03:36.150> brushes<00:03:37.110> like<00:03:37.530> this

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
lower lash line using brushes like this

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.220 
lower lash line using brushes like this
as<00:03:38.250> opposed<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.850> a<00:03:38.940> liner<00:03:39.240> brush<00:03:39.600> gives<00:03:40.050> you

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
as opposed to a liner brush gives you

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.890 
as opposed to a liner brush gives you
just<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:40.680> know<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:41.100> sort<00:03:41.940> of<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.090> thicker<00:03:42.330> swath

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
just you know a sort of a thicker swath

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.660 
just you know a sort of a thicker swath
of<00:03:43.140> color<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.740> a<00:03:44.190> less<00:03:44.430> precise<00:03:46.310> placement<00:03:47.310> of

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
of color and a less precise placement of

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.340 
of color and a less precise placement of
color<00:03:47.970> but<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.360> still<00:03:48.630> looks<00:03:48.660> really<00:03:49.140> pretty

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
color but it still looks really pretty

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.020 
color but it still looks really pretty
now<00:03:49.709> that<00:03:49.860> you've<00:03:49.950> gotten<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.370> blue<00:03:50.610> place

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
now that you've gotten the blue place

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.240 
now that you've gotten the blue place
there<00:03:51.450> about<00:03:52.140> where<00:03:52.380> you<00:03:52.560> want<00:03:52.890> to<00:03:53.010> take<00:03:53.220> a

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
there about where you want to take a
