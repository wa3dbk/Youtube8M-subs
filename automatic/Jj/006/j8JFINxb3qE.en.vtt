00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
tale and with this episode we get a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.090 
tale and with this episode we get a
recap<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.699> takes<00:00:17.940> about<00:00:18.090> seven<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> half

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
recap that takes about seven and a half

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.890 
recap that takes about seven and a half
minutes<00:00:20.100> probably<00:00:20.760> up<00:00:21.029> till<00:00:21.240> eight<00:00:21.480> minutes<00:00:21.810> I

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
minutes probably up till eight minutes I

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.210 
minutes probably up till eight minutes I
guess<00:00:22.080> until<00:00:22.380> things<00:00:22.619> really<00:00:22.800> start<00:00:23.100> going

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
guess until things really start going

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.269 
guess until things really start going
down<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:24.000> around<00:00:24.960> eight<00:00:25.230> minutes<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:26.010> takes

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
down so around eight minutes it takes

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.990 
down so around eight minutes it takes
until<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:27.260> get<00:00:28.260> some<00:00:28.529> actual<00:00:28.800> content<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.699> this

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
until we get some actual content in this

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.359 
until we get some actual content in this
episode<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:30.750> we<00:00:31.529> could<00:00:31.710> say<00:00:31.920> right<00:00:32.160> now<00:00:32.189> that

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
episode so we could say right now that

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.580 
episode so we could say right now that
this<00:00:32.700> episode<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.210> Fairy<00:00:33.450> Tail<00:00:33.750> how<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.110> recap
