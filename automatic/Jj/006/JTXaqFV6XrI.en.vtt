moment<00:03:35.590> of<00:03:35.920> discovery<00:03:36.430> when<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.209> child

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
moment of discovery when the child

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.380 
moment of discovery when the child
realizes<00:03:38.560> that<00:03:39.040> he<00:03:39.220> can<00:03:39.370> say<00:03:39.610> something<00:03:40.150> and

realizes that he can say something and
he's<00:03:41.290> so<00:03:41.470> happy<00:03:41.739> that<00:03:42.070> he<00:03:42.190> sometimes<00:03:43.090> runs

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
happiness in a different way but it's

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.870 
happiness in a different way but it's
that<00:03:49.540> moment<00:03:50.080> of<00:03:50.500> discovery<00:03:51.100> I<00:03:51.280> find<00:03:51.700> that
