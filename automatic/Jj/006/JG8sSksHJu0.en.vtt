00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello friends in this video tutorial let's go 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.319
 to learn how to make the most famous 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:18.090
 hardware set to our device 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:20.039
 motorola and second generation this 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.199
 because it can happen or because it should be 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.090
 do when entering the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.689
 device in the part of 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.640
 security configurations and then created 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.219
 some type of blocking with devices 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.739
 then the pin pattern or password and in 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.469
 some time I forgot in this case 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.340
 let's make this pattern continue what 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.260
 we confirm 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.270
 well that's an example way we're not going 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.550
 to create a pattern and we're going to make 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.560
 mind that we forgot then if 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.660
 me at the time of blocking my device 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.000
 and turn it on again and unlock it 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.030
 to access and makes me forgot the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.570
 pattern and now how do I enter 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.489
 to my information or my device 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.080
 nothing to do in this case if you 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.400
 we try several times 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.920
 our device is going to block 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.080
 for 30 seconds during those 30 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.990
 seconds we can not mark again the 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.369
 pattern or password or beep 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.110
 we would have to wait in case 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.020
 that we do not remember since we wait 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.659
 the 30 seconds again 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.609
 to be able to enter again if you already 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.530
 I completely forgot then what 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:26.750
 first thing we should do is turn off 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.610
 our device remember that at 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.679
 do that all the information that you have 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.020
 the device is going to be totally lost 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:36.070
 as a recommendation we should have the 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.350
 very well charged battery 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.570
 so that I can apply this hard 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.659
 set then let's turn off the 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.659
 device 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.060
 how to turn it off 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.790
 ready you have to have knowledge in 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.189
 count the keys that the 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.619
 device in this case here we have the 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.350
 power key and here those volume 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.210
 both increase and decrease for 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.490
 do this lack with a motorola 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.909
 you have to do several steps the first 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.909
 step is 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.090
 take the power button and the button 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.430
 of volume down at the same time I 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.760
 first for three seconds we are going to 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:21.790
 first and we count 123 let's go 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.540
 and as we can see we get a flashmob 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.519
 or a way where it gives us certain 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.069
 device features and apart 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.650
 tells us if the battery is well charged 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.090
 or not to perform this process 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.050
 in this case as we can see it says 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.090
 ok battery 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.920
 in volume keys both increase 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.950
 how to decrease appear certain arrows 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.349
 to go up or down 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.050
 and on the power button or the 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:50.349
 on are like the options for 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.629
 to get to that factory mode or to 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.220
 that way which we need 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:57.230
 enter 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.480
 then the option to reach 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.160
 up to him to perform the hard reset to 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.390
 our device is going to be he tells us 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.440
 recovery mode 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.510
 I do not know if we can focus 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.100
 ay appears with the power button 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.930
 we confirm 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.750
 then its initial appears on the screen 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.430
 of Motorola and the following screenshot 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.200
 shows us the android doll 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.849
 as if it were going to fix or 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.410
 let's see that having a bit of 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.420
 patience because prices can be a 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.580
 little waste 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.520
 and as we can see then we do not have 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.370
 no option and step to follow 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.800
 they do not seem to me before 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.989
 again with the power buttons 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.180
 but in this case it already goes with the button 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:46.069
 volume up the cousins ​​for about 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.069
 seconds also 1 2 3 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:53.910
 he did not appear again we oppressed 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.910
 1 2 3 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.110
 it does not appear to us either 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.930
 ready the first for several seconds 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.350
 until you leave the menu to be able 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.090
 perform the reset and factory 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.040
 in this case, the 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.740
 Volume buttons up volume 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.030
 down here several options but the one 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.859
 we need to be able 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.400
 reset our device is going to be 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.400
 the one that says white datafactory reset with 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.790
 the volume down we move up that 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.100
 option and 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.790
 with the bolus with the power key 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.520
 sorry we confirmed our reset 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.700
 We are going to give you the option 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.680
 white datafactory reset remember 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.630
 We confirm with the power button 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.630
 then the other less options and in 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.880
 this case then the only viable option 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.920
 to be able to make this set is where 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.110
 says and is euros the dt 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.720
 we choose that option and again with the 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.170
 power button we confirm there 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.610
 our device this way time 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:05.360
 or resetting factory in this 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:08.140
 case of a way to enter the 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.140
 device directly 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.260
 after formatting 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.550
 we will leave a menu to be able 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.460
 again wood and the device to 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.740
 start there as we can see come out - 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.310
 again earlier this was the option 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.199
 white datafactory reset that's where 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.150
 way we love you but as it already forms 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:33.069
 we have then we go to the option 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.900
 reboot system now 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:37.419
 there it tells us that to return 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.830
 back to the initial system then 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:40.830
 with the power button we confirm 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.870
 and there is our device has already been 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:50.370
 restored from the factory there starts 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.370
 again with the motorola logo 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.370
 with the screenshots will start increasing 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.370
 make this hardware set 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.130
 many to burn it so that it 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.810
 realize that our device 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.150
 it was already without password so I was 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.830
 forgotten 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.830
 but the information I did not lose 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.199
 As you can see he is preparing the 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:42.469
 device you have to have a bit of 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:42.469
 patience 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.840
 and there as we can see now 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.130
 we start with the device 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.420
 then the configurations are already 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:02.310
 initials 

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:05.510
 sorry or mickey anyway 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.510
 let go and continue 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:08.770
 and the second 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.710
 omit our account the moment omit 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:19.919
 following 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.840
 later 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.790
 ready and there's how you can see our 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.120
 device that we have restored from 

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:35.980
 factory so we can block it 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.750
 and unlock and you will not have problems 

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.889
 that ask me for some password that I 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.099
 I have forgotten
