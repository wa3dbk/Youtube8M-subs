00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
that we win in 20 minutes but usually

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.260 
that we win in 20 minutes but usually
takes<00:05:25.190> a<00:05:25.250> longer<00:05:25.520> than<00:05:25.729> that<00:05:25.820> and<00:05:26.000> that's<00:05:26.120> when

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
takes a longer than that and that's when
