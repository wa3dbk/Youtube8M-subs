also carefully use a razor knife

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.050 
also carefully use a razor knife
sometimes<00:02:09.830> you<00:02:09.890> can<00:02:10.009> pull<00:02:10.220> it<00:02:10.340> without<00:02:10.610> having

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
sometimes you can pull it without having

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.940 
sometimes you can pull it without having
to<00:02:11.270> cut<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.510> but<00:02:11.630> usually<00:02:11.810> cutting<00:02:12.709> it<00:02:12.800> is<00:02:12.920> a

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
to cut it but usually cutting it is a

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.380 
to cut it but usually cutting it is a
little<00:02:13.190> bit<00:02:13.310> easier<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.959> peel<00:02:14.959> back<00:02:15.170> the

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
little bit easier and peel back the

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.390 
little bit easier and peel back the
water<00:02:17.390> shield<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.620> again<00:02:18.890> do<00:02:19.040> this<00:02:19.130> carefully

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
water shield and again do this carefully

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.370 
water shield and again do this carefully
and<00:02:19.670> peel<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.180> back<00:02:20.300> enough<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.260> can

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
and peel it back enough so that you can

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.229 
and peel it back enough so that you can
get<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.620> all<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:21.890> bolts<00:02:22.220> for<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.970> window

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
get it all the bolts for the window

regulator

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.930 

most<00:02:30.260> often<00:02:30.560> when<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.739> regulator<00:02:31.129> breaks<00:02:31.400> the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
most often when the regulator breaks the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.699 
most often when the regulator breaks the
cable<00:02:32.360> breaks<00:02:32.599> so<00:02:33.110> what<00:02:33.230> I'm<00:02:33.319> doing<00:02:33.530> here<00:02:33.650> is

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
cable breaks so what I'm doing here is

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.160 
cable breaks so what I'm doing here is
I'm<00:02:33.830> just<00:02:34.040> moving<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.970> window<00:02:35.090> down<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:36.110> I

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
I'm just moving the window down and I

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.430 
I'm just moving the window down and I
reconnected<00:02:36.680> my<00:02:36.830> switch<00:02:37.099> and<00:02:37.640> move<00:02:37.879> it<00:02:38.000> down

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
reconnected my switch and move it down

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.720 
reconnected my switch and move it down
into<00:02:39.440> a<00:02:39.470> spot<00:02:39.799> where<00:02:39.980> you<00:02:40.040> can<00:02:40.069> see<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.519> two

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
into a spot where you can see the two

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.030 
into a spot where you can see the two
bolts<00:02:41.150> now<00:02:41.870> if<00:02:41.989> your<00:02:42.140> window<00:02:42.349> regulator<00:02:42.769> was

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
bolts now if your window regulator was

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.740 
bolts now if your window regulator was
broken<00:02:43.580> you'd<00:02:43.879> be<00:02:44.000> able<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.180> just<00:02:44.299> move<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.629> by

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
broken you'd be able to just move it by

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.420 
broken you'd be able to just move it by
hand<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.260> move<00:02:45.739> it<00:02:45.830> to<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:45.980> point<00:02:46.160> where<00:02:46.340> you

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
hand and move it to a point where you

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.800 
hand and move it to a point where you
can<00:02:46.519> get<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.790> two<00:02:46.970> bolts<00:02:47.209> through<00:02:47.599> those

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
can get to the two bolts through those

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.080 
can get to the two bolts through those
two<00:02:47.989> holes<00:02:48.230> those<00:02:49.099> are<00:02:49.280> ten<00:02:49.489> millimeter<00:02:49.910> bolts

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090

and<00:05:06.840> now<00:05:07.840> I'm<00:05:07.930> just<00:05:08.110> going<00:05:08.259> to<00:05:08.289> fast<00:05:08.560> forward

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
and now I'm just going to fast forward

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.400 
and now I'm just going to fast forward
as<00:05:09.099> I<00:05:09.280> install<00:05:10.060> the<00:05:10.270> rest<00:05:10.479> of<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:10.810> bolts<00:05:11.020> and

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
as I install the rest of the bolts and

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:18.040 
as I install the rest of the bolts and
then<00:05:12.130> tighten<00:05:12.490> them<00:05:12.580> up

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.890 

put<00:05:19.050> your<00:05:19.230> harness

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
put your harness

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.200 
put your harness
on<00:05:20.050> the<00:05:20.139> clip<00:05:20.400> your<00:05:21.400> new<00:05:21.550> harness<00:05:21.790> may<00:05:22.030> come

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
on the clip your new harness may come

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.490 
on the clip your new harness may come
with<00:05:22.360> a<00:05:22.389> new<00:05:22.540> clip<00:05:22.780> so<00:05:22.960> you'd<00:05:23.080> pull<00:05:23.259> the<00:05:23.350> clip

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
with a new clip so you'd pull the clip

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.980 
with a new clip so you'd pull the clip
out<00:05:23.620> the<00:05:23.740> door<00:05:24.120> then<00:05:25.120> reconnect<00:05:25.780> the<00:05:25.870> harness

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
out the door then reconnect the harness

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.350 
out the door then reconnect the harness
now<00:05:26.889> you<00:05:26.949> can<00:05:27.130> take<00:05:27.250> the<00:05:27.400> tape<00:05:27.639> off<00:05:27.820> the<00:05:27.880> window

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
now you can take the tape off the window

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.999 
now you can take the tape off the window
if<00:05:28.509> you<00:05:28.630> use<00:05:28.840> some<00:05:29.050> tape<00:05:29.229> to<00:05:29.410> hold<00:05:29.530> it<00:05:29.680> up<00:05:29.830> and

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
if you use some tape to hold it up and

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.110 
if you use some tape to hold it up and
lower<00:05:30.910> the<00:05:31.120> window<00:05:31.270> down<00:05:32.460> until<00:05:33.460> it<00:05:33.580> contacts

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
lower the window down until it contacts

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.320 
lower the window down until it contacts
the<00:05:34.419> regulator<00:05:34.990> and<00:05:35.229> then<00:05:36.009> put<00:05:36.639> the<00:05:36.759> two<00:05:36.940> bolts

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330
