00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello guys and girls this video is very 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.069
 special for my friend breeze at sea 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.340
 and she looked at this picture then and I decided 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.660
 make him a video since he liked there are two 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.009
 ways that I'm going to do in this video 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.260
 I hope you like it 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.449
 are some ideas this my way this is the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.859
 My little friend's breeze in the sea channel 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.109
 that my dearest cute friend you know 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.830
 I love you so much forget 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.080
 okay 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.210
 well as I was saying there are two ways to 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.450
 do it in the sense my way I'm not 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.579
 expert I do it with an acrylic there 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.180
 people that this way they do it with 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:44.160
 watercolor I actually this technique of 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.289
 acrylic how well in a video of a 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.180
 Korean girl who was not doing 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.700
 bun she was doing that was a 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.980
 flower I do like that but in this case I 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.360
 I do I'm going to do a nice and like 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.000
 you know then one of all practice 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:03.000
 pretty little stars 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.489
 and little animals and in this case, 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.190
 a breeze liked to crucita but not 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.260
 be the same video because I wanted and decided 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.729
 make a bow and in the course of 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.590
 video I'm going to make a fruit but good 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.990
 As you can see, the nail is animated and everything and 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.030
 what I do is the first form of a 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.740
 bun and from there I'm cleaning all the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.560
 areas practically to leave this a 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.050
 this shading of what would come to be 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.390
 a little hair this technique by the call 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.119
 some of watercolor make it with 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.750
 watercolor but as I say and go back to 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.490
 repeat I saw it with acrylic and there are 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.850
 people who do it with my 40 that 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.149
 I 've also seen an organic video 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.550
 recently but from the video that I gave them 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.009
 I say that this Korean lives because I saw it 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.410
 more before and it was acrylic not from 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.660
 watercolor there are anyway how they 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.450
 I say there are ideas in this world because in 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.610
 videos from youtube was only matter 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.920
 of patience if you want to make this monkey 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.670
 Well, you can let it shine 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.840
 but 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.060
 I'm going to put more things like that in person 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.730
 It looks very nice looks like 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.640
 silk or be a stamp stamped something like that 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.160
 from the effect that I see it I do not know but 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.390
 in person we know everything in videos and 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.910
 cameras because it does not look the same as one what 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.100
 go in person but as I say it is a 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.709
 idea more I hope you like this video to 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.360
 the girls and also in this part 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.530
 I also tell them that I would have 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.480
 liked that the nail this already encapsulated and 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.330
 all but with a glow down like 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.170
 then I'm going to do another design 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.150
 fruits later in this video 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.769
 the design itself is beautiful and how they 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.560
 I say it helps a lot to see pictures at least in 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.830
 facebook in which there is a page of 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.350
 Some girl I got 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.990
 some pictures that are of marked nails 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.300
 I do not know if you guys have seen those pictures 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.190
 which are several squares of the 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.830
 nails then you send it to your mail 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.020
 they print it and they take out many sheets 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.080
 you can practice on the nails I 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.480
 I agree to have seen it I copied it and 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.210
 I sent my mail and I started to take out 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.570
 enough leaves and it served me because of 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.670
 there I practice designs or any little thing 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.500
 later in the course of the video 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.270
 I'm going to show you which leaves of which I 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.460
 I'm talking to you in this case already 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.800
 finishing all this we have already put 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.870
 little ball as I tell you I got everything 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.790
 a little bit for you to see that then 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.090
 the design depends on what you 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.730
 want to do it because that's what I do not know 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.620
 everyone's taste then here 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.540
 I put acrylic but the acrylic is water 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.530
 it is not very loaded when it dries 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:55.490
 It takes half transparent and I already marked everything 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.380
 what is the body of the bow and you can see it 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.540
 there marked with him or is already highlighted 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.580
 the front from below is not a front 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.790
 that's why you see it in the middle of paco is a 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.350
 pink well short and would have shown 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.940
 have made a white front since 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:14.310
 I would highlight human look at him 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.620
 it has already passed as the end and the jury and 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.590
 I show you here it's very nice 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.360
 see person shines and as I say, I do not know 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.370
 see in person how it should look in a 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.470
 video there are the leaves that I tell you 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.810
 that's more or less how I practice 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.310
 bows you should get that 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.560
 those leaves because it really helps 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.840
 here in this same nail that already cleans the 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.300
 design and everything I put a curious mix and 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.390
 stella what I tell you can have 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.750
 a shiny background is already encapsulated 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.700
 and filing I'm going to draw some cherries 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.150
 as I say you can draw any 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.970
 fruit can draw half to caritas 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.610
 everything you want butterflies of 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.880
 everything but with the same function in this 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.920
 case then I do it in this way is 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.110
 one more technique and I also tell them from 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.770
 right now they do all the 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.150
 process and mark it around 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.610
 the balls that would be the cherry 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.070
 with a well-thin line of 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.840
 acrylic black and good and what you 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.050
 more or less I advance and also already 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.180
 before capsules you do not go right now 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.280
 to see that part but I put lines 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.080
 thick google permanent that is not 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.480
 sticky is not sticky to dark two 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.750
 minutes and from there it happened to the club and 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:30.720
 I put the chicken is that I'm reluctant there 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.940
 do not see then here and this is the design 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.920
 finished I hope you liked breeze 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.570
 I did it with a lot of love and also for 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.000
 the girls to see in a way 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.100
 different in two types and here are the 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.690
 good pictures take care we see you up 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.110
 the next video blessings and kisses 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.110
 bye
