for<00:01:48.689> me<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.990> probably<00:01:49.380> judged<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.009> little<00:01:50.159> bit

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
for me I probably judged it a little bit

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.859 
for me I probably judged it a little bit
too<00:01:50.520> harshly<00:01:50.820> because<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.119> was<00:01:51.210> coming<00:01:51.509> off<00:01:51.630> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
too harshly because I was coming off the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.710 
too harshly because I was coming off the
percy<00:01:52.200> jackson<00:01:52.619> high<00:01:52.799> but<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.880> was<00:01:54.240> still<00:01:54.479> very

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
percy jackson high but it was still very

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.139 
percy jackson high but it was still very
very<00:01:55.079> good<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.189> lot<00:01:56.219> different<00:01:56.909> than<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.119> was

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
very good and a lot different than I was

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.749 
very good and a lot different than I was
expecting<00:01:57.390> but<00:01:57.960> still<00:01:58.259> good<00:01:58.770> nonetheless<00:01:59.040> it

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
expecting but still good nonetheless it

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.330 
expecting but still good nonetheless it
is<00:01:59.820> a<00:02:00.030> dystopian<00:02:00.810> book<00:02:01.079> but<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.829> feel<00:02:02.100> like<00:02:02.189> it

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
is a dystopian book but I feel like it

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.190 
is a dystopian book but I feel like it
has<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.520> really<00:02:03.000> different<00:02:03.299> tank<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.899> mean<00:02:04.079> it

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
has a really different tank I mean it

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.319 
has a really different tank I mean it
does<00:02:04.350> have<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> lot<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.189> typical<00:02:05.490> dystopian

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
does have a lot of the typical dystopian

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.010 
does have a lot of the typical dystopian
tropes<00:02:06.780> but<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.200> feel<00:02:07.439> like<00:02:07.530> it

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
tropes but I feel like it

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.720 
tropes but I feel like it
them<00:02:08.230> a<00:02:08.320> lot<00:02:08.440> differently<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.100> I<00:02:09.280> enjoyed

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:09.730 
them a lot differently and I enjoyed

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.550 
them a lot differently and I enjoyed
that<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.150> it<00:02:10.330> also<00:02:10.450> has<00:02:10.570> a<00:02:10.690> male<00:02:10.930> lead<00:02:11.230> which

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
that and it also has a male lead which

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.440 
that and it also has a male lead which
is<00:02:11.710> something<00:02:11.920> that<00:02:12.220> usually<00:02:12.820> doesn't<00:02:13.270> happen

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
is something that usually doesn't happen

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.800 
is something that usually doesn't happen
in<00:02:13.870> a<00:02:13.960> lot<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.230> dystopian<00:02:14.560> so<00:02:15.540> check<00:02:16.540> it<00:02:16.570> out
