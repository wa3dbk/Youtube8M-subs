00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
seven you do not need to because the

smoke alarm does not have a battery
backup<00:01:06.229> but<00:01:07.229> anyways<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.030> if<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
backup but anyways so if you do have the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.670 
backup but anyways so if you do have the
900<00:01:11.310> series<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:12.360> little<00:01:12.750> red<00:01:12.930> thing<00:01:12.960> here<00:01:13.470> it

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
900 series this little red thing here it

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.320 
900 series this little red thing here it
connects<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.460> battery<00:01:14.610> you're<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.180> going

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
connects the battery you're just going

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.010 
connects the battery you're just going
to<00:01:15.360> twist<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.590> off<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> little<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.750> just

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
to twist it off a little and that just

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.710 
to twist it off a little and that just
basically<00:01:19.140> unlocks<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.460> battery<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.240> you're

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
basically unlocks the battery and you're

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.090 
basically unlocks the battery and you're
just<00:01:21.810> going<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.020> pull<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.350> out<00:01:22.500> like<00:01:23.780> that<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
just going to pull it out like that and

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.810 
just going to pull it out like that and
there's<00:01:26.100> these<00:01:26.280> wires<00:01:26.960> you<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.170> unclip<00:01:29.009> it

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.100 

like<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.360> it's<00:01:33.780> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.930> start

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
like that and it's going to start

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.140 
like that and it's going to start
chirping<00:01:34.320> now<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.369> now<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> loose

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
chirping now so now it is a loose

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.399 
chirping now so now it is a loose
battery<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:36.869> put<00:01:37.079> your<00:01:37.229> new

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
battery and you just put your new

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:50.620 
battery and you just put your new
battery<00:01:37.619> back<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:41.240> by<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.479> snapping<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.350> in

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.450 

just<00:01:51.630> like<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:54.920> then<00:01:55.920> now<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.130> just

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
just like that and then now you just

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:07.130 
just like that and then now you just
take<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:57.440> and<00:01:58.440> put<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.740> back<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:59.220> just<00:02:06.140> like

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
take it and put it back in just like

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.340 
take it and put it back in just like
that<00:02:07.260> and<00:02:07.650> you<00:02:08.429> put<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.700> red<00:02:08.940> thing<00:02:09.350> right

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
that and you put this red thing right

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.430 
that and you put this red thing right
there<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.860> that's<00:02:11.040> basically<00:02:11.550> all<00:02:11.960> it<00:02:12.960> is<00:02:13.080> it

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
there and that's basically all it is it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.560 
there and that's basically all it is it
to<00:02:13.770> replacing<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.370> battery<00:02:14.880> in<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.270> and

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
to replacing the battery in this and

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.520 
to replacing the battery in this and
then<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.680> next<00:02:17.010> part<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:18.230> you're<00:02:19.230> just<00:02:19.410> going

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
then the next part is you're just going

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.800 
then the next part is you're just going
to<00:02:19.680> put<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.370> back<00:02:20.550> up<00:02:20.610> on<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.180> little<00:02:21.390> fitting

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
to put it back up on the little fitting

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.310 
to put it back up on the little fitting
the<00:02:21.990> mounting<00:02:22.350> bracket<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:24.320> find<00:02:25.320> this<00:02:25.410> little

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
the mounting bracket I find this little

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:36.350 
the mounting bracket I find this little
thing<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.830> probably<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.340> bit<00:02:35.880> easier

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
thing and this is probably a bit easier

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.400 
thing and this is probably a bit easier
than<00:02:36.600> taking<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:37.080> off<00:02:37.230> you're<00:02:37.980> snapping<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.700> in

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
than taking it off you're snapping it in

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.070 
than taking it off you're snapping it in
and<00:02:40.410> then<00:02:41.190> there's<00:02:41.910> just<00:02:42.180> little<00:02:42.540> knob<00:02:42.750> right

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
and then there's just little knob right

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.930 
and then there's just little knob right
here<00:02:43.140> you're<00:02:44.040> going<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.280> go<00:02:44.430> ahead<00:02:44.520> and<00:02:44.760> turn

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
here you're going to go ahead and turn

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.210 
here you're going to go ahead and turn
