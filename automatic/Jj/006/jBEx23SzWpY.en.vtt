way I did it this V Gundam is sold

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.120 
way I did it this V Gundam is sold
separately<00:01:33.840> but<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.829> going<00:01:35.040> to

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
separately but this is going to

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.460 
separately but this is going to
transform<00:01:35.640> into<00:01:36.180> these<00:01:36.509> two<00:01:36.900> blasters<00:01:37.439> that

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
transform into these two blasters that

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.530 
transform into these two blasters that
just<00:01:37.829> sit<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.159> top<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.549> shoulders<00:01:38.970> which

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
just sit on top of the shoulders which

core top and the core bottom go

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.490 
core top and the core bottom go
whooshing<00:03:23.909> up<00:03:24.180> towards<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.629> top<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:24.989> when

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
whooshing up towards the top and when

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.110 
whooshing up towards the top and when
they<00:03:25.590> do<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:25.889> you<00:03:26.010> can<00:03:26.190> see<00:03:26.400> quite<00:03:26.699> a<00:03:26.729> few<00:03:26.970> of

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
they do that you can see quite a few of

on their legs including on the v2 which

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.559 
on their legs including on the v2 which
is<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.680> little<00:03:31.949> surprising<00:03:32.459> but<00:03:33.060> this<00:03:33.269> is<00:03:33.419> where

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
is a little surprising but this is where

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:34.849 
is a little surprising but this is where
they<00:03:33.659> got<00:03:33.750> their<00:03:33.959> inspiration<00:03:34.079> for<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.680> lot<00:03:34.829> of

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
they got their inspiration for a lot of

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.439 
they got their inspiration for a lot of
these<00:03:35.010> weapons<00:03:35.459> whether<00:03:35.729> they<00:03:35.940> were<00:03:36.000> used<00:03:36.299> in

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:36.449 
these weapons whether they were used in

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.330 
these weapons whether they were used in
the<00:03:36.510> anime<00:03:36.659> or<00:03:36.959> not<00:03:37.079> I'd<00:03:37.349> have<00:03:37.769> to<00:03:37.889> go<00:03:37.979> back<00:03:38.159> and

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
the anime or not I'd have to go back and

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.979 
the anime or not I'd have to go back and
watch<00:03:38.459> 50<00:03:38.849> episodes<00:03:39.269> so<00:03:39.419> I<00:03:39.449> haven't<00:03:39.810> done<00:03:39.930> that

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
watch 50 episodes so I haven't done that

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.780

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
information again these big plates at

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.259 
information again these big plates at
the<00:03:52.620> bottom<00:03:52.949> are<00:03:53.129> the<00:03:53.159> originals<00:03:53.729> these<00:03:54.000> ones

here at the top are the same as The
Vegan<00:03:55.709> them<00:03:56.040> so<00:03:56.669> you<00:03:56.729> build<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.209> core

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
Vegan them so you build the core

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.539 
Vegan them so you build the core
fighters<00:03:58.049> here<00:03:58.439> including<00:03:58.979> the<00:03:59.069> head<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.459> the

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
fighters here including the head of the

V<00:03:59.699> Gundam<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.239> one<00:04:00.720> for<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.049> hexa<00:04:01.470> then<00:04:02.040> you

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
V Gundam and one for the hexa then you

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.830 
V Gundam and one for the hexa then you
build<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.459> core<00:04:02.669> booster<00:04:02.849> itself<00:04:03.419> you<00:04:03.659> can

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
build the core booster itself you can

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.750 
build the core booster itself you can
mount<00:04:03.989> it<00:04:04.139> there<00:04:04.409> on<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.829> stand<00:04:05.129> as<00:04:05.370> they<00:04:05.519> show

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
mount it there on the stand as they show

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.309 
mount it there on the stand as they show
then<00:04:06.419> you're<00:04:06.540> going<00:04:06.629> to<00:04:06.689> go<00:04:06.810> through<00:04:07.019> build

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
then you're going to go through build

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.500
