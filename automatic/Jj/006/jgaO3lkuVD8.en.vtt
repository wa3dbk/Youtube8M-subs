00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.650
 I'll say right away that I purchased a turner 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.100
 for industrial machines 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.109
 they are native to install it I 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.930
 made a plate like this 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.500
 I still have stainless steel 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.750

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.149

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:06.510

 recently appeared in search I don't know but 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.479
 I didn't stumble on it before 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:17.759
 the cost of this cat is 375 hryvnia 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:20.180
 on the rest of the price of 450, even with a fee 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.590
 cash on delivery goes out 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.659

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.780

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.240

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.740
 Taiwan 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.619
 so that 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.380
 I do not know whether to trust this record or not 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.149
 I have a poor quality when you 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.720
 get cash on delivery 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:49.070

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.799

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.039
 tilting tactile width 35 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.070
 millimeters in finished form will be 10 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:02.610
 4 millimeters addition for me this 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:07.020

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.509

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.400

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:16.220
 a bit later let's say so in order to 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.220
 handle knitwear or cotton 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.410
 knit resent and paste into these 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.110
 holes do not always insert all 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.840
 I insert it here, I think everyone knows 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.360
 how to work for tilting them extremely 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.120

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:40.160

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.160
 tutu with pins someone needles someone 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:48.920
 helps himself with tweezers in general then who 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.920

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.830
 set 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.810
 I haven't thought of any yet 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.560
 devices to gum not 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:13.540
 twisted with not stretched still 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:16.950
 ahead and so here we insert our 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:23.310
 knitted fabric 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.310
 here is the cotton we lower our foot 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.900
 what we get in finished form 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.530

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.320

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.040
 line that is all pretty exactly 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.040
 and neat 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.010
 also on the aspen I read that 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.450
 A tilter is bought on aliexpress and 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.970

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.860
 nightmare and disaster 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:33.500
 their cost is simply incredible 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.340
 expensive especially if you only sew for 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.860

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.630
