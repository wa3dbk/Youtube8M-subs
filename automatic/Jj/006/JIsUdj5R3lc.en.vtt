program called the evolution of the

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.639 
program called the evolution of the
drive<00:00:05.730> so<00:00:06.509> we're<00:00:06.600> going<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.779> start<00:00:07.080> off<00:00:07.259> by

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.180 
starting with the front foot defensive
shot<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.510> show<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.080> how<00:00:10.349> we<00:00:10.380> can<00:00:10.650> progress

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
shot and show you how we can progress

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.610 
shot and show you how we can progress
and<00:00:11.550> get<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.480> most<00:00:12.660> perfect<00:00:13.080> drive<00:00:13.290> and

and get to the most perfect drive and

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.589 
and get to the most perfect drive and
even<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.250> lofted<00:00:14.610> Drive<00:00:14.820> later<00:00:15.089> on<00:00:15.269> because

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
even the lofted Drive later on because

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.590 
even the lofted Drive later on because
they're<00:00:16.080> all<00:00:16.230> an<00:00:16.350> extension<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.070> each<00:00:17.279> other

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
they're all an extension of each other

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.120 
they're all an extension of each other
so<00:00:18.600> first<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:19.050> all<00:00:19.109> here<00:00:19.410> we<00:00:19.529> have<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.920> front

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
so first of all here we have the front

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.580 
so first of all here we have the front
foot<00:00:20.340> defense<00:00:20.840> now<00:00:21.840> there's<00:00:22.050> nothing<00:00:22.410> more

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
foot defense now there's nothing more

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.340 
foot defense now there's nothing more
disheartening<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> bowler<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:25.199> when

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
disheartening to a bowler is that when

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.960 
disheartening to a bowler is that when
they<00:00:25.470> come<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.859> they<00:00:26.010> bowl<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.310> perfect<00:00:26.789> ball

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
and then all you do is get in behind it

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.820 
and then all you do is get in behind it
and<00:00:30.150> give<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> solid<00:00:30.960> front<00:00:31.199> foot<00:00:31.349> defensive

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
and give a solid front foot defensive

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.799 
and give a solid front foot defensive
shot<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.640> really<00:00:32.910> puts<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.420> hard<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.750> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
shot it really puts the hard in the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.780 
shot it really puts the hard in the
mouth<00:00:33.960> there<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.530> what<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.219> want<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.430> do<00:00:35.579> is

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
create this effect of having a wall you

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.310 
create this effect of having a wall you
want<00:00:39.000> their<00:00:39.180> board<00:00:39.360> about<00:00:39.629> straight<00:00:40.020> off<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
want their board about straight off the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.500 
want their board about straight off the
wall<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.100> be<00:00:41.219> absolutely<00:00:41.579> solid<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
wall and to be absolutely solid so the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.529 
wall and to be absolutely solid so the
bowler<00:00:42.719> knows<00:00:42.960> nothing<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.860> getting<00:00:44.040> through

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
bowler knows nothing is getting through

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.479 
bowler knows nothing is getting through
so<00:00:45.539> these<00:00:45.960> first<00:00:46.289> key<00:00:46.559> points<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> front

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
so these first key points for the front

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.310 
so these first key points for the front
foot<00:00:47.640> defensive<00:00:48.090> shot<00:00:48.270> are<00:00:48.539> going<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.110> put

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
well first of all here we go we're now

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.430 
well first of all here we go we're now
starts<00:00:57.210> which<00:00:57.690> we've<00:00:57.870> already<00:00:57.989> talked<00:00:58.320> about

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
starts which we've already talked about

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.770 
starts which we've already talked about
and<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.699> first<00:00:59.969> thing<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.180> we<00:01:00.359> want<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.629> do

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
and the first thing that we want to do

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.189 
and the first thing that we want to do
is<00:01:01.670> putting<00:01:02.670> our<00:01:02.789> head<00:01:03.090> towards<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.019> ball

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
is putting our head towards the ball

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.380 
is putting our head towards the ball
that's<00:01:04.979> that's<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:05.549> really<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.180> lead

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
that's that's we really have to lead

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.359 
that's that's we really have to lead
with<00:01:06.420> our<00:01:06.689> head<00:01:06.960> here<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:07.950> don't<00:01:08.070> fall

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
with our head here so that we don't fall

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.270 
with our head here so that we don't fall
over<00:01:08.670> or<00:01:09.119> anything<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:11.070> goes

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
over or anything like that so it goes

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.149 
over or anything like that so it goes
towards<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
towards the

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.730 
towards the
and<00:01:12.310> the<00:01:12.850> front<00:01:13.150> foot<00:01:13.290> lands<00:01:14.290> on<00:01:14.409> the<00:01:14.530> hill

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
and the front foot lands on the hill

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.399 
and the front foot lands on the hill
first<00:01:15.119> that's<00:01:16.119> quite<00:01:16.479> an<00:01:16.570> important<00:01:16.990> part<00:01:17.200> we

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
first that's quite an important part we

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.039 
first that's quite an important part we
land<00:01:17.619> on<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.799> hill<00:01:18.100> go<00:01:18.970> onto<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.390> forefoot

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
land on the hill go onto the forefoot

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.680 
land on the hill go onto the forefoot
and<00:01:20.080> then<00:01:20.860> our<00:01:21.100> back<00:01:21.340> heel<00:01:21.640> can<00:01:21.909> come<00:01:22.119> off<00:01:22.299> and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
and then our back heel can come off and

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.330 
and then our back heel can come off and
let's<00:01:23.409> just<00:01:23.560> make<00:01:23.770> sure<00:01:23.950> that<00:01:23.979> we<00:01:24.190> don't

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
let's just make sure that we don't

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.399 
let's just make sure that we don't
rotate<00:01:24.549> fully<00:01:25.149> around<00:01:25.509> and<00:01:25.840> there's<00:01:26.320> no

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
rotate fully around and there's no

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:27.810 
rotate fully around and there's no
ballerinas<00:01:27.009> around<00:01:27.220> here<00:01:27.399> because<00:01:27.640> what<00:01:27.790> that

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
ballerinas around here because what that

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.660 
ballerinas around here because what that
does<00:01:28.210> is<00:01:28.840> it<00:01:28.990> opens<00:01:29.110> up<00:01:29.440> your<00:01:29.590> hips<00:01:29.799> and<00:01:30.490> it

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
does is it opens up your hips and it

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.889 
does is it opens up your hips and it
means<00:01:30.850> that<00:01:31.030> you're<00:01:31.119> going<00:01:31.240> to<00:01:31.270> play<00:01:31.390> across

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
for you guys head to the ball there just

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.410 
for you guys head to the ball there just
like<00:01:41.830> that<00:01:42.009> so<00:01:42.190> that's<00:01:42.369> that's<00:01:42.789> the<00:01:43.000> footwork

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
like that so that's that's the footwork

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.260 
like that so that's that's the footwork
once<00:01:43.960> you're<00:01:44.140> in<00:01:44.229> this<00:01:44.350> position<00:01:44.560> here<00:01:45.240> all<00:01:46.240> of

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
once you're in this position here all of

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.460 
once you're in this position here all of
this<00:01:46.479> case<00:01:46.780> of<00:01:47.020> is<00:01:47.229> being<00:01:47.920> still<00:01:49.470> everything

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
this case of is being still everything

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.889 
this case of is being still everything
has<00:01:50.649> to<00:01:50.830> be<00:01:50.950> still<00:01:51.369> just<00:01:52.090> for<00:01:52.300> a<00:01:52.330> moment<00:01:52.509> and

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
has to be still just for a moment and

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.520 
has to be still just for a moment and
then<00:01:53.800> all<00:01:54.039> the<00:01:54.159> comes<00:01:54.429> through<00:01:54.700> is<00:01:54.880> your<00:01:55.149> arms

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
then all the comes through is your arms

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.420 
then all the comes through is your arms
bang

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
bang

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.660 
bang
you'll<00:01:59.000> notice<00:01:59.650> there's<00:02:00.650> look<00:02:01.190> if<00:02:01.340> we<00:02:01.460> want<00:02:01.640> to

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
you'll notice there's look if we want to

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.580 
you'll notice there's look if we want to
keep<00:02:01.790> things<00:02:02.090> simple<00:02:02.420> here<00:02:02.450> is<00:02:03.050> probably<00:02:03.380> one

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
keep things simple here is probably one

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.920 
keep things simple here is probably one
thing<00:02:03.860> that<00:02:04.010> I<00:02:04.040> want<00:02:04.220> you<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.340> focus<00:02:04.580> on<00:02:04.930> that's

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
getting you the footwork right being

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.389 
getting you the footwork right being
still<00:02:08.450> for<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.750> moment<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.380> they're<00:02:10.250> just

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
still for a moment and they're just

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.580 
still for a moment and they're just
focusing<00:02:11.000> on<00:02:11.150> only<00:02:11.750> your<00:02:11.930> arms<00:02:12.140> coming

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
through focusing on that front elbow

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.770 
through focusing on that front elbow
that's<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.610> most<00:02:16.850> important<00:02:17.390> part<00:02:17.600> here

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
that's the most important part here

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.390 
that's the most important part here
you've<00:02:18.260> got<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.500> get<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.709> high<00:02:18.860> front<00:02:19.220> elbow

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
you've got to get the high front elbow

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.130 
you've got to get the high front elbow
it's<00:02:19.970> going<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.180> give<00:02:20.300> you<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.540> angle<00:02:20.959> on<00:02:21.050> the

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
it's going to give you the angle on the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.230 
it's going to give you the angle on the
bat<00:02:21.350> making<00:02:22.190> going<00:02:22.340> into<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.700> ground<00:02:22.910> and

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
bat making going into the ground and

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.970 
bat making going into the ground and
it's<00:02:23.660> also<00:02:23.900> going<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.230> allow<00:02:24.320> everything<00:02:24.800> to

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
it's also going to allow everything to

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.640 
it's also going to allow everything to
travel<00:02:25.430> in<00:02:25.580> a<00:02:25.790> straight<00:02:25.820> line<00:02:26.440> because<00:02:27.440> if<00:02:27.560> the

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
travel in a straight line because if the

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.860 
travel in a straight line because if the
ball<00:02:27.830> is<00:02:27.920> moving<00:02:27.980> around<00:02:28.360> we<00:02:29.360> want<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.720> go

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
ball is moving around we want to go

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.390 
ball is moving around we want to go
along<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.230> straight<00:02:30.560> line<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:30.980> case<00:02:31.190> our

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
along a straight line and case our

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.560 
along a straight line and case our
timings<00:02:31.880> out<00:02:32.060> that's<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.930> very<00:02:33.140> key<00:02:33.350> point
