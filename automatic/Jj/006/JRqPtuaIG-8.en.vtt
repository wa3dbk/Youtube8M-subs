was<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.120> mystery<00:00:48.570> mascara<00:00:49.110> review<00:00:49.500> so

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
was in the mystery mascara review so

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.490 
was in the mystery mascara review so
it's<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.760> same<00:00:50.820> exact<00:00:51.390> wand<00:00:51.690> nothing's

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
it's the same exact wand nothing's

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.889 
it's the same exact wand nothing's
changed<00:00:53.039> since<00:00:53.190> then<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:54.030> bristles<00:00:54.449> are<00:00:54.600> very

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
changed since then the bristles are very

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.330 
changed since then the bristles are very
well<00:00:55.140> separated<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.890> as<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.129> can<00:00:56.309> see

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
well separated and as you can see

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.310 
well separated and as you can see
there's<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.850> little<00:00:56.940> bit<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.600> tilt<00:00:58.020> on<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
there's a little bit of a tilt on the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.020 
there's a little bit of a tilt on the
actual<00:00:58.770> wand<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.430> think<00:00:59.640> that's<00:00:59.820> what

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
actual wand and I think that's what

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.349 
actual wand and I think that's what
really<00:01:00.149> helps<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.930> lashes<00:01:01.739> curl<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.520> stay

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
really helps the lashes curl and stay

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.179 
really helps the lashes curl and stay

i think the applicator does a pretty
good<00:05:25.760> job<00:05:25.910> so<00:05:30.340> i<00:05:31.340> really<00:05:31.729> like<00:05:31.910> layering

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
good job so i really like layering

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.200 
good job so i really like layering
because<00:05:33.229> i<00:05:33.260> like<00:05:33.560> the<00:05:33.860> tint<00:05:34.130> to<00:05:34.400> be<00:05:34.550> as<00:05:34.820> dark<00:05:35.030> as

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
because i like the tint to be as dark as

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.240 
because i like the tint to be as dark as
possible<00:05:35.389> but<00:05:36.110> if<00:05:36.200> you<00:05:36.289> like<00:05:36.440> it<00:05:36.650> more<00:05:36.800> subtle

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
possible but if you like it more subtle

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.070 
possible but if you like it more subtle
than<00:05:37.280> you<00:05:37.520> can<00:05:37.669> just<00:05:37.820> apply<00:05:38.000> one<00:05:38.330> layer<00:05:38.360> i<00:05:38.870> like

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
than you can just apply one layer i like

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.140 
than you can just apply one layer i like
to<00:05:39.229> apply<00:05:39.410> two<00:05:39.470> to<00:05:39.770> three<00:05:39.979> layers<00:05:40.160> we<00:05:40.669> are<00:05:40.940> done

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150
