00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
 all right 

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.810
 I am that our love never 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.560
 I would finish and I devoted myself to loving you as 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.660
 one more 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.570
 now I'm sad full of the while 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.030
 just from the government to breathe was not 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.799
 need to say that you loved me if you did not 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.750
 you did with the heart 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.910
 I would like to know why you played with me 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.940
 you changed my life because of disappointment and 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.940
 sadness 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.380
 this month 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.590
 I'm nobody to tell you what to do 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.199
 but you do things that make me a lot 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.300
 hurt and this I do not do it for you to have 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.370
 Sadness is for you to reflect and 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.290
 clients with the head i always give you 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.360
 I hope but costs to find your 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.059
 playing with my head that exploits me 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.190
 and this seems like you do not care 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.649
 I am like a seed on earth that 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.989
 I never speak of I have a city you 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.329
 you want or it's just a game where I'm going to 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.519
 losing pain is the pain that I'm not going to 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.500
 bear would be one more reason to 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.659
 start crying this is a story 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.820
 that we have to subscribe to touch the 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.549
 heart and let yourself be discovered or only 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.340
 let yourself be carried by the wind your photos 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.110
 So beautiful is the one we have the most 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.150
 for now it does not come in many colors 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.670
 but do not be afraid our love is 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.040
 higher my heart is fast he came back 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.140
 with scales is not immune to pain 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.299
 but if to the flames forgive me if you 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.729
 they get wrong when I write is that I can not 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.860
 leave stylized letters sometimes I have 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.560
 to laugh so as not to cry and cheat on me 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.120
 same and leave behind I feel sorry I ask you 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.950
 sorry for not being able 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.410
 sorry when I 'm there with you every 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.390
 instant and pierced by the arrows of 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.610
 cupid I give you my heart 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.860
 Take care of it with love forgive me little mister 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.050
 wrong when I write is that I can not leave 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.090
 of feeling my lips sometimes I have to 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.940
 laugh so as not to cry and cheat on me 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.310
 ignore while there is hope 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.650
 there is something to build we still have 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.960
 the time to be able to fulfill it only 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.510
 because you pay attention when you meet 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.330
 that kills me and I can no longer follow me 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.280
 will kill your life or you will kill me your sign was 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.500
 I promise illuminators with my light 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.970
 I hope everyone makes you think and date 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.060
 account of the pain you can achieve 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.770
 I hope you continue to feed me courage and 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.040
 neither doing loves likes of the poor 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.040
 heart 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.810
 that's 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.080
 this song is for a person who 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.690
 it did a lot of damage limit in my heart and 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.340
 I died completely shattered just 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.560
 I wanted to tell you that all the love that 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.540
 some day I felt mushrooms with the 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.400
 I hate and I can never look at the 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.940
 eyes because I have to go back to 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.940
 fall in love
