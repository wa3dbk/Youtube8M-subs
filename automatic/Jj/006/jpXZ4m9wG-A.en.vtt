bill<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.029> figure<00:00:06.299> I<00:00:06.600> was<00:00:06.810> released<00:00:07.109> by<00:00:07.290> Hasbro

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
bill to figure I was released by Hasbro

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.650 
bill to figure I was released by Hasbro
and<00:00:08.040> first<00:00:08.849> up<00:00:08.910> I<00:00:08.970> gotta<00:00:09.150> say<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.330> think<00:00:09.420> he's

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
and first up I gotta say I think he's

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.110 
and first up I gotta say I think he's
really<00:00:09.900> cool<00:00:10.200> one<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.099> better<00:00:11.340> figures

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
really cool one of the better figures

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.180 
really cool one of the better figures
from<00:00:12.330> Hasbro<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:12.780> think<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.410> definitely<00:00:13.980> one

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
from Hasbro I think and definitely one

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.709 
from Hasbro I think and definitely one
of<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.370> cooler<00:00:14.580> builder<00:00:14.969> figures<00:00:15.269> when<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.509> saw

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
of the cooler builder figures when I saw

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.390 
of the cooler builder figures when I saw
pictures<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.170> this<00:00:16.260> guy<00:00:16.470> got<00:00:16.710> really<00:00:16.980> excited

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
pictures of this guy got really excited

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.500 
pictures of this guy got really excited
right<00:00:17.550> away<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.760> thought<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.210> got<00:00:18.390> the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
right away I thought that got the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.750 
right away I thought that got the
likeness<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.650> character<00:00:20.010> down<00:00:20.189> really<00:00:20.550> well

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
likeness the character down really well

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.759 
likeness the character down really well
I<00:00:20.789> mean<00:00:20.970> not<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.810> he<00:00:22.080> should<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.439> incredibly

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
I mean not that he should be incredibly

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.250 
I mean not that he should be incredibly
difficult<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:24.240> sculpt<00:00:24.660> or<00:00:24.779> anything<00:00:25.109> he's

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
difficult to to sculpt or anything he's

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.109 
difficult to to sculpt or anything he's
pretty<00:00:25.769> huge<00:00:26.099> he's<00:00:26.490> supposed<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.849> be<00:00:26.939> just
