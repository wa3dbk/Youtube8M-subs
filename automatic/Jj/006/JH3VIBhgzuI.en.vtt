that's<00:00:34.200> right<00:00:34.350> here<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:35.190> replaced<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.790> with

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
that's right here we replaced it with

we<00:00:44.309> installed<00:00:44.700> our<00:00:45.000> Samsung<00:00:45.629> 840<00:00:46.469> pro<00:00:46.890> SSD

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
we installed our Samsung 840 pro SSD

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.880 
we installed our Samsung 840 pro SSD
into<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.420> caddy<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.410> allowed<00:00:49.680> us<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
into that caddy and that allowed us to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.650 
into that caddy and that allowed us to
take<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.340> existing<00:00:50.789> operating<00:00:50.910> system<00:00:51.539> that

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
take the existing operating system that

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.880 
take the existing operating system that
was<00:00:51.780> already<00:00:51.930> installed<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> Mac<00:00:52.739> and

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
was already installed on the Mac and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.889 
was already installed on the Mac and
create<00:00:53.460> an<00:00:53.520> image<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.390> copy<00:00:54.660> that

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
create an image of it and copy that

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.069 
create an image of it and copy that
image<00:00:55.020> over<00:00:55.530> onto<00:00:56.039> our<00:00:56.070> newly<00:00:56.730> installed<00:00:57.079> SSD

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079

that's<00:00:58.559> pretty<00:00:58.770> much<00:00:58.890> where<00:00:59.100> we<00:00:59.129> left<00:00:59.370> off<00:00:59.550> in

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
that's pretty much where we left off in

that's pretty much where we left off in
that<00:00:59.879> one<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.210> right<00:01:00.300> now<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:00.539> have<00:01:00.660> two<00:01:00.809> drives

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
that one so right now we have two drives

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.479 
that one so right now we have two drives
in<00:01:01.199> here<00:01:01.350> an<00:01:01.440> SSD<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:01.980> original

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
in here an SSD and the original

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.460 
in here an SSD and the original
mechanical<00:01:02.609> drive<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.899> video<00:01:04.260> we're

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
mechanical drive in this video we're

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.990 
mechanical drive in this video we're
actually<00:01:04.619> going<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.070> be<00:01:05.189> reinstalling<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
actually going to be reinstalling the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.160 
actually going to be reinstalling the
optical<00:01:06.390> drive<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.840> will<00:01:07.049> actually

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
optical drive and that will actually

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.160 
optical drive and that will actually
allow<00:01:07.650> us<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:08.130> install<00:01:08.640> Windows<00:01:09.390> 7<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:10.020> can

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
allow us to install Windows 7 so we can

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.800 
allow us to install Windows 7 so we can
set<00:01:10.350> up<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.650> device<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:11.760> use<00:01:12.420> with<00:01:12.600> boot
