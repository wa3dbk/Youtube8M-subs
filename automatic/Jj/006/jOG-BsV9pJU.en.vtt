00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.350 
you folded him up and honestly it it
doesn't<00:01:37.860> look<00:01:38.159> great<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.759> mean<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.000> from<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
doesn't look great I mean just from the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.050 
doesn't look great I mean just from the
side<00:01:39.570> that's<00:01:39.810> dumb<00:01:40.200> I'm<00:01:40.950> not<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.520> huge<00:01:41.729> fan<00:01:41.850> of

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
side that's dumb I'm not a huge fan of

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.460 
side that's dumb I'm not a huge fan of
this<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.479> mean<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:42.930> him<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.259> show<00:01:43.439> I

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
this I mean I like him in the show I

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.840 
this I mean I like him in the show I
think<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.159> got<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> really<00:01:44.460> cool<00:01:44.670> beer

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
think that it's got a really cool beer

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.670 
think that it's got a really cool beer
cooler<00:01:45.090> than<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.270> show<00:01:45.479> I'm<00:01:46.110> not<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.380> Voyager

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
cooler than the show I'm not the Voyager

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.069 
cooler than the show I'm not the Voyager
toys<00:01:46.890> but<00:01:47.250> for<00:01:47.460> sale<00:01:47.640> immerse<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.479> really

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
toys but for sale immerse it really

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.499 
toys but for sale immerse it really
wasn't<00:01:49.320> translate<00:01:49.740> well<00:01:49.890> if<00:01:50.820> I'm<00:01:51.030> completely

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
wasn't translate well if I'm completely

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.359 
wasn't translate well if I'm completely
honest<00:01:51.840> yeah<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.590> camera<00:01:52.829> looks<00:01:52.979> cool<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.280> he

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
honest yeah the camera looks cool and he

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.920 
honest yeah the camera looks cool and he
actually<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> bullet<00:01:54.030> firing<00:01:54.299> mechanism

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
actually is a bullet firing mechanism

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.840 
actually is a bullet firing mechanism
and<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.799> still<00:01:55.920> actually<00:01:56.070> having<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:56.640> like<00:01:56.820> a

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
and it's still actually having so like a

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.569 
and it's still actually having so like a
spring-loaded<00:01:57.329> mech<00:01:57.659> mechanism<00:01:58.490> just<00:01:59.490> get

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
spring-loaded mech mechanism just get

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.789 
spring-loaded mech mechanism just get
this<00:01:59.640> other<00:01:59.790> way<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.210> he<00:02:00.899> has<00:02:01.079> one<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.710> these

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
this other way and he has one of these

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.109 
this other way and he has one of these
little<00:02:01.950> mechanism<00:02:02.189> sort<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.909> ball

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
little mechanism sort of like the ball

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.350 
little mechanism sort of like the ball
push<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.380> then<00:02:04.920> basically<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.729> get

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
push that in and then basically you get

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.540 
push that in and then basically you get
to<00:02:06.450> push<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:07.200> partly<00:02:07.500> cannon<00:02:07.890> forward

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
to push this partly cannon forward

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.180 
to push this partly cannon forward
they'll<00:02:09.360> fire<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.899> think<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.739> is<00:02:10.950> quite

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
they'll fire I think that is quite

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.690 
they'll fire I think that is quite
ingenious<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.849> quite<00:02:12.060> like<00:02:12.239> that

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
ingenious I quite like that

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.979 
ingenious I quite like that
but<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:13.730> don't<00:02:14.090> think<00:02:14.239> it's<00:02:14.420> quite<00:02:14.599> enough<00:02:14.900> to

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
but I don't think it's quite enough to

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.080 
but I don't think it's quite enough to
save<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.409> vehicle<00:02:15.739> mode<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.459> let's<00:02:16.909> just

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
save the vehicle mode so let's just

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.399 
save the vehicle mode so let's just
abandon<00:02:17.629> this<00:02:17.750> vehicle<00:02:18.170> mode<00:02:18.290> because

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
abandon this vehicle mode because

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.649 
abandon this vehicle mode because
honestly<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:18.980> sucks<00:02:19.310> we<00:02:20.239> don't<00:02:20.330> have<00:02:20.450> wheels

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
honestly it sucks we don't have wheels

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:21.940 
honestly it sucks we don't have wheels
at<00:02:20.930> our<00:02:20.989> back<00:02:21.110> here<00:02:21.349> and<00:02:21.440> wheels<00:02:21.680> on<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:21.920> front

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
at our back here and wheels on the front

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.479 
at our back here and wheels on the front
but<00:02:22.489> I'm<00:02:23.080> kind<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.140> useless<00:02:24.409> because<00:02:24.950> you

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
but I'm kind of useless because you

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.080 
but I'm kind of useless because you
barely<00:02:26.000> rolls<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:27.549> it<00:02:28.549> feels<00:02:28.819> like<00:02:28.909> it's

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
barely rolls and it feels like it's

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.949 
barely rolls and it feels like it's
falling<00:02:29.269> apart<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.840> be<00:02:29.930> honest<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:31.640> yeah<00:02:32.150> let's

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
falling apart to be honest so yeah let's

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.140 
falling apart to be honest so yeah let's
get<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.409> the<00:02:33.709> absolute<00:02:34.129> saving<00:02:34.700> grace<00:02:34.879> of<00:02:35.060> this

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
get to the absolute saving grace of this

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.940 
get to the absolute saving grace of this
toy<00:02:35.329> which<00:02:35.569> is<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.900> robot<00:02:36.379> mode<00:02:36.530> okay<00:02:36.890> so

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
toy which is the robot mode okay so

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.890 
toy which is the robot mode okay so
transform<00:02:37.790> shockwave<00:02:38.420> what<00:02:38.629> we're<00:02:38.720> going<00:02:38.810> to

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
transform shockwave what we're going to

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.539 
transform shockwave what we're going to
do<00:02:39.079> is<00:02:39.409> we're<00:02:39.590> going<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.769> get<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.040> cannon<00:02:40.459> at

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
do is we're going to get the cannon at

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.160 
do is we're going to get the cannon at
the<00:02:40.670> waist<00:02:40.849> on<00:02:41.150> peg<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:41.629> the<00:02:41.870> fell<00:02:42.049> out<00:02:42.140> of

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
the waist on peg that the fell out of

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.039 
the waist on peg that the fell out of
the<00:02:42.230> way<00:02:42.610> lift<00:02:43.610> this<00:02:43.909> piece<00:02:44.150> up<00:02:44.329> then<00:02:44.900> we're

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
the way lift this piece up then we're

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.479 
the way lift this piece up then we're
going<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.260> do<00:02:45.349> is<00:02:45.590> going<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.160> take<00:02:46.340> this<00:02:46.400> piece

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
going to do is going to take this piece

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.250 
going to do is going to take this piece
here<00:02:46.760> i'm<00:02:46.910> going<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.180> rotate<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:47.750> around<00:02:47.840> at

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
here i'm going to rotate it around at

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.140 
here i'm going to rotate it around at
the<00:02:48.349> knee<00:02:48.560> like<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:49.609> that's<00:02:49.760> his<00:02:49.879> leg

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
the knee like that and that's his leg

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.000 
the knee like that and that's his leg
obviously<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.019> then<00:02:51.620> going<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.799> flip<00:02:51.920> out

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
obviously and then going to flip out

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.490 
obviously and then going to flip out
these<00:02:52.160> feet<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.640> there<00:02:53.299> we<00:02:53.450> have<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.810> leg<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.260> do

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
these feet and there we have a leg to do

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.380 
these feet and there we have a leg to do
the<00:02:54.590> seven<00:02:54.829> this<00:02:54.920> side<00:02:55.160> rotate<00:02:55.819> at<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.269> knee

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
the seven this side rotate at the knee

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.530 
the seven this side rotate at the knee
then<00:02:57.290> move<00:02:57.799> it<00:02:57.920> fall<00:02:58.099> on<00:02:58.129> the<00:02:58.310> ball<00:02:58.489> joint<00:02:58.790> and

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
then move it fall on the ball joint and

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.199 
then move it fall on the ball joint and
for<00:02:59.870> partly<00:03:00.140> feet<00:03:00.590> just<00:03:00.859> like<00:03:00.950> that<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:01.549> there

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
for partly feet just like that and there

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.080 
for partly feet just like that and there
are<00:03:02.390> is<00:03:02.659> legs<00:03:03.609> then<00:03:04.609> what<00:03:04.730> we're<00:03:04.819> going<00:03:04.849> to<00:03:05.000> do

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
are is legs then what we're going to do

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.240 
are is legs then what we're going to do
is<00:03:05.299> we're<00:03:05.959> going<00:03:06.079> to<00:03:06.140> come<00:03:06.319> around<00:03:06.409> here<00:03:06.769> and

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
is we're going to come around here and

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.930 
is we're going to come around here and
take<00:03:07.730> this<00:03:07.760> off<00:03:08.090> in<00:03:08.269> the<00:03:08.329> back<00:03:08.510> like<00:03:09.290> that<00:03:09.940> get

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
take this off in the back like that get

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.780 
take this off in the back like that get
that<00:03:11.120> round<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:12.709> front<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.280> right<00:03:13.549> to<00:03:13.700> that

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
that round the front and right to that

next<00:05:02.660> to<00:05:02.860> Megatron<00:05:03.860> and<00:05:05.230> Optimus<00:05:06.230> Prime<00:05:06.850> it's

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
next to Megatron and Optimus Prime it's

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.120 
next to Megatron and Optimus Prime it's
the<00:05:08.090> optimist<00:05:08.480> in<00:05:08.630> there<00:05:08.810> so<00:05:09.650> you<00:05:09.710> can<00:05:09.950> see

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
the optimist in there so you can see

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.460 
the optimist in there so you can see
that<00:05:10.310> he<00:05:10.370> does<00:05:10.490> scale<00:05:10.820> fairly<00:05:11.330> well<00:05:11.510> if<00:05:12.290> you

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
that he does scale fairly well if you

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.150 
that he does scale fairly well if you
can<00:05:12.590> get<00:05:12.680> him<00:05:12.800> stand<00:05:13.100> up<00:05:14.500> now<00:05:15.500> in<00:05:15.800> the<00:05:15.890> show<00:05:16.130> I

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
can get him stand up now in the show I

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.640 
can get him stand up now in the show I
think<00:05:17.000> it<00:05:17.150> was<00:05:17.210> bigger<00:05:17.510> than<00:05:17.870> Megatron<00:05:18.320> if<00:05:18.530> i

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
think it was bigger than Megatron if i

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.250 
think it was bigger than Megatron if i
think<00:05:18.830> is<00:05:18.920> about<00:05:19.040> the<00:05:19.100> same<00:05:19.250> size<00:05:19.310> diverse

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
think is about the same size diverse

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.110 
think is about the same size diverse
Myron's<00:05:21.260> can<00:05:21.440> share<00:05:21.650> in<00:05:21.740> a<00:05:21.770> while<00:05:21.950> so<00:05:22.250> there<00:05:23.030> we

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
Myron's can share in a while so there we

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.870 
Myron's can share in a while so there we
go<00:05:23.800> there<00:05:24.800> they<00:05:24.950> all<00:05:25.070> are<00:05:25.100> together<00:05:25.460> and<00:05:25.820> they

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
go there they all are together and they

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.790 
go there they all are together and they
do<00:05:25.940> look<00:05:26.240> pretty<00:05:26.480> badass<00:05:26.750> this<00:05:27.440> is<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.590> first

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
do look pretty badass this is the first

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.900 
do look pretty badass this is the first
time<00:05:28.010> that<00:05:28.070> i<00:05:28.280> should<00:05:28.460> add<00:05:28.550> them<00:05:28.700> all<00:05:28.760> together

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
time that i should add them all together

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.840 
time that i should add them all together
and<00:05:29.270> i<00:05:29.360> got<00:05:30.290> to<00:05:30.320> say<00:05:30.440> that's<00:05:30.980> pretty<00:05:31.400> damn<00:05:31.640> cool

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
and i got to say that's pretty damn cool

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.300 
and i got to say that's pretty damn cool
but<00:05:32.480> that<00:05:32.780> is<00:05:32.900> my<00:05:33.050> review<00:05:33.170> for<00:05:33.350> shock<00:05:33.860> wave<00:05:34.100> now

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
but that is my review for shock wave now

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.580 
but that is my review for shock wave now
overall<00:05:34.790> I<00:05:35.240> think<00:05:35.690> this<00:05:35.960> is<00:05:36.110> a<00:05:36.140> really<00:05:36.410> good

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
overall I think this is a really good

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.620 
overall I think this is a really good
figure<00:05:36.950> the<00:05:37.100> robot<00:05:37.370> mode<00:05:37.520> is<00:05:37.700> fantastic<00:05:38.480> it's

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
figure the robot mode is fantastic it's

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.210 
figure the robot mode is fantastic it's
good<00:05:38.810> enough<00:05:38.990> to<00:05:39.050> redeem<00:05:39.470> all<00:05:39.680> the<00:05:40.010> failures

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
good enough to redeem all the failures

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.940 
good enough to redeem all the failures
of<00:05:40.670> the<00:05:41.120> vehicle<00:05:41.510> mode<00:05:41.690> which<00:05:42.560> are<00:05:42.740> quite<00:05:42.830> a

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
of the vehicle mode which are quite a

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.280 
of the vehicle mode which are quite a
few<00:05:43.040> and<00:05:43.460> I<00:05:44.300> mean<00:05:44.450> we've<00:05:44.570> got<00:05:44.600> really<00:05:44.960> accurate

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
few and I mean we've got really accurate

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.960 
few and I mean we've got really accurate
looking<00:05:45.500> railroad<00:05:45.950> awesome<00:05:46.460> color<00:05:46.670> scheme

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
looking railroad awesome color scheme

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.250 
looking railroad awesome color scheme
and<00:05:47.000> it's<00:05:47.300> shock<00:05:47.600> wave<00:05:47.810> at<00:05:47.960> the<00:05:48.020> end<00:05:48.140> of<00:05:48.170> the

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
and it's shock wave at the end of the

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.290 
and it's shock wave at the end of the
day<00:05:48.350> you've<00:05:48.500> got<00:05:48.680> to<00:05:48.770> buy<00:05:48.920> it<00:05:48.980> but<00:05:49.910> there<00:05:50.120> is

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
day you've got to buy it but there is

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.750 
day you've got to buy it but there is
transformers<00:05:51.260> prime<00:05:51.470> beast<00:05:51.530> 12<00:05:52.250> side<00:05:52.550> of<00:05:52.670> a

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
transformers prime beast 12 side of a

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.190 
transformers prime beast 12 side of a
shock<00:05:53.090> wave<00:05:53.270> overall<00:05:53.720> I<00:05:53.750> would<00:05:53.930> give<00:05:54.170> this

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
shock wave overall I would give this

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.370 
shock wave overall I would give this
figure<00:05:54.680> a<00:05:54.830> solid<00:05:55.580> 8.5<00:05:55.760> out<00:05:56.390> of<00:05:56.420> 10<00:05:56.540> for<00:05:57.290> the

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
figure a solid 8.5 out of 10 for the

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.320 
figure a solid 8.5 out of 10 for the
robot<00:05:57.620> mode<00:05:57.770> probably<00:05:58.460> give<00:05:58.580> it<00:05:58.610> about<00:05:58.730> a<00:05:58.850> six

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
robot mode probably give it about a six

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.940 
robot mode probably give it about a six
or<00:05:59.510> a<00:05:59.540> five<00:05:59.900> for<00:06:00.200> the<00:06:00.290> vehicle<00:06:00.470> mode<00:06:00.770> and

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
or a five for the vehicle mode and

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.100 
or a five for the vehicle mode and
honestly<00:06:01.820> I<00:06:02.030> think<00:06:02.150> this<00:06:02.540> is<00:06:02.600> worth<00:06:02.900> your

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
honestly I think this is worth your

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.420 
honestly I think this is worth your
money<00:06:03.140> you<00:06:03.440> can<00:06:03.590> pick<00:06:03.770> this<00:06:03.860> guy<00:06:04.040> out<00:06:04.130> from<00:06:04.280> the

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
money you can pick this guy out from the

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.730 
money you can pick this guy out from the
power<00:06:04.640> toys<00:06:04.910> right<00:06:05.210> now<00:06:05.450> my<00:06:06.290> fact<00:06:06.530> that<00:06:06.650> will
