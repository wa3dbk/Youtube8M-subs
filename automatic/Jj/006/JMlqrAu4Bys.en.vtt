00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:11.100
 Hello, welcome to the picture, let's talk. 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.200
 in this lesson on the principle of 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:20.190
 rectilinear propagation of light for this we 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.890
 we will also define the concepts of 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.610
 shadow and gloom 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:31.920
 Look at this schematic in him we have 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:36.149
 a point source of light in the body is 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:41.579
 located in front of the light source and a 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:45.149
 to the one located after the body of the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.469
 several rays of light emitted 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.819
 by f 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:57.870
 some pass tangentiando the body to be and 

00:00:52.819 --> 00:01:00.449
 they even touch the screen to you. 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.489
 can see that when these rays touch 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:10.770
 against the formation of a 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:13.170
 called region is if the rays that are 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.939
 issued by f 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:21.869
 they can not get across the body 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:25.110
 this does not reach the region s 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:29.659
 the region is whether it is a region that we 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:33.659
 we call a shadow in the shade so it's 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:38.100
 characterized by the absence of lightning 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.009
 light the whole region around the shade 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.820
 which receives the light rays emitted by 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.320
 f 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:51.869
 is a region and illuminated that I called 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:56.759
 that region and you can see that 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:02:01.409
 the shadow region has the same shape 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:05.460
 of the body being this proves that the rays 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:08.610
 that tangent not to be and touched on until 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.540
 the air will follow in a straight line from 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:17.730
 otherwise the shadow would have otherwise 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:23.010
 so we say that the light is 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:27.860
 paid straight but in any type 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:31.830
 e-mail addresses not only in 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:35.849
 homogeneous and transparent 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:39.299
 now thinking of an extensive source of 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:43.319
 light and rays emitted by this source 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:46.709
 light that tangentiate a body if we 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:51.060
 we can finish some regions this 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:54.569
 region that is soon to possession where 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:03:00.359
 does not cross any beam of light emitted 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:03.209
 by the ab body will be a shadow region 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.430
 if we take a point, it's a point 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.010
 by the line a little above a little 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.920
 under the shadow region where 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:15.720
 passes a small amount of reais 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:19.170
 this region in the years called the penumbra 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:23.540
 the penumbra is not even an illuminated region and 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.940
 nor is it a shadow region a point is 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:31.500
 located in this region would be 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:35.400
 illuminated region a region that receives 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:39.389
 many rays of light emitted by the source 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:43.590
 still looking at the bulkhead and shadow 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:48.030
 the closer to the bulkhead the body 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:52.829
 the shadow will be sharper 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:55.769
 the farther from the lower 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:59.700
 shadow shape definition 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:06.810
 you can still conclude that all this 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:10.010
 The region behind the body c is a 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:14.160
 region that does not receive light rays 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:18.359
 from the source and that is, it is 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:22.079
 a whole region of shade now that we 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.990
 we know how the regions are formed 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:29.599
 of shadow and also of penumbra 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:32.599
 we will understand how the 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:32.599
 eclipses
