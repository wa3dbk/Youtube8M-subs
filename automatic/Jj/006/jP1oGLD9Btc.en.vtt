00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.890 
yo and I gotta say I think it feels
little<00:04:28.650> bit<00:04:28.920> better<00:04:29.100> on<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.940> galaxy<00:04:30.270> s3<00:04:30.480> in

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
little bit better on the galaxy s3 in

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.660 
little bit better on the galaxy s3 in
terms<00:04:31.380> of<00:04:31.500> smoothness<00:04:31.560> and<00:04:31.980> everything<00:04:32.280> so

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
terms of smoothness and everything so

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.040 
terms of smoothness and everything so
that<00:04:32.700> could<00:04:33.030> be<00:04:33.180> because<00:04:33.360> they<00:04:33.690> have<00:04:33.720> like

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
that could be because they have like

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.260 
that could be because they have like
more<00:04:34.830> effects<00:04:35.220> here<00:04:35.460> they<00:04:35.670> as<00:04:35.790> on<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.030> iPhone

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
more effects here they as on the iPhone

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.590 
more effects here they as on the iPhone

4s
I<00:04:36.750> know<00:04:37.050> because<00:04:37.410> from<00:04:37.740> what<00:04:37.950> I've<00:04:38.040> heard<00:04:38.070> they

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
I know because from what I've heard they

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.120 
I know because from what I've heard they
have<00:04:39.210> like<00:04:39.420> off<00:04:39.600> master<00:04:39.990> games<00:04:40.170> for<00:04:40.710> for<00:04:40.980> some

smartphones they played on mid

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.620 
smartphones they played on mid
settings<00:04:43.830> so<00:04:44.640> you<00:04:44.700> don't<00:04:45.030> get<00:04:45.180> all<00:04:45.240> the

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
settings so you don't get all the

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.540 
settings so you don't get all the
particles<00:04:45.930> and<00:04:46.440> affection<00:04:46.860> air<00:04:46.950> things<00:04:47.220> and

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
on some phones they get all of these

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.580 
on some phones they get all of these
effects<00:04:50.010> you<00:04:50.760> know<00:04:50.880> I<00:04:51.090> don't<00:04:51.600> think<00:04:51.930> I'm<00:04:52.290> sure

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
effects you know I don't think I'm sure

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.620 
effects you know I don't think I'm sure
if<00:04:52.680> you<00:04:52.770> can<00:04:52.890> edit<00:04:53.100> that<00:04:53.190> in<00:04:54.020> options<00:04:56.330> see<00:04:57.330> I

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
if you can edit that in options see I

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.930 
if you can edit that in options see I
don't<00:04:57.750> think<00:04:57.990> you<00:04:58.410> can<00:04:58.530> change<00:04:58.830> the<00:04:58.980> graphics

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
well yeah but that's kind of weird to

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.600 
well yeah but that's kind of weird to
come<00:05:04.140> change<00:05:04.380> the<00:05:04.470> graphics<00:05:04.890> so<00:05:05.040> you<00:05:05.280> can<00:05:05.430> I

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
come change the graphics so you can I

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.430 
come change the graphics so you can I
see<00:05:05.670> if<00:05:05.820> they've<00:05:06.000> added<00:05:06.450> a<00:05:06.480> option<00:05:07.050> like<00:05:07.200> that

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
see if they've added a option like that

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.070 
see if they've added a option like that
but<00:05:08.310> I've<00:05:08.880> got<00:05:08.940> to<00:05:09.270> say<00:05:09.390> it<00:05:09.540> just<00:05:09.810> very<00:05:10.020> very

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:58.969 
it felt like it was running a little bit
better<00:05:56.549> on<00:05:56.909> the<00:05:57.329> galaxy<00:05:57.629> s3<00:05:57.869> but<00:05:58.559> it<00:05:58.829> also

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
better on the galaxy s3 but it also

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.719 
better on the galaxy s3 but it also
feels<00:05:59.369> like<00:05:59.669> it<00:06:00.269> maybe<00:06:00.539> did<00:06:00.809> a<00:06:01.049> wholesome<00:06:01.979> lag
