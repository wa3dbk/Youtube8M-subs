hi everyone just want to show you this
new<00:00:02.610> solar<00:00:03.030> panel<00:00:03.480> I<00:00:03.570> built<00:00:03.810> here<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.710> panel

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
new solar panel I built here the panel

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.610 
new solar panel I built here the panel
on<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.759> talk<00:00:06.029> was<00:00:06.359> actually<00:00:06.779> made<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.259> few

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
on the talk was actually made a few

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.580 
on the talk was actually made a few
weeks<00:00:08.280> ago<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.809> one<00:00:09.960> on<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.139> bottom<00:00:10.349> I

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
weeks ago and the one on the bottom I

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.400 
weeks ago and the one on the bottom I
just<00:00:10.620> recently<00:00:11.280> finished<00:00:11.960> about<00:00:12.960> two<00:00:13.019> days

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
just recently finished about two days

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.160 
just recently finished about two days
ago<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.099> I've<00:00:15.000> just<00:00:15.330> connected<00:00:15.719> them

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
ago and I've just connected them

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.310 
ago and I've just connected them
together<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:17.369> also<00:00:18.210> connected<00:00:18.960> them<00:00:19.080> in

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
together and also connected them in

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.000 
together and also connected them in
series<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.970> panel<00:00:21.449> here<00:00:21.930> has<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.350> total<00:00:22.800> of

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
series so this panel here has a total of

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.950 
series so this panel here has a total of
36<00:00:23.880> cells<00:00:25.430> now<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.640> panel<00:00:27.060> up<00:00:27.240> here<00:00:27.300> these

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
36 cells now this panel up here these

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.230 
36 cells now this panel up here these
are<00:00:28.140> two<00:00:28.170> separate<00:00:28.890> panels<00:00:29.429> connected

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
are two separate panels connected

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.820 
are two separate panels connected
together<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:31.050> take<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> look<00:00:31.410> at<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.619> back

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
together you take a look at the back

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.530 
together you take a look at the back
there<00:00:32.430> -<00:00:32.750> wooden<00:00:33.750> box<00:00:34.230> panels<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.370> I've<00:00:36.239> just

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
there - wooden box panels and I've just

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.049 
there - wooden box panels and I've just
connected<00:00:36.930> them<00:00:37.320> all<00:00:37.530> into<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.219> one<00:00:38.579> panel

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
connected them all into this one panel

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.920 
connected them all into this one panel
so<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.020> they're<00:00:40.320> connected<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:41.010> series<00:00:41.430> and

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
so and they're connected in series and

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.590 
so and they're connected in series and
this<00:00:42.930> gives<00:00:43.200> me<00:00:43.440> 18<00:00:43.980> volts<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:45.329> panel

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
this gives me 18 volts and this panel

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.240 
this gives me 18 volts and this panel
here<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.870> already<00:00:46.050> made<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> video<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:47.070> this

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
here I already made a video on it this

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.229 
here I already made a video on it this
one<00:00:47.489> has<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> backing<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.780> body<00:00:49.530> filler<00:00:49.829> and

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
one has a backing of body filler and

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.150 
one has a backing of body filler and
just<00:00:51.239> spray<00:00:51.449> painted<00:00:51.930> white<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.860> cells

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
just spray painted white and the cells

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.400 
just spray painted white and the cells
are<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.610> laid<00:00:53.850> out<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.870> one<00:00:55.050> here<00:00:55.289> is

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
are just laid out and this one here is

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.470 
are just laid out and this one here is
slightly<00:00:55.770> different<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.610> I've<00:00:57.059> made<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.239> new

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
slightly different and I've made a new

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.010 
slightly different and I've made a new
video<00:00:57.829> on<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:59.190> one<00:00:59.370> as<00:00:59.489> well<00:00:59.699> on<00:01:00.059> how<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.629> build

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
video on this one as well on how I build

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.009 
video on this one as well on how I build
this<00:01:01.469> wooden<00:01:02.399> box<00:01:02.579> panel<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.480> one<00:01:03.719> here<00:01:03.989> I

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
this wooden box panel this one here I

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.810 
this wooden box panel this one here I
use<00:01:04.320> fiberglass<00:01:04.860> Short<00:01:05.729> Strand<00:01:06.170> fiberglass

use fiberglass Short Strand fiberglass

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.149 
use fiberglass Short Strand fiberglass
it's<00:01:08.820> for<00:01:09.030> automotive<00:01:09.659> rust<00:01:10.350> repair<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.950> I've

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
it's for automotive rust repair and I've

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.899 
it's for automotive rust repair and I've
just<00:01:11.369> smooth<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.880> over<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.470> wood<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:14.460> this

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
just smooth it over the the wood on this

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.840 
just smooth it over the the wood on this
panel<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.320> contacts<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:17.340> go<00:01:17.610> out

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
panel and the contacts just go out

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.020 
panel and the contacts just go out
through<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.180> back<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.590> one<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.790> one

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
through the back on this one this one

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.960 
through the back on this one this one
here<00:01:21.360> they<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:22.009> come<00:01:23.009> underneath<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.549> glass

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
here they just come underneath the glass

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.200 
here they just come underneath the glass
and<00:01:24.360> go<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.350> top<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.430> design<00:01:26.880> here

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
and go on to the top so this design here

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.999 
and go on to the top so this design here
is<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> little<00:01:27.630> better<00:01:27.960> there's<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.650> little<00:01:28.860> more

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
is a little better there's a little more

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.410 
is a little better there's a little more
room<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.090> could<00:01:30.390> do<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:32.150> I've<00:01:33.150> just

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
room so I could do that and I've just

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.499 
room so I could do that and I've just
connected<00:01:33.810> them<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.740> these<00:01:35.549> batteries<00:01:36.180> here

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
connected them to these batteries here

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.450 
connected them to these batteries here
all<00:01:37.049> these<00:01:37.290> batteries<00:01:37.500> are<00:01:37.710> connected<00:01:38.250> in

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
all these batteries are connected in

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.149 
all these batteries are connected in
parallel<00:01:39.290> now<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.350> only<00:01:40.560> problem<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
parallel now the only problem is the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.359 
parallel now the only problem is the
wire<00:01:41.340> coming<00:01:41.670> from<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> panel<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.540> fairly

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
wire coming from the panel is fairly

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.280 
wire coming from the panel is fairly
thin<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.850> does<00:01:45.030> warm<00:01:45.299> up<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.630> bit<00:01:45.659> and

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
thin so it does warm up a bit and

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.980 
thin so it does warm up a bit and
there's<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.070> few<00:01:47.369> issues<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.420> change

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
there's a few issues I have to change

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.179 
there's a few issues I have to change
there<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:49.380> these<00:01:49.530> batteries<00:01:49.950> are<00:01:50.070> all

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
there but these batteries are all

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.910 
there but these batteries are all
charged<00:01:50.610> up<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:51.509> one<00:01:51.750> here<00:01:52.020> rain<00:01:52.439> battery

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
charged up this one here rain battery

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.700 
charged up this one here rain battery
this<00:01:53.369> one<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.470> these<00:01:55.470> two<00:01:55.950> here<00:01:56.990> these<00:01:57.990> this

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
this one and these two here these this

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.560 
this one and these two here these this
battery<00:01:59.130> here<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.460> an<00:01:59.579> old<00:01:59.729> one<00:02:00.000> it's<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.360> weak

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
battery here is an old one it's a weak

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.620 
battery here is an old one it's a weak
battery<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:01.380> one<00:02:01.619> also<00:02:02.060> but<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.240> one<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.540> a

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
battery this one also but this one is a

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.130 
battery this one also but this one is a
good<00:02:03.810> one<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.250> one<00:02:05.570> but<00:02:06.570> they're<00:02:06.719> all<00:02:06.899> up

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
good one and this one but they're all up

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.570 
good one and this one but they're all up
too<00:02:07.409> right<00:02:07.680> now<00:02:07.979> both<00:02:08.450> 13-7<00:02:09.770> so<00:02:10.770> in<00:02:11.039> probably

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
too right now both 13-7 so in probably

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.540 
too right now both 13-7 so in probably
another<00:02:11.819> day

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
another day

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.540 
another day
so<00:02:12.790> it'll<00:02:13.180> jump<00:02:13.510> up<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.750> over<00:02:14.590> 14<00:02:15.010> volts<00:02:15.340> so<00:02:15.460> I'm

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
so it'll jump up to over 14 volts so I'm

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.680 
so it'll jump up to over 14 volts so I'm
gonna<00:02:15.640> have<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:15.940> hook<00:02:16.210> up<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:17.100> automatic

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
gonna have to hook up a automatic

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.960 
gonna have to hook up a automatic
charger<00:02:19.690> on<00:02:19.840> this<00:02:20.310> controller<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.700> can<00:02:21.820> buy

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
charger on this controller you can buy

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.900 
charger on this controller you can buy
those<00:02:22.210> right<00:02:22.540> at<00:02:22.630> Canadian<00:02:22.930> Tire<00:02:22.960> 20<00:02:23.650> bucks<00:02:23.910> so

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
those right at Canadian Tire 20 bucks so

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.510 
those right at Canadian Tire 20 bucks so
it<00:02:25.000> connected<00:02:25.450> these<00:02:25.660> two<00:02:26.040> wooden<00:02:27.040> panels

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
it connected these two wooden panels

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.190 
it connected these two wooden panels
together<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.510> this<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.500> now<00:02:29.970> 36<00:02:30.970> cell<00:02:31.330> unit<00:02:31.870> so

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
together and this is now 36 cell unit so

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.500 
together and this is now 36 cell unit so
just<00:02:32.830> like<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.160> store-bought<00:02:33.610> ones<00:02:33.910> they

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
just like the store-bought ones they

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.980 
just like the store-bought ones they
come<00:02:34.750> in<00:02:34.930> 36<00:02:35.500> L<00:02:35.740> as<00:02:36.070> well<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:37.210> so<00:02:37.630> this<00:02:37.780> gives

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
come in 36 L as well and so this gives

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.520 
come in 36 L as well and so this gives
you<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.260> good<00:02:38.550> voltage<00:02:39.550> for<00:02:40.330> charging<00:02:40.780> and

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
you a good voltage for charging and

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.340 
you a good voltage for charging and
let's<00:02:42.220> take<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.430> look<00:02:42.700> at<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.420> wiring<00:02:43.870> here<00:02:44.290> I

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
let's take a look at the wiring here I

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.750 
let's take a look at the wiring here I
just<00:02:44.620> connected<00:02:45.100> these<00:02:45.310> two<00:02:45.610> in<00:02:46.180> series<00:02:46.600> and

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
just connected these two in series and

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.120 
just connected these two in series and
the<00:02:48.760> wiring<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:49.240> pretty<00:02:49.420> rough<00:02:49.630> right<00:02:49.960> now

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
the wiring is pretty rough right now

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.350 
the wiring is pretty rough right now
this<00:02:51.130> is<00:02:51.280> all<00:02:51.430> gonna<00:02:51.610> have<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:51.850> be<00:02:51.970> attached

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
this is all gonna have to be attached

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.590 
this is all gonna have to be attached
with<00:02:52.840> clips<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.100> back<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.820> properly

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
with clips to the back and properly

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.280 
with clips to the back and properly
insulated<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:57.480> now<00:02:58.480> I've<00:02:58.660> had<00:02:58.870> I<00:02:59.110> have<00:02:59.260> a

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
insulated and now I've had I have a

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.840 
insulated and now I've had I have a
diode<00:02:59.560> on<00:02:59.890> here<00:03:00.070> you<00:03:00.130> have<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.490> have<00:03:00.520> a<00:03:00.610> diode

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
diode on here you have to have a diode

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.670 
diode on here you have to have a diode
on<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.570> panel's<00:03:01.990> or<00:03:04.170> what'll<00:03:05.170> happen<00:03:05.350> is<00:03:05.560> at

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
on the panel's or what'll happen is at

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.700 
on the panel's or what'll happen is at
night<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:06.280> could<00:03:06.610> drain<00:03:06.910> your<00:03:07.090> batteries<00:03:07.710> so

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
night it could drain your batteries so

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.230 
night it could drain your batteries so
you<00:03:08.740> have<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.160> have<00:03:09.250> a<00:03:09.280> diode<00:03:09.520> it<00:03:09.790> only<00:03:10.000> allows

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
you have to have a diode it only allows

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.480 
you have to have a diode it only allows
the<00:03:10.450> current<00:03:10.600> to<00:03:10.780> flow<00:03:10.870> one<00:03:11.380> way<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:12.250> allows

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
the current to flow one way so allows

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.950 
the current to flow one way so allows
the<00:03:12.760> current<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.060> go<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.360> batteries<00:03:13.780> to

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
the current to go to the batteries to

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.690 
the current to go to the batteries to
charge<00:03:14.200> them<00:03:14.500> but<00:03:14.860> it<00:03:14.980> won't<00:03:15.190> allow<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.610> to

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
charge them but it won't allow it to

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.180 
charge them but it won't allow it to
come<00:03:15.850> back<00:03:16.120> into<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.840> panel<00:03:17.260> but

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
come back into the panel but

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.790 
come back into the panel but
unfortunately<00:03:18.820> with<00:03:19.270> this<00:03:19.510> diode<00:03:20.230> I<00:03:20.410> have

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
unfortunately with this diode I have

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.340 
unfortunately with this diode I have
here<00:03:22.230> it's<00:03:23.230> can't<00:03:23.860> handle<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:25.350> current

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
here it's can't handle the current

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.960 
here it's can't handle the current
that's<00:03:26.680> flowing<00:03:26.770> through<00:03:27.280> here<00:03:27.400> so<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:27.850> was

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
that's flowing through here so it was

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.840 
that's flowing through here so it was
getting<00:03:28.239> so<00:03:28.450> hot<00:03:28.780> that<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.620> had<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.250> actually

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
getting so hot that I had to actually

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.330 
getting so hot that I had to actually
cool<00:03:31.239> it<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:31.570> in<00:03:31.840> some<00:03:32.230> water<00:03:32.440> so<00:03:32.770> if<00:03:33.130> liquid

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
cool it and in some water so if liquid

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.510 
cool it and in some water so if liquid
cooled<00:03:33.850> this<00:03:34.239> diode<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.920> I'm<00:03:36.040> gonna<00:03:36.130> have<00:03:36.370> to

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
cooled this diode so I'm gonna have to

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.330 
cooled this diode so I'm gonna have to
change<00:03:36.790> this<00:03:37.030> up<00:03:37.330> because<00:03:38.110> this<00:03:38.470> diode<00:03:38.980> was<00:03:39.160> so

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
change this up because this diode was so

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.300 
change this up because this diode was so
hot<00:03:39.580> when<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:40.570> dunked<00:03:41.230> it<00:03:41.440> in<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.650> water<00:03:41.830> it

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
hot when I dunked it in the water it

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.130 
hot when I dunked it in the water it
actually<00:03:42.989> sizzled<00:03:43.989> and<00:03:44.380> steam<00:03:44.860> came<00:03:45.190> off<00:03:45.340> so

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
actually sizzled and steam came off so

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.420 
actually sizzled and steam came off so
that's<00:03:47.140> a<00:03:47.380> problem<00:03:47.620> there<00:03:48.010> I<00:03:48.040> have<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.250> get<00:03:48.370> a

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
that's a problem there I have to get a

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.930 
that's a problem there I have to get a
heavy-duty<00:03:48.730> diode<00:03:49.330> for<00:03:49.870> this<00:03:50.020> one<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.530> I<00:03:51.430> have

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
heavy-duty diode for this one and I have

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.000 
heavy-duty diode for this one and I have
some<00:03:52.390> just<00:03:52.810> some<00:03:52.930> automotive<00:03:53.320> plugs<00:03:53.770> these

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
some just some automotive plugs these

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.150 
some just some automotive plugs these
are<00:03:54.190> just<00:03:54.570> automotive<00:03:55.570> from<00:03:56.320> random<00:03:56.830> cars

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
are just automotive from random cars

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.479 
are just automotive from random cars
this<00:03:57.459> is<00:03:57.670> out<00:03:57.970> of<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:58.180> Firefly<00:03:58.980> Pontiac<00:03:59.980> Firefly

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
this is out of a Firefly Pontiac Firefly

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.660 
this is out of a Firefly Pontiac Firefly
this<00:04:01.330> one<00:04:01.540> was<00:04:01.720> as<00:04:01.900> well<00:04:02.110> I<00:04:02.410> have<00:04:03.070> so<00:04:03.310> many<00:04:03.459> of

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
this one was as well I have so many of

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.820 
this one was as well I have so many of
these<00:04:03.700> cars<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.270> wiring<00:04:05.080> harnesses<00:04:05.530> around

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
these cars and wiring harnesses around

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.130 
these cars and wiring harnesses around
so<00:04:06.070> and<00:04:06.400> they<00:04:06.910> have<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.300> rubber<00:04:07.480> seals<00:04:07.870> in

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
so and they have the rubber seals in

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.540 
so and they have the rubber seals in
them<00:04:08.320> so<00:04:08.590> they<00:04:09.400> are<00:04:09.430> an<00:04:10.239> okay<00:04:10.780> plug<00:04:11.050> to<00:04:11.260> use<00:04:11.550> but

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
them so they are an okay plug to use but

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.530 
them so they are an okay plug to use but
you<00:04:12.580> could<00:04:12.910> buy<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.180> proper<00:04:13.959> solar<00:04:14.830> panel

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
you could buy the proper solar panel

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.060 
you could buy the proper solar panel
plugs

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.969 

so<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.310> panel<00:04:20.549> here<00:04:20.970> at<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.359> bottom<00:04:21.810> is<00:04:22.560> made

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
so the panel here at the bottom is made

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.050 
so the panel here at the bottom is made
up<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.790> a<00:04:24.150> two-by-four<00:04:24.930> frame<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.820> I've<00:04:26.820> just

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
up of a two-by-four frame and I've just

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.629 
up of a two-by-four frame and I've just
used<00:04:27.210> some<00:04:27.570> chipboard<00:04:27.960> for<00:04:28.590> this<00:04:28.770> one<00:04:29.039> now

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
used some chipboard for this one now

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.140 
used some chipboard for this one now
chipboard<00:04:30.539> is<00:04:31.020> not<00:04:31.590> really<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:33.000> best

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
chipboard is not really the best

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.300 
chipboard is not really the best
material<00:04:33.780> to<00:04:34.229> use<00:04:34.440> for<00:04:34.470> this<00:04:34.830> you'd<00:04:35.100> rather

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
material to use for this you'd rather

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.969 
material to use for this you'd rather
use<00:04:35.699> plywood<00:04:36.259> but<00:04:37.259> I<00:04:37.320> just<00:04:37.530> want<00:04:37.710> to<00:04:37.770> try<00:04:37.949> it

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
use plywood but I just want to try it

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.550 
use plywood but I just want to try it
out<00:04:38.130> because<00:04:38.280> this<00:04:38.490> is<00:04:38.639> half<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:39.180> money<00:04:39.560> of

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
out because this is half the money of

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.189 
out because this is half the money of
plywood<00:04:41.160> so<00:04:41.400> I've<00:04:42.210> coated<00:04:42.570> it<00:04:42.870> with<00:04:42.900> the

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
plywood so I've coated it with the

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.620 
plywood so I've coated it with the
fiberglass<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:44.070> I've<00:04:44.699> also<00:04:44.880> painted<00:04:45.240> the

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
fiberglass and I've also painted the

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.629 
fiberglass and I've also painted the
backside<00:04:46.139> of<00:04:46.440> painted<00:04:46.800> everything<00:04:47.070> I'm<00:04:47.520> gonna

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
backside of painted everything I'm gonna

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.560 
backside of painted everything I'm gonna
do<00:04:47.850> a<00:04:47.880> recode<00:04:48.419> on<00:04:48.750> this<00:04:49.139> with<00:04:49.410> this<00:04:49.740> exterior

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
do a recode on this with this exterior

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.390 
do a recode on this with this exterior
paint<00:04:51.570> just<00:04:52.020> just<00:04:52.380> an<00:04:52.500> outdoor<00:04:52.860> pane<00:04:53.100> I<00:04:53.130> had

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
paint just just an outdoor pane I had

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.930 
paint just just an outdoor pane I had
lots<00:04:54.300> of<00:04:54.479> leftover<00:04:55.139> cans<00:04:56.039> from<00:04:56.400> from

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
lots of leftover cans from from

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.180 
lots of leftover cans from from
different<00:04:57.060> jobs<00:04:57.539> so<00:04:58.320> I<00:04:58.350> have<00:04:58.710> lots<00:04:58.889> of

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
different jobs so I have lots of

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.420 
different jobs so I have lots of
exterior<00:04:59.820> paint<00:05:00.620> so<00:05:01.620> it's<00:05:01.740> 5:30<00:05:02.220> in<00:05:02.370> the

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
exterior paint so it's 5:30 in the

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.879 
exterior paint so it's 5:30 in the
afternoon<00:05:02.490> and<00:05:03.210> I'm<00:05:03.900> just<00:05:04.110> gonna<00:05:04.260> do<00:05:04.530> a<00:05:04.560> test

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
afternoon and I'm just gonna do a test

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.580 
afternoon and I'm just gonna do a test
now<00:05:05.220> with<00:05:05.490> a<00:05:05.520> motor<00:05:05.820> and<00:05:06.120> see<00:05:06.870> how<00:05:07.080> it<00:05:07.260> powers

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
now with a motor and see how it powers

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.950 
now with a motor and see how it powers
it<00:05:07.770> so<00:05:08.520> I<00:05:08.550> have<00:05:08.729> my<00:05:08.849> test<00:05:09.060> motor<00:05:09.360> here<00:05:09.750> and

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
it so I have my test motor here and

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.140 
it so I have my test motor here and
let's<00:05:10.349> just<00:05:10.560> see<00:05:10.770> how<00:05:11.039> powerful<00:05:11.550> this<00:05:11.729> panel

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
let's just see how powerful this panel

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:20.260 
let's just see how powerful this panel
is

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:27.520 

nut<00:05:20.840> sack<00:05:21.169> no<00:05:21.500> mom<00:05:22.030> just<00:05:25.720> see<00:05:26.720> how<00:05:26.930> powerful

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
nut sack no mom just see how powerful

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:43.250 
nut sack no mom just see how powerful
this<00:05:27.710> is

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.050 

so<00:05:44.260> now<00:05:44.410> I<00:05:44.440> have<00:05:44.710> a<00:05:44.740> utility<00:05:45.310> light

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
so now I have a utility light

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.380 
so now I have a utility light
it's<00:05:46.540> a<00:05:46.660> halogen<00:05:47.170> bulb<00:05:47.410> I'm<00:05:47.740> not<00:05:48.130> sure<00:05:48.610> of<00:05:48.880> the

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
it's a halogen bulb I'm not sure of the

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.590 
it's a halogen bulb I'm not sure of the
wattage<00:05:49.630> of<00:05:50.020> this<00:05:50.280> light<00:05:51.280> it's<00:05:51.910> at<00:05:52.090> least<00:05:52.330> a

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
wattage of this light it's at least a

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.230 
wattage of this light it's at least a
hundred<00:05:52.750> watts<00:05:53.400> because<00:05:54.400> it<00:05:54.520> dad's<00:05:54.730> batteries

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
hundred watts because it dad's batteries

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.020 
hundred watts because it dad's batteries
really<00:05:55.510> easily<00:05:55.780> so<00:05:56.650> just<00:05:56.890> turn<00:05:57.040> it<00:05:57.160> on<00:05:57.250> see

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
really easily so just turn it on see

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.790 
really easily so just turn it on see
what<00:05:58.150> happens<00:05:58.600> Oh<00:05:59.520> spark<00:06:00.520> and<00:06:01.330> there<00:06:02.260> we<00:06:02.410> go<00:06:02.530> so

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
what happens Oh spark and there we go so

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.180 
what happens Oh spark and there we go so
it<00:06:03.040> powers<00:06:03.460> that<00:06:03.700> light<00:06:03.940> and<00:06:04.720> this<00:06:05.560> light<00:06:05.620> is

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
it powers that light and this light is

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.550 
it powers that light and this light is
hard<00:06:06.670> to<00:06:06.820> power<00:06:07.030> on<00:06:07.390> the<00:06:07.720> panel's<00:06:08.110> actually

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
hard to power on the panel's actually

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.650 
hard to power on the panel's actually
the<00:06:08.710> other<00:06:08.860> panels<00:06:09.250> I<00:06:09.370> made<00:06:09.550> unless<00:06:10.330> you<00:06:10.480> have

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
the other panels I made unless you have

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.040 
the other panels I made unless you have
enough<00:06:11.130> connected<00:06:12.130> together<00:06:12.220> so<00:06:13.180> you<00:06:13.660> can<00:06:13.810> see

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
enough connected together so you can see

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.970 
enough connected together so you can see
there's<00:06:14.260> a<00:06:14.640> spark<00:06:15.640> there

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980 
there's a spark there

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.730 
there's a spark there
it's<00:06:17.980> amazing<00:06:18.460> what<00:06:18.820> these<00:06:19.090> solar<00:06:20.050> cells<00:06:20.410> can

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
it's amazing what these solar cells can

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.160 
it's amazing what these solar cells can
can<00:06:21.610> put<00:06:21.880> out<00:06:22.060> power<00:06:22.960> wise<00:06:23.910> and<00:06:24.930> the<00:06:25.930> wires

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.170 
can put out power wise and the wires

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.090 
can put out power wise and the wires
starting<00:06:26.620> to<00:06:26.680> get<00:06:26.770> hot<00:06:27.010> in<00:06:27.280> my<00:06:27.400> hand<00:06:27.670> some<00:06:29.100> so

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.100 
starting to get hot in my hand some so

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.060 
starting to get hot in my hand some so
it<00:06:30.190> powers<00:06:30.520> that<00:06:30.760> halogen<00:06:31.390> light<00:06:31.980> so<00:06:32.980> I've

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
it powers that halogen light so I've

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.420 
it powers that halogen light so I've
hooked<00:06:33.220> the<00:06:33.370> solar<00:06:33.610> panel<00:06:34.060> to<00:06:34.090> this<00:06:35.070> 18<00:06:36.070> volt

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
hooked the solar panel to this 18 volt

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.600 
hooked the solar panel to this 18 volt
cordless<00:06:37.210> drill<00:06:37.810> and<00:06:38.320> I<00:06:38.920> just<00:06:39.250> shoved<00:06:39.520> the

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
cordless drill and I just shoved the

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:53.880 
cordless drill and I just shoved the
wires<00:06:39.790> in<00:06:40.000> there

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:53.890 

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:59.170 

quite<00:06:54.890> a<00:06:54.920> bit<00:06:55.160> of<00:06:55.280> power<00:06:57.580> not<00:06:58.580> quite<00:06:58.880> as<00:06:58.970> much

00:06:59.170 --> 00:06:59.180 
quite a bit of power not quite as much

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.060 
quite a bit of power not quite as much
as<00:06:59.390> the<00:06:59.540> battery<00:06:59.990> but<00:07:00.980> it<00:07:01.190> works<00:07:01.400> fine<00:07:01.700> now<00:07:03.070> the

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.070 
as the battery but it works fine now the

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.490 
as the battery but it works fine now the
reason<00:07:04.400> why<00:07:04.490> I<00:07:04.520> built<00:07:04.880> these<00:07:05.090> wooden<00:07:05.500> box

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:06.500 
reason why I built these wooden box

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.740 
reason why I built these wooden box
panels<00:07:07.040> is<00:07:07.190> because<00:07:07.790> I<00:07:07.820> started<00:07:08.330> running<00:07:08.480> out

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:08.750 
panels is because I started running out

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.850 
panels is because I started running out
of<00:07:08.780> glass<00:07:09.170> and<00:07:09.940> now<00:07:10.940> this<00:07:11.330> only<00:07:11.570> uses<00:07:11.900> half<00:07:12.560> the

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:12.860 
of glass and now this only uses half the

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.620 
of glass and now this only uses half the
amount<00:07:13.010> of<00:07:13.160> glass<00:07:13.540> but<00:07:14.540> I<00:07:14.750> do<00:07:14.810> like<00:07:15.410> the<00:07:15.800> the

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:16.630 
amount of glass but I do like the the

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.080 
amount of glass but I do like the the
the<00:07:17.630> two<00:07:17.900> pieces<00:07:18.740> of<00:07:18.800> glass<00:07:18.950> that<00:07:19.370> are<00:07:19.550> bonded

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.090 
the two pieces of glass that are bonded

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.350 
the two pieces of glass that are bonded
together<00:07:20.920> because<00:07:21.920> I<00:07:22.160> think<00:07:22.340> that<00:07:22.610> will<00:07:23.030> last

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 
together because I think that will last

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.930 
together because I think that will last
a<00:07:23.600> lot<00:07:23.750> longer<00:07:23.810> than<00:07:24.230> these<00:07:24.590> wood<00:07:24.890> panels<00:07:25.760> beak

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:25.940 
a lot longer than these wood panels beak

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.690 
a lot longer than these wood panels beak
and<00:07:26.180> another<00:07:26.510> problem<00:07:26.930> is<00:07:27.050> is<00:07:27.200> the<00:07:27.320> wood<00:07:27.700> will

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:28.700 
and another problem is is the wood will

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.320 
and another problem is is the wood will
expand<00:07:29.450> and<00:07:30.140> contract<00:07:30.880> there's<00:07:31.880> a<00:07:32.000> few

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:32.330 
expand and contract there's a few

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.470 
expand and contract there's a few
percent<00:07:32.840> so<00:07:33.669> it's<00:07:34.669> probably<00:07:35.150> a<00:07:35.180> lot<00:07:35.419> better

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:35.480 
percent so it's probably a lot better

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.470 
percent so it's probably a lot better
just<00:07:35.990> to<00:07:36.140> use<00:07:36.350> the<00:07:36.620> two<00:07:36.770> pieces<00:07:37.010> of<00:07:37.190> glass<00:07:37.480> but

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:38.480 
just to use the two pieces of glass but

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.570 
just to use the two pieces of glass but
I'm<00:07:38.720> trying<00:07:39.110> out<00:07:39.290> this<00:07:39.590> panel<00:07:39.890> here<00:07:40.310> I'm<00:07:40.460> gonna

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:40.580 
I'm trying out this panel here I'm gonna

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.840 
I'm trying out this panel here I'm gonna
try<00:07:40.820> out<00:07:41.000> see<00:07:41.240> how<00:07:41.419> it<00:07:41.450> works<00:07:41.810> and<00:07:42.020> I<00:07:42.770> may<00:07:43.250> even

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:43.850 
try out see how it works and I may even

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.110 
try out see how it works and I may even
put<00:07:44.120> some<00:07:44.690> sort<00:07:45.020> of<00:07:45.080> tin<00:07:45.440> around<00:07:46.340> the<00:07:46.910> wood

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 
put some sort of tin around the wood

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.380 
put some sort of tin around the wood
area<00:07:47.600> to<00:07:47.990> keep<00:07:48.140> any<00:07:48.380> water<00:07:48.740> off<00:07:49.130> of<00:07:49.160> the<00:07:49.460> panel

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:50.390 
area to keep any water off of the panel

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.960 
area to keep any water off of the panel
or<00:07:51.230> off<00:07:51.440> of<00:07:51.470> the<00:07:51.800> frame<00:07:52.070> and<00:07:52.610> I'm<00:07:52.880> gonna

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:52.970 
or off of the frame and I'm gonna

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.240 
or off of the frame and I'm gonna
continue<00:07:53.300> building<00:07:53.870> different<00:07:54.740> types<00:07:55.010> of

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:55.250 
continue building different types of

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.969 
continue building different types of
panels<00:07:55.750> designs<00:07:56.750> anyway<00:07:57.229> using<00:07:57.680> different

00:07:57.969 --> 00:07:57.979 
panels designs anyway using different

00:07:57.979 --> 00:08:00.969 
panels designs anyway using different
materials<00:07:58.550> to<00:07:58.970> see<00:07:59.180> which<00:07:59.390> one<00:07:59.770> works<00:08:00.770> the

00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:00.979 
materials to see which one works the

00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:04.750 
materials to see which one works the
best<00:08:01.100> and<00:08:01.550> lasts<00:08:02.000> the<00:08:02.090> longest<00:08:03.490> well<00:08:04.490> that<00:08:04.610> was

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:04.760 
best and lasts the longest well that was

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.469 
best and lasts the longest well that was
just<00:08:04.790> a<00:08:05.060> look<00:08:05.300> at<00:08:05.540> the<00:08:06.430> homemade<00:08:07.430> wood<00:08:07.820> framed

00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 
just a look at the homemade wood framed

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:13.570 
just a look at the homemade wood framed
solar<00:08:09.169> panel<00:08:09.940> thank<00:08:10.940> you<00:08:11.060> for<00:08:11.210> watching
