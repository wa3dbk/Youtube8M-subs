something or just whatever else

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.910 
something or just whatever else
another<00:04:35.450> one<00:04:35.690> is<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.920> ats-v<00:04:37.130> and<00:04:38.470> this<00:04:39.470> one<00:04:39.710> is

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
another one is the ats-v and this one is

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.600 
another one is the ats-v and this one is
just<00:04:39.950> it's<00:04:40.550> like<00:04:40.730> port<00:04:41.390> of<00:04:41.570> Yahtzee<00:04:42.080> on<00:04:42.290> Chloe

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
just it's like port of Yahtzee on Chloe

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.830 
just it's like port of Yahtzee on Chloe
which<00:04:43.610> is<00:04:43.910> pretty<00:04:44.630> cool<00:04:44.810> actually<00:04:45.050> it's<00:04:46.840> you

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
which is pretty cool actually it's you

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.590 
which is pretty cool actually it's you
can<00:04:47.990> basically<00:04:48.490> play<00:04:49.490> Yahtzee<00:04:49.910> with<00:04:50.180> more

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
can basically play Yahtzee with more

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.840 
can basically play Yahtzee with more
than<00:04:50.690> one<00:04:50.840> player<00:04:51.110> if<00:04:51.260> you<00:04:51.380> want<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:51.890> throw

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
than one player if you want and throw

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.610 
than one player if you want and throw
the<00:04:53.090> dice<00:04:53.270> so<00:04:53.540> you<00:04:53.720> basically<00:04:53.900> just<00:04:54.290> like

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
the dice so you basically just like

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.130 
the dice so you basically just like
shake<00:04:54.950> it<00:04:55.130> and<00:04:55.340> like<00:04:55.610> throw<00:04:55.910> it<00:04:55.940> but<00:04:56.780> it's<00:04:56.930> kind

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
shake it and like throw it but it's kind

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
shake it and like throw it but it's kind
of<00:04:57.170> funny<00:04:57.350> we<00:04:57.530> could<00:04:57.710> just<00:04:57.860> kind<00:04:58.070> of<00:04:58.100> like

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
of funny we could just kind of like

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.090 
of funny we could just kind of like
vibrate<00:04:58.760> so<00:04:59.060> you<00:04:59.120> can<00:04:59.480> probably<00:04:59.660> hear<00:04:59.870> that

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
vibrate so you can probably hear that

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.230 
vibrate so you can probably hear that
but<00:05:01.100> touch<00:05:01.250> my<00:05:01.400> camera<00:05:01.700> can<00:05:01.820> probably<00:05:02.030> hear

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
but touch my camera can probably hear

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.960 
but touch my camera can probably hear
maybe<00:05:03.170> not<00:05:03.440> but<00:05:03.890> then<00:05:04.040> you<00:05:04.250> throw<00:05:04.550> it<00:05:04.730> and

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
maybe not but then you throw it and

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.330 
maybe not but then you throw it and
it'll<00:05:05.270> you<00:05:06.170> can<00:05:06.320> keep<00:05:06.530> certain<00:05:06.740> dice<00:05:06.980> and<00:05:07.250> roll

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
it'll you can keep certain dice and roll

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.100 
it'll you can keep certain dice and roll
again<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:07.700> and<00:05:09.220> yeah<00:05:10.220> and<00:05:10.750> darn<00:05:11.750> it<00:05:11.870> on<00:05:11.990> it

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
again and and yeah and darn it on it

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.690 
again and and yeah and darn it on it
almost<00:05:12.590> I<00:05:12.680> didn't<00:05:12.950> get<00:05:13.070> a<00:05:13.100> whole<00:05:13.280> house<00:05:13.460> there

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
almost I didn't get a whole house there

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.610 
almost I didn't get a whole house there
no<00:05:13.880> ah<00:05:14.050> but<00:05:15.610> yeah<00:05:16.610> that's<00:05:17.170> those<00:05:18.170> are<00:05:18.320> some<00:05:18.560> of

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
no ah but yeah that's those are some of

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.100 
no ah but yeah that's those are some of
the<00:05:18.710> few<00:05:19.340> cool<00:05:19.640> apps<00:05:19.880> that<00:05:20.330> you<00:05:20.510> can<00:05:20.660> do<00:05:20.810> and

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
the few cool apps that you can do and

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.200 
the few cool apps that you can do and
there's<00:05:22.010> one<00:05:22.250> more<00:05:22.490> that<00:05:22.730> I<00:05:22.790> haven't<00:05:23.090> quite

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
there's one more that I haven't quite

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.100 
there's one more that I haven't quite
figured<00:05:23.420> out<00:05:23.630> yet<00:05:23.830> that<00:05:24.830> I<00:05:25.750> need<00:05:26.750> to<00:05:26.870> figure

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
figured out yet that I need to figure

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.780 
figured out yet that I need to figure
out<00:05:27.260> but<00:05:27.590> every<00:05:27.890> time<00:05:28.010> I<00:05:28.070> try<00:05:28.280> and<00:05:28.310> use<00:05:28.550> it<00:05:28.670> it

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
out but every time I try and use it it

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.670 
out but every time I try and use it it
freezes<00:05:29.150> my<00:05:29.330> game<00:05:29.570> because<00:05:29.990> I<00:05:30.110> probably<00:05:30.350> don't

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
freezes my game because I probably don't

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.450 
freezes my game because I probably don't
have<00:05:30.770> the<00:05:30.890> right<00:05:31.010> codes

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
have the right codes

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.870 
have the right codes
it's<00:05:32.030> a<00:05:32.300> gecko<00:05:32.750> os<00:05:33.260> and<00:05:33.560> basically<00:05:34.460> what<00:05:34.670> it<00:05:34.790> is

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
it's a gecko os and basically what it is

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.350 
it's a gecko os and basically what it is
is<00:05:35.120> basically<00:05:35.390> like<00:05:35.570> a<00:05:35.750> cheat<00:05:36.380> code<00:05:37.360> loader

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
is basically like a cheat code loader

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.210 
is basically like a cheat code loader
thing<00:05:38.690> and<00:05:38.930> probably<00:05:39.590> the<00:05:39.680> recent<00:05:40.070> mine

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
thing and probably the recent mine

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.470 
thing and probably the recent mine
doesn't<00:05:40.430> work<00:05:40.670> as<00:05:40.850> because<00:05:41.090> I<00:05:41.150> don't<00:05:41.300> how<00:05:41.420> we

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
doesn't work as because I don't how we

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.860 
doesn't work as because I don't how we
are<00:05:41.960> D<00:05:42.200> but<00:05:42.530> that<00:05:42.860> might<00:05:43.070> be<00:05:43.100> my<00:05:43.400> issue<00:05:43.550> and<00:05:43.970> so

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
are D but that might be my issue and so

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.390 
are D but that might be my issue and so
you<00:05:44.960> can<00:05:45.170> like<00:05:45.350> load<00:05:45.620> cheats<00:05:45.920> but<00:05:46.100> every<00:05:46.280> time

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
you can like load cheats but every time

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.420 
you can like load cheats but every time
I<00:05:46.490> load<00:05:46.760> mine<00:05:47.000> it's<00:05:47.240> just<00:05:47.450> not<00:05:47.630> freezes<00:05:48.080> but

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
I load mine it's just not freezes but

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.010 
I load mine it's just not freezes but
that<00:05:49.430> kind<00:05:49.640> of<00:05:49.670> happens<00:05:50.030> sometimes<00:05:50.420> probably

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
that kind of happens sometimes probably

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.200 
that kind of happens sometimes probably
because<00:05:51.290> I<00:05:51.500> don't<00:05:51.890> have<00:05:52.220> the<00:05:52.640> correct<00:05:52.850> codes

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
because I don't have the correct codes

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.100 
because I don't have the correct codes
but<00:05:53.810> anyways<00:05:54.230> so<00:05:55.150> that's<00:05:56.150> about<00:05:56.300> it<00:05:56.450> so

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
but anyways so that's about it so

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.210 
but anyways so that's about it so
