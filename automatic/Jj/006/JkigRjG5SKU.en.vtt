00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 press of all dear friends here to me 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.270
 Two parcels arrived I already had them both 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.400
 unpacked because I didn't know what was there 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.639
 have on aliexpress gave again fake 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.320
 track number in general, then I no longer 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.120
 I am surprised almost every time 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.880
 cheating well yes god with him the main thing is that 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.769
 the item came I thought that there was nokia 3310 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.480
 in fact almost a g-shock watch 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:27.119
 ga-100 in my model called that 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.429
 have boxes ordered first 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.929
 I unpacked I think that clock would not have noticed 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.750
 what they stood up to me like that now 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.910
 I, in general, did not see getting nothing 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.210
 and he just rushes to her move 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.020
 will prove well packed and protect these 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.500
 watch 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.190
 as you see in general, then with the original 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.309
 tacos 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.840
 instructions and all the rest here they are in 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.390
 principle done I will tell you quite well then 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.140
 There is quite a normal quality 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.940
 Now the fund to make things work 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.500
 configure and everything is in principle norms let's 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.260
 look sit on my hand as if 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.830
 there is an original one cassio watch but not 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.930
 g-shock 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.659
 the model is not so cool I decided 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.610
 try the same shock if not 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.920
 original 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:19.619
 after all the original is pretty expensive 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:27.390
 and save money so sometimes to wear 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:30.360
 quite well but not bad quite necessary very 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.700
 a lot of fit that is set up under 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.200
 itself and in principle can be worn in so 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.280
 the second package was such 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.939
 Fifth iPhone Case with Homer 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.340
 simpson 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.259
 who supposedly bites the apple now I'm 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.860
 we leave year so taking off on iphone and 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:50.430
 in general, I have a good quality wave 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.560
 for one and a half dollars it means that the clock cost 12 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.689
 bucks but also phthisis grin and a half bucks 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.310
