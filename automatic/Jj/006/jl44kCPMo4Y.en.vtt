 I came here to take branches from the coba 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.179

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.839
 metin is after an hour that the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.250
 they would have put it on the 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.380
 10 have put at 11 the balls of 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.189
 football the one that put the world 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.699
 then look and I already get some 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.369
 few and good let's open them what 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.040
 first because we ran out of place 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.290
 good to see so you can see info look 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.120
 parchment blessing the first for this 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.930
 so lucky because it does not throw nearly 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:47.430
 nothing now you will see 55 is that the strip of 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.530
 55 good also good 50 here 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.440
 I wanted to apologize for the video that 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.820
 you've seen before, it's good for the east 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.480
 the payment that I have been robbed to dry 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.280
 good that scratches me a lot good I did not scratch 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.800
 because it's that people like that are my turn 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.600
 a lot of the balls, so to speak 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.270
 some way and I have thrown a beans 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.430
 in and good they have thrown us nothing more already 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.780
 see I'm going to throw the branches of the elbow 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.960
 because as you know if you have a to 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.090
 inventory you can not catch more and now 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.440
 I say it but I also knew it 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.930

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.290

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.909
 I came here and I had about 9 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.030
 over there because I'm doing the 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.390
 vision and status hitting like 20 minutes 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.490
 those who took me 15 balls look at another 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.200
 ball the drop is quite high and 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.200
 considering that I'm going with a glove 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.979
 does not mean host another ball this 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.190
 It has not happened before, you do not think it is 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.190
 A) Yes 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.990
 When I'm recording, it's the same as 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.920
 by the stone that christer of the biologist to 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.750
 see what throws anything 50 that there may be 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.600
 these advances and they go hp I do not think but 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.979
 good is the daddy to the floor to see that 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.280
 I was going to say I was telling you 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.280
 every good everything but besides the coba 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.250
 that way I have there and now we're going to 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.220

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.830

 good 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.980
 to see I have to take this does not qualify me 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.190
 the shaman is helpless I have to 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.920
 catch this it worth the shot 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.780
 what I told you about the dragon stone of 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.310
 these that is called delivering 10 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.650
 series the mission had to give 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.510
 quimistÃ¡n the one that you give the fragments and 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.670
 nothing more and when they give you one more than 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.540
 is 10 here I am going to have 10 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.730
 look 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.640
 what they have given me have changed me all 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.260
 the ten for a raw draconis rope 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.629
 and then these are the ones that are leaving 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.420
 improving and all that ruben I'm hitting 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:10.090
 in automatic paste gatera so that no 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.489

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.140
 they can go asking you give the space 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.230
 and change the screen giving the space 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.459
 then the sticking is already there 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.069

 open it I'm here in the store 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:28.540
 general because we're going to throw more 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.800
 10k bars of those than 50 goats 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.890

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.440
 all cheek to pass 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.670

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.410
 I do not know I 'm not reading what is 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.730
 pulling this had the 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.510
 populations after they open all 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.430
 because it does not pull at anything 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.470
 to see are all the skills are missing 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:03.360

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:13.330
 this is sold and some yang is made 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.940
