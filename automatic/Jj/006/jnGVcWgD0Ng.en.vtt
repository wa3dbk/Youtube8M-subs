 Hello, this is Haha Kizu Toy. 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.120
 Today's Masked Rider Wizard Final Form Infinity Only Weapon 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.840
 I'm going to look at Excalibur toys. 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.920
 If you scan an infinite ring contained in the component 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.580
 You can change from caliber mode to X mode 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.520
 There are four LED gimmicks that shine 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.160
 Touch the shape of your hand to activate the melee. 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.900
 Known as Hidden Gimmick 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.340
 Plasma Shining Strike can also be reproduced. 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.420
 This manual is described in detail 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.200
 This information was given to you before your review. 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.820
 I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to you. 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.200
 I've been reviewing several toys for the Kamen Rider Wizard 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.500
 Excalibur is out of order, too late to review. 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:54.370
 If you watch it fun, you will almost finish the Rider Wizard 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.550
 The special side where Kaimu precedes appears on April 28 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.570
 I'm going to air at AnnieBox at 6PM. 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.980
 So let's open it up and take a look. 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.140
 Be careful when using a knife. 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.740
