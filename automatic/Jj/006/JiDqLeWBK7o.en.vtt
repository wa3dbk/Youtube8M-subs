instant emitter the original is much
much<00:00:45.780> heavier<00:00:45.989> than<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.469> clinical<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.309> feels

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
much heavier than the clinical and feels

all looks like there's nothing there but

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.240 
all looks like there's nothing there but
I<00:03:35.390> just<00:03:35.630> turn<00:03:35.870> it<00:03:35.990> over<00:03:36.080> to<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.410> side<00:03:36.590> here<00:03:36.620> yes

I just turn it over to the side here yes
you've<00:03:37.550> got<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.820> couple<00:03:38.000> of<00:03:38.470> switches<00:03:39.470> in<00:03:39.830> there

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
you've got a couple of switches in there

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.670 
you've got a couple of switches in there
so<00:03:40.460> this<00:03:41.300> first<00:03:41.780> one<00:03:41.960> here<00:03:42.230> has<00:03:42.320> got<00:03:42.380> two

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680

so this first one here has got two
settings<00:03:42.950> and<00:03:43.460> then<00:03:44.150> all<00:03:44.270> exactly<00:03:44.990> what<00:03:45.140> they

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
settings and then all exactly what they

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.020 
settings and then all exactly what they
do<00:03:45.380> is<00:03:45.740> they<00:03:45.830> can't<00:03:46.040> get<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.250> console<00:03:46.700> to<00:03:46.850> work

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
do is they can't get the console to work

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.720 
do is they can't get the console to work
and<00:03:47.300> the<00:03:48.260> second<00:03:48.710> switch<00:03:48.920> here<00:03:49.220> if<00:03:49.430> you<00:03:49.550> can

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
and the second switch here if you can

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.180 
and the second switch here if you can
see<00:03:49.970> that<00:03:50.180> it's<00:03:51.050> actually<00:03:51.170> got<00:03:51.560> I<00:03:51.770> think<00:03:51.980> it's

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
see that it's actually got I think it's

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.710 
see that it's actually got I think it's
four<00:03:52.640> settings<00:03:54.700> you<00:03:55.700> can<00:03:55.850> adjust<00:03:55.910> there<00:03:56.510> I

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
four settings you can adjust there I

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.120 
four settings you can adjust there I
think<00:03:57.080> only<00:03:57.230> three<00:03:57.470> of<00:03:57.680> them<00:03:57.830> are<00:03:57.980> maybe

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
think only three of them are maybe

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.440 
think only three of them are maybe
actually<00:03:59.060> hooked<00:03:59.300> up<00:03:59.510> to<00:04:00.100> and<00:04:01.450> Penny's

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
actually hooked up to and Penny's

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.200 
actually hooked up to and Penny's
underneath<00:04:03.170> be<00:04:03.650> fair<00:04:04.040> you<00:04:04.370> basically<00:04:04.910> got<00:04:05.090> you

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
underneath be fair you basically got you

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.750 
underneath be fair you basically got you
two<00:04:05.420> switches<00:04:05.810> in<00:04:06.080> there<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.640> what<00:04:07.640> I'm

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
two switches in there and what I'm

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.920 
two switches in there and what I'm
guessing<00:04:08.000> is<00:04:08.330> one<00:04:09.020> is<00:04:09.170> for<00:04:09.460> 50<00:04:10.460> 60<00:04:10.640> Hertz<00:04:11.120> and

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
guessing is one is for 50 60 Hertz and

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.570 
guessing is one is for 50 60 Hertz and
the<00:04:12.110> other<00:04:12.290> one<00:04:12.530> is<00:04:12.770> a<00:04:14.650> Japanese<00:04:15.650> English

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
the other one is a Japanese English

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.320 
the other one is a Japanese English
language<00:04:17.480> and<00:04:18.160> possibly<00:04:19.160> something<00:04:20.060> to<00:04:20.180> do

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
language and possibly something to do

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.360 
language and possibly something to do
with<00:04:20.479> the<00:04:21.049> built-in<00:04:21.440> games<00:04:21.739> because<00:04:22.160> the

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
with the built-in games because the

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.050 
with the built-in games because the
Sailor<00:04:22.610> did<00:04:23.030> say<00:04:23.300> that<00:04:23.540> this<00:04:23.840> is

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
Sailor did say that this is

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.760 
Sailor did say that this is
meant<00:04:24.240> that<00:04:24.389> have<00:04:24.540> something<00:04:24.870> like<00:04:25.020> 300<00:04:25.620> odds

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
meant that have something like 300 odds

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.270 
meant that have something like 300 odds
both<00:04:26.700> in<00:04:27.000> games<00:04:27.240> on<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:28.169> console<00:04:28.620> so<00:04:28.889> that

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
both in games on the console so that

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.950 
both in games on the console so that
might<00:04:29.520> be<00:04:29.550> something<00:04:30.000> to<00:04:30.030> do<00:04:30.210> with<00:04:30.330> switching

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
might be something to do with switching

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.379 
might be something to do with switching
the<00:04:31.050> games<00:04:31.290> and<00:04:32.220> he<00:04:32.520> also<00:04:32.669> said<00:04:33.000> that<00:04:33.150> there's

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
the games and he also said that there's

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.750 
the games and he also said that there's
actually<00:04:33.810> only<00:04:34.320> about<00:04:34.650> five<00:04:34.980> games<00:04:35.430> on<00:04:35.639> it

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
actually only about five games on it

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.360 
actually only about five games on it
really<00:04:36.030> there's<00:04:36.750> like<00:04:37.020> one<00:04:37.530> of<00:04:37.620> these<00:04:37.710> clone

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
really there's like one of these clone

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.920 
really there's like one of these clone
systems<00:04:38.880> where<00:04:39.030> it<00:04:39.120> just<00:04:39.240> repeats<00:04:39.419> the<00:04:39.720> same

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
systems where it just repeats the same

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.629 
systems where it just repeats the same
game<00:04:40.139> over<00:04:40.169> and<00:04:40.470> over<00:04:40.710> I<00:04:40.770> can<00:04:40.919> event<00:04:41.190> so<00:04:41.400> I

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
game over and over I can event so I

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.780 
game over and over I can event so I
guess<00:04:42.389> and<00:04:42.570> that's<00:04:42.690> what<00:04:42.840> that's<00:04:43.020> all<00:04:43.230> about

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
guess and that's what that's all about

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.520 
guess and that's what that's all about
them<00:04:44.790> but<00:04:45.510> as<00:04:45.600> I<00:04:45.720> say<00:04:45.870> I<00:04:45.900> can't<00:04:46.139> get<00:04:46.260> it<00:04:46.350> to<00:04:46.440> work

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
them but as I say I can't get it to work

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.110 
them but as I say I can't get it to work
so<00:04:46.590> I<00:04:46.740> can't<00:04:46.919> really<00:04:47.070> test<00:04:47.250> though<00:04:47.460> so<00:04:47.940> there's

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
so I can't really test though so there's

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.760 
so I can't really test though so there's
only<00:04:48.240> four<00:04:48.510> screws<00:04:48.810> holding<00:04:48.840> it<00:04:49.260> together<00:04:49.410> and

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
only four screws holding it together and

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.200 
only four screws holding it together and
if<00:04:49.919> I<00:04:49.980> just<00:04:50.130> pop<00:04:50.310> the<00:04:50.400> top<00:04:50.610> off<00:04:50.790> figured<00:04:51.090> you'll

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
if I just pop the top off figured you'll

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.670 
if I just pop the top off figured you'll
be<00:04:51.240> able<00:04:51.330> to<00:04:51.510> see<00:04:51.720> how<00:04:52.080> little<00:04:52.290> is<00:04:52.530> actually

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
be able to see how little is actually

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.090 
be able to see how little is actually
inside<00:04:53.250> one<00:04:53.460> of<00:04:53.490> these<00:04:53.639> coolant<00:04:54.060> systems<00:04:54.450> and

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
inside one of these coolant systems and

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.340 
inside one of these coolant systems and
there<00:04:56.100> you<00:04:56.220> have<00:04:56.280> it<00:04:56.510> it's<00:04:57.510> basically<00:04:57.780> made<00:04:58.169> up

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
there you have it it's basically made up

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.100 
there you have it it's basically made up
of<00:04:58.500> three<00:04:58.850> boards<00:04:59.850> here<00:05:00.060> connected<00:05:00.600> by<00:05:00.750> these

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
of three boards here connected by these

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.800 
of three boards here connected by these
cheap<00:05:01.560> ribbon<00:05:01.979> cables<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:03.419> first<00:05:03.630> one

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
cheap ribbon cables and the first one

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.950 
cheap ribbon cables and the first one
here<00:05:04.020> is<00:05:04.050> your<00:05:04.410> power<00:05:04.560> connector<00:05:05.100> in<00:05:05.190> your<00:05:05.340> AV

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
here is your power connector in your AV

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.930 
here is your power connector in your AV
port<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:07.860> that's<00:05:08.040> connected<00:05:08.280> up<00:05:08.550> to<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:08.790> main

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
port and that's connected up to the main

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.870 
port and that's connected up to the main
board<00:05:09.180> here<00:05:09.540> with<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:09.979> cartridge<00:05:10.979> slot<00:05:11.190> and

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
board here with the cartridge slot and

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.480 
board here with the cartridge slot and
then<00:05:12.030> that's<00:05:12.510> those<00:05:12.810> a<00:05:13.220> switches<00:05:14.220> I<00:05:14.250> showed

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
then that's those a switches I showed

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.730 
then that's those a switches I showed
you<00:05:14.669> my<00:05:14.760> net<00:05:14.910> go<00:05:15.030> Stephanie<00:05:15.450> at<00:05:15.600> the<00:05:15.780> expansion

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
you my net go Stephanie at the expansion

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.650 
you my net go Stephanie at the expansion
port<00:05:17.010> there<00:05:17.190> and<00:05:17.400> then<00:05:17.880> that's<00:05:18.030> connected<00:05:18.510> up

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
port there and then that's connected up

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.440 
port there and then that's connected up
to<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:18.870> controller<00:05:19.830> board<00:05:20.520> then<00:05:20.790> front<00:05:21.210> there

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
to the controller board then front there

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.770 
to the controller board then front there
with<00:05:21.570> the<00:05:21.810> on/off<00:05:22.680> switch<00:05:22.710> and<00:05:23.300> your<00:05:24.300> reset

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
with the on/off switch and your reset

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.830 
with the on/off switch and your reset
button<00:05:24.810> there<00:05:25.610> so<00:05:26.610> as<00:05:27.150> I<00:05:27.300> say<00:05:27.450> this<00:05:27.630> one

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
button there so as I say this one

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.020 
button there so as I say this one
doesn't<00:05:28.410> work<00:05:28.530> I<00:05:28.740> can't<00:05:28.979> seem<00:05:29.550> to<00:05:29.610> get<00:05:29.760> it<00:05:29.880> to

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
doesn't work I can't seem to get it to

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.890 
doesn't work I can't seem to get it to
play<00:05:30.870> any<00:05:31.020> games<00:05:31.350> and<00:05:31.680> it<00:05:31.890> doesn't<00:05:32.720> short<00:05:33.720> with

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
play any games and it doesn't short with

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.630 
play any games and it doesn't short with
anything<00:05:34.260> a<00:05:34.320> menu<00:05:34.560> system<00:05:34.890> when<00:05:35.160> I<00:05:35.220> turn<00:05:35.460> it<00:05:35.490> on

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
anything a menu system when I turn it on

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.990 
anything a menu system when I turn it on
it<00:05:35.880> will<00:05:36.270> show<00:05:36.630> a<00:05:36.660> black<00:05:37.020> screen<00:05:37.610> so<00:05:38.610> as<00:05:38.640> get

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
it will show a black screen so as get

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.650 
it will show a black screen so as get
some<00:05:39.150> power<00:05:39.360> but<00:05:39.780> I<00:05:39.840> just<00:05:40.380> can't<00:05:40.590> go<00:05:40.740> to<00:05:40.800> a<00:05:41.660> show

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
some power but I just can't go to a show

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.870 
some power but I just can't go to a show
anything<00:05:42.960> other<00:05:43.260> than<00:05:43.470> plain<00:05:44.160> black<00:05:44.520> screen

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
anything other than plain black screen

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.610 
anything other than plain black screen
which<00:05:45.330> is<00:05:45.450> kind<00:05:45.630> of<00:05:45.660> disappointing<00:05:46.260> it<00:05:46.350> quite

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
which is kind of disappointing it quite

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.150 
which is kind of disappointing it quite
like<00:05:46.740> to<00:05:46.770> see<00:05:47.100> how<00:05:47.220> it<00:05:47.340> all<00:05:48.380> it<00:05:49.380> functions<00:05:49.979> with

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
like to see how it all it functions with

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.240 
like to see how it all it functions with
real<00:05:50.700> games<00:05:51.000> and<00:05:51.270> whatnot<00:05:51.750> her<00:05:52.169> emulates<00:05:53.010> them

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
real games and whatnot her emulates them

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.490 
real games and whatnot her emulates them
but<00:05:53.479> sadly<00:05:54.479> I<00:05:54.630> can't<00:05:54.870> get<00:05:54.990> it<00:05:55.080> work<00:05:55.229> and<00:05:55.410> I've

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
but sadly I can't get it work and I've

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.420 
but sadly I can't get it work and I've
tried<00:05:55.680> be<00:05:57.200> sold<00:05:58.200> during<00:05:58.289> all<00:05:58.530> the<00:05:58.710> points<00:05:59.310> on

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
tried be sold during all the points on

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.940 
tried be sold during all the points on
the<00:05:59.580> board<00:06:00.479> there<00:06:00.870> and<00:06:00.900> checking<00:06:01.770> all<00:06:01.860> the

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
the board there and checking all the

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.440 
the board there and checking all the
connections<00:06:02.460> but<00:06:02.639> just<00:06:02.910> can't<00:06:03.120> get<00:06:03.270> it<00:06:03.360> to

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
connections but just can't get it to

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.540 
connections but just can't get it to
work<00:06:03.630> so<00:06:03.900> I<00:06:04.110> don't<00:06:04.560> know<00:06:04.680> if<00:06:04.740> anyone<00:06:05.220> has<00:06:05.370> any

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
work so I don't know if anyone has any

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.520 
work so I don't know if anyone has any
ideas<00:06:05.639> about<00:06:06.210> how<00:06:06.389> to<00:06:06.450> get<00:06:07.110> these<00:06:07.229> clone

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
ideas about how to get these clone

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.950 
ideas about how to get these clone
systems<00:06:08.039> running<00:06:08.789> again<00:06:09.090> and<00:06:09.120> it's<00:06:09.479> probably

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
systems running again and it's probably

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.860 
systems running again and it's probably
quite<00:06:10.139> a<00:06:10.229> long<00:06:10.500> shot<00:06:10.800> but<00:06:11.070> yeah<00:06:11.910> just<00:06:12.389> let<00:06:12.810> me

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
quite a long shot but yeah just let me

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.260 
quite a long shot but yeah just let me
know<00:06:12.990> if<00:06:13.229> you<00:06:13.350> have<00:06:13.470> any<00:06:13.680> ideas<00:06:14.100> but<00:06:14.940> yeah<00:06:15.060> yeah

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
just like that quick video on that and

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.400 
just like that quick video on that and
show<00:06:17.039> you<00:06:17.100> the<00:06:17.310> corne<00:06:17.789> system<00:06:18.240> I<00:06:18.419> thought<00:06:19.320> it

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
show you the corne system I thought it

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.810 
show you the corne system I thought it
was<00:06:19.580> pretty<00:06:20.580> interesting<00:06:21.030> and<00:06:22.610> just<00:06:23.610> to

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
was pretty interesting and just to

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.210 
was pretty interesting and just to
compare<00:06:24.389> the<00:06:24.600> two<00:06:24.900> systems<00:06:25.530> side-by-side

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
compare the two systems side-by-side

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.450 
compare the two systems side-by-side
here

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
here

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.960 
here
your<00:06:28.389> your<00:06:28.690> fake<00:06:29.020> Chinese<00:06:29.800> clone<00:06:30.460> and<00:06:30.759> your

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:30.970 
your your fake Chinese clone and your

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.640 
your your fake Chinese clone and your
original<00:06:31.720> Saiga<00:06:33.479> system<00:06:34.479> yeah<00:06:35.169> the<00:06:35.500> other

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
original Saiga system yeah the other

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.610 
original Saiga system yeah the other
thing<00:06:35.830> as<00:06:35.949> well<00:06:36.069> actually<00:06:36.460> came<00:06:36.669> with<00:06:36.789> her<00:06:36.940> a

thing as well actually came with her a

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.110 
thing as well actually came with her a
knockoff<00:06:38.620> power<00:06:38.919> supply<00:06:39.310> as<00:06:39.490> well<00:06:39.520> you<00:06:39.970> can

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
knockoff power supply as well you can

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.499 
knockoff power supply as well you can
see<00:06:40.300> that<00:06:40.330> it's<00:06:41.289> carefully<00:06:41.740> badly<00:06:42.099> drawn<00:06:42.509> Sega

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:43.509 
see that it's carefully badly drawn Sega

Megadrive on it and but this is the
power<00:06:46.840> supply<00:06:47.080> had<00:06:47.410> been<00:06:47.440> using<00:06:47.710> the<00:06:48.039> poet

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580 
power supply had been using the poet

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.700 
power supply had been using the poet
seems<00:06:48.789> to<00:06:48.940> work<00:06:49.090> okay<00:06:49.479> then<00:06:50.110> I'll<00:06:50.199> see<00:06:50.530> if<00:06:50.620> it
