00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 as I have already mentioned in other 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.580
 videos a street fight can not 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.859
 bring nothing good though I know that 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.510
 many times we can not avoid a fight 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.730
 street, that's why today I'm going 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.769
 to mention what precautions to take before 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.350
 of fighting on the street and how to control 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.570
 fear and mentalize of course without 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.340
 However, remember that the best fight is 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.500
 which is not given first we go with the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.570
 precautions avoid fighting in places 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.849
 lonely or in places you do not know 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.800
 many times those fights can end 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.170
 very bad because there is no one to stop the fight 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.520
 and if it's in an unknown place you do not know 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.160
 if this person you're with 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.290
 fighting can have friends or accomplices 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.420
 in which you could help yourself and good 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.190
 they could hurt you a lot if you know that 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.590
 the fight is not going to be able to avoid you 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.020
 I recommend that you think coldly and 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.510
 you go to a busy place, either by 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.610
 vehicles or by people like that surely 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.890
 someone will intervene before something 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.079
 bad pass avoids fighting with people 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.149
 strangers we never know with whom we 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.010
 we can poke it could be that the opponent 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.410
 will bring a weapon or be a person 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.539
 dangerous so if you're going to fight with 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.290
 a person you do not know is better 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.540
 finish as much 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.460
 possible fast and if you can avoid it by 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.620
 middle of the dialogue then of course 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.360
 avoid it if the person with whom you are going to 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.730
 fighting is accompanied by one or more 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.860
 friends do not trust your word of 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.630
 that he's just going to fight you the most 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.460
 sure is that his friends help him 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.440
 that would recommend you to go to some 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.780
 place equally that I had a lot 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.880
 transit a bus stop is a 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.460
 shopping center or a place where 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.410
 there are simply many people like that if something 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.750
 it goes wrong someone could call the 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.729
 police or just stop fighting 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.490
 if you see that your opponent can no longer 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.500
 defend yourself do not keep attacking what if you leave 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.840
 to hit it in time you can avoid yourself in 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.759
 many problems with the police and with 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.890
 your relatives or with neighbors that you 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.110
 they can be seeing like this you will notice 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.810
 that you are a serious person and that you have 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.090
 self-control if you're fighting one against 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.770
 Do not let yourself be carried away by courage if 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.410
 You are losing if you have given a good 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.350
 hit and do not use any weapon either 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.420
 stones bottles sticks etc avoid 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.520
 use all this so you will also avoid 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.240
 many problems with justice if the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.340
 fight is going to hit some gang member 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.590
 who come together as a group I would recommend you 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.510
 better run and look for a patrol then 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.700
 these people are so cowardly that they do not 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.830
 can fight one alone to forces have 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.930
 that fight all together and could 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.090
 do you a lot of damage now yes we go with what 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.220
 who are waiting for how to avoid fear 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.230
 to fight or how to control it rather 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.660
 many times the fear that we can have 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.150
 before a fight can be provoked 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.730
 because of the fear we have of pain 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.770
 be afraid of losing a fight to some 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.690
 injury or even if our opponent wants 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.420
 revenge after we go with the first 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.240
 point a fight is not painful then 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.340
 while we are fighting the pain 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.840
 you're inhibited by some chemicals that 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.210
 run in our body as per 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.040
 example the adrenaline which helps us 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.440
 to perform better in many 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.210
 physical activities pain only 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.670
 We will feel it when we are hit by 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.010
 example the nose the eyes the genitals 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.230
 or very sensitive points because our 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.290
 body is warning us that we can 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.510
 suffer serious damage and good that is better 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.880
 put beautiful save but most 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.760
 the blows in a fight are aimed at 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.310
 cheeks 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.599
 to the stomach to the arms to the hands with 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.129
 the people we are with 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.349
 fighting many times they do not know 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.420
 absolutely nothing about how to fight and 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.340
 just throw punches like crazy the 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.400
 fear of losing a fight is something very 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.379
 That's why I'm going to recommend that you 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.269
 forget that part and concentrate on 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.579
 what are you doing if you are going to fight 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.110
 that you focus on fighting only 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.959
 whoever loses or who wins is the least 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.150
 the important thing is that you do not leave injured 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.430
 from that fight the fear of an injury is 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.470
 quite valid but so that it does not hurt 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.659
 it is necessary that we become that we 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.640
 let's make little ball or just that we 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.560
 let's hit as long as 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.690
 answer the blows is going to be very 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.430
 difficult to get you injuries however you 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.650
 I'll give you good advice that 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.209
 know when to give up and forget that 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.400
 foolishness of pride that is not going to 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.200
 lead to nothing good if your opponent is 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.540
 willing to stop fighting not what 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.099
 look for more so leave it likewise if 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.319
 you see that your opponent can no longer fight 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.629
 just leave it that will make you look like a 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.340
 pretty mature person the fear that 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.739
 the person with whom we are fighting 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.989
 want to avenge after is also 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.549
 quite valid however many times 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.199
 after a fight 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.449
 the people we are facing 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.819
 decides to abandon that attitude so 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.620
 unless you already know that you are a 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:28.960
 person who simply is not going to leave 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.879
 and it will cost much more work to go back to 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.190
 provoke you also remember that what 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.940
 important is to get out of the problem in that 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.740
 moment 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.780
 Worry first for the first and 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.129
 then so it can come later 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.680
 remember that street fights 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:43.960
 many times they only end in about 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.419
 how many blows to a purple eye 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.370
 blood in the nose or a little blood 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.530
 on the lips but this is very weird 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.539
 many times they are a few hits and 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.280
 someone gets to intervene if they take the 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:56.289
 precautions that I mentioned to you 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.300
 surely your fighting will not 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:00.789
 they will end up in more than a few 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.860
 blows and good a little bit of courage 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:05.800
 part of the two sides people in a row 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.900
 and others aside remember that you train what 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.599
 I put in the videos and well this 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.310
 obviously it takes you up on other 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:14.379
 people who do not practice arts 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.659
 martial always remember to be 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:18.490
 smart in combat and not leave you 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:19.960
 lead by the emotions that our 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.210
 opponent are bigger 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.130
 or heavier does not mean you know 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.259
 fight or be stronger than us 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.430
 intelligence and knowledge is what 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.710
 that will win you the fight 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.240
 Remember also that if the combat 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.740
 is giving problems or you see that go 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.389
 too dangerous 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.090
 you can use defense techniques 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:39.490
 staff which I have already published in 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.130
 several videos and I will continue publishing more 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.169
 go ahead a few bumps bruises and 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.419
 others will be taken away in a couple of days 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.430
 instead the experience stays for 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.470
 always remember also that the best 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.570
 fight is the one that does not take place if 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.759
 Do you have any doubt or any other fear of 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.349
 part of the ones that I mentioned 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:58.630
 leave it in the comments and gladly 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:00.849
 another video because the fear of fighting is not 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.800
 something that is removed so easy however 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:04.509
 it is something that is easy to control 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.820
 once they take precautions 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:09.220
 necessary and are sure of what you have 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.650
 been doing either exercise of 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.419
 training etcetera and I remind you that 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.580
 if you carry out all the exercises 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.770
 showing videos and practice 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.720
 techniques you're probably going to stay a lot 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.909
 higher than an ordinary person and 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.270
 current if you liked the video give it 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:25.940

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.010

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.080
 subscribed subscribe remember that I have
