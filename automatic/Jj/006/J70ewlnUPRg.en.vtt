00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.880 

hardware<00:00:13.630> on<00:00:13.720> the<00:00:13.810> machine<00:00:14.080> is<00:00:14.290> modeled<00:00:14.650> in

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:14.890 
hardware on the machine is modeled in

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.330 
hardware on the machine is modeled in
full<00:00:15.130> studio<00:00:15.550> so<00:00:16.209> we're<00:00:16.420> able<00:00:16.570> to<00:00:17.130> go<00:00:18.130> through

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
full studio so we're able to go through

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.010 
full studio so we're able to go through
the<00:00:18.460> complete<00:00:19.650> process<00:00:20.650> on<00:00:21.220> the<00:00:21.460> machine<00:00:22.020> also

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.020 
the complete process on the machine also

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.570 
the complete process on the machine also
in<00:00:23.290> the<00:00:23.380> tools<00:00:23.590> video<00:00:23.830> before<00:00:23.980> we<00:00:24.160> take<00:00:24.369> it<00:00:24.490> to

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
in the tools video before we take it to

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.609 
in the tools video before we take it to
the<00:00:24.700> machine<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:26.740> here<00:00:26.980> we<00:00:27.070> have<00:00:28.619> the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
the machine so here we have the

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.740 
the machine so here we have the
hanatronic<00:00:29.980> power<00:00:30.340> machine<00:00:30.700> with<00:00:31.509> the<00:00:31.599> wheel

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
hanatronic power machine with the wheel

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.160 
hanatronic power machine with the wheel
changer<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:34.090> in<00:00:34.329> the<00:00:34.420> machine<00:00:34.690> we<00:00:34.840> have<00:00:34.870> the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
changer and in the machine we have the

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.900 
changer and in the machine we have the
steady<00:00:35.410> rest<00:00:35.680> so<00:00:36.070> I'm<00:00:36.220> going<00:00:36.430> to<00:00:36.460> do<00:00:36.640> is<00:00:36.820> I'm

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
steady rest so I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.630 
steady rest so I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:00:37.000> to<00:00:37.060> bring<00:00:37.210> up<00:00:37.329> the<00:00:37.450> fluting<00:00:38.640> will

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
going to bring up the fluting will

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.700 
going to bring up the fluting will
simulate<00:00:39.940> that<00:00:40.329> really<00:00:40.660> quickly<00:00:40.900> so<00:00:41.560> we<00:00:41.680> can

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
simulate that really quickly so we can

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.830 
simulate that really quickly so we can
see<00:00:42.040> the<00:00:42.460> flute<00:00:44.640> okay<00:00:45.640> and<00:00:46.300> then<00:00:46.480> we'll<00:00:46.629> zoom

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
see the flute okay and then we'll zoom

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.270 
see the flute okay and then we'll zoom
in<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.680> I<00:00:50.769> can<00:00:50.949> show<00:00:51.129> you<00:00:51.190> how<00:00:51.460> that<00:00:51.640> works<00:00:51.879> so

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
in and I can show you how that works so

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.910 
in and I can show you how that works so
basically<00:00:54.929> it'll<00:00:55.929> start<00:00:56.199> to<00:00:56.289> grind<00:00:56.559> you<00:00:56.800> can

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
basically it'll start to grind you can

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.740 
basically it'll start to grind you can
see<00:00:57.039> the<00:00:57.129> wheel<00:00:57.280> moving<00:00:57.789> it's<00:00:58.239> moving<00:00:58.359> up

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
see the wheel moving it's moving up

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.139 
see the wheel moving it's moving up
towards<00:00:59.109> the<00:00:59.230> steady<00:00:59.500> rest<00:00:59.789> you<00:01:00.789> can<00:01:00.940> program

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
towards the steady rest you can program

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.419 
towards the steady rest you can program
the<00:01:01.420> steady<00:01:01.629> rest<00:01:01.809> start<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:02.620> stop<00:01:03.039> wherever

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:03.429 
the steady rest start and stop wherever

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.540 
the steady rest start and stop wherever
you<00:01:03.519> like<00:01:03.730> in<00:01:04.030> this<00:01:04.420> particular<00:01:05.220> case<00:01:06.220> what

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
you like in this particular case what

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.510 
you like in this particular case what
I'm<00:01:06.670> doing<00:01:06.940> is<00:01:07.090> I'm<00:01:07.830> I'm<00:01:08.830> starting<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.370> wheel

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
I'm doing is I'm I'm starting the wheel

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.610 
I'm doing is I'm I'm starting the wheel
ahead<00:01:09.670> if<00:01:09.970> you<00:01:10.060> can<00:01:10.180> see<00:01:10.390> and<00:01:10.690> then<00:01:11.200> as<00:01:11.350> we<00:01:11.500> go

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
ahead if you can see and then as we go

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.200 
ahead if you can see and then as we go
down<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:11.980> flute<00:01:12.220> it's<00:01:12.490> going<00:01:12.640> to<00:01:12.730> pick<00:01:12.910> up<00:01:13.060> the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
down the flute it's going to pick up the

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.569 
down the flute it's going to pick up the
steady<00:01:13.420> rest<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.890> steady<00:01:15.130> rest<00:01:15.250> is<00:01:15.369> going<00:01:15.490> to

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
steady rest the steady rest is going to

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:17.660 
steady rest the steady rest is going to
follow<00:01:15.790> down<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.450> flute<00:01:16.659> giving<00:01:16.960> me<00:01:17.049> maximum

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
follow down the flute giving me maximum

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.740 
follow down the flute giving me maximum
support<00:01:18.670> and<00:01:18.909> then<00:01:19.000> I<00:01:19.030> can<00:01:19.240> stop<00:01:19.450> it<00:01:19.570> wherever

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
support and then I can stop it wherever

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.929 
support and then I can stop it wherever
I<00:01:19.960> want<00:01:20.259> to<00:01:20.350> or<00:01:20.770> when<00:01:21.070> it<00:01:21.159> runs<00:01:21.310> out<00:01:21.490> of<00:01:21.549> stroke

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
I want to or when it runs out of stroke

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:25.340 
I want to or when it runs out of stroke
and<00:01:22.229> finish<00:01:23.229> off<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.530> rest<00:01:23.650> of<00:01:23.860> its<00:01:23.979> all

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
and finish off the rest of its all

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.310 
and finish off the rest of its all
that's<00:01:26.350> pretty<00:01:26.560> much<00:01:26.649> how<00:01:26.829> it<00:01:26.950> works<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:29.200> can

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
that's pretty much how it works you can

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.380 
that's pretty much how it works you can
bring<00:01:29.470> it<00:01:29.590> up<00:01:29.680> for<00:01:29.979> not<00:01:30.549> just<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.850> fluting<00:01:31.240> but

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
bring it up for not just the fluting but

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.260 
bring it up for not just the fluting but
also<00:01:31.540> if<00:01:32.140> we're<00:01:32.320> doing<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.619> heel<00:01:32.860> grind<00:01:33.270> it's

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
also if we're doing the heel grind it's

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.810 
also if we're doing the heel grind it's
the<00:01:34.420> same<00:01:34.680> principle<00:01:35.680> we<00:01:36.310> can<00:01:36.490> bring<00:01:36.670> it<00:01:36.759> up

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
the same principle we can bring it up

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.990 
the same principle we can bring it up
for<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.090> hill<00:01:37.240> growing<00:01:37.509> operation<00:01:38.020> too<00:01:39.000> and

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
for the hill growing operation too and

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.469 
for the hill growing operation too and
if<00:01:40.899> we're<00:01:41.049> doing<00:01:41.430> for<00:01:42.430> grinding<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.820> point

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.670 

facet<00:01:46.479> point<00:01:46.689> we<00:01:46.840> can<00:01:46.990> also<00:01:47.110> bring<00:01:47.409> you<00:01:47.530> into

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
facet point we can also bring you into

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.520 
facet point we can also bring you into
place<00:01:47.890> at<00:01:48.040> the<00:01:48.130> end<00:01:48.340> of<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.579> tool<00:01:48.820> here<00:01:49.090> to

place at the end of the tool here to

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.319 
place at the end of the tool here to
support<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.829> the<00:01:51.670> end<00:01:51.790> of<00:01:51.909> the<00:01:51.969> tour<00:01:52.180> while
