00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:12.019
 With you again you are seeing here. 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.019
 one more beauty I lacked 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.770
 I think it's no surprise to anyone 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.020

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:22.320
 peace things of the epul and what 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.119
 was missing here is imeq and not 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.369
 stop making a boot for 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.390
 you do not 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.390
 so let's go to it 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.559
 staff did not record specifications of 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.090
 speed or anything by itself 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.430
 for you to see a box and then I leave 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.430
 all in the description so let's go 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.390
 here when I zoom kiesle 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.520
 let's move a lower 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.520
 here you will not be able to 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:27.170
 here is usually me coming here to the camera 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:29.810
 of companies there the keyboard and if it even touches 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:41.630
 she was just in time 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:43.610
 of course here in a new loulÃ© goes in there 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.289
 court is too big is too small 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:52.490
 His original janete not know when 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:56.090
 you buy the mec me and you have to 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.729
 buy the other things too but the 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.929
 imeq not it already comes with keyboard and comes 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.929
 also left here on the side 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.970
 his original mouse I had here is 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.420
 similar to the 11 but I will not take the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:18.769
 most of the mice to hit there 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.989
 original mouse this just this little box 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.590
 that 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.590
 Leave it to me here 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.870
 so that was just what I needed right? 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:37.870
 because others already have a mac mini one 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:37.870
 macbook air the ipad and in a little while 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:45.250

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.560
 take the body already mentioned before here 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.160
 when the clip was released in 2006 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.650
 some things in 2005 the first mac I 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.580
 I also bought in could not be 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:13.100
 different from others but firmly 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:17.110
 that she's up there now studying a 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:25.120
 key here there's kind of this chaos here but 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:25.120
 leaves fair when the path of strength 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:34.090

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.090
