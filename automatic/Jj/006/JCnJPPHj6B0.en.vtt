00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:13.209
 protest 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:15.369
 Of course 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.369
 p 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.550

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:31.029
 I would like to talk a little about the beginnings 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.649
 of devida monte glasses until she is known with a character 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.310
 loved 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.440
 ute thurman and then I met another sounded 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.320
 berta thurman how was the process between you robert and now 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.960
 of the result or is a conclusion of this 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.920
 p a 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.860
 they are called fascination with frost 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.110
 with the poles with bonuses 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.810
 different bars of the passes and fiddled with an impasse assumption 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.090
 put as 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.250
 monotonous now has only one face or one single type of colors 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.390
 loses with a lot 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.190
 monsignor depth 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.020
 but at the time that the last session gave I think that if nothing counts 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.400
 What I did was like 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.909
 live it to be able to work in depth that I did not banque 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.570
 among the people, those things that were so different but so similar existed 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:24.590
 exist in a 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.950
 in a single character let's say do not vote out there denied as more 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.820
 a woman 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.000
 + c 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.220
 not like more voluptuous and angry donci 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.380
 freedom was something more the complaining party and gender and more 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.350
 you all childish girl more sales up here than felton arms or who do not 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.170
 it was mentally efe 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.050
 the best thing is that even 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.400
 he tells me several months 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.290
 according to what he wanted to say that he will heal + 2% audience that raped his daughter 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.899
 there was a moment of research put on 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.160
 well the course only of women but they were at the time on untaba 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.010
 the sense of difference because only step by step because they are false 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.989
 cool manu to several festivals 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.410
 from the past it is of step back 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.310
 and I think that has to do with the curiosity to meet you with 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.209
 in people similar to two who do the same thing that you do at least that's 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.299
 the cd place in that I lived it always a thing of much curiosity of need 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:30.239
 exchange information and experiences and expectations with other 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.620
 and I have made the seed of 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.540
 of the desire and he of the feeling that he could make a show 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.760
 as cobeña 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.129
 born 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.780
 at that time without me to palliate a female in rio de janeiro when I saw 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.699
 25 threat but shows alone or two or three and I understood 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.849
 in the body 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.649
 what could I do 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:56.300
 nothing that there was something rational gold from the mines ing 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.900
 we have the same right that they were infected but 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.390
 Who are we? 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.760
 Strength and inner strength 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.650
 with to do it and that in that sense each of your meetings of women to 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.569
 what I went 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.989
 it turned out as his power inspired the iii 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.190
 and the lightly wounded 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.159
 in hong kong the one 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.689
 things like 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:20.949
 but they enrich their trotyl girlfriend 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:25.269
 I think it's up to the same places but that way when there's only 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.819
 girls in a colossus 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.649
 there are some permits and some experts that disarm more quickly 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:37.219
 it's not that the second or third day of strike rates until they are pulling 700 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:38.279
 and eruptive 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:40.919
 d stopped caring yesterday to give 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.179
 it is from the poetic place sensible it 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:48.929
 and I do not doubt that that can be that was the now also in a mixed course more 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:52.879
 Now that we have avoided, we have seen so many houses for families doing such different things 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:57.859
 mafias with marina relegated america and north when we started with that out there 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:03.269
 they had even less spent working on the sea and the tc in shows 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.829
 then we did not have as much reference guillén crow hot that the feeling of 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.279
 release of what was expected of a female passenger on stage was very 

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:16.949
 great in the courses and that the Mixed Kurds also saw but of what 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:17.850
 say that 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.850
 in the fire last summer an accelerated 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:24.399
 of the permission to do what is shantal 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.139
 shell 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.259
 pocketknives the boxes aspect if it can be hahahaha 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:35.770
 and that freedom said it's a show that 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.770
 we are not credit subjects 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.659
 the cities from the need 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:42.309
 of life 

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:45.990
 so the show the first pique to show this 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.610
 also makes from a place of 2009 demands of a father of the 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.430
 motorcycle and should have been demanded 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.379
 write a show to make a show 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:59.460
 will be lost to very different things to be my dad and for many 

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:01.460
 weeks that he spends up 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.710
 and what a min that thinks he did things almost without speaking this agents almost 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:08.220
 as 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.409
 against 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.229
 of the word in the theater 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.400
 And then when 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.220
 min I put my hand a couple of classes with my dad to write 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:20.009
 stories I wanted to do with something else 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:23.949
 I asked for actually count percent the adam and eva statement about the 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.949
 dramaturgy and about writing this 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.289
 intimately linked with the clan and with how it is understood what the mission of 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.030
 a little 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.430
 that idea of ​​what 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.389
 have passed a 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.509
 you can not control and even if you pass police bonus or say yes 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:40.800
 lópez educate that you can not train work 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.060
 that it can be percent to train the things that cost you the most 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.680
 polystyrene talgo some things but they say what they have to do with 2 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.220
 very intimately and with poland houda what had to do with this work and still 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.460
 the dramaturgy was not previous that that is what my dad does not support for example 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.039
 for you to lose again 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:02.719
 but that's the way some people dare 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:07.080
 of course my old trusts the grammar waist elaborated with one of the 

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:07.919
 sides 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:09.889
 my son is interested in the works that are 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.189
 a work beyond a bet they put was 

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:14.580
 I had no idea 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.729
 of history if I knew had as clearly some things from which 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:23.490
 I wanted to talk and with the ones I wanted to get into but the story would be sent to 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.939
 from the improvisations I knew I wanted it to have a lot to do with the 

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:30.159
 public woman was almost 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:32.150
 everything to do with the public 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.230
 and that had to do with this sentence are cinema 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.780
 nothing of what the affected read on the one hand because while I was sleeping in it 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.389
 thinking about my dad 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:44.780
 and he was thinking about my dad's mom 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.780
 that was the engine of this show 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:51.430
 just because it was a Canaanite mine is made of earth 

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:54.569
 nobody came 

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:55.860
 I had intellectuality 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.430
 when speaking the necessary to live in life but to throw was like in the 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.539
 pears with ground apples 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:05.449
 I wanted to go back a little to that 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:07.249
 in the show 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:07.439
 i
