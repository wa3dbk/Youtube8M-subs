down when you turn it over you'll see
that<00:02:34.060> there's<00:02:34.209> going<00:02:34.269> to<00:02:34.390> be<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.569> little<00:02:34.870> bit<00:02:34.959> of

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
that there's going to be a little bit of

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.309 
that there's going to be a little bit of
a<00:02:35.140> gap<00:02:35.459> left<00:02:36.459> I<00:02:36.790> haven't<00:02:37.209> gone<00:02:37.360> I<00:02:37.660> sorry<00:02:38.290> I

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
a gap left I haven't gone I sorry I

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.420 
a gap left I haven't gone I sorry I
haven't<00:02:38.470> leave<00:02:38.650> this<00:02:38.769> stick<00:02:38.980> goes<00:02:39.130> to<00:02:39.310> the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.650 
hallway and I'll show you in a minute
the<00:02:41.830> reasoning<00:02:42.519> behind<00:02:42.610> that<00:02:42.910> so<00:02:43.209> pressing<00:02:43.450> it

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
the reasoning behind that so pressing it

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.160 
the reasoning behind that so pressing it
down<00:02:43.690> making<00:02:44.170> sure<00:02:44.290> it's<00:02:44.470> nice<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:45.030> stuck<00:02:46.170> and

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
down making sure it's nice and stuck and

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.130 
down making sure it's nice and stuck and
you<00:02:48.099> finger<00:02:48.340> go<00:02:49.269> ahead<00:02:49.510> do<00:02:49.629> the<00:02:49.690> same<00:02:49.930> thing

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
you finger go ahead do the same thing

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.440 
you finger go ahead do the same thing
with<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.349> other<00:02:50.440> side

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
with the other side

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.479 
with the other side
putting<00:02:52.450> glue<00:02:52.599> on<00:02:52.660> top<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:57.099> at<00:02:57.220> this<00:02:57.310> point

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
putting glue on top and at this point

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.210 
putting glue on top and at this point
we're<00:02:57.700> also<00:02:57.880> going<00:02:58.239> to<00:02:58.360> do<00:02:58.630> glue<00:02:59.530> around<00:02:59.799> the

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
we're also going to do glue around the

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.370 
we're also going to do glue around the
top<00:03:00.459> part<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:02.410> our<00:03:02.590> little<00:03:02.890> bump<00:03:03.099> here<00:03:04.380> around

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
top part of our little bump here around

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.920 
top part of our little bump here around
the<00:03:05.530> sides<00:03:08.730> very<00:03:09.730> quickly<00:03:10.060> with<00:03:10.329> my<00:03:10.480> next<00:03:10.780> one

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
the sides very quickly with my next one

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.839 
the sides very quickly with my next one
and<00:03:11.799> we're<00:03:11.890> going<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.040> press<00:03:12.280> that<00:03:12.489> down

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.520 

because<00:03:15.849> I'm<00:03:16.180> using<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.599> same<00:03:16.780> color<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:17.230> don't

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
because I'm using the same color I don't

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.470 
because I'm using the same color I don't
need<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.769> be<00:03:17.890> particularly<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.819> meet<00:03:19.120> with<00:03:19.269> it

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
need to be particularly to meet with it

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.390 
need to be particularly to meet with it
but<00:03:20.019> obviously<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:20.709> do<00:03:20.829> want<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.040> make<00:03:21.160> sure

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
but obviously you do want to make sure

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.150 
but obviously you do want to make sure

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
it's as neat as possible first thing it

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.460 
it's as neat as possible first thing it
down<00:03:24.280> give<00:03:24.489> it<00:03:24.579> a<00:03:24.639> nice<00:03:24.790> little<00:03:25.440> nice<00:03:26.440> little

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
down give it a nice little nice little

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.550 
down give it a nice little nice little
pad<00:03:26.799> to<00:03:26.920> make<00:03:26.950> sure<00:03:27.220> everything's<00:03:27.609> on<00:03:27.790> there

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
pad to make sure everything's on there

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.640 
pad to make sure everything's on there
and<00:03:29.560> there<00:03:29.980> were<00:03:30.069> you<00:03:30.100> know<00:03:31.380> some<00:03:32.380> of<00:03:32.470> you

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
and there were you know some of you

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.080 
and there were you know some of you
might<00:03:32.980> notice<00:03:33.310> that<00:03:33.459> when<00:03:33.609> you<00:03:33.700> use<00:03:33.819> a<00:03:33.850> hot

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
might notice that when you use a hot

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.490 
might notice that when you use a hot
glue<00:03:34.299> gun<00:03:34.329> it's<00:03:34.660> going<00:03:34.870> to<00:03:34.989> discolor<00:03:35.350> your

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
glue gun it's going to discolor your

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.559 
glue gun it's going to discolor your
paper<00:03:35.980> that's<00:03:36.639> just<00:03:36.819> because<00:03:37.090> it's<00:03:37.269> hot<00:03:37.420> but

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
paper that's just because it's hot but

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.870 
paper that's just because it's hot but
when<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:37.840> cools<00:03:38.049> down<00:03:38.139> you<00:03:38.769> won't<00:03:38.980> see<00:03:39.160> that<00:03:39.370> so

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
when it cools down you won't see that so

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.220 
when it cools down you won't see that so
that's<00:03:40.060> our<00:03:40.380> sole<00:03:41.380> colored<00:03:41.739> one<00:03:41.920> for<00:03:42.760> that

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
that's our sole colored one for that

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.210 
that's our sole colored one for that
I'll<00:03:44.230> do<00:03:44.380> another<00:03:44.530> one<00:03:44.769> just<00:03:45.040> with<00:03:45.160> our

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
I'll do another one just with our

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.479 
I'll do another one just with our
different<00:03:46.060> colors<00:03:46.389> so<00:03:46.600> you<00:03:46.690> can<00:03:46.750> see<00:03:47.489> same

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
different colors so you can see same

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.370 
different colors so you can see same
thing<00:03:48.670> again<00:03:48.910> a<00:03:50.220> little<00:03:51.220> bit<00:03:51.430> too<00:03:51.609> much<00:03:52.380> that's

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
thing again a little bit too much that's

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.900 
thing again a little bit too much that's
why<00:03:53.590> I<00:03:53.620> had<00:03:53.769> my<00:03:53.920> craft<00:03:54.190> mat<00:03:54.280> underneath<00:03:54.730> to

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
why I had my craft mat underneath to

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.400 
why I had my craft mat underneath to
catch<00:03:55.030> it

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:08.610 

there<00:04:01.410> we<00:04:01.530> are

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.559 

around<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.550> sides<00:04:11.700> just<00:04:12.700> a<00:04:12.790> little<00:04:13.000> bit<00:04:13.120> just

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
around the sides just a little bit just
