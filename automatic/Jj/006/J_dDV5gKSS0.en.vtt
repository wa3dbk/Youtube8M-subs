00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.630
 it's a super feminine program that 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.860
 leads among women as they are with the 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.630
 chemistry among you that is sometimes very 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.180
 difficult between 12 but you know that we 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.480
 we carry barbarian I think there was so much 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.760
 curiosity to see what a woman was like 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.130
 Colombian about your age or a 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.230
 mexicana that you do not understand how 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.730
 so curious to see how we were that 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.790
 there was no time to be and that 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.980
 we left after it was very well handled 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.080
 how the roles were distributed was all 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:45.300
 a super relaxed 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:48.390
 [Music] 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.480
 what was your role 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.130
 in 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.710
 having chosen to be me for example 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.690
 they chose one was married but not 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.790
 had and the other is single and does not fear 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.020
 said I am married and with children then 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.540
 it seems to me that naturally each subject 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.160
 falling on one over another according to the 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.890
 life experience that each one had 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.979
 then there then easy how many 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.619
 marriages have lasted 20 30 years and have 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.450
 been when my parents for example 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.450
 divorced I just think about the idea 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.229
 hard, so if I said now that the 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.820
 group is going to appear here with the years 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.200
 it appears that as classified in a 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.470
 newspaper to see if you find any 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.509
 initial more because it's not so easy is 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.009
 important to discover or for me 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.840
 participate in a project where 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.110
 we clearly speak to the whole woman 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.180
 Latin American 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.610
 that place is from an independent place 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.390
 who works with ideas wanting to do 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.940
 things and in that sense it was for me a 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.920
 very interesting discovery to know 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.950
 these two women from other places 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.160
 mexico and colombia that at the same time 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:01.200
 routes equal to me and so different 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.200
 [Music] 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.259
 talking about your next year of being 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.759
 driving towards crosses how was the 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.470
 proposal how did you feel that you 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.170
 they proposed to you how 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.890
 I find it very flattering and I say it every 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.709
 once you have even thought that 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.530
 a hyper successful program throughout the 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.080
 world where also the female role is 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.860
 makes me want to have thought of me as 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.030
 possible candidate I say I think 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.770
 great from that place already with that 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.190
 look what you got with that and I'll stay 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.190
 quiet
