not<00:00:50.050> all<00:00:50.260> at<00:00:50.410> the<00:00:50.500> same<00:00:50.649> time<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:52.149> in<00:00:52.540> my

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
not all at the same time and in my

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.080 
not all at the same time and in my

opinion the two best classes to level up
with<00:00:55.420> fasts<00:00:55.870> is<00:00:56.050> the<00:00:56.410> medic<00:00:56.739> class<00:00:56.890> and<00:00:57.370> the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
with fasts is the medic class and the

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.049 
with fasts is the medic class and the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.790 
not a good tip is if you are lucky
enough<00:02:30.520> to<00:02:31.090> get<00:02:31.240> an<00:02:31.390> XP<00:02:31.750> boost<00:02:31.960> for<00:02:32.290> for<00:02:32.770> a

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
enough to get an XP boost for for a

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.460 
enough to get an XP boost for for a
class<00:02:33.100> you<00:02:34.060> should<00:02:34.240> probably<00:02:34.390> play<00:02:34.840> very<00:02:35.290> much

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
class you should probably play very much

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.310 
class you should probably play very much
on<00:02:36.070> that<00:02:36.130> class<00:02:36.510> but<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:37.630> can<00:02:37.780> get<00:02:37.960> a<00:02:37.990> boost

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
on that class but you can get a boost

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.100 
on that class but you can get a boost
for<00:02:38.650> one<00:02:38.860> day<00:02:39.070> for<00:02:39.580> seven<00:02:39.910> days<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.330> if<00:02:40.930> you

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
for one day for seven days and if you

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.230 
for one day for seven days and if you
are<00:02:41.200> very<00:02:41.830> lucky<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.370> can<00:02:42.520> get<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.730> boost<00:02:42.940> for

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
are very lucky you can get a boost for

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.010 
are very lucky you can get a boost for
30<00:02:43.750> days<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:46.060> also<00:02:46.300> think<00:02:46.570> it<00:02:46.780> is<00:02:46.870> possible

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
30 days and I also think it is possible

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.270 
30 days and I also think it is possible
to<00:02:47.350> get<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.590> boost<00:02:47.800> 480<00:02:48.700> days<00:02:48.940> but<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.890> chances

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
to get a boost 480 days but the chances

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.680 
to get a boost 480 days but the chances
are<00:02:51.340> very<00:02:51.550> unlikely<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:54.390> that<00:02:55.390> was<00:02:55.540> basically

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
are very unlikely and that was basically

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.410 
are very unlikely and that was basically
