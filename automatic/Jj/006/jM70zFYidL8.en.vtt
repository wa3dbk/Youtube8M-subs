individual and they got killed
unfortunately<00:02:12.550> but<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.810> venom<00:02:14.260> is<00:02:15.150> seen<00:02:16.150> as

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
unfortunately but the venom is seen as

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.260 
unfortunately but the venom is seen as
medically<00:02:16.930> significant<00:02:17.620> but<00:02:18.030> not<00:02:19.030> very

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
medically significant but not very

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.660 
medically significant but not very
dangerous<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:20.140> healthy<00:02:20.860> adults<00:02:21.069> I<00:02:21.400> don't

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
dangerous to healthy adults I don't

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.479 
dangerous to healthy adults I don't
think<00:02:21.910> they<00:02:22.060> can<00:02:22.300> kill<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.540> healthy<00:02:22.930> adult

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
these are very calm snakes then

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.300

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
but as I told you they are not true

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:58.170 
but as I told you they are not true
Cobras<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:56.310> it's<00:02:57.310> probably<00:02:57.670> just<00:02:57.970> an

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
Cobras and it's probably just an

aderson<00:03:47.520> and<00:03:48.780> for<00:03:49.780> him<00:03:49.960> I<00:03:53.940> still<00:03:54.940> think<00:03:55.210> he<00:03:55.450> can

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
aderson and for him I still think he can

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:04.470 
aderson and for him I still think he can
um<00:03:56.430> eat<00:03:57.430> that<00:03:58.920> let's<00:03:59.920> see<00:04:00.040> what<00:04:00.160> happens

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.920 

for<00:04:05.470> now<00:04:05.590> I'll<00:04:05.770> stop<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.340> video<00:04:06.610> and<00:04:09.660> get<00:04:10.660> back

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
for now I'll stop the video and get back

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.860 
for now I'll stop the video and get back
to<00:04:11.140> it<00:04:11.260> when<00:04:11.530> he<00:04:11.830> has<00:04:12.400> a<00:04:12.430> better<00:04:12.730> idea<00:04:13.180> how<00:04:13.810> to

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
to it when he has a better idea how to

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.770 
to it when he has a better idea how to
solve<00:04:14.260> this<00:04:14.470> thinking<00:04:15.180> okay<00:04:16.180> who<00:04:16.329> is<00:04:16.450> a<00:04:16.480> quick

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
solve this thinking okay who is a quick

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.580 
solve this thinking okay who is a quick
return<00:04:17.139> to<00:04:17.829> the<00:04:17.950> hospital<00:04:18.489> table<00:04:18.609> speeding

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
return to the hospital table speeding

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.700 
return to the hospital table speeding
he's<00:04:20.590> on<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.859> right<00:04:20.980> track<00:04:22.200> he<00:04:23.200> got<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.530> head

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
he's on the right track he got the head

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.810 
he's on the right track he got the head
end<00:04:23.950> and<00:04:24.220> I<00:04:25.380> think<00:04:26.380> after<00:04:26.770> this<00:04:27.190> point<00:04:27.520> it's

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
end and I think after this point it's

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.379 
end and I think after this point it's
gonna<00:04:28.060> be<00:04:28.270> a<00:04:28.800> fast<00:04:29.800> feeding<00:04:30.250> this<00:04:31.210> is<00:04:31.360> a

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
gonna be a fast feeding this is a

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.790 
gonna be a fast feeding this is a
yearling<00:04:31.870> snake<00:04:32.230> and<00:04:33.870> I<00:04:34.870> would<00:04:35.200> assume<00:04:35.740> that

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
yearling snake and I would assume that

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.000 
yearling snake and I would assume that
it<00:04:36.280> would<00:04:36.400> be<00:04:36.790> able<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:37.090> feed<00:04:37.450> on<00:04:38.010> larger

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
it would be able to feed on larger

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.010 
it would be able to feed on larger
pinkies<00:04:39.700> but<00:04:40.150> apparently<00:04:40.950> he<00:04:41.950> cannot<00:04:42.900> do<00:04:43.900> it

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
pinkies but apparently he cannot do it

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.150 
pinkies but apparently he cannot do it
comfortably<00:04:44.620> so<00:04:46.020> again<00:04:47.020> I'll<00:04:47.680> get<00:04:47.889> smaller

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
comfortably so again I'll get smaller

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.140 
comfortably so again I'll get smaller
ones<00:04:48.430> for<00:04:48.669> him<00:04:48.850> as<00:04:48.970> well

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.170 

unfortunately<00:04:52.950> he<00:04:53.950> ended<00:04:54.220> up<00:04:54.340> turning<00:04:54.940> his

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
unfortunately he ended up turning his

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.040 
unfortunately he ended up turning his
back<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.389> us<00:04:56.669> so<00:04:57.669> we<00:04:57.820> cannot<00:04:58.120> see<00:04:58.360> much<00:04:58.660> of<00:04:58.690> the

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
back to us so we cannot see much of the

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.890 
back to us so we cannot see much of the
feeding<00:04:59.430> but<00:05:00.430> we<00:05:00.790> can<00:05:01.000> see<00:05:01.180> his<00:05:01.360> pretty<00:05:01.810> colors

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
feeding but we can see his pretty colors

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.850 
feeding but we can see his pretty colors
at<00:05:04.900> least<00:05:07.169> again<00:05:08.169> he's<00:05:08.380> doing<00:05:08.590> a<00:05:08.650> good<00:05:08.800> job

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
at least again he's doing a good job

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.740 
at least again he's doing a good job
he's<00:05:11.550> done<00:05:12.550> with<00:05:12.820> the<00:05:12.940> first<00:05:13.120> part<00:05:13.300> of<00:05:13.600> the

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
he's done with the first part of the

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.290 
he's done with the first part of the
body<00:05:13.930> got<00:05:14.550> the<00:05:15.550> limbs<00:05:15.789> in<00:05:16.030> pretty<00:05:16.360> much<00:05:16.710> so

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
body got the limbs in pretty much so

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.070 
body got the limbs in pretty much so
he'll<00:05:19.300> manage<00:05:19.890> just<00:05:20.890> a<00:05:21.010> quick<00:05:21.220> tip<00:05:21.460> to<00:05:22.210> people
