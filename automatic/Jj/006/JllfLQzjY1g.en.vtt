00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.910
 to the new edition of Masche to go show 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.220
 I tell you how to get this new Roman 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.509
 like to be involved with schachenmayr and 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:16.080
 entangled the argentiner has one 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.730
 blitzer edge and the early has small 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.119
 curls on the sides 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.810
 both are like the one big net 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.810
 optics revealed 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.740
 I start with the family and show 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.770
 different methods of threading 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.230
 attitude at these yarns begins theme 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.380
 so that you serve them something like that 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.020
 half a meter and see here at 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.960
 the right side a glittering edge 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.600
 but is working with the opposite 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.410
 lying edge and I work with one 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.930
 crochet hook number four 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:56.309
 you are standing into a loop at the edge 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.500
 that's practically a scam and then 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.200
 Are you in the next but one sleep 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.600
 and shoot them through the first stitch 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.600
 you have a sling on the needle 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.759
 you are standing in the next but one again 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.110
 loop and shoot them through the 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:14.750
 sling on the needle 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.880
 that's your air mass chain , so to speak 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.780
 and again next bend and 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.660
 Pull the needle more often through the sleep and 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.390
 so on, so you make your air 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.670
 mesh chain you always take with you 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:36.080
 the left hand a bit of the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:38.700
 top of the gun and almost in the 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.720
 next or next bend this 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.939
 is not working so hard 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.220
 you continue until you have the desired number 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.220
 have formed on air masses 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.520
 when you finish the air mass chain 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.150
 if that's to work and that way 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.970
 that the air masses are turned towards you 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:07.010
 and the network is still being processed 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:09.470
 is behind the work and the first 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.350
 method of guiding the thread or that 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.050
 net in this case is that 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.200
 it's similar to a normal one 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.500
 yarn around the finger wraps around 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.990
 the index finger and then again 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.080
 the ring finger around a little tension 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.220
 to have 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:33.260
 now so went into the first air mass 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.270
 in the next but one from the 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.720
 finger comes and that the upper edge 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.090
 not the glitter knew who shoots 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.570
 through the sling on the needle and the 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.000
 next net of the net still 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.280
 once through the two they sound now 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.420
 that's on the needle then that is 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:59.180
 a tight knit, so to speak, and again 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:02.690
 prick into the next air mass of 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.360
 the top edge the next sleep for 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.860
 pick up 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.410
 I had to move up a bit 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.480
 the crane and again the next but one 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.170
 sleep through the two loops on the 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.600
 needle pull back a tight stitch in 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.209
 the air mass sting the 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.130
 next bend from the to the 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.890
 forefinger leads fetch from the 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.530
 top edge and the next bend 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.040
 through the two loops on the needle 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.910
 pull 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.580
 but you can also with the index finger 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:40.970
 thread into the next but one loop 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:45.980
 and the next bend through the 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:48.320
 two loops on the needle pull with 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:54.620
 the forefinger as the next but one 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:58.480
 Thread this loop through the 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.480
 pull two loops on the needle 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.650
 That's another way you have to 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.630
 just try it out which you 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:13.820
 best is to prick the air mass 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.010
 bend from the index finger get the 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.930
 next loop again through the two 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.900
 looping on the needle pull like that 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.000
 do you make strong stitches 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:26.030
 you can theoretically with kat 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.220
 but they work together 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:33.620
 then in the next row heavier 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:35.630
 record as firm stitches and one 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.550
 Another method is that you just 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.060
 shows that once again with the 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.060
 index finger 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:50.390
 Another method is that you just 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:51.500
 the top of the net with the left 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.250
 hand holding 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.560
 just as I do this and easy 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.870
 always a sling on the needles imst 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.430
 and as I said it is not so sensitive 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.930
 whether that be the next or the 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:10.790
 the next loop is not the end 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.310
 very much on the giant picture mesh picture 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.130
 You can not say that at all 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:20.900
 So just with the left hand that 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:24.070
 net after lead and him in the next 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.570
 or before in the next but one loop 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.830
 pierce and through the two punches 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.810
 pull on the needle 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:34.750
 this is the third method you do 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.750
 keep the network working 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:42.960
 Here again the method where I am 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.729
 net around the finger sling now I am 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.430
 already at the fixed meshes so in 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:51.000
 a solid mass pierce one 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:54.180
 catch the top of the sling 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.949
 net and the next loop through 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:03.150
 pull the two loops on the needle 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:05.729
 and so on, so just paper 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:09.560
 look at all three methods and look 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:09.560
 Which is the best from the hand 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.820
 and automatically form themselves now 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.160
 they ruffle a lot for one 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:24.300
 or you can use it 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:26.910
 use to spice up a t-shirt 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:33.780
 making such a break on the sleeve 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:37.380
 rand or on the collar ran is here 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:41.700
 So the method that easiest for me 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:44.250
 by the hand where I change this network 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:47.360
 the index finger and then again around the 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.360
 ring finger put 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.550
 besides, the yarns have one where 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:08.160
 beautiful course beautiful 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:12.080
 Gradients and just at the edge of the ring 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.080
 a glittering effect 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.270
 the end of work is also complete 

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:26.710
 you just pull you cut 

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:28.720
 the thread off with about 220 cm length and 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.879
 then shoot the thread through the last one 

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.159
 loop through the last stitch on the 

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:34.379
 Just start a simple one 

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:39.280
 knot 

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:42.430
 then you can garnish the net in height 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:45.659
 cut off your rip and include 

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:48.580
 few stitches awarded 

00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:53.889
 and so it looks with a few rows 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:56.560
 but of course you can do one 

00:07:53.889 --> 00:08:00.690
 Crochet all over it or you 

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.690
 You can even do a pulli or pry
