00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
in a more abbreviated session

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.720 
in a more abbreviated session
next<00:01:45.150> I'll<00:01:45.300> be<00:01:45.420> moving<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.140> barbell<00:01:47.100> bent

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
next I'll be moving to the barbell bent

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:56.900 
next I'll be moving to the barbell bent
over<00:01:48.060> rows<00:01:54.110> okay<00:01:55.110> stay<00:01:55.500> high<00:01:55.710> keep<00:01:56.550> your<00:01:56.730> body

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
tight now you want to move in a pretty

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.450 
tight now you want to move in a pretty
aggressive<00:02:02.670> pace<00:02:03.740> but<00:02:04.740> still<00:02:04.950> maintain<00:02:05.160> the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
aggressive pace but still maintain the
