it was asked what's the difference

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.140 
it was asked what's the difference
between<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:09.210> hero<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.929> detailer<00:00:11.150> this

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
between the hero and the detailer this

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.180 
between the hero and the detailer this
is<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.480> motor<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.830> detailer<00:00:15.770> this<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:17.039> the

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
is the motor of the detailer this is the

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.109 
is the motor of the detailer this is the
motor<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:18.390> hero<00:00:18.830> the<00:00:19.830> hero<00:00:19.859> motor<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.850> much

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
motor of the hero the hero motor is much

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.950 
motor of the hero the hero motor is much
smaller<00:00:21.740> but<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.980> motor<00:00:23.400> spins<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.720> much

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
smaller but the motor spins so much

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.890 
smaller but the motor spins so much
faster<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.830> way<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.160> creates<00:00:26.510> you<00:00:27.510> know<00:00:27.570> a

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
faster that way it creates you know a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.950 
faster that way it creates you know a
hell<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.470> blades<00:00:28.769> be<00:00:29.390> making<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.570> trimmer

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
hell of a blades be making that trimmer

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.959 
hell of a blades be making that trimmer
hit<00:00:31.289> harder<00:00:31.710> that's<00:00:31.920> why<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.160> hero<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.820> my

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
hit harder that's why the hero is my

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.020 
hit harder that's why the hero is my
favorite<00:00:33.450> trimmer<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.989> blade<00:00:34.770> moves<00:00:35.730> so

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
favorite trimmer that blade moves so

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.680 
favorite trimmer that blade moves so
fast<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.690> has<00:00:36.899> no<00:00:37.200> choice<00:00:37.469> but<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.829> hit<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:39.000> you

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
fast it has no choice but to hit so you

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.959 
fast it has no choice but to hit so you
know<00:00:39.840> one<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.340> issues<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.520> people<00:00:41.640> have

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969

know one of the issues that people have
with<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> hero<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:43.620> know<00:00:43.680> they<00:00:44.010> say<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:45.289> hump

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
with the hero you know they say the hump

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.020 
with the hero you know they say the hump
this<00:00:47.489> hump<00:00:47.850> right<00:00:48.059> here<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.600> case<00:00:50.030> winds

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
this hump right here on the case winds

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.520 
this hump right here on the case winds
up<00:00:51.300> hitting<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> forehead<00:00:52.170> when<00:00:52.379> you're

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
up hitting the forehead when you're

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.470 
up hitting the forehead when you're
trying<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.800> line<00:00:53.039> but<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.460> found<00:00:53.789> out<00:00:54.090> what<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
trying to line but I found out what the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.869 
trying to line but I found out what the
issue<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.920> case<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.399> actually<00:00:56.610> a

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
issue is the case is actually a

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.500 
issue is the case is actually a
two-piece<00:00:57.510> case<00:00:58.190> you<00:00:59.190> know<00:00:59.340> this<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
two-piece case you know this is the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.420 
two-piece case you know this is the
first<00:01:00.719> piece<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.050> goes<00:01:01.410> over<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.039> then<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
first piece that goes over and then the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.759 
first piece that goes over and then the
aluminum<00:01:03.090> skin<00:01:03.390> goes<00:01:03.750> over<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.290> giving<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.680> a

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
aluminum skin goes over it giving it a

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.670 
aluminum skin goes over it giving it a
little<00:01:05.010> extra<00:01:05.400> height<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.960> know<00:01:07.140> so

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
little extra height to it you know so

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.160 
little extra height to it you know so
one<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.549> my<00:01:08.670> experiments<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.689> I'm<00:01:09.869> going<00:01:10.080> to

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
one of my experiments that I'm going to

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.020 
one of my experiments that I'm going to
be<00:01:10.229> doing<00:01:10.590> later<00:01:10.799> I'm<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.460> be<00:01:11.580> taking

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
be doing later I'm going to be taking

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.630 
be doing later I'm going to be taking
this<00:01:12.210> motor<00:01:12.510> out<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.560> hero<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.159> putting

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
this motor out of the hero and putting

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.590 
this motor out of the hero and putting
it<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.060> housing<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.560> detailer

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
it in the housing of the detailer

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.820 
it in the housing of the detailer
you<00:01:18.600> know<00:01:18.720> I'm<00:01:18.990> gonna<00:01:19.200> have<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.439> do<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> little

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
you know I'm gonna have to do a little

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.590 
you know I'm gonna have to do a little
soldering<00:01:20.280> with<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.610> motor<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.180> think<00:01:21.450> I

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
soldering with the motor but I think I

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.050 
soldering with the motor but I think I
can<00:01:21.750> make<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:21.960> work<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.890> stay<00:01:23.220> tuned<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.939> your

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
can make it work so stay tuned and your

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.969 
can make it work so stay tuned and your
boy<00:01:24.210> Ron<00:01:24.479> Legend<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.020> going<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.290> always<00:01:25.680> have

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
boy Ron Legend is going to always have

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.249 
boy Ron Legend is going to always have
something<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.759> something<00:01:27.030> new<00:01:27.360> once<00:01:28.110> I

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
something for you something new once I

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.770 
something for you something new once I
get<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.650> done<00:01:28.860> I'll<00:01:29.159> post<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.150> have<00:01:30.540> your

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
get it done I'll post it and have your

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.230 
get it done I'll post it and have your
video<00:01:31.430> showing<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.720> how<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.750> works<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:35.240> just

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
video showing you how it works so just

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.690 
video showing you how it works so just
wanted<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.630> answer<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.860> person<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.400> asks

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
wanted to answer the person that asks

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.600 
wanted to answer the person that asks
that<00:01:38.820> question<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:40.439> detailer<00:01:40.890> motor<00:01:41.310> is

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
that question the the detailer motor is

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.080 
that question the the detailer motor is
bigger<00:01:42.030> but<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.540> spins<00:01:42.899> slower<00:01:43.790> that's<00:01:44.790> why

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
bigger but it spins slower that's why

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.920 
bigger but it spins slower that's why
you<00:01:45.149> actually<00:01:45.540> get<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.960> better<00:01:46.290> line<00:01:46.649> from<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
you actually get a better line from the

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.710 
you actually get a better line from the
from<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> hero<00:01:49.490> especially<00:01:50.490> if<00:01:50.729> it's<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.630> a

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
from the hero especially if it's just a

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.289 
from the hero especially if it's just a
5<00:01:51.990> star<00:01:52.380> blade<00:01:52.680> on<00:01:52.979> both<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.520> them<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
5 star blade on both of them the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.929 
5 star blade on both of them the
detailer<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.770> know<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.130> much<00:01:56.340> better<00:01:56.579> with

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
detailer you know is much better with

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.690 
detailer you know is much better with
the<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.689> new<00:01:57.869> wide<00:01:58.140> blade<00:01:58.590> on<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.460> T

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
the the new wide blade on it that the T

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.179 
the the new wide blade on it that the T
wide<00:01:59.909> blade<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.570> much<00:02:00.780> sharper<00:02:01.110> than<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
wide blade is so much sharper than the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.420
