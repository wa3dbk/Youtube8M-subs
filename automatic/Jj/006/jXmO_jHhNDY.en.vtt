00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.770
 hello in this recipe the idea was to make a 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.660
 cake without using egg and that has 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.280
 had two consequences the first one is 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.959
 that has not been very compact and the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.150
 second it is that he has been somewhat dry 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:20.610
 would go very well a bit of tomato sauce 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.800
 or how I made some Syrian sauce and 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.660
 that in addition to the spicy touch gives something 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.910
 of flavor well as you see we started 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.040
 climbing chard these are 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.650
 ecological and are somewhat harder so 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.110
 We put them in boiling water 23 minutes 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.000
 then we remove them we drain them and 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.510
 we reserve them on the other hand we are going to 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.510
 peel potatoes 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.820
 We cut them into slices 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.960
 ah 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.540
 and how are we going to steam them in the 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.540
 quick pot we put them in your container 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.870
 we also peel the carrots and also 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.870
 we add them 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.210
 ah 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.170
 and finally we are going to incorporate a 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:48.180
 chicken breast 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.180
 we open it to season the 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.490
 we put it in the cooking container 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.490
 steamed 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.950
 we put it in the pot we cover 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.380
 and when it takes pressure we leave it 8 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.290
 minutes 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.340
 while we will saute onion 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.340
 we cut in julienne 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.320
 We put a pan on the fire with a 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.320
 trickle of oil 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
 ah 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.450
 we incorporate it and add garlic too 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.800
 chopped and if you want it to be a point 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.670
 spicy chilli 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.670
 we sautÃ© 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.370
 and let the vegetables and saute good 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.370
 are the pot has already lost the pressure 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.709
 and now let's shred the chicken 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.990
 we incorporate it into the onion 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.990
 we sautÃ© them 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.900
 and we can assemble the cake 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.489
 we put a Swiss chard leaf base 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.919
 then a layer of potato 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.069
 then a layer of carrot as you see 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.069
 open in the middle 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.980
 we add the chicken 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.320
 i 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.370
 we press a little so that the cake 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.370
 be more compact 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:30.159
 another layer of potatoes 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.530
 and finally some chard leaves 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.349
 As all the ingredients are already 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.389
 cooked we put it in the oven just 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:05.280
 so that it takes heat with about 20 minutes 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:05.280
 at 180 degrees will be enough 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.819
 Y 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.290
 As I commented to you I was rich but it is a 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.970
 recipe that needs improvement I hope 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.120
 your comments a hug up 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.120
 then
