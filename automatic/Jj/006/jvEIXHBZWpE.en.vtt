some typos they'll come up and i'll be

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.219 
some typos they'll come up and i'll be
in<00:04:47.639> the<00:04:47.729> second<00:04:48.060> third<00:04:48.270> parts<00:04:48.629> not<00:04:48.930> so<00:04:49.080> much

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
in the second third parts not so much

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.499 
in the second third parts not so much
here<00:04:49.470> this<00:04:49.680> is<00:04:49.860> there's<00:04:50.550> no<00:04:50.699> problem<00:04:51.060> here<00:04:51.090> Why

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
here this is there's no problem here Why

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:52.879 
here this is there's no problem here Why
should<00:04:51.539> there<00:04:51.750> might<00:04:51.990> be<00:04:52.020> a<00:04:52.169> few<00:04:52.409> but<00:04:52.590> near<00:04:52.860> the

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
should there might be a few but near the

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.230 
should there might be a few but near the
end<00:04:53.039> but<00:04:53.460> not<00:04:54.120> much<00:04:55.550> you<00:04:56.550> guys<00:04:56.729> think<00:04:57.090> they're

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
end but not much you guys think they're

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.879 
end but not much you guys think they're
school<00:04:57.599> I<00:04:57.629> guess<00:04:57.750> these<00:04:58.110> are<00:04:58.169> the<00:04:58.440> closest

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
school I guess these are the closest

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.399 
school I guess these are the closest
equivalent<00:04:59.129> of<00:04:59.430> squirtles<00:05:00.259> because<00:05:01.259> they

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.409 
equivalent of squirtles because they

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:02.990 
equivalent of squirtles because they
have<00:05:01.500> rapid<00:05:01.889> spin<00:05:02.069> withdraw<00:05:02.490> but<00:05:02.729> they<00:05:02.819> don't

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
have rapid spin withdraw but they don't

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.110 
have rapid spin withdraw but they don't
have<00:05:03.060> bubble<00:05:04.050> or<00:05:04.680> anything<00:05:04.800> like<00:05:04.979> that<00:05:05.120> but

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
have bubble or anything like that but

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:13.180 
have bubble or anything like that but
there<00:05:06.300> would<00:05:06.539> be<00:05:06.569> up<00:05:06.810> the<00:05:06.930> koopa<00:05:08.930> and<00:05:11.270> he's<00:05:12.270> sad

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
there would be up the koopa and he's sad

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.939 
there would be up the koopa and he's sad
anyway<00:05:14.900> let's<00:05:15.900> go<00:05:16.199> Mario<00:05:18.469> yeah<00:05:19.469> I<00:05:19.500> gotta<00:05:19.710> heal

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
anyway let's go Mario yeah I gotta heal

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.570 
anyway let's go Mario yeah I gotta heal
it<00:05:20.069> anyway<00:05:20.400> I<00:05:21.830> don't<00:05:22.830> know<00:05:23.039> if<00:05:23.159> Amy's<00:05:23.430> are

it anyway I don't know if Amy's are
actually<00:05:23.909> significantly<00:05:24.150> long<00:05:25.250> little

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
actually significantly long little

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.269 
actually significantly long little
glitchy<00:05:26.490> there<00:05:26.789> but<00:05:27.090> I<00:05:27.469> don't<00:05:28.469> know<00:05:28.560> i'm

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:29.279 
glitchy there but I don't know i'm

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:31.339 
glitchy there but I don't know i'm
guessing<00:05:30.029> yeah<00:05:30.449> this<00:05:30.569> person<00:05:30.960> has<00:05:31.110> to<00:05:31.229> be<00:05:31.289> a

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
guessing yeah this person has to be a

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:32.990 
guessing yeah this person has to be a
foreigner<00:05:31.710> because<00:05:31.830> apparently<00:05:32.340> and<00:05:32.789> why

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
foreigner because apparently and why

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.879 
foreigner because apparently and why
they<00:05:33.150> had<00:05:33.330> fed<00:05:33.810> to<00:05:34.020> the<00:05:34.139> end<00:05:34.319> or<00:05:34.500> apparently

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
they had fed to the end or apparently

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.129 
they had fed to the end or apparently
they<00:05:34.979> were<00:05:35.099> just<00:05:36.800> putting<00:05:37.800> in<00:05:37.979> fed<00:05:38.340> for<00:05:39.139> dub

they were just putting in fed for dub

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.370 
they were just putting in fed for dub
verse<00:05:40.440> reasons<00:05:41.310> of<00:05:41.460> scripting<00:05:42.139> so<00:05:43.139> you<00:05:43.259> could

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
verse reasons of scripting so you could

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.890 
verse reasons of scripting so you could
say<00:05:43.500> potion<00:05:43.949> fed<00:05:44.219> 22<00:05:44.849> did<00:05:45.029> a<00:05:45.060> maybe<00:05:45.599> and

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
say potion fed 22 did a maybe and

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.620 
say potion fed 22 did a maybe and
guessing<00:05:46.380> but<00:05:46.560> i<00:05:46.969> think<00:05:47.969> it<00:05:48.029> is<00:05:48.120> so<00:05:48.300> yeah<00:05:48.389> that

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
guessing but i think it is so yeah that

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.350 
guessing but i think it is so yeah that
