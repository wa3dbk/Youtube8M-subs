00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.300 
all the time in my house you get three
for<00:01:36.909> a<00:01:36.940> dollar<00:01:37.000> I<00:01:37.479> grab<00:01:37.930> this<00:01:38.229> display<00:01:38.860> easel

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
for a dollar I grab this display easel

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.469 
for a dollar I grab this display easel
because<00:01:39.580> I<00:01:39.670> thought<00:01:39.820> this<00:01:40.000> would<00:01:40.150> be<00:01:40.180> really

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
because I thought this would be really

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.820 
because I thought this would be really
good<00:01:40.630> in<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:40.840> kitchen<00:01:41.170> for<00:01:41.320> holding<00:01:41.710> my

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
good in the kitchen for holding my

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.770 
good in the kitchen for holding my
cookbooks<00:01:42.369> so<00:01:42.700> hopefully<00:01:43.150> this<00:01:43.330> is<00:01:43.360> going<00:01:43.690> to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
cookbooks so hopefully this is going to

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.539 
cookbooks so hopefully this is going to
stand<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.110> test<00:01:44.140> of<00:01:44.409> time<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:44.920> if<00:01:45.250> I<00:01:45.340> don't

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
stand the test of time and if I don't

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.250 
stand the test of time and if I don't
like<00:01:45.700> it<00:01:45.820> in<00:01:45.909> my<00:01:45.940> kitchen<00:01:46.330> I<00:01:46.510> might<00:01:46.750> use<00:01:46.960> it<00:01:46.990> for

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
like it in my kitchen I might use it for

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.190 
like it in my kitchen I might use it for
displaying<00:01:48.070> some<00:01:48.400> plates<00:01:48.760> in<00:01:49.000> my<00:01:49.479> other<00:01:49.690> room

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200

stores<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:56.380> for<00:01:56.740> some<00:01:56.979> reason<00:01:57.400> if<00:01:57.580> you<00:01:57.760> ask<00:01:58.000> a

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
stores and for some reason if you ask a

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.000 
stores and for some reason if you ask a
kid<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.659> come<00:01:58.840> up<00:01:58.960> and<00:01:59.200> point<00:01:59.439> with<00:01:59.560> a<00:01:59.590> pointer

kid to come up and point with a pointer

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.670 
kid to come up and point with a pointer
it's<00:02:00.250> for<00:02:00.520> some<00:02:00.670> reason<00:02:00.970> like<00:02:01.119> 85<00:02:01.689> times<00:02:02.290> more

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
it's for some reason like 85 times more

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.870 
it's for some reason like 85 times more
exciting<00:02:03.130> than<00:02:03.220> if<00:02:03.340> they<00:02:03.430> just<00:02:03.580> point<00:02:03.790> with

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
exciting than if they just point with

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.120 
exciting than if they just point with
their<00:02:04.000> finger<00:02:04.330> so<00:02:04.840> I<00:02:05.080> rarely<00:02:05.500> use<00:02:05.680> this<00:02:05.979> I

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
pattern on this I thought it looked

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.840

to apply and remove my son's dresser
actually<00:02:36.680> needs<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:37.070> be<00:02:37.190> lined<00:02:37.460> and<00:02:37.730> I<00:02:37.820> really

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
actually needs to be lined and I really

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.250 
actually needs to be lined and I really
liked<00:02:38.240> how<00:02:38.360> it<00:02:38.390> was<00:02:38.510> kind<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:38.750> like<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:38.930> wood

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
liked how it was kind of like a wood

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.340 
liked how it was kind of like a wood
grain<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.860> it<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:40.490> I<00:02:40.550> picked<00:02:40.820> up<00:02:41.030> one<00:02:41.480> roll<00:02:41.870> per

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
grain to it so I picked up one roll per

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.080 
grain to it so I picked up one roll per
drawer<00:02:42.740> I'm<00:02:43.100> assuming<00:02:43.610> that's<00:02:43.730> going<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:43.940> be<00:02:44.060> a

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
drawer I'm assuming that's going to be a

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.940 
drawer I'm assuming that's going to be a
little<00:02:44.300> bit<00:02:44.450> too<00:02:44.630> much<00:02:44.810> but<00:02:45.110> for<00:02:45.500> just<00:02:45.710> six

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
little bit too much but for just six

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.310 
little bit too much but for just six
dollars<00:02:46.160> I<00:02:46.640> think<00:02:46.670> that<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.180> big<00:02:47.600> roll<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:48.110> shelf

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
dollars I think that a big roll of shelf

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.050 
dollars I think that a big roll of shelf
liner<00:02:48.530> can<00:02:48.830> run<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.160> at<00:02:49.340> least<00:02:49.640> twelve

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
liner can run you at least twelve

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.970 
liner can run you at least twelve
dollars<00:02:50.540> like<00:02:50.750> Bed<00:02:50.930> Bath<00:02:51.050> &amp;<00:02:51.260> Beyond<00:02:51.470> so<00:02:51.800> I

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
dollars like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond so I

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.710 
dollars like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond so I
thought<00:02:52.370> this<00:02:52.580> was<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.820> really<00:02:53.240> really<00:02:53.480> good

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
thought this was a really really good

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.130 
thought this was a really really good
buy

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
buy

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.900 
buy
plus<00:02:54.380> I<00:02:54.500> can<00:02:54.650> use<00:02:54.680> this<00:02:54.920> in<00:02:55.040> other<00:02:55.160> places<00:02:55.490> if

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
plus I can use this in other places if

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.780 
plus I can use this in other places if
it<00:02:56.510> doesn't<00:02:57.050> fit<00:02:57.410> all<00:02:57.590> in<00:02:57.650> there<00:02:57.980> and<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.550> last

it doesn't fit all in there and the last

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.250 
it doesn't fit all in there and the last

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
can it's been a super long time since

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.850 
can it's been a super long time since
I've<00:03:02.330> seen<00:03:02.510> these<00:03:02.600> at<00:03:02.780> Dollar<00:03:02.960> Tree<00:03:03.080> and<00:03:03.470> we

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
I've seen these at Dollar Tree and we

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.530 
I've seen these at Dollar Tree and we
need<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.040> trash<00:03:04.310> can<00:03:04.520> for<00:03:04.700> our<00:03:04.820> bonus<00:03:05.060> room<00:03:05.390> I

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
need a trash can for our bonus room I

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.150 
need a trash can for our bonus room I
think<00:03:05.600> every<00:03:06.140> room<00:03:06.290> should<00:03:06.470> have<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.620> trash<00:03:06.860> can

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
think every room should have a trash can

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.830 
think every room should have a trash can
and<00:03:07.430> honestly<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.150> think<00:03:08.360> this<00:03:08.660> is<00:03:08.810> a

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
and honestly I think this is a

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.200 
and honestly I think this is a
relatively<00:03:09.470> quality<00:03:10.220> piece<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:10.850> it<00:03:10.940> doesn't

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
relatively quality piece and it doesn't

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.270 
relatively quality piece and it doesn't
look<00:03:11.450> super<00:03:12.050> horrible<00:03:12.530> especially<00:03:12.860> for<00:03:13.250> a

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
look super horrible especially for a

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.830 
look super horrible especially for a
bonus<00:03:13.700> room<00:03:13.850> I<00:03:13.970> think<00:03:14.030> that<00:03:14.300> this<00:03:14.420> would<00:03:14.630> be

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
bonus room I think that this would be

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.200 
bonus room I think that this would be
perfect<00:03:15.440> up<00:03:15.830> there<00:03:16.070> so<00:03:16.550> those<00:03:17.000> are<00:03:17.120> the

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
perfect up there so those are the

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.820 
perfect up there so those are the
organizing<00:03:17.690> products<00:03:17.990> that<00:03:18.110> I<00:03:18.140> picked<00:03:18.440> up<00:03:18.680> I

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830
