00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
able to move and instead the neurosis is

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.139 
able to move and instead the neurosis is
like<00:01:01.989> try<00:01:02.530> to<00:01:02.559> hold<00:01:02.829> still<00:01:02.949> which<00:01:03.640> is<00:01:03.820> like<00:01:04.000> you

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.740 
and i wouldn't know what I was looking
for<00:02:11.780> anyway<00:02:12.230> um<00:02:12.819> when<00:02:13.819> he<00:02:13.849> first<00:02:14.150> looked<00:02:14.360> at<00:02:14.569> he

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
for anyway um when he first looked at he

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.009 
for anyway um when he first looked at he
thought<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.319> looked<00:02:15.500> fine<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:17.660> then<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.870> more

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
thought it looked fine and then the more

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.500 
thought it looked fine and then the more
he<00:02:18.110> looked<00:02:18.319> at<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:19.370> was<00:02:19.519> like<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:20.060> spinal

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
he looked at it it was like the spinal

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.430 
he looked at it it was like the spinal
cord<00:02:20.629> was<00:02:20.750> supposed<00:02:21.049> to<00:02:21.140> be<00:02:21.230> like

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
cord was supposed to be like

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.949 
cord was supposed to be like
consistently<00:02:22.430> gray<00:02:22.819> all<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.480> way<00:02:23.569> through

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
consistently gray all the way through

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.559 
consistently gray all the way through
and<00:02:24.250> instead<00:02:25.250> there<00:02:25.459> was<00:02:25.549> like<00:02:25.790> this<00:02:26.060> patch

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
and instead there was like this patch

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.360 
and instead there was like this patch
that<00:02:26.900> was<00:02:27.079> like<00:02:27.230> lighter<00:02:27.590> than<00:02:27.829> the<00:02:27.980> rest<00:02:28.160> of

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
that was like lighter than the rest of

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.729 
that was like lighter than the rest of
it<00:02:28.549> and<00:02:28.760> he<00:02:29.480> thought<00:02:29.690> he<00:02:29.989> says<00:02:30.200> like<00:02:30.380> well<00:02:30.590> not

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
it and he thought he says like well not

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.100 
it and he thought he says like well not
that<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.220> look<00:02:31.430> at<00:02:31.519> it<00:02:31.700> more<00:02:31.849> maybe<00:02:32.630> that<00:02:32.900> you

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
that I look at it more maybe that you

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.009 
that I look at it more maybe that you
know<00:02:33.200> that<00:02:33.470> could<00:02:33.650> be<00:02:33.799> on<00:02:34.720> what<00:02:35.720> do<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:35.840> call

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
know that could be on what do you call

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.190 
know that could be on what do you call
it<00:02:36.519> like<00:02:37.519> a<00:02:37.549> scab<00:02:37.940> or<00:02:38.239> lesion<00:02:38.690> when<00:02:38.900> you<00:02:38.989> call

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
it like a scab or lesion when you call

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.979 
it like a scab or lesion when you call
that<00:02:39.230> I<00:02:39.530> forget<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:41.180> after<00:02:41.420> he<00:02:41.660> looked<00:02:41.780> at<00:02:41.900> it

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
that I forget so after he looked at it

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.500 
that I forget so after he looked at it
for<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.140> little<00:02:42.290> bit<00:02:42.470> he<00:02:42.709> did<00:02:42.890> think<00:02:43.160> that<00:02:43.510> he's

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
for a little bit he did think that he's

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.699 
for a little bit he did think that he's
pretty<00:02:44.720> much<00:02:44.810> keep<00:02:45.079> going<00:02:45.410> with<00:02:45.560> the

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
pretty much keep going with the

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.390 
pretty much keep going with the
hypothesis<00:02:46.310> hypothesis<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:47.420> have<00:02:47.780> a<00:02:47.810> mess

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
hypothesis hypothesis that I have a mess

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.770 
hypothesis hypothesis that I have a mess
he's<00:02:49.400> been<00:02:49.579> sticking<00:02:50.030> with<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.209> you<00:02:50.630> know<00:02:50.750> I

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
he's been sticking with that you know I

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.059 
he's been sticking with that you know I
don't<00:02:51.079> think<00:02:51.290> he's<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.560> hundred<00:02:51.950> percent

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
don't think he's a hundred percent

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.400 
don't think he's a hundred percent
positive<00:02:52.430> but<00:02:52.910> he<00:02:53.030> seems<00:02:53.299> you<00:02:54.170> know<00:02:54.260> the

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
positive but he seems you know the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.380 
positive but he seems you know the
further<00:02:54.620> we<00:02:54.829> go<00:02:54.950> along<00:02:55.220> he<00:02:55.489> stays<00:02:55.760> he<00:02:56.060> seems<00:02:56.269> to

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
further we go along he stays he seems to

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.890 
further we go along he stays he seems to
stay<00:02:56.599> pretty<00:02:56.930> sure<00:02:57.079> that<00:02:57.440> is<00:02:57.620> what<00:02:57.829> it<00:02:57.980> is<00:02:58.100> so<00:02:58.900> I

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
stay pretty sure that is what it is so I

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.000 
stay pretty sure that is what it is so I
think<00:02:59.989> that's<00:03:00.230> what<00:03:00.470> we're<00:03:00.620> sticking<00:03:00.980> with

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
think that's what we're sticking with

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.360 
think that's what we're sticking with
that<00:03:01.459> um<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:03.470> know<00:03:03.590> I'm<00:03:03.829> being<00:03:04.160> diagnosed
