00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
the question is from Karen I grouped

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.380 
the question is from Karen I grouped
them<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.650> little<00:00:16.980> bit<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:18.210> low<00:00:19.050> logic<00:00:20.390> order

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
them a little bit in a low logic order

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.109 
them a little bit in a low logic order
that<00:00:23.779> it's<00:00:24.779> not<00:00:25.019> on<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.220> order<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
that it's not on the order that the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.259 
that it's not on the order that the
questions<00:00:27.840> are<00:00:28.590> posted<00:00:29.279> but<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.849> little<00:00:30.090> bit

questions are posted but a little bit
illogical<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:32.329> Karen<00:00:33.329> did<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> last

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
illogical and Karen did the last

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.119 
illogical and Karen did the last
question<00:00:34.440> today<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:35.430> she<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.000> first<00:00:36.300> to

easy for those who don't ask questions
to<00:01:13.680> judge<00:01:14.070> those<00:01:14.670> questions<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.780> are<00:01:16.080> stupid

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
to judge those questions that are stupid

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.190 
to judge those questions that are stupid
questions<00:01:16.619> or<00:01:17.280> whatever<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.840> don't

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
questions or whatever but I don't

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
believe there are silly questions and I

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.200 
believe there are silly questions and I
don't<00:01:21.869> live<00:01:22.080> there<00:01:22.110> stupid<00:01:22.680> questions<00:01:23.210> there

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
don't live there stupid questions there

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.490 
don't live there stupid questions there
are<00:01:24.240> only<00:01:24.740> questions<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.840> they<00:01:27.840> need<00:01:28.200> an

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
are only questions and they need an

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.420 
are only questions and they need an
answer

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
answer

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.230 
answer
so<00:01:29.939> let's<00:01:30.630> only<00:01:30.960> thing<00:01:31.470> with<00:01:31.740> questions<00:01:32.549> so

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
so let's only thing with questions so

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.399 
so let's only thing with questions so
but<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:34.020> ask<00:01:34.259> me<00:01:34.590> your<00:01:34.979> question<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.409> you

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
but you you ask me your question and you

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.719 
but you you ask me your question and you
say<00:01:38.210> in<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.360> three<00:01:39.600> piece<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.110> straighteners

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
say in the three piece of straighteners

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.700 
say in the three piece of straighteners
training<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.030> PDF<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.600> keys<00:01:43.140> are<00:01:43.409> in

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
training in the PDF the keys are in

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.499 
training in the PDF the keys are in
order<00:01:44.180> l<00:01:45.180> FS<00:01:46.040> so<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.280> that's<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.030> lateral

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
order l FS so that that's the lateral

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.270 
order l FS so that that's the lateral
bending<00:01:49.399> first<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:51.090> forward<00:01:51.720> down<00:01:51.930> and

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
bending first the forward down and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.730 
bending first the forward down and
stepping<00:01:53.280> under<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.540> then<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.380> say<00:01:55.560> between

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
stepping under and then you say between

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.069 
stepping under and then you say between
the<00:01:55.950> launching<00:01:56.490> information<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.570> side

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
the launching information on the side

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.740 
the launching information on the side
the<00:01:58.320> order<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.009> l<00:01:59.340> s<00:01:59.700> f<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.560> lateral<00:02:02.549> bending

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
the order is l s f so lateral bending

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.620 
the order is l s f so lateral bending
stepping<00:02:03.750> under<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.259> forward<00:02:05.189> down<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
stepping under and forward down and the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.540 
stepping under and forward down and the
question<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.590> does<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.979> order<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
question of you is does the order of the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.760 
question of you is does the order of the
key<00:02:08.789> piece<00:02:09.539> matter<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.440> always<00:02:11.009> work<00:02:11.280> after

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
key piece matter I always work after

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.670 
key piece matter I always work after
first<00:02:11.950> version<00:02:12.460> so<00:02:12.790> this<00:02:12.970> is<00:02:13.260> actually<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.380> very

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
first version so this is actually a very

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.110 
first version so this is actually a very
good<00:02:14.950> question<00:02:15.930> because<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:19.150> think<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:21.670> can<00:02:21.880> do

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
good question because I think you can do

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.400 
good question because I think you can do
the<00:02:22.660> LFS<00:02:23.140> very<00:02:23.410> strict<00:02:23.920> but<00:02:25.020> actually<00:02:26.020> the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
the LFS very strict but actually the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.350 
the LFS very strict but actually the
lateral<00:02:27.310> pending<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:27.820> forward<00:02:28.180> down<00:02:28.330> and

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
lateral pending and forward down and

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.870 
lateral pending and forward down and
stepping<00:02:28.960> under<00:02:29.230> are<00:02:29.440> hanging<00:02:29.950> together<00:02:30.190> and

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
stepping under are hanging together and

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.680 
stepping under are hanging together and
the<00:02:31.450> one<00:02:31.660> cannot<00:02:32.110> do<00:02:32.380> without<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.670> other<00:02:33.820> so

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.400 

yeah<00:02:37.690> one<00:02:38.530> of<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:39.240> things<00:02:40.240> with<00:02:41.170> lateral

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
yeah one of the things with lateral

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.010 
yeah one of the things with lateral
bending<00:02:41.890> is<00:02:42.820> that<00:02:43.570> you<00:02:43.900> asked<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:45.010> horse<00:02:46.020> with

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
bending is that you asked the horse with

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.320 
bending is that you asked the horse with
his<00:02:47.140> head<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.740> inside<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.520> because<00:02:49.090> the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
his head to the inside and because the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.560 
his head to the inside and because the
head<00:02:49.540> is<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.780> member<00:02:50.740> of<00:02:50.770> the<00:02:51.040> whole<00:02:51.220> spine<00:02:51.790> when

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
head is a member of the whole spine when

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.130 
head is a member of the whole spine when
the<00:02:52.660> horse<00:02:52.990> will<00:02:53.410> relax<00:02:54.220> then<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.900> whole

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
the horse will relax then the the whole

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.190 
the horse will relax then the the whole
spine<00:02:56.530> will<00:02:56.800> Bend<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:57.550> then<00:02:58.240> you<00:02:58.420> will<00:02:58.630> reach

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
spine will Bend and then you will reach

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.970 
spine will Bend and then you will reach
the<00:02:59.620> hip<00:02:59.830> of<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.640> horse<00:03:00.910> and<00:03:01.240> then<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.620> inside

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
the hip of the horse and then the inside

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.430 
the hip of the horse and then the inside
hip<00:03:03.220> comes<00:03:03.490> forward<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:04.390> because<00:03:05.020> of<00:03:05.200> that

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
hip comes forward and because of that

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.520 
hip comes forward and because of that
the<00:03:05.830> horse<00:03:06.070> will<00:03:06.390> step<00:03:07.390> under<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.050> point<00:03:08.350> of

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
the horse will step under the point of

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.730 
the horse will step under the point of
weight<00:03:09.270> so<00:03:10.270> that's<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.630> relationship<00:03:11.200> with

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
weight so that's the relationship with

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.060 
weight so that's the relationship with
those<00:03:11.920> two<00:03:12.370> things<00:03:12.610> and<00:03:13.680> because<00:03:14.680> of<00:03:14.950> the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
those two things and because of the

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.580 
those two things and because of the
lateral<00:03:15.280> bending<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:16.209> horse<00:03:16.450> is<00:03:16.660> stretching

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
lateral bending the horse is stretching

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.860 
lateral bending the horse is stretching
the<00:03:17.770> back<00:03:18.010> muscle<00:03:18.610> it's<00:03:18.940> called<00:03:19.390> the

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
the back muscle it's called the

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.620 
the back muscle it's called the
latissimus<00:03:20.650> dorsi<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:21.400> when<00:03:21.880> you<00:03:22.000> stretch<00:03:22.360> to

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
latissimus dorsi and when you stretch to

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.730 
latissimus dorsi and when you stretch to
the<00:03:22.750> left<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:23.200> to<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.470> right<00:03:24.120> then<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:26.080> back

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
the left and to the right then the back

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.250 
the left and to the right then the back
muscles<00:03:26.770> are<00:03:27.510> lengthened<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.720> because<00:03:29.230> of

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
muscles are lengthened and because of

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.920 
muscles are lengthened and because of
that<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:30.160> horse<00:03:30.459> will<00:03:30.640> step<00:03:30.970> will<00:03:31.390> go<00:03:31.570> forward

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
that the horse will step will go forward

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.080 
that the horse will step will go forward
down<00:03:32.260> so<00:03:32.890> that's<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.220> relationship<00:03:33.940> between

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
down so that's the relationship between

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.870 
down so that's the relationship between
between<00:03:34.870> those<00:03:35.170> two<00:03:35.560> things<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.520> forward

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
between those two things the forward

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.330 
between those two things the forward
down<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.060> they're<00:03:37.480> stepping<00:03:37.660> under<00:03:38.080> no<00:03:39.070> the

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
down and they're stepping under no the

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.680 
down and they're stepping under no the
forward<00:03:39.640> am<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.060> lateral<00:03:40.390> bending<00:03:40.630> and

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
forward am and the lateral bending and

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.020 
forward am and the lateral bending and
the<00:03:43.690> forward<00:03:43.930> down<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.560> inside<00:03:45.030> hip

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
the forward down and the inside hip

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.570 
the forward down and the inside hip
coming<00:03:46.420> forward<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:47.100> stepping<00:03:48.100> under<00:03:48.400> are

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
coming forward and stepping under are

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.780 
coming forward and stepping under are
also<00:03:48.820> connected<00:03:49.480> because<00:03:49.870> when<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:51.250> horse<00:03:51.490> is

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
also connected because when the horse is

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.220 
also connected because when the horse is
going<00:03:52.620> more<00:03:53.620> forward<00:03:54.160> down<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:55.510> inside<00:03:55.870> hind

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
going more forward down the inside hind

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.940 
going more forward down the inside hind
leg<00:03:56.470> will<00:03:57.190> come<00:03:57.820> a<00:03:58.000> little<00:03:58.150> bit<00:03:58.330> more<00:03:58.570> forward

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
leg will come a little bit more forward

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.610 
leg will come a little bit more forward
so<00:03:59.950> those<00:04:00.459> two<00:04:00.970> things<00:04:01.000> are<00:04:01.510> connected<00:04:02.020> as

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
so those two things are connected as

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.110 
so those two things are connected as
well<00:04:02.890> and<00:04:04.290> but<00:04:05.290> if<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.530> inside<00:04:05.920> hind<00:04:06.280> leg<00:04:06.910> is

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
well and but if the inside hind leg is

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.500 
well and but if the inside hind leg is
not<00:04:07.650> stepping<00:04:08.650> on<00:04:09.100> the<00:04:09.489> door<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:10.120> point<00:04:10.390> of

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
not stepping on the door the point of

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.300 
not stepping on the door the point of
weight<00:04:10.720> then<00:04:11.560> there<00:04:11.800> is<00:04:11.920> a<00:04:11.950> little<00:04:12.130> bit

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
weight then there is a little bit

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.370 
weight then there is a little bit
unbalanced<00:04:13.090> and<00:04:13.390> then<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.870> horse<00:04:14.110> will

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
unbalanced and then the horse will

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.000 
unbalanced and then the horse will
stiffened<00:04:14.950> is<00:04:15.370> his<00:04:15.850> back<00:04:16.090> so<00:04:16.720> also<00:04:17.140> do<00:04:17.350> those

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
stiffened is his back so also do those

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.599 
stiffened is his back so also do those
two<00:04:18.549> things<00:04:19.470> support<00:04:20.470> each<00:04:20.650> other<00:04:20.890> and<00:04:21.160> meet

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
two things support each other and meet

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:22.450 
two things support each other and meet
each<00:04:21.880> other

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
each other

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.300 
each other
and<00:04:22.550> it's<00:04:23.360> a<00:04:23.479> it's<00:04:23.780> kind<00:04:24.110> of<00:04:24.199> a<00:04:24.259> triad<00:04:26.110> so

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
and it's a it's kind of a triad so

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.200 
and it's a it's kind of a triad so
sometimes<00:04:28.310> you<00:04:30.370> when<00:04:31.370> you're<00:04:31.490> trading<00:04:31.759> avoid

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
sometimes you when you're trading avoid

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.840 
sometimes you when you're trading avoid
you<00:04:32.720> do<00:04:32.870> a<00:04:32.900> little<00:04:33.080> bit<00:04:33.440> more<00:04:33.490> bending<00:04:34.490> and

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
you do a little bit more bending and

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.550 
you do a little bit more bending and
then<00:04:35.270> you<00:04:35.389> have<00:04:35.539> a<00:04:35.570> better<00:04:35.780> forward<00:04:36.169> down<00:04:36.350> in<00:04:36.500> a

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
then you have a better forward down in a

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.010 
then you have a better forward down in a
bed<00:04:36.710> of<00:04:36.830> stepping<00:04:37.100> under<00:04:37.400> but<00:04:38.030> sometimes<00:04:38.690> you

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
bed of stepping under but sometimes you

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.379 
bed of stepping under but sometimes you
ask<00:04:39.440> a<00:04:39.889> little<00:04:40.039> bit<00:04:40.220> more<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.759> inside<00:04:41.090> hind

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
ask a little bit more the inside hind

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.260 
ask a little bit more the inside hind
leg<00:04:41.660> to<00:04:41.900> come<00:04:42.110> on<00:04:42.380> there<00:04:42.680> and<00:04:43.070> then<00:04:43.940> you<00:04:44.060> have<00:04:44.240> a

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
leg to come on there and then you have a

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.909 
leg to come on there and then you have a
bit<00:04:44.509> of<00:04:44.539> forward<00:04:44.840> down<00:04:45.080> in<00:04:45.259> a<00:04:45.350> better<00:04:45.500> lateral

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
bit of forward down in a better lateral

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.249 
bit of forward down in a better lateral
bending<00:04:46.070> and<00:04:46.520> sometimes<00:04:47.419> you<00:04:47.539> ask<00:04:47.720> the<00:04:48.050> horse

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
bending and sometimes you ask the horse

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.920 
bending and sometimes you ask the horse
a<00:04:48.530> little<00:04:48.740> bit<00:04:48.860> forward<00:04:49.130> down<00:04:49.460> and<00:04:49.820> then<00:04:50.600> the

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
a little bit forward down and then the

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.290 
a little bit forward down and then the
other<00:04:51.110> two<00:04:51.380> things<00:04:51.789> progress<00:04:52.789> a<00:04:52.970> little<00:04:53.210> bit

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
other two things progress a little bit

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.210 
other two things progress a little bit
more<00:04:53.539> so<00:04:55.150> yeah<00:04:56.150> you<00:04:56.210> can<00:04:56.539> come<00:04:57.169> in<00:04:57.500> different

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
more so yeah you can come in different

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.390 
more so yeah you can come in different
angles<00:04:58.940> in<00:04:59.570> the<00:04:59.690> LFS<00:05:00.169> but<00:05:00.889> when<00:05:01.099> you<00:05:01.190> are

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
angles in the LFS but when you are

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.310 
angles in the LFS but when you are
beginning<00:05:01.820> and<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.270> horse<00:05:02.479> is<00:05:02.570> very<00:05:02.900> stiff

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
beginning and the horse is very stiff

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.089 
beginning and the horse is very stiff
with<00:05:03.949> a<00:05:03.979> very<00:05:04.570> stiff<00:05:05.570> back<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:06.830> first

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
with a very stiff back and the first

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.999 
with a very stiff back and the first
thing<00:05:07.970> is<00:05:08.210> the<00:05:08.630> lateral<00:05:09.020> bending<00:05:09.259> and<00:05:09.680> not<00:05:09.860> the

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
thing is the lateral bending and not the

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.400 
thing is the lateral bending and not the
forward<00:05:10.370> down<00:05:10.580> but<00:05:10.849> because<00:05:11.360> you<00:05:12.080> have<00:05:12.259> to

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
forward down but because you have to

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.330 
forward down but because you have to
stretch<00:05:12.710> them<00:05:12.919> in<00:05:13.130> depending<00:05:13.970> and<00:05:15.130> but<00:05:16.130> when

you are working with a horse for a

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.680 
you are working with a horse for a
longer<00:05:18.830> time<00:05:19.210> then<00:05:21.550> yeah<00:05:22.550> you<00:05:22.729> can<00:05:22.759> also<00:05:23.120> have

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
longer time then yeah you can also have

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.850 
longer time then yeah you can also have
more<00:05:23.930> accent<00:05:24.560> to<00:05:24.919> the<00:05:25.400> stepping<00:05:25.849> under<00:05:26.210> or

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
more accent to the stepping under or

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.210 
more accent to the stepping under or

shift a little bit

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.960

so<00:05:35.409> does<00:05:36.409> the<00:05:36.560> order<00:05:36.740> of<00:05:36.949> the<00:05:37.070> keys<00:05:37.280> matter<00:05:37.639> in

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
so does the order of the keys matter in

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.089 
so does the order of the keys matter in
the<00:05:38.150> beginning<00:05:38.690> yes<00:05:39.110> the<00:05:39.380> L<00:05:39.590> is<00:05:39.889> very

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
the beginning yes the L is very

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.120 
the beginning yes the L is very
important<00:05:40.699> and<00:05:40.880> after<00:05:41.270> a<00:05:41.599> while<00:05:41.870> you<00:05:42.199> you<00:05:42.470> mix

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
important and after a while you you mix

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.899 
important and after a while you you mix
them<00:05:43.400> all<00:05:43.669> together<00:05:44.330> and<00:05:45.080> you<00:05:45.220> put<00:05:46.220> an<00:05:46.370> accent

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:46.909 
them all together and you put an accent

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:50.100 
them all together and you put an accent
but<00:05:47.449> the<00:05:48.050> one<00:05:48.500> cannot<00:05:48.919> without<00:05:49.190> the<00:05:49.699> other

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
but the one cannot without the other

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.770 
but the one cannot without the other
so<00:05:51.110> that<00:05:51.259> is<00:05:51.409> the<00:05:51.560> question<00:05:52.009> of<00:05:52.389> carding<00:05:53.419> very

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
so that is the question of carding very

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.680
