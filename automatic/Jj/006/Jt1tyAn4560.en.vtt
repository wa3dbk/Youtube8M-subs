00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.859 

I

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.409 

if<00:00:21.869> I'm<00:00:22.019> able<00:00:22.169> to<00:00:22.320> land<00:00:22.590> my<00:00:22.830> hits<00:00:23.220> well<00:00:24.090> enough

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:24.419 
if I'm able to land my hits well enough

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:26.689 
if I'm able to land my hits well enough
this<00:00:24.750> probably<00:00:25.500> again<00:00:25.949> be<00:00:26.160> one<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.609> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
this probably again be one of the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.749 
this probably again be one of the
fastest<00:00:27.239> times<00:00:30.919> the<00:00:31.919> thing<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.489> very

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
fastest times the thing is is that very

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.540 
fastest times the thing is is that very
least<00:00:33.000> he's<00:00:33.210> going<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.449> get<00:00:33.540> exhausted

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
least he's going to get exhausted

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:48.080

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.910 

so<00:01:50.170> I'm<00:01:50.229> just<00:01:50.350> come<00:01:50.500> on<00:01:50.650> in<00:01:50.799> acts<00:01:50.979> mode<00:01:52.740> if<00:01:53.740> he's

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
so I'm just come on in acts mode if he's

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.100 
so I'm just come on in acts mode if he's
already<00:01:54.159> on<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.520> ground<00:01:54.790> I<00:01:55.150> believe<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.960> acts

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
already on the ground I believe the acts

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:03.620 
already on the ground I believe the acts
will<00:01:56.439> have<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.590> higher<00:01:56.860> damage<00:01:57.130> per<00:01:57.430> second

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.490

we'll use that opportunity to pull off a

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.070 
we'll use that opportunity to pull off a
whole<00:02:33.610> bunch<00:02:33.820> of<00:02:33.970> more<00:02:34.150> exhaustive<00:02:34.690> tax<00:02:34.840> off

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
whole bunch of more exhaustive tax off

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.740 
whole bunch of more exhaustive tax off
in<00:02:35.230> his<00:02:35.320> face<00:02:35.880> we<00:02:36.880> might<00:02:37.060> wait<00:02:37.210> for<00:02:37.390> him<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.540> get

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
in his face we might wait for him to get

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.830 
in his face we might wait for him to get
out<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:39.310> enrichment<00:02:39.730> before<00:02:40.300> we<00:02:40.420> do<00:02:40.570> that<00:02:42.840> he

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
out of enrichment before we do that he

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.060 
out of enrichment before we do that he
was<00:02:43.990> just<00:02:44.170> wrecking<00:02:44.650> everything<00:02:44.800> here<00:02:45.250> huh

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
was just wrecking everything here huh

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.260 
was just wrecking everything here huh
and<00:02:48.070> I'm<00:02:48.160> clearly<00:02:48.550> getting<00:02:48.670> sloppy<00:02:49.060> because

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
and I'm clearly getting sloppy because

00:02:49.270 --> 00:03:13.440 
and I'm clearly getting sloppy because
I've<00:02:49.450> taken<00:02:49.900> quite<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.260> bit<00:02:50.410> of<00:02:50.500> damage

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.390 

okay<00:03:14.080> so<00:03:14.140> at<00:03:14.319> this<00:03:14.440> point<00:03:17.010> premortal<00:03:18.010> has

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
okay so at this point premortal has

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.240 
okay so at this point premortal has
forced<00:03:18.910> to<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:19.239> something<00:03:19.750> in<00:03:19.870> Acts<00:03:20.019> mode<00:03:20.290> we

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.560 

okay<00:04:05.100> not<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.760> big<00:04:06.060> deal<00:04:07.490> but<00:04:08.490> we<00:04:08.640> will<00:04:08.850> we'll

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
okay not a big deal but we will we'll

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:19.220 
okay not a big deal but we will we'll
take<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:09.810> small<00:04:10.260> opportunity<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.930> sharpen<00:04:18.230> gang

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
take a small opportunity to sharpen gang

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.930 
take a small opportunity to sharpen gang
use<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.760> is<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.940> geometry<00:04:22.730> he's<00:04:23.730> just

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
use that is the geometry he's just

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:38.190 
use that is the geometry he's just
breaking<00:04:24.420> everything<00:04:24.930> here<00:04:25.170> huh

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.400 

he's<00:04:38.920> going<00:04:39.010> to<00:04:39.100> run<00:04:39.190> away<00:04:39.310> too<00:04:43.110> all<00:04:44.110> right<00:04:44.230> so

he's going to run away too all right so

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.540 
he's going to run away too all right so
I'm<00:04:44.440> just<00:04:44.620> going<00:04:44.740> to<00:04:44.800> wait<00:04:44.980> here<00:04:45.010> now<00:04:45.370> I<00:04:45.400> want

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
I'm just going to wait here now I want

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.160 
I'm just going to wait here now I want
to<00:04:45.610> see<00:04:45.700> if<00:04:45.760> he's<00:04:45.850> going<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.030> go<00:04:46.120> to<00:04:46.150> eight<00:04:46.390> or

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
to see if he's going to go to eight or

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:57.629 
to see if he's going to go to eight or
one

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.540 

number<00:04:58.389> one<00:04:58.509> makes<00:04:58.689> him<00:04:58.749> decide<00:04:59.199> and<00:05:00.009> maybe

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
number one makes him decide and maybe

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.159 
number one makes him decide and maybe
it's<00:05:00.759> a<00:05:00.819> function<00:05:01.120> of<00:05:01.270> how<00:05:01.539> much<00:05:01.689> damage<00:05:01.900> he's

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
it's a function of how much damage he's

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:12.399 
it's a function of how much damage he's
taken

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:14.169 

again<00:05:12.979> when<00:05:13.129> he's<00:05:13.249> exhausted<00:05:13.849> he's<00:05:13.969> going<00:05:14.119> to

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:14.179 
again when he's exhausted he's going to

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:16.179 
again when he's exhausted he's going to
get<00:05:14.599> his<00:05:14.749> head<00:05:14.989> and<00:05:15.169> that'll<00:05:15.439> make<00:05:15.469> it<00:05:15.889> for<00:05:16.099> an
