00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
think we just killed them I'll be too

think we just killed them I'll be too
much<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.500> just<00:00:20.100> end<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.430> fast<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.789> guess<00:00:21.230> why

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
much and just end it fast I guess why

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.200 
much and just end it fast I guess why
was<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:22.920> easy<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.460> kill<00:00:23.490> them<00:00:23.880> too<00:00:24.060> much

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
was it so easy to kill them too much

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.790 
was it so easy to kill them too much
because<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.810> just<00:00:24.930> felt<00:00:25.170> like<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.320> guys<00:00:25.529> were

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
because it just felt like you guys were

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.950 
because it just felt like you guys were
all<00:00:26.000> mechanically<00:00:27.000> just<00:00:27.359> out<00:00:27.510> playing<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
all mechanically just out playing the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.650 
all mechanically just out playing the
copenhagen<00:00:28.500> wolves<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.920> mean<00:00:29.640> apart<00:00:30.269> from<00:00:30.390> I

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
copenhagen wolves I mean apart from I

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.389 
copenhagen wolves I mean apart from I
don't<00:00:31.080> know<00:00:31.199> if<00:00:31.349> we<00:00:31.500> mechanically<00:00:32.070> outplayed

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
don't know if we mechanically outplayed

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.120 
don't know if we mechanically outplayed
them<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.579> think<00:00:32.790> we<00:00:32.850> just<00:00:33.140> like<00:00:34.140> took<00:00:34.800> trades

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
them I think we just like took trades

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.350 
them I think we just like took trades
are<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.340> better<00:00:35.489> times<00:00:35.760> because<00:00:36.030> i<00:00:36.149> think<00:00:36.300> i

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
are the better times because i think i

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.729 
are the better times because i think i
mislike<00:00:36.660> every<00:00:36.870> hook<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.140> game<00:00:37.350> but<00:00:37.559> it

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
mislike every hook this game but it

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.840 
mislike every hook this game but it
didn't<00:00:37.950> really<00:00:38.040> matter<00:00:38.309> at<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.640> end<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
didn't really matter at the end of the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.450 
didn't really matter at the end of the
day<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.030> thing<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.200> like<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:41.040> example<00:00:41.100> on

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
day so thing is just like for example on

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.979 
day so thing is just like for example on
both<00:00:41.610> didn't<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:41.910> traded<00:00:42.270> but<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:42.750> had<00:00:42.870> our

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
both didn't we traded but we had our

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.830 
both didn't we traded but we had our
jungler<00:00:43.230> close<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.850> forced<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.390> Morgana

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
jungler close so we forced the Morgana

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.450 
jungler close so we forced the Morgana
to<00:00:46.079> flash<00:00:46.320> out<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.920> river<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.190> our

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
to flash out to the river and our

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.220 
to flash out to the river and our
jungler<00:00:47.670> was<00:00:47.850> there<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.149> we<00:00:48.300> knew<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.660> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
jungler was there so we knew like the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.389 
jungler was there so we knew like the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
they thought they were to be doing that

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.990 
they thought they were to be doing that
they<00:00:52.379> weren't<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:53.460> things<00:00:53.910> like

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000
