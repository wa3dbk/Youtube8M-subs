00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
for around 65 to 70 dollars I can't tell

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.400 
for around 65 to 70 dollars I can't tell
you<00:00:29.760> how<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.060> compares<00:00:30.510> directly<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.200> those

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
you how it compares directly to those

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.319 
you how it compares directly to those
but<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:31.950> can't<00:00:32.250> tell<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.579> how<00:00:32.730> its<00:00:32.879> performed

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
but I can't tell you how its performed

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.959 
but I can't tell you how its performed
for<00:00:33.540> me<00:00:34.100> first<00:00:35.100> let's<00:00:35.370> look<00:00:35.550> at<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.820> design

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
for me first let's look at the design

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.299 
for me first let's look at the design
it's<00:00:36.719> made<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.079> durable<00:00:37.290> polyester<00:00:37.980> and

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
it's made of a durable polyester and

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.770 
it's made of a durable polyester and
clearly<00:00:38.850> designed<00:00:39.149> for<00:00:39.390> use<00:00:39.539> outdoors

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
clearly designed for use outdoors

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.930 
clearly designed for use outdoors
obviously<00:00:40.589> because<00:00:40.980> it's<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.339> solar<00:00:41.579> charger

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
obviously because it's a solar charger

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.329 
obviously because it's a solar charger
it<00:00:42.809> has<00:00:43.019> a<00:00:43.050> number<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.499> tags<00:00:43.769> around<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.219> edge

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
it has a number of tags around the edge

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.430 
it has a number of tags around the edge
so<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.640> can<00:00:44.999> hang<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.269> for<00:00:45.570> example<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.289> your

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
so you can hang it for example on your

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.459 
so you can hang it for example on your
backpack<00:00:47.030> it<00:00:48.030> opens<00:00:48.359> up<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.659> a<00:00:48.719> book<00:00:48.839> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
backpack it opens up like a book the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.020 
backpack it opens up like a book the
first<00:00:49.710> page<00:00:49.980> being<00:00:50.249> the<00:00:50.429> panels<00:00:50.820> themselves

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
first page being the panels themselves

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.020 
first page being the panels themselves
and<00:00:51.600> under<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.319> is<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.589> zip<00:00:53.039> pocket<00:00:53.069> for

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
and under that is a zip pocket for

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.970 
and under that is a zip pocket for
carrying<00:00:54.390> cables<00:00:54.899> or<00:00:55.350> where<00:00:55.589> you<00:00:55.679> can<00:00:55.800> even

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
carrying cables or where you can even

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.069 
carrying cables or where you can even
tuck<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.370> your<00:00:56.489> mobile<00:00:56.760> or<00:00:57.179> a<00:00:57.210> small<00:00:57.749> tablet

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
tuck in your mobile or a small tablet

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.369 
tuck in your mobile or a small tablet
during<00:00:58.530> charge<00:00:59.420> you<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.539> two<00:01:00.780> USB<00:01:01.350> ports

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
during charge you have two USB ports

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.889 
during charge you have two USB ports
here<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.069> a<00:01:02.399> red<00:01:02.699> light<00:01:02.999> will<00:01:03.300> glow<00:01:03.479> when<00:01:03.870> a

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
here and a red light will glow when a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.840 
here and a red light will glow when a
charge<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.409> available<00:01:04.949> then<00:01:05.100> there's<00:01:05.339> sun

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
charge is available then there's sun

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.930 
charge is available then there's sun
shining<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.830> it's<00:01:07.830> very<00:01:08.040> lightweight<00:01:08.280> easy

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
shining on it it's very lightweight easy

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.670 
shining on it it's very lightweight easy
to<00:01:09.150> take<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.659> your<00:01:09.780> travels<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.440> that's

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
to take on your travels and that's

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.929 
to take on your travels and that's
mainly<00:01:10.890> because<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.399> doesn't<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:11.850> an

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
mainly because it doesn't have an

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.609 
mainly because it doesn't have an
internal<00:01:12.270> battery<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.840> its<00:01:12.990> own<00:01:13.170> only<00:01:13.590> a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
voltage regulator which gives a constant

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
5 volts the maximum output is 2 amps
