drop pieces our background pieces these
ones<00:06:33.370> here<00:06:33.580> Adam<00:06:33.910> built<00:06:34.120> me<00:06:34.300> little<00:06:34.690> frames<00:06:35.020> so

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:35.289 
ones here Adam built me little frames so

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:36.540 
ones here Adam built me little frames so
they're<00:06:35.440> wooden<00:06:35.620> frames<00:06:36.010> and<00:06:36.250> then<00:06:36.310> it's<00:06:36.460> just

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
they're wooden frames and then it's just

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.279 
they're wooden frames and then it's just
fabric<00:06:37.120> the<00:06:37.270> fabrics<00:06:37.630> I<00:06:37.750> use<00:06:37.900> quite<00:06:38.140> a<00:06:38.200> bit

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:38.289 
fabric the fabrics I use quite a bit

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:40.510 
fabric the fabrics I use quite a bit
stretch<00:06:39.010> over<00:06:39.310> these<00:06:39.460> frames<00:06:39.820> I

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
stretch over these frames I

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.070 
stretch over these frames I
is<00:06:40.580> quite<00:06:40.789> a<00:06:40.849> bit<00:06:41.060> of<00:06:41.180> just<00:06:41.389> fabrics<00:06:41.840> for

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
is quite a bit of just fabrics for

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.749 
is quite a bit of just fabrics for
backgrounds<00:06:42.650> as<00:06:42.830> well<00:06:42.889> as<00:06:43.129> our<00:06:43.490> vinyl

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 
backgrounds as well as our vinyl

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:45.730 
backgrounds as well as our vinyl
backgrounds<00:06:44.389> and<00:06:44.509> so<00:06:44.930> this<00:06:45.110> way<00:06:45.259> I<00:06:45.289> don't<00:06:45.470> have

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
backgrounds and so this way I don't have

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.290 
backgrounds and so this way I don't have
to<00:06:45.830> worry<00:06:46.009> about<00:06:46.129> the<00:06:46.370> wrinkles<00:06:46.759> in<00:06:46.940> them<00:06:47.060> and

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
to worry about the wrinkles in them and

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.260 
to worry about the wrinkles in them and
these<00:06:47.360> are<00:06:47.419> more<00:06:48.080> on<00:06:48.289> our<00:06:48.889> more<00:06:49.280> popular<00:06:49.460> used

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
these are more on our more popular used

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.480 
these are more on our more popular used
ones<00:06:50.599> so<00:06:50.780> I<00:06:50.810> have<00:06:51.050> these<00:06:51.229> all<00:06:51.440> ins<00:06:51.650> on<00:06:51.949> frames

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
ones so I have these all ins on frames

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.920 
ones so I have these all ins on frames
here<00:06:52.789> and<00:06:52.879> let's<00:06:53.000> see<00:06:53.150> let<00:06:53.389> me<00:06:53.419> pull<00:06:53.659> out<00:06:53.720> one

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
here and let's see let me pull out one

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.020 
here and let's see let me pull out one
that<00:06:54.020> doesn't<00:06:54.259> have<00:06:54.470> a<00:06:54.500> back<00:06:54.710> on<00:06:54.919> it<00:06:54.979> can<00:06:55.909> you

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
that doesn't have a back on it can you

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.180 
that doesn't have a back on it can you
see<00:06:56.210> that<00:06:56.360> there<00:06:56.599> it's<00:06:57.139> just<00:06:57.500> literally<00:06:57.860> a

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190 
see that there it's just literally a

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.790 
see that there it's just literally a
frame<00:06:58.639> that<00:06:58.669> Adam<00:06:59.210> built<00:06:59.419> and<00:06:59.720> then<00:07:00.379> I<00:07:00.470> stretch

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
frame that Adam built and then I stretch

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.420 
frame that Adam built and then I stretch
the<00:07:01.069> fabric<00:07:01.250> and<00:07:01.669> stapled<00:07:02.180> it<00:07:02.300> over<00:07:02.569> there<00:07:02.750> and

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
the fabric and stapled it over there and

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.089 
the fabric and stapled it over there and
then<00:07:04.430> we<00:07:04.550> have<00:07:04.729> some<00:07:05.030> bigger<00:07:05.770> bigger<00:07:06.770> wood

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:07.099 
then we have some bigger bigger wood

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:09.629 
then we have some bigger bigger wood
panel<00:07:07.789> pieces<00:07:08.030> that<00:07:08.449> we<00:07:08.569> use<00:07:08.720> for<00:07:09.020> floor<00:07:09.289> drops

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:09.639 
panel pieces that we use for floor drops

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:12.850 
panel pieces that we use for floor drops
back<00:07:10.639> there<00:07:10.909> too<00:07:11.150> a<00:07:11.449> big<00:07:12.169> thing<00:07:12.379> about<00:07:12.409> this

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:12.860 
back there too a big thing about this

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.370 
back there too a big thing about this
studio<00:07:13.310> is<00:07:13.550> the<00:07:13.819> great<00:07:14.150> light<00:07:14.509> reflects<00:07:15.169> off

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380 
studio is the great light reflects off

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.210 
studio is the great light reflects off
of<00:07:15.620> our<00:07:15.800> tin<00:07:16.190> roof<00:07:17.139> tin<00:07:18.139> ceiling<00:07:18.560> it's<00:07:18.860> it's<00:07:19.099> a

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.220 
of our tin roof tin ceiling it's it's a

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.490 
of our tin roof tin ceiling it's it's a
tin<00:07:19.460> roof<00:07:19.669> that<00:07:20.479> we<00:07:20.630> just<00:07:20.810> put<00:07:21.050> up<00:07:21.169> as<00:07:21.349> our

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:21.500 
tin roof that we just put up as our

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.350 
tin roof that we just put up as our
ceiling<00:07:21.919> and<00:07:22.069> so<00:07:22.490> when<00:07:22.610> the<00:07:22.699> light<00:07:22.880> comes<00:07:23.150> in

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 
ceiling and so when the light comes in

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.790 
ceiling and so when the light comes in
not<00:07:23.539> only<00:07:23.569> does<00:07:23.960> it<00:07:24.080> bounce<00:07:24.199> off<00:07:24.470> our<00:07:24.650> white

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 
not only does it bounce off our white

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.040 
not only does it bounce off our white
floors<00:07:25.159> but<00:07:25.699> it<00:07:25.849> bounces<00:07:26.240> off<00:07:26.389> the<00:07:26.630> ceiling

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.050 
floors but it bounces off the ceiling

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.170 
floors but it bounces off the ceiling
and<00:07:27.229> so<00:07:27.380> we<00:07:27.500> get<00:07:27.650> great<00:07:28.130> natural<00:07:28.849> light<00:07:29.030> in

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.180 
and so we get great natural light in

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.450
