people<00:00:12.330> sometimes<00:00:12.719> get<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.990> little<00:00:13.049> bit

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
people sometimes get a little bit

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.860 
people sometimes get a little bit
confused<00:00:13.830> about<00:00:13.980> why<00:00:14.759> we<00:00:15.150> don't<00:00:15.360> especially

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
confused about why we don't especially

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.870 
confused about why we don't especially
man<00:00:16.230> we're<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.440> purge<00:00:16.830> snorkel<00:00:17.400> now<00:00:17.580> purge

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
man we're a purge snorkel now purge

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.460 
man we're a purge snorkel now purge
snorkel<00:00:18.390> has<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> little<00:00:18.900> bell<00:00:19.109> up<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.380> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
snorkel has a little bell up in the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.710 
snorkel has a little bell up in the
bottom<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.430> when<00:00:20.640> you've<00:00:20.760> got<00:00:20.939> water<00:00:21.240> inside

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
bottom so when you've got water inside

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.810 
bottom so when you've got water inside
your<00:00:21.960> snorkel<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.560> makes<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.920> easier<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.400> clear

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
your snorkel it makes it easier to clear

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.240 
your snorkel it makes it easier to clear
so<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.480> blow<00:00:24.779> out<00:00:24.810> your<00:00:25.019> snorkel<00:00:25.500> some<00:00:26.010> water

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
so you blow out your snorkel some water

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.040 
so you blow out your snorkel some water
comes<00:00:26.519> through<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.880> top<00:00:27.090> some<00:00:27.539> comes<00:00:27.810> through

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
comes through the top some comes through

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.179 
comes through the top some comes through
this<00:00:28.199> valve<00:00:28.529> at<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.769> bottom

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
this valve at the bottom

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.049 
this valve at the bottom
the<00:00:29.880> reason<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.359> don't<00:00:30.570> like<00:00:30.900> wearing<00:00:31.349> these

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
the reason we don't like wearing these

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.729 
the reason we don't like wearing these
we-we're<00:00:33.059> just<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.390> plain<00:00:33.750> j-type<00:00:34.230> snorkel

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
we-we're just a plain j-type snorkel

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.190 
we-we're just a plain j-type snorkel
does<00:00:35.160> when<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.520> ear<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.300> water<00:00:36.630> blows<00:00:36.989> out

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
does when the ear in water blows out

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.290 
does when the ear in water blows out
underwater<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.040> makes<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.399> loud<00:00:38.579> noise<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.180> if

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
underwater it makes a loud noise and if

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.940 
underwater it makes a loud noise and if
there's<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.540> big<00:00:39.719> snapper<00:00:39.989> 20<00:00:40.230> meters<00:00:40.649> from<00:00:40.680> you

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
there's a big snapper 20 meters from you

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.889 
there's a big snapper 20 meters from you
you<00:00:41.129> haven't<00:00:41.460> seen<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.760> yet<00:00:41.910> he<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:42.690> hear

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
you haven't seen it yet he can hear

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.590 
you haven't seen it yet he can hear
there<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.649> hits<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.579> just<00:00:44.820> tend<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.180> go<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.539> a

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
there so hits we just tend to go for a

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.020 
there so hits we just tend to go for a
plane<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> j-type<00:00:46.590> snorkel<00:00:47.100> but<00:00:47.489> when<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.760> blow

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
plane a j-type snorkel but when you blow

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.670 
plane a j-type snorkel but when you blow
out<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.539> water<00:00:48.690> flows<00:00:49.020> out<00:00:49.320> through

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
out of it the water flows out through

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.970 
out of it the water flows out through
the<00:00:50.039> top<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.840> lands<00:00:51.840> on<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.199> surface<00:00:52.559> beside

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
the top and lands on the surface beside

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.430 
the top and lands on the surface beside
you<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.940> also<00:00:54.390> quite<00:00:54.750> like<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> bendy

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
you but I also quite like a bendy

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.950 
you but I also quite like a bendy
snorkel<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.070> when<00:00:56.190> you're<00:00:56.309> swimming<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.960> under

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
snorkel so when you're swimming in under

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.590 
snorkel so when you're swimming in under
a<00:00:57.989> rock<00:00:58.230> or<00:00:58.559> through<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.250> kelp<00:00:59.460> it<00:01:00.210> doesn't

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
a rock or through the kelp it doesn't

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.510 
a rock or through the kelp it doesn't
follow<00:01:00.719> follow<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> mascot<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.190> see<00:01:02.370> how

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
follow follow the a mascot to see how

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.729 
follow follow the a mascot to see how
the<00:01:02.579> snorkel<00:01:03.030> beans<00:01:03.239> if<00:01:03.600> you're<00:01:04.229> not<00:01:04.409> enter

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
the snorkel beans if you're not enter

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.160 
the snorkel beans if you're not enter
being<00:01:04.949> these<00:01:05.070> snorkel<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.670> want<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.880> basic

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
being these snorkel so you want a basic

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.080 
being these snorkel so you want a basic
5j<00:01:07.170> type<00:01:07.470> we<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.040> those<00:01:08.400> as<00:01:08.610> well

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
5j type we have those as well

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.450 
5j type we have those as well
so<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.530> more<00:01:10.680> for<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.920> person<00:01:11.100> that's

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
so this is more for the person that's

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.219 
so this is more for the person that's
not<00:01:11.760> doing<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.210> lot<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.659> dive<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.170> there

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
not doing a lot of we dive in there

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.810 
not doing a lot of we dive in there
under<00:01:13.470> rocks<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.920> things<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.250> wants<00:01:14.640> a

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
under rocks and things like that wants a

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.480 
under rocks and things like that wants a
good<00:01:15.060> step<00:01:15.930> snorkel<00:01:16.409> go<00:01:16.920> for<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.220> sort<00:01:17.460> of

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
good step snorkel go for that sort of

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.480 
good step snorkel go for that sort of
thing<00:01:17.549> but<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.659> downside<00:01:18.900> talk<00:01:19.470> ND<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.009> if

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
thing but the downside talk ND is if

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.609 
thing but the downside talk ND is if
you're<00:01:20.790> swimming<00:01:21.119> very<00:01:21.420> fast<00:01:21.750> coming<00:01:22.200> up<00:01:22.409> or

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
you're swimming very fast coming up or

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.320 
you're swimming very fast coming up or
along<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.950> surface<00:01:23.310> sometimes<00:01:23.850> they'll

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
along the surface sometimes they'll

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.109 
along the surface sometimes they'll
they'll<00:01:24.869> move<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.290> little<00:01:25.439> bit<00:01:25.970> to<00:01:26.970> compensate

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
they'll move a little bit to compensate

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.420 
they'll move a little bit to compensate
fit<00:01:27.810> we've<00:01:28.110> got<00:01:28.320> some<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.740> are<00:01:28.799> sort<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.130> semi

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
fit we've got some that are sort of semi

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.830 
fit we've got some that are sort of semi
rigid<00:01:29.670> they've<00:01:30.000> all<00:01:30.119> been<00:01:30.329> but<00:01:30.509> they're<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> bit

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
rigid they've all been but they're a bit

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.020 
rigid they've all been but they're a bit
harder<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.229> bend<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.100> there's<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.549> small<00:01:32.820> point

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
harder to bend so there's a small point

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.510 
harder to bend so there's a small point
in<00:01:33.210> between<00:01:33.329> we've<00:01:33.840> got<00:01:34.049> we've<00:01:34.860> got<00:01:34.890> two<00:01:35.250> types

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
in between we've got we've got two types

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.240 
in between we've got we've got two types
so<00:01:35.880> we've<00:01:36.030> got<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.360> over<00:01:36.780> as<00:01:37.140> well<00:01:37.409> that's<00:01:38.100> a

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
so we've got the over as well that's a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.020 
so we've got the over as well that's a
semi-rigid

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
semi-rigid

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.940 
semi-rigid
so<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> good<00:01:39.720> j-type<00:01:40.049> snorkel<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.619> what<00:01:40.799> you're

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
so a good j-type snorkel is what you're

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.830 
so a good j-type snorkel is what you're
after<00:01:41.100> some<00:01:41.850> people<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.180> got<00:01:42.329> quite<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> wide

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
after some people have got quite a wide

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.149 
after some people have got quite a wide
mouth<00:01:43.110> look<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.619> one<00:01:43.740> with<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.979> bigger

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
mouth look for the one with the bigger

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.969 
mouth look for the one with the bigger
mouthpiece<00:01:44.670> or<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.110> go<00:01:46.259> for<00:01:46.290> say<00:01:46.740> our

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
mouthpiece or you can go for say our

personal war a teenage approve smoking
I<00:01:57.280> tend<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:57.820> think<00:01:58.509> a<00:01:58.689> personal<00:01:59.229> calls<00:01:59.409> are

for teenagers that haven't done a lot of
smoking<00:02:03.759> it<00:02:04.060> just<00:02:04.270> makes<00:02:04.450> it<00:02:04.570> much<00:02:04.750> easier<00:02:04.810> for

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
smoking it just makes it much easier for

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.230

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
bit better you know sometimes we say

people<00:02:11.980> their<00:02:12.340> massive<00:02:12.760> sleeker<00:02:13.030> but<00:02:13.269> even

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
people their massive sleeker but even

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.970 
people their massive sleeker but even
after<00:02:13.840> they've<00:02:13.989> tried<00:02:14.140> them<00:02:14.410> on<00:02:14.500> on<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.739> shop

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
after they've tried them on on the shop

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.009 
after they've tried them on on the shop
and<00:02:15.190> what<00:02:15.310> happens<00:02:15.610> is<00:02:15.790> if<00:02:16.209> you<00:02:16.330> get<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.540> snorkel

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
and what happens is if you get a snorkel

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.600 
and what happens is if you get a snorkel
that's<00:02:17.140> got<00:02:17.319> too<00:02:17.470> big<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:17.769> the<00:02:17.860> other<00:02:17.950> piece<00:02:18.160> it

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
that's got too big in the other piece it

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.220 
that's got too big in the other piece it
tends<00:02:18.819> to<00:02:18.940> make<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.360> amount<00:02:19.569> move<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.110> your

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
tends to make the amount move in your

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.680 
tends to make the amount move in your
small<00:02:20.500> lines<00:02:20.860> open<00:02:21.280> up<00:02:21.430> which<00:02:22.269> means<00:02:22.480> that

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
small lines open up which means that

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.059 
small lines open up which means that
allows<00:02:22.959> water<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.410> get<00:02:23.650> in<00:02:23.799> that<00:02:23.920> up

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
allows water to get in that up

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.930 
allows water to get in that up
underneath<00:02:24.370> here<00:02:24.760> so<00:02:26.430> check<00:02:27.430> on<00:02:27.549> your<00:02:27.700> snorkel
