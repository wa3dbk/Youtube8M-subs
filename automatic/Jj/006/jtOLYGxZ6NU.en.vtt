00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.560
 Because I am here? What should I do? 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.300
 No, I can not remember anything ... 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.920
 Some time ago, I was lost in the eternal labyrinth. 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.720
 The Cherry tree that is never covered by its flowers 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.480
 You can know my reason for being. 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.590
 I'm going to ask who I am. 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.810
 "Inochi no aufheben" is the hardest question for me. 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.460
 "Kokoro no synthese" is what I've been looking for for some time. 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.660
 Please tell me! Please tell me the limit of my life! 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.870
 Is not easy! It is not easy to know who I am! 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.150
 Please give it to me! Please put order in my life! 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.730
 I just want to know who I am at this moment. 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.900
 I'm alone, without any friends. 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.530
 Then I just want to find my sweet friend. 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.230
 It is impossible? I do not know. I just want a friend. 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.620
 Will the girl who will be my friend be under the Tree? 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.730
 The one that will tell me my reason for being? 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.810
 I'm going to see her right away. 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.100
 "Inochi no aufheben" is the hardest question for me. 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.750
 "Kokoro no synthese" is what I've been looking for for some time. 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.000
 Please tell me! Please tell me the limit of my life! 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.270
 Is not easy! It is not easy to know who I am! 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.560
 Please give it to me! Please put order in my life! 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.130
 Every spring you can give my life order. 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.580
 Hakanage, Ayashige, the cherry blossoms have spoken to me. 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.810
 Kanashige, Setsunage, the true fairy tale. 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.820
 Yukashige, Monoge, at the limit of my life. 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.680
 Kanashige, Setsunage, the real thing in my life. 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.890
 Please tell me! Please tell me the limit of my life! 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.180
 Is not easy! It is not easy to know who I am! 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.490
 Please give it to me! Please put order in my life! 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.480
 I just want to know who I am at this moment. 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.480
 The Cherry Tree knows the truth, the limit of my life.
