upgraded<00:01:27.900> stainless<00:01:28.680> steel<00:01:29.040> exhaust<00:01:29.189> system

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
upgraded stainless steel exhaust system

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.520 
upgraded stainless steel exhaust system
with<00:01:30.530> a<00:01:31.530> race<00:01:32.570> catalytic<00:01:33.570> converter<00:01:33.990> as<00:01:34.259> well

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
with a race catalytic converter as well

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.450 
with a race catalytic converter as well
a<00:01:35.159> hard<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.079> extra<00:01:37.079> high<00:01:37.619> performance<00:01:38.189> clutch

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
a hard and extra high performance clutch

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.560 
a hard and extra high performance clutch
and<00:01:39.290> I<00:01:40.290> guess<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.220> would<00:01:41.340> be<00:01:41.520> quite<00:01:41.909> okay<00:01:42.240> for

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
and I guess that would be quite okay for

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.719 
and I guess that would be quite okay for
matching<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.890> performance<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.490> we

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
matching the the performance that we

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.030 
matching the the performance that we
will<00:01:44.880> get<00:01:45.360> into<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.689> car<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:47.210> as<00:01:48.210> you've<00:01:48.450> seen

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
will get into the car so as you've seen

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.920 
will get into the car so as you've seen
previously<00:01:50.040> on<00:01:50.340> solves<00:01:50.850> United<00:01:51.299> how<00:01:51.509> easy<00:01:51.869> it

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
previously on solves United how easy it

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.920 
previously on solves United how easy it
is<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.079> do<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:53.579> as<00:01:53.880> easy<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.630> even<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
is to do this it's as easy so even the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.810 
is to do this it's as easy so even the
manager<00:01:55.350> here<00:01:55.560> Frederick<00:01:55.890> yet<00:01:56.159> map<00:01:56.369> tune<00:01:56.610> can

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
manager here Frederick yet map tune can

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.609 
manager here Frederick yet map tune can
do<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.619> connected<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.130> underneath<00:01:59.610> the

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
do it so you connected it underneath the

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:08.119 
do it so you connected it underneath the
steering<00:02:01.619> column<00:02:01.890> here<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:05.479> its<00:02:06.479> ass<00:02:07.129> backing

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
steering column here so its ass backing

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.639 
steering column here so its ass backing
up<00:02:08.220> vehicle<00:02:08.840> press<00:02:09.840> any<00:02:10.020> key<00:02:10.110> that's<00:02:10.530> all

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
up vehicle press any key that's all

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.320 
up vehicle press any key that's all
right<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:11.280> backup<00:02:11.670> will<00:02:11.849> actually<00:02:12.150> take

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
right the backup will actually take

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.390 
right the backup will actually take
about<00:02:12.629> three

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
about three

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.759 
about three
it's<00:02:13.579> okay<00:02:14.299> so<00:02:15.159> while<00:02:16.159> we<00:02:16.310> are<00:02:16.430> waiting<00:02:17.470> we<00:02:18.470> am

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
it's okay so while we are waiting we am
