leaving XV color on just leave it on and
it<00:01:05.339> makes<00:01:05.549> no<00:01:05.760> difference<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.330> what<00:01:06.570> your

this does is it allows us to fade the

this does is it allows us to fade the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.179 
up or fades down to black or two white
and<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:24.479> change<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.900> color<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.439> lot<00:01:26.009> of

and we can change this color a lot of

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.580 
and we can change this color a lot of
the<00:01:26.360> sport<00:01:27.360> photographers<00:01:27.869> out<00:01:27.990> there<00:01:28.020> really

the sport photographers out there really

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.380 
the sport photographers out there really
love<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.250> particular<00:01:29.729> feature<00:01:29.909> because<00:01:30.150> it

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
love this particular feature because it

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.730 
love this particular feature because it
allows<00:01:30.570> them<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.780> create<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> transitional

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
allows them to create a transitional

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.590 
allows them to create a transitional
point<00:01:31.890> from<00:01:32.130> one<00:01:32.340> shot<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.610> another<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.509> in

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
point from one shot to another so in

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.120

these<00:01:39.509> different<00:01:39.900> modes<00:01:40.079> I'm<00:01:40.320> not<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> fan<00:01:40.979> of

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
these different modes I'm not a fan of

these different modes I'm not a fan of
using<00:01:41.579> these<00:01:41.790> transitional<00:01:42.390> pieces<00:01:42.630> or<00:01:42.869> these

using these transitional pieces or these
transitional<00:01:43.439> modes<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:43.770> some<00:01:43.979> folks<00:01:44.130> really

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
transitional modes but some folks really

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.600 
transitional modes but some folks really
love<00:01:44.939> them<00:01:48.079> next<00:01:49.079> our<00:01:49.229> digital<00:01:49.590> effects<00:01:49.920> okay

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610

effects<00:02:31.470> are<00:02:31.680> exactly<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.250> same<00:02:32.459> thing<00:02:32.700> as<00:02:32.820> we

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
effects are exactly the same thing as we

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.160 
effects are exactly the same thing as we
have<00:02:33.060> with<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.270> digital<00:02:33.420> effects<00:02:33.870> but<00:02:34.080> they

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
have with the digital effects but they

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.780 
have with the digital effects but they
apply<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.470> still<00:02:34.860> images<00:02:35.190> as<00:02:35.340> opposed<00:02:35.640> to

apply to still images as opposed to

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.760 
apply to still images as opposed to
applying<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.209> motion<00:02:36.540> images<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.440> we've<00:02:37.590> got

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
applying to motion images so we've got

people are interested in what this does
it<00:02:54.060> allows<00:02:54.090> us<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.660> take<00:02:54.840> very<00:02:55.590> smooth<00:02:56.250> very

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
it allows us to take very smooth very

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.090 
it allows us to take very smooth very

there's<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.880> caveat<00:03:00.390> now<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.230> can<00:03:01.380> see<00:03:01.590> here

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
there's a caveat now you can see here

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.380 
there's a caveat now you can see here
what<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.160> smooth<00:03:02.400> slow<00:03:02.580> record<00:03:02.970> looks<00:03:03.209> like

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
what the smooth slow record looks like

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.940 
what the smooth slow record looks like
it's<00:03:03.630> very<00:03:03.780> smooth<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.260> very<00:03:04.410> slow<00:03:04.739> but

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
it's very smooth and very slow but

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.560 
it's very smooth and very slow but
you'll<00:03:05.040> notice<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.400> looks<00:03:05.610> just<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.209> little<00:03:06.390> bit

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
you'll notice it looks just a little bit

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.630 
you'll notice it looks just a little bit
grainy<00:03:06.810> or<00:03:06.989> maybe<00:03:07.739> not<00:03:07.980> quite<00:03:08.190> as<00:03:08.250> pretty

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
grainy or maybe not quite as pretty

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.310 
grainy or maybe not quite as pretty
that's<00:03:09.300> because<00:03:09.600> when<00:03:09.750> we're<00:03:09.900> using<00:03:10.110> the

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
that's because when we're using the

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.110 
that's because when we're using the
smooth<00:03:10.590> slow<00:03:10.860> record<00:03:11.310> mode<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:12.000> actually

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
smooth slow record mode it actually

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.210 
smooth slow record mode it actually
drops<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.840> resolution<00:03:13.470> of<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.650> camcorder

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
drops the resolution of the camcorder

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.610 
drops the resolution of the camcorder
now<00:03:14.730> we<00:03:14.790> can<00:03:15.000> record<00:03:15.300> smooth<00:03:15.660> slow<00:03:15.959> for<00:03:16.320> three

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
now we can record smooth slow for three

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.550 
now we can record smooth slow for three
seconds<00:03:17.040> six<00:03:17.700> seconds<00:03:18.090> or<00:03:18.269> 12<00:03:18.840> seconds<00:03:19.410> as

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
seconds six seconds or 12 seconds as

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.530 
seconds six seconds or 12 seconds as
we're<00:03:20.130> working<00:03:20.250> with<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.580> camcorder<00:03:21.090> but

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
we're working with the camcorder but

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.910 
we're working with the camcorder but
bear<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:21.750> mind<00:03:21.840> that<00:03:22.170> we're<00:03:22.350> going<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.709> lose

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
bear in mind that we're going to lose

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.570 
bear in mind that we're going to lose
some<00:03:23.100> of<00:03:23.160> our<00:03:23.370> resolution<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:25.019> choose<00:03:25.350> ok<00:03:25.680> this

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
some of our resolution so choose ok this

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.490 
some of our resolution so choose ok this
opens<00:03:26.910> it<00:03:26.970> up<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.150> we<00:03:27.299> can<00:03:27.450> see<00:03:27.720> in<00:03:27.930> this<00:03:28.170> upper

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
opens it up and we can see in this upper

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.650 
opens it up and we can see in this upper
right<00:03:28.709> hand<00:03:28.860> corner<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.340> small<00:03:29.610> golfer<00:03:30.120> this

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
right hand corner the small golfer this

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.120 
right hand corner the small golfer this
is<00:03:30.780> telling<00:03:31.080> us<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.290> we're<00:03:31.440> in<00:03:31.530> smooth<00:03:31.860> slow

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
is telling us that we're in smooth slow

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.810 
is telling us that we're in smooth slow
record<00:03:32.700> mode<00:03:32.940> so<00:03:33.750> let's<00:03:34.080> hit<00:03:34.530> set<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.190> this

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
record mode so let's hit set and this

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.190 
record mode so let's hit set and this
allows<00:03:36.120> us<00:03:36.299> to<00:03:36.480> determine<00:03:36.720> whether<00:03:36.930> we're

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
allows us to determine whether we're

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.810 
allows us to determine whether we're
going<00:03:37.350> to<00:03:37.410> record<00:03:37.830> sound<00:03:38.130> with<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.580> smooth

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
going to record sound with the smooth

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.360 
going to record sound with the smooth
slow<00:03:39.000> record<00:03:39.360> or<00:03:39.570> not<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.860> allows<00:03:41.040> us<00:03:41.250> to

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
slow record or not and it allows us to

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.830 
slow record or not and it allows us to
adjust<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.760> timing<00:03:42.090> so<00:03:42.239> let's<00:03:42.450> start<00:03:42.720> with

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
adjust the timing so let's start with

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.319 
adjust the timing so let's start with
the<00:03:42.930> timing<00:03:43.320> ok<00:03:44.040> we<00:03:44.280> can<00:03:44.459> set<00:03:44.670> this<00:03:44.820> up<00:03:45.030> so<00:03:45.090> that

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
the timing ok we can set this up so that

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.780 
the timing ok we can set this up so that
it<00:03:45.390> records<00:03:45.630> for<00:03:45.930> three<00:03:46.200> seconds<00:03:46.650> after<00:03:47.160> we

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
it records for three seconds after we

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.759 
it records for three seconds after we
press<00:03:48.060> start<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.810> stop<00:03:49.079> or<00:03:49.380> for<00:03:49.560> three

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
press start and stop or for three

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.330 
press start and stop or for three
seconds<00:03:50.160> before<00:03:50.370> we<00:03:51.329> press<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.959> start/stop

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
seconds before we press the start/stop

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.220 
seconds before we press the start/stop
we'll<00:03:53.340> hit<00:03:53.519> three<00:03:53.760> seconds<00:03:54.180> before<00:03:54.329> and<00:03:54.959> you

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
we'll hit three seconds before and you

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.979 
we'll hit three seconds before and you
notice<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.680> golfer<00:03:56.160> has<00:03:56.400> now<00:03:56.640> moved<00:03:56.989> to

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
notice that the golfer has now moved to

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.840 
notice that the golfer has now moved to
the<00:03:58.110> very<00:03:58.320> end<00:03:58.560> of<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.709> timeline<00:03:59.010> so<00:03:59.700> what

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
the very end of the timeline so what

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.120 
the very end of the timeline so what
this<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.060> telling<00:04:00.420> us<00:04:01.019> is<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.290> when<00:04:01.709> we<00:04:01.829> press

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
this is telling us is that when we press

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.729 
this is telling us is that when we press
the<00:04:02.340> smooth<00:04:03.060> slow<00:04:03.209> record<00:04:03.600> button<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.079> then

the smooth slow record button and then
we<00:04:04.890> press<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.280> record<00:04:05.459> button<00:04:05.730> it's<00:04:06.450> going<00:04:06.570> to

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
we press the record button it's going to

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.860 
we press the record button it's going to
record<00:04:07.320> for<00:04:07.709> three<00:04:07.950> seconds<00:04:08.430> until<00:04:08.670> we<00:04:09.299> press

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
record for three seconds until we press

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.140

the<00:04:10.140> start/stop<00:04:10.470> button<00:04:10.730> in<00:04:11.730> other<00:04:11.970> words

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
the start/stop button in other words

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.250 
the start/stop button in other words
what<00:04:12.299> that<00:04:12.450> means<00:04:12.630> is<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.810> camera<00:04:13.170> is

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
what that means is the camera is

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.380 
what that means is the camera is
constantly<00:04:13.860> buffering<00:04:14.519> up<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:15.150> information

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
constantly buffering up the information

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.449 
constantly buffering up the information
that's<00:04:15.840> coming<00:04:16.079> to<00:04:16.229> it<00:04:16.560> when<00:04:16.739> we<00:04:16.890> turn<00:04:17.130> on<00:04:17.280> the

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
that's coming to it when we turn on the

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.120 
that's coming to it when we turn on the
smooth<00:04:17.729> slow<00:04:17.910> record<00:04:18.329> and<00:04:18.540> it<00:04:19.380> does<00:04:19.829> that<00:04:19.859> by

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
smooth slow record and it does that by

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.650 
smooth slow record and it does that by
using<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.790> internal<00:04:21.120> memory<00:04:21.479> in<00:04:21.570> the

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
using the internal memory in the

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.050 
using the internal memory in the
camcorder<00:04:22.260> but<00:04:22.860> we<00:04:23.340> also<00:04:23.520> need<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:23.820> remember

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
camcorder but we also need to remember

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.390 
camcorder but we also need to remember
that<00:04:24.240> it's<00:04:24.510> at<00:04:24.660> a<00:04:24.900> quarter<00:04:25.380> or<00:04:25.590> a<00:04:25.620> half<00:04:25.770> Frizzle

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
that it's at a quarter or a half Frizzle

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.740 
that it's at a quarter or a half Frizzle
depending<00:04:26.940> on<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.120> mode<00:04:27.270> that<00:04:27.330> we're<00:04:27.600> working

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
depending on the mode that we're working

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.960 
depending on the mode that we're working
in<00:04:28.139> so<00:04:28.710> be<00:04:28.860> aware<00:04:29.130> of<00:04:29.190> that<00:04:29.310> that<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:29.699> picture

in so be aware of that that the picture
is<00:04:30.000> not<00:04:30.090> going<00:04:30.660> to<00:04:30.720> be<00:04:30.900> real<00:04:31.110> pretty<00:04:31.380> my<00:04:32.130> own

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
is not going to be real pretty my own

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.610 
is not going to be real pretty my own
opinion<00:04:32.850> is<00:04:32.970> that<00:04:33.060> generally<00:04:34.020> you're<00:04:34.380> better

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
opinion is that generally you're better

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.389 
opinion is that generally you're better
