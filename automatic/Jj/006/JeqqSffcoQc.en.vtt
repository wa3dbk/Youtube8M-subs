wax<00:01:10.740> for<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> most<00:01:11.700> part<00:01:11.939> as<00:01:12.119> far<00:01:12.299> as<00:01:12.390> photo

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
wax for the most part as far as photo

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.230 
wax for the most part as far as photo
printing<00:01:13.229> goes<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:14.070> entirely<00:01:14.490> about<00:01:14.850> inkjet

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
printing goes it's entirely about inkjet

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.390 
printing goes it's entirely about inkjet
these<00:01:15.420> days<00:01:15.659> those<00:01:16.380> other<00:01:16.710> technologies<00:01:16.920> like

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
these days those other technologies like

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.340 
these days those other technologies like
thermal<00:01:17.640> wax<00:01:17.939> where<00:01:18.390> those<00:01:18.990> were<00:01:19.110> printers

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
thermal wax where those were printers

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.780 
thermal wax where those were printers
that<00:01:19.439> actually<00:01:19.740> had<00:01:19.890> kind<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.250> like<00:01:20.369> crayons

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
that actually had kind of like crayons

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.340 
that actually had kind of like crayons
in<00:01:21.060> them<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.360> were<00:01:21.479> melted<00:01:21.869> onto<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.170> page

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
in them that were melted onto the page

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.440 
in them that were melted onto the page
most<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.310> has<00:01:23.400> gone<00:01:23.520> away<00:01:23.670> dye

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
most of that has gone away dye

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.570 
most of that has gone away dye
sublimation<00:01:24.750> or<00:01:25.320> dye<00:01:25.530> sub<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.100> still<00:01:26.340> around

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
sublimation or dye sub is still around

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.280 
sublimation or dye sub is still around
and<00:01:26.790> one<00:01:26.970> nice<00:01:27.119> thing<00:01:27.150> about<00:01:27.360> dye<00:01:27.689> sub<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.140> it

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
and one nice thing about dye sub is it

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.530 
and one nice thing about dye sub is it
gives<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.740> truly<00:01:29.280> continuous<00:01:29.729> tone<00:01:30.210> print

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
gives you a truly continuous tone print

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.730 
gives you a truly continuous tone print
like<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.840> get<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.110> darkroom<00:01:31.409> it's<00:01:31.590> not<00:01:31.710> a

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
like you get in the darkroom it's not a

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.140 
like you get in the darkroom it's not a
bunch<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.009> dots<00:01:32.220> or<00:01:32.490> anything<00:01:32.670> like<00:01:32.909> that

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
bunch of dots or anything like that

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.300 
bunch of dots or anything like that
the<00:01:33.659> downside<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.140> dye<00:01:34.350> sub<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.799> have<00:01:35.070> to

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
the downside to dye sub is you have to

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.789 
the downside to dye sub is you have to
print<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.700> special<00:01:36.090> dye<00:01:36.299> sub<00:01:36.600> paper<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.710> you

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
print on special dye sub paper so you

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.109 
print on special dye sub paper so you
don't<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.040> lot<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.189> paper<00:01:38.430> options<00:01:38.909> and

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
don't have a lot of paper options and

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.370 
don't have a lot of paper options and
it's<00:01:39.240> expensive<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.900> prints<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.259> be<00:01:40.350> a

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
it's expensive and the prints can be a

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.469 
it's expensive and the prints can be a
little<00:01:40.619> soft<00:01:40.860> laser<00:01:41.790> printers<00:01:42.180> are<00:01:42.329> nice

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
little soft laser printers are nice

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.210 
little soft laser printers are nice
because<00:01:42.810> they're<00:01:43.229> cheap<00:01:43.560> they're<00:01:43.860> cheap<00:01:44.070> to

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
because they're cheap they're cheap to

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.520 
because they're cheap they're cheap to
buy<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.610> they're<00:01:44.700> cheap<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.909> use<00:01:45.240> cost<00:01:46.170> per

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
buy and they're cheap to use cost per

buy and they're cheap to use cost per
print<00:01:46.829> wise<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.250> cheaper<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> laser<00:01:47.880> printer

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
print wise is cheaper on a laser printer

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.429 
print wise is cheaper on a laser printer
than<00:01:48.329> anything<00:01:48.509> else<00:01:48.780> even<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.079> color<00:01:49.259> laser

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
than anything else even a color laser

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.639

printer but they don't have they're not
continuous<00:01:53.159> tone<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:54.180> more<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.630> a

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
continuous tone it's more like a

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
paper and stuff like that so it comes

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.490

that's been around for quite a while and
called<00:02:12.670> inkjet<00:02:13.120> because<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.629> it<00:02:13.870> really<00:02:13.930> is

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
called inkjet because it it really is

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.839 
called inkjet because it it really is
just<00:02:14.379> that<00:02:14.829> it's<00:02:15.069> a<00:02:15.159> bunch<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.430> ink<00:02:15.640> and

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
just that it's a bunch of ink and

just that it's a bunch of ink and
there's<00:02:16.299> a<00:02:16.329> little<00:02:16.450> nozzle<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:16.989> just<00:02:17.140> goes

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
there's a little nozzle that just goes

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.410 
there's a little nozzle that just goes
and<00:02:17.859> spits<00:02:18.189> it<00:02:18.310> all<00:02:18.400> over<00:02:18.549> the<00:02:18.640> page<00:02:18.819> in<00:02:19.090> the

the r3000 the important thing about this

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.470 
the r3000 the important thing about this
printer<00:02:47.980> is<00:02:48.129> it<00:02:48.400> uses<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:49.060> doesn't<00:02:49.299> have<00:02:49.389> the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
printer is it uses it doesn't have the

sticker on it anymore the Epson k3 ink

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.250 
sticker on it anymore the Epson k3 ink
system<00:02:51.819> which<00:02:52.239> is<00:02:52.359> a<00:02:52.389> very<00:02:52.599> particular<00:02:52.780> set<00:02:53.079> of

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
system which is a very particular set of

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.399 
system which is a very particular set of
inks<00:02:53.530> that's<00:02:53.709> great<00:02:54.220> for<00:02:54.849> photo<00:02:55.060> printing<00:02:55.409> so

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
inks that's great for photo printing so

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.399 
inks that's great for photo printing so
what<00:02:57.280> happens<00:02:57.700> when<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.269> send<00:02:58.599> an<00:02:58.780> image<00:02:59.230> to

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
what happens when you send an image to

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.619 
what happens when you send an image to
the<00:02:59.530> printer<00:02:59.829> is<00:02:59.980> as<00:03:00.549> you<00:03:00.669> know<00:03:00.700> on<00:03:01.060> screen

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
the printer is as you know on screen

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.899 
the printer is as you know on screen
every<00:03:02.109> pixel<00:03:02.469> is<00:03:02.620> an<00:03:02.739> individual<00:03:03.159> color<00:03:03.370> so

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
every pixel is an individual color so

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.429 
every pixel is an individual color so
the<00:03:04.480> pics<00:03:04.689> on<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.900> upper<00:03:05.049> left-hand<00:03:05.319> corner

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:05.439 
the pics on the upper left-hand corner

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.679 
the pics on the upper left-hand corner
might<00:03:05.769> be<00:03:05.950> red<00:03:06.219> and<00:03:06.519> that<00:03:07.120> red<00:03:07.419> has<00:03:07.659> a

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 
might be red and that red has a

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.319 
might be red and that red has a
particular<00:03:08.139> name<00:03:08.169> Eric<00:03:08.469> value<00:03:08.829> that<00:03:09.340> value<00:03:10.120> is

particular name Eric value that value is

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.679 
particular name Eric value that value is
sent<00:03:10.659> to<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.519> printer<00:03:12.519> driver<00:03:12.909> which<00:03:13.450> tries

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:13.689 
sent to the printer driver which tries

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.720 
sent to the printer driver which tries
to<00:03:13.870> translate<00:03:14.169> that<00:03:14.379> single<00:03:14.919> dot<00:03:15.159> of<00:03:15.430> color

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
to translate that single dot of color

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.719 
to translate that single dot of color
into<00:03:16.659> a<00:03:16.690> pattern<00:03:17.169> of<00:03:17.560> printer<00:03:18.099> dots<00:03:18.280> of<00:03:18.549> the

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:18.729 
into a pattern of printer dots of the

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:21.599 
into a pattern of printer dots of the
same<00:03:18.940> color<00:03:19.209> so<00:03:19.900> this<00:03:20.049> printer<00:03:20.319> has<00:03:20.609> eight

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
same color so this printer has eight

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.119 
same color so this printer has eight
different<00:03:22.269> inks<00:03:22.540> in<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:23.019> I<00:03:23.199> believe<00:03:23.229> and<00:03:23.739> those

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
different inks in it I believe and those

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:25.710 
different inks in it I believe and those
are<00:03:24.310> mixed<00:03:24.549> together<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.970> create<00:03:25.329> every<00:03:25.599> other

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
are mixed together to create every other

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.929 
are mixed together to create every other
color<00:03:26.019> but<00:03:26.260> they're<00:03:26.709> not<00:03:26.859> mixed<00:03:27.250> together<00:03:27.459> in

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:27.939 
color but they're not mixed together in

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:28.979 
color but they're not mixed together in
the<00:03:28.120> way<00:03:28.209> that<00:03:28.389> you<00:03:28.479> would<00:03:28.599> in<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:28.810> painting

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
the way that you would in a painting

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.780 
the way that you would in a painting
studio<00:03:29.379> where<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.650> glob<00:03:30.370> a<00:03:30.400> bunch<00:03:30.699> of

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
studio where you glob a bunch of

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.009 
studio where you glob a bunch of
different<00:03:31.090> inks<00:03:31.239> together<00:03:31.479> and<00:03:31.629> swirl<00:03:31.900> them

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
different inks together and swirl them

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.390 
different inks together and swirl them
around<00:03:32.109> and<00:03:32.409> now<00:03:32.470> you've<00:03:32.620> got<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:32.769> final<00:03:33.099> ink

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
around and now you've got a final ink

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.129 
around and now you've got a final ink
that's<00:03:33.579> a<00:03:33.639> particular<00:03:34.030> color<00:03:34.239> instead<00:03:34.959> it's

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
that's a particular color instead it's

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.149 
that's a particular color instead it's
more<00:03:35.319> like<00:03:35.470> what<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:35.680> see<00:03:35.829> in<00:03:35.859> a<00:03:35.979> magazine

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 
more like what you see in a magazine

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.729 
more like what you see in a magazine
they<00:03:36.909> lay<00:03:37.209> down<00:03:37.449> patterns<00:03:38.049> of<00:03:38.199> dots<00:03:38.439> in

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
they lay down patterns of dots in

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.439 
they lay down patterns of dots in
particular<00:03:39.250> ways<00:03:39.459> and<00:03:39.819> it<00:03:39.879> just<00:03:40.060> so<00:03:40.150> happens

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:40.449 
particular ways and it just so happens

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.420 
particular ways and it just so happens
that<00:03:40.540> if<00:03:40.689> you<00:03:40.750> lay<00:03:40.900> down<00:03:41.129> one<00:03:42.129> of<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.280> ink

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
that if you lay down one of the ink

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.339 
that if you lay down one of the ink
colors<00:03:42.819> in<00:03:43.150> a<00:03:43.239> certain<00:03:43.569> way<00:03:43.689> next<00:03:43.959> to<00:03:44.109> some<00:03:44.259> of

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
colors in a certain way next to some of

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.649 
colors in a certain way next to some of
the<00:03:44.409> other<00:03:44.530> ink<00:03:44.739> colors<00:03:45.009> you<00:03:45.159> get<00:03:45.340> puce<00:03:46.329> or

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
the other ink colors you get puce or

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.679 
the other ink colors you get puce or
whatever<00:03:47.049> so<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.829> single<00:03:48.459> colored<00:03:49.060> pixel<00:03:49.509> on

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:49.689 
whatever so a single colored pixel on

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.499 
whatever so a single colored pixel on
screen<00:03:50.139> is<00:03:50.400> represented<00:03:51.400> on<00:03:51.519> your<00:03:51.849> page<00:03:52.090> by

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:52.509 
screen is represented on your page by

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:55.289 
screen is represented on your page by
maybe<00:03:52.870> a<00:03:53.169> hundred<00:03:53.769> printer<00:03:54.400> dots<00:03:54.549> teeny<00:03:55.030> tiny

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
maybe a hundred printer dots teeny tiny

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.920 
maybe a hundred printer dots teeny tiny
little<00:03:55.479> printer<00:03:55.810> dots<00:03:55.989> so<00:03:56.769> the<00:03:57.400> first<00:03:57.639> thing

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
little printer dots so the first thing

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.300 
little printer dots so the first thing
the<00:03:58.930> first<00:03:59.109> mistake<00:03:59.439> that<00:03:59.470> people<00:03:59.859> often<00:04:00.159> make

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
the first mistake that people often make

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.949 
the first mistake that people often make
is<00:04:00.579> they<00:04:00.819> see<00:04:00.879> the<00:04:01.209> resolution<00:04:01.540> of<00:04:01.870> the

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
is they see the resolution of the

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.780 
is they see the resolution of the
printer<00:04:02.349> and<00:04:02.500> this<00:04:02.919> printer<00:04:03.220> will<00:04:03.459> list<00:04:03.639> its

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
printer and this printer will list its

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.499 
printer and this printer will list its
resolution<00:04:04.329> as<00:04:04.449> 1440<00:04:05.409> dots<00:04:06.009> per<00:04:06.220> inch<00:04:06.250> or<00:04:06.639> 2880

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:07.509 
resolution as 1440 dots per inch or 2880

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:08.909 
resolution as 1440 dots per inch or 2880
dots<00:04:07.780> per<00:04:07.989> inch<00:04:08.079> and<00:04:08.319> they<00:04:08.379> think<00:04:08.560> oh<00:04:08.620> my<00:04:08.739> gosh

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
dots per inch and they think oh my gosh

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.640 
dots per inch and they think oh my gosh
I<00:04:09.129> have<00:04:09.310> to<00:04:09.340> have<00:04:09.459> an<00:04:09.609> image<00:04:09.819> that's<00:04:10.650> 1440

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
I have to have an image that's 1440

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.409 
I have to have an image that's 1440
pixels<00:04:11.799> per<00:04:12.489> inch<00:04:12.519> and<00:04:12.819> that's<00:04:12.879> not<00:04:13.120> true

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
pixels per inch and that's not true

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.050 
pixels per inch and that's not true
because<00:04:13.840> a<00:04:14.019> single<00:04:14.799> pixel<00:04:15.069> on<00:04:15.310> your<00:04:15.519> screen<00:04:15.849> is

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
because a single pixel on your screen is

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.520 
because a single pixel on your screen is
represented<00:04:16.780> by<00:04:16.840> a<00:04:16.900> whole<00:04:17.079> bunch<00:04:17.109> of<00:04:17.289> printer

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
represented by a whole bunch of printer

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.990 
represented by a whole bunch of printer
dots<00:04:17.739> and<00:04:18.159> we'll<00:04:18.489> talk<00:04:18.639> about<00:04:18.759> resolution

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
dots and we'll talk about resolution

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.580 
dots and we'll talk about resolution
later<00:04:19.479> when<00:04:19.720> we<00:04:19.810> talk<00:04:19.930> about<00:04:20.139> how<00:04:20.259> you<00:04:20.320> size

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
later when we talk about how you size

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.850 
later when we talk about how you size
your<00:04:20.889> images<00:04:21.340> so<00:04:22.320> there<00:04:23.320> are<00:04:23.469> a<00:04:23.529> number<00:04:23.560> of

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
your images so there are a number of

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.680 
your images so there are a number of
different<00:04:24.219> things<00:04:24.490> to<00:04:25.029> think<00:04:25.060> about

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
different things to think about

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.100 
different things to think about
when

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
when

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.119

black-and-white stuff how big you want
to<00:04:30.610> print<00:04:30.879> what<00:04:31.060> kind<00:04:31.240> of<00:04:31.300> computer<00:04:31.629> you<00:04:31.659> have

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930
