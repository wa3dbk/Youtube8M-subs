00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.480
 hello guys many of you waited 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.849
 right this moment and indeed we are 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.920
 got to the point of making the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.049
 crib houses 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.820
 let's start realizing what you do 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.990
 therefore they see the most from a distance 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.539
 tiny 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.520
 and to do so we use the clips of 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.960
 polystyrene that we have left 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.960
 let's start with the tutorial 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:37.860
 were the houses in Bethlehem they were gods 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.810
 simple rectangles that above all 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.360
 showing them at a distance not 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:48.460
 they could have this form also with 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:52.780
 a small dome on the head of the 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:57.460
 little house and then maybe there were those 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:00.610
 cimbas on a single floor and maybe of 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.740
 what once is a small window 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.680
 so they are very elements 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:20.100
 we consider these parts simple 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:20.100
 rectangular forms better than Bellini 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.380
 here will come a small bill that 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:33.930
 obviously we can also realize a 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.930
 part and then paste it 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:43.640
 we cut corners to give a 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:49.190
 a little optical illusion 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:02:03.260
 google and simu we are therefore all 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:02:06.110
 ganglia then we dig the mail is not there 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.459
 need to create the vacuum inside 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:15.280
 just simply give it 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.280
 the illusion of euro munari trans 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.290
 and here is the little house 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.379
 we then tapered another 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.140
 compiled and here is the final result 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:39.159
 let us proceed now to the realization instead 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:42.629
 of the smaller one and on one floor 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.629
 but rectangular 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:18.680
 to dig inside the window 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.620
 that we create a small diagonal cut 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.400
 and then we take the pieces off and take them out 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.400
 from the inside 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:38.560
 we always draw lines inside 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.560
 the streets of agorÃ  mali 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.660
 in this way we can pull out the 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.660
 little pieces 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:12.960
 if you see that the interior is not well 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:16.019
 aligned you can still crush it 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.590
 with something therefore also with one 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:30.020
 anything alive even with a screwdriver 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:34.580
 the scissors this way and that's it 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.580
 this other little house is also ready 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:44.940
 keep it up and then they will come 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:47.280
 painted wanting it is possible to create the 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.600
 empty inside to make you 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.600
 enter the lights 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.550
 cutting out this space inside 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.310
 we can bring up a small one 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:16.419
 light so that the light in fact 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:19.810
 comes out from inside the house 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:24.220
 at this point we create a nice little house 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:30.570
 a little different with a porch and one 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:30.570
 small turret always with fairing 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:58.000
 and extract these small meals 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:06:02.240
 polystyrene a central line and then her 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.810
 in fact we pull these scales of 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.810
 polystyrene 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:24.570
 and here is created by the last house with 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:28.380
 even a nice porch always 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:30.510
 work and close to others to create 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:34.640
 instead of larger houses 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:38.610
 we can adopt the same process 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:41.130
 we can simply compose several 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.370
 polystyrene elements reassemble 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:46.410
 together and even the cropping and the 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.660
 The finishing of the houses will result again 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.610
 easier because we don't have to do it 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:54.240
 in miniature as we did instead 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.830
 in smaller houses and this is the 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.300
 method to create houses in a way 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:01.640
 simple 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.640
 then we proceed to painting
