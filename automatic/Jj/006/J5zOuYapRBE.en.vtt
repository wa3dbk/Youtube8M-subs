 on the city gate the reception was warm 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.180
 - are translatable kisses and tight hugs the entity counts on what she 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.680
 I wanted 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.669
 and there were even reasons for so much celebration 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.560
 after all, for the first time a dance group formed by children of low 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.170
 income 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.589
 was selected for the international ballet festival 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.979
 thirty-eight dancers most girls performed in america 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:33.750
 grand prix of New York who brought together groups from more than 30 countries was very 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.789
 important for the admiration of all abroad 'mainly Americans who 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:40.460
 have seen the work and the technical quality 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.910
 anyway all the presentations the dance group 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.780
 They congratulated 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.860
 organization 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.590
 and by education also the small artists how to cut a way 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.860
 companies should keep the style looser 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.750
 in addition it managed to surpass more than 400 dancers of the whole world 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.060
 after that only in the pocket of souza and silva 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.270
 with two choreographies one solution and the other classic she got note today 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.690
 confirms 8 guarantees a one-month course in the United States 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.380
 sanctioned 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.910
 this line was an achievement in many cases of the disease 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.150
 the idea is this 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.980
 she embarks tomorrow against her mother for now also want to think about it 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:27.910
 now 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.000
 she's going to be good it must be another experience 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.660
 in fact everything is valid 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.330
 each winner inside her fifteen of the areas she already knew that what she had 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.880
 happened today the dancer of only 15 years changed the cold stages 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.280
 fire truck 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.350
 jordan fields stopped to acknowledge her talent in conversations 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.549
 opponents and many people from many 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:52.530
 would return 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.790
 a higher rank in conversation with the so much mat of duty 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.970
 fulfilled was the first international voyage 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.620
 the first 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.740
 despite all that I have noticed that Brazil does not 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.929
 - if they are not too difficult 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.189
 it's not easy 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:10.370
 a child 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.649
 getting there is unknown 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:14.989
 so it's not so well 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.029
 no one is 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:17.419
 the greatest fiscal stimulus
