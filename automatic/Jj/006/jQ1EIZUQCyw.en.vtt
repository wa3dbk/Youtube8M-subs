96<00:02:28.230> /<00:02:28.560> 87<00:02:29.010> champ<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.430> 85<00:02:30.000> prayer<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:31.200> those

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
96 / 87 champ and 85 prayer so those

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.630 
96 / 87 champ and 85 prayer so those
bonuses<00:02:31.650> are<00:02:31.770> actually<00:02:32.010> quite<00:02:32.280> good<00:02:32.310> now<00:02:32.610> I

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
bonuses are actually quite good now I

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.980 
bonuses are actually quite good now I
saw<00:02:32.850> obviously<00:02:33.000> wield<00:02:33.360> this<00:02:33.510> item<00:02:33.780> inside

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
saw obviously wield this item inside

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.270 
saw obviously wield this item inside
again<00:02:35.240> 8888<00:02:36.240> jump<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.810> five<00:02:37.200> press<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:37.710> 92

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
again 8888 jump and five press so 92

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.040 
again 8888 jump and five press so 92
slash<00:02:38.490> so<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.700> slash<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.270> actually<00:02:39.660> slightly

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
slash so the slash is actually slightly

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.840 
slash so the slash is actually slightly
higher<00:02:40.410> on<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.830> berserkering<00:02:41.250> by<00:02:41.400> four<00:02:41.700> which

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
higher on the berserkering by four which

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.780 
higher on the berserkering by four which
isn't<00:02:42.000> much<00:02:42.180> but<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.170> strength<00:02:43.620> is<00:02:43.860> only<00:02:44.070> one

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
isn't much but the strength is only one

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.820 
isn't much but the strength is only one
less<00:02:45.270> than<00:02:45.570> having<00:02:45.840> thus<00:02:45.990> our<00:02:46.140> sword<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.620> the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
less than having thus our sword and the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.160 
less than having thus our sword and the
glory<00:02:47.100> ATH<00:02:47.880> strength<00:02:48.150> against<00:02:48.420> 87<00:02:48.990> which<00:02:49.080> is

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
glory ATH strength against 87 which is

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.040 
glory ATH strength against 87 which is
only<00:02:49.460> 0.25<00:02:50.460> of<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.820> damage<00:02:51.150> another<00:02:51.780> thing<00:02:51.960> that

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
only 0.25 of a damage another thing that

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.240 
only 0.25 of a damage another thing that
was<00:02:52.110> said<00:02:52.290> in<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.470> other<00:02:52.530> video<00:02:52.680> actually<00:02:53.100> is

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
was said in the other video actually is

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.550 
was said in the other video actually is
people<00:02:53.760> saying<00:02:54.000> other<00:02:54.360> speeds<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.170> same<00:02:55.200> thus

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
people saying other speeds the same thus

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.050 
people saying other speeds the same thus
our<00:02:55.680> sword<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.040> these<00:02:56.220> can<00:02:56.400> have<00:02:56.520> identical

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
our sword and these can have identical

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.780 
our sword and these can have identical
speeds<00:02:57.300> so<00:02:57.980> in<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.130> case<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.490> can<00:02:59.640> actually

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
speeds so in that case you can actually

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.580 
speeds so in that case you can actually
they<00:03:00.480> do<00:03:00.540> attack<00:03:00.840> at<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.020> same<00:03:01.170> speed<00:03:01.410> so

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
they do attack at the same speed so

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.960 
they do attack at the same speed so
that's<00:03:01.890> not<00:03:02.100> really<00:03:02.280> I'm<00:03:02.370> not<00:03:02.400> going<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.640> come

that's not really I'm not going to come

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.580 
that's not really I'm not going to come
to<00:03:03.090> this<00:03:03.150> office<00:03:03.240> it's<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.540> same<00:03:03.720> I've<00:03:04.440> not

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
you've got those three then you can't

when you're training strength but a good

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.570 
when you're training strength but a good
way<00:05:34.169> to<00:05:34.230> start<00:05:34.530> is<00:05:34.770> you<00:05:35.010> could<00:05:35.160> start<00:05:35.430> with

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
way to start is you could start with

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.950 
way to start is you could start with
that<00:05:35.640> and<00:05:36.060> then<00:05:36.419> you<00:05:36.450> could<00:05:36.600> just<00:05:36.750> upgrade

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
that and then you could just upgrade

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.659 
that and then you could just upgrade
like<00:05:37.590> I<00:05:37.620> mean<00:05:37.830> just<00:05:37.980> do<00:05:38.040> it<00:05:38.130> in<00:05:38.190> parts<00:05:38.460> when<00:05:38.610> you

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
like I mean just do it in parts when you

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.700 
like I mean just do it in parts when you
hit<00:05:38.790> a<00:05:38.820> formal<00:05:39.180> cash<00:05:39.330> pile<00:05:39.540> you<00:05:39.990> get<00:05:40.230> that<00:05:40.470> set

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
hit a formal cash pile you get that set

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.110 
hit a formal cash pile you get that set
up<00:05:40.740> and<00:05:40.980> then<00:05:41.010> of<00:05:41.550> course<00:05:41.700> when<00:05:41.790> you<00:05:41.850> get<00:05:41.910> three

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
up and then of course when you get three

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.550 
up and then of course when you get three
more<00:05:42.240> back<00:05:42.419> you<00:05:42.630> get<00:05:42.810> that<00:05:42.990> set<00:05:43.230> up<00:05:43.320> and<00:05:43.500> then

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
more back you get that set up and then

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.890 
more back you get that set up and then
you<00:05:43.770> can<00:05:43.890> start<00:05:44.100> grating<00:05:44.370> from<00:05:44.550> there<00:05:44.790> so<00:05:44.900> just

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
thing but I did think I'd really needed

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.220 
thing but I did think I'd really needed
to<00:06:32.430> cover<00:06:32.700> this<00:06:32.850> topic<00:06:33.030> as<00:06:33.270> well<00:06:33.390> cause<00:06:33.960> I<00:06:34.080> mean

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
to cover this topic as well cause I mean

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.210 
to cover this topic as well cause I mean

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 
I didn't really see much of it in the

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.890

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
comment sections like I said earlier so

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:37.820

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
I think a lot of people might have

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.500 
I think a lot of people might have
actually<00:06:38.130> missed<00:06:38.310> this<00:06:38.460> as<00:06:38.610> well<00:06:38.760> but<00:06:39.270> if<00:06:39.419> you

in the situation of going through this I

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.159 
in the situation of going through this I
would<00:07:06.000> take<00:07:06.150> this<00:07:06.270> out<00:07:06.449> to<00:07:06.630> the<00:07:06.660> option<00:07:07.050> I'd

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:07.169 
would take this out to the option I'd

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:09.140 
would take this out to the option I'd
buy<00:07:07.410> that<00:07:07.440> I<00:07:07.770> sell<00:07:08.070> up<00:07:08.220> get<00:07:08.520> that<00:07:08.669> and<00:07:08.880> then<00:07:09.030> I'd

buy that I sell up get that and then I'd
get<00:07:09.300> that<00:07:09.449> finally<00:07:09.780> I<00:07:09.900> think<00:07:10.050> I'd<00:07:10.139> be

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:10.259 
get that finally I think I'd be

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:11.749 
get that finally I think I'd be
definitely<00:07:10.710> the<00:07:10.860> best<00:07:11.009> option<00:07:11.340> to<00:07:11.370> go<00:07:11.550> through

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 
definitely the best option to go through

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:13.250 
definitely the best option to go through
but<00:07:12.150> of<00:07:12.240> course<00:07:12.449> you<00:07:12.810> can't<00:07:13.020> just<00:07:13.050> jump

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:13.260 
but of course you can't just jump

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.540 
but of course you can't just jump
straight<00:07:13.350> to<00:07:13.560> that<00:07:13.650> you<00:07:13.830> want<00:07:13.919> but<00:07:14.220> which<00:07:14.370> one

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:14.550 
straight to that you want but which one

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.840 
straight to that you want but which one
is<00:07:14.639> better<00:07:15.889> overall<00:07:16.889> particular<00:07:17.430> these<00:07:17.729> are

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:17.850 
is better overall particular these are

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.100 
is better overall particular these are
the<00:07:17.910> bonuses<00:07:18.210> here<00:07:18.389> and<00:07:18.600> these<00:07:18.900> are<00:07:19.050> the

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.110 
the bonuses here and these are the

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.140 
the bonuses here and these are the
bonuses<00:07:19.410> here<00:07:19.620> so<00:07:19.949> the<00:07:20.039> bonuses<00:07:20.460> of<00:07:20.669> this<00:07:20.940> is

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.150 
bonuses here so the bonuses of this is

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.779 
bonuses here so the bonuses of this is
actually<00:07:21.630> very<00:07:21.660> I<00:07:22.199> don't<00:07:23.190> think<00:07:23.580> it's<00:07:23.669> better

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:23.789 
actually very I don't think it's better

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:26.060 
actually very I don't think it's better
it's<00:07:24.030> point<00:07:24.300> two<00:07:24.479> five<00:07:24.750> damage<00:07:25.070> sacrificing

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.070

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.950 
it's point two five damage sacrificing
all<00:07:26.220> that<00:07:26.669> defense<00:07:27.030> and<00:07:27.330> a<00:07:27.539> tiny<00:07:27.720> bit<00:07:27.930> of

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:27.960 
all that defense and a tiny bit of

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.810 
all that defense and a tiny bit of
attack<00:07:28.229> so<00:07:28.860> I'd<00:07:28.979> probably<00:07:29.100> say<00:07:29.340> this<00:07:29.699> is

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:29.820 
attack so I'd probably say this is

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.430 
attack so I'd probably say this is
better<00:07:30.000> if<00:07:30.120> you<00:07:30.150> have<00:07:30.270> seven<00:07:30.539> mil<00:07:30.630> to<00:07:30.750> get<00:07:30.930> get

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 
better if you have seven mil to get get

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.960 
better if you have seven mil to get get
a<00:07:31.470> fury<00:07:31.740> at<00:07:32.010> the<00:07:32.099> Dragon<00:07:32.430> Skin<00:07:32.520> get<00:07:32.789> a<00:07:32.820> real

a fury at the Dragon Skin get a real

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.960 
defender and get a berserkering imbued
