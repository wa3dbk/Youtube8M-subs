 hello friends welcome to my world channel 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.690
 of toys in this continuous video 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.400
 showing them the steps or puzzles 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.280
 that I showed you in the previous video 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.980
 where I asked which step they wanted to see 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.580
 first and good I'll start by 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.199
 show them the passage of frozen here is 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.150
 see how nice 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.689
 look at what a beautiful little bag and we see the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.210
 queen elsa and says happened where as you see 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.960
 what beautiful little stars or snow flex 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.150
 have here are little snowflakes and the 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.820
 Queen of the Shah looks lovely 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.220
 and so it's from the back what 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.890
 beautiful 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.370
 well let's open it and start 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.370
 put it together 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:59.320
 and not show on all the pieces 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:02.560
 They are 48 pieces and as I showed you in 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.330
 an earlier video that I made of a step 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.480
 Ponies hand where he showed them a 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.550
 box a very nice food and came 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.930
 in a step of greater opposes if they have not 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.640
 seen this video I leave it in the 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.700
 information box so they can go to 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.150
 see it there I told them that I like it 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.160
 flip all the pieces with the little face 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.530
 up when I'm putting together a 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.979
 step and that is my strategy I think that 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.830
 that's faster so I'm already seeing 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.680
 what do you think is that and good friends here 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.479
 I already have all my pieces like that with the 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.960
 face up what do you think if 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:42.100
 together we put together this puzzle we are going to 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.930
 see let's put the little face here to the 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.720
 queen that 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.770
 let's look for some other part of your 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.829
 face this piece goes here 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.829
 Y 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.720
 this piece here 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:11.530
 and this other piece may go here 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:13.069
 I think it was already here not here yes there 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.840
 very well 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:21.790
 this one seems to me that goes by here I said this 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.790
 how is it here perfect 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:31.730
 let's see if we list here without 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.909
 to see if it's here not here yes up 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.000
 these two this is human 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:41.560
 let's leave it here this piece 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.560
 it stays here there it is 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.550
 let's see if this other one stays here like this 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:54.410
 if you stay 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:58.860
 now let's see if he was here not 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:03.010
 there's no need to go in here if there's more 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:07.660
 let's see if this stays here yes that 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:10.270
 let's see if he is here like this to our 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.870
 step is already taking shape truth that um 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.890
 and well now let's see if this piece 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.890
 Stays here 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:24.110
 If that's where that piece goes now let's see if 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:27.430
 is here and there goes now this 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.430
 piece seems to me that goes here 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:37.580
 and it was around here and let's see if it's 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.530
 there very well let's see if this piece 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.990
 enter here 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:46.130
 there it is so the student knows he was 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:50.930
 here let's see if it was here no no it's going 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:54.020
 to go how is it, how is it? 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.260
 let's see if it stays here if it's 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:01.250
 is here is now there 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.580
 this piece goes here is 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.580
 let's see if this is left here yes 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:10.100
 perfect that such is now here no no 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.410
 is going to see, let's try it is like this 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.660
 this piece will go let's see if this 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:20.010
 piece goes in here does not go there 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:23.880
 How is it if this piece is going to go very 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:26.850
 well now I was here 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.700
 is our puzzle and mere 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:33.060
 ready let's keep putting together this piece 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.070
 goes here so well this part that 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.520
 we had armed before where the sha has 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:43.860
 your hand up goes here together with 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:47.540
 this very well and it's perfect let's 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.540
 see if these pieces enter here 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.800
 to me 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:01.460
 in this way so one more 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:03.710
 this is perfect here as you see only 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.480
 we have to build this corner where it says 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.480
 elsa let's see 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:14.910
 and that this piece goes here and then 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.080
 let's see it was there and we already formed the 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.990
 name of the queen 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.190
 elsa that is going to continue to build 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:26.230
 let's see if this piece enters here 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.230
 if it fits me perfect 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:34.340
 I was there very well, because this piece is going 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:38.500
 here there is already only this 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.500
 corner of here we have five pieces left 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:46.680
 it does not come in and let's see if it does not 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:51.230
 enter this piece goes here after this 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:54.950
 piece here was here now 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:57.950
 this piece goes here and this is my last 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:00.070
 piece and is good friends my 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:03.740
 elsa puzzle has been ready 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:06.260
 see how nice it is I love I liked it 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.390
 much this step of the reyna elsa with 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.520
 all those little snowflakes see what 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.590
 pretty looks and I love to put together 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.110
 puzzle I think it's a hobby 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.570
 that relaxes a lot and so it distracts you 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.700
 It is perfect for children and this 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.620
 especially because he's only 48 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.530
 pieces like that is that it will not take them much 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:27.050
 time to build it and the more steps armen 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.270
 you will increase your capacity and 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.620
 sooner they will be able to put together the good 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.110
