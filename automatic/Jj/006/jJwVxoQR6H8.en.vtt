can really see that through this whole

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.300 
can really see that through this whole
album<00:04:22.890> I<00:04:23.250> think<00:04:23.880> that<00:04:24.680> what<00:04:25.680> I've<00:04:25.800> noticed<00:04:26.010> as

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
album I think that what I've noticed as

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.430 
album I think that what I've noticed as
well<00:04:26.490> as<00:04:26.640> I<00:04:26.729> you<00:04:27.000> know<00:04:27.120> you

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
well as I you know you

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.810 
well as I you know you
when<00:04:27.620> you<00:04:27.710> when<00:04:28.100> you're<00:04:28.220> in<00:04:28.250> this<00:04:28.430> style<00:04:28.640> of

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
when you when you're in this style of

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.280 
when you when you're in this style of
music<00:04:28.910> you<00:04:29.240> don't<00:04:29.420> want<00:04:29.600> to<00:04:29.720> hear<00:04:29.900> the<00:04:30.050> same

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
music you don't want to hear the same

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.990 
music you don't want to hear the same
stuff<00:04:30.680> through<00:04:30.980> every<00:04:31.310> album<00:04:31.610> I<00:04:31.730> mean<00:04:31.880> there

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
stuff through every album I mean there

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.910 
stuff through every album I mean there
are<00:04:32.030> some<00:04:32.300> fans<00:04:32.510> that<00:04:32.660> do<00:04:32.840> but<00:04:33.530> it<00:04:33.860> is

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
are some fans that do but it is

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.640 
are some fans that do but it is
interesting<00:04:34.580> for<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.780> band<00:04:35.960> to<00:04:36.260> keep<00:04:36.500> it

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
interesting for the the band to keep it

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.980 
interesting for the the band to keep it
fresh<00:04:36.980> and<00:04:37.310> I<00:04:37.970> think<00:04:38.270> they<00:04:38.420> really<00:04:38.570> did<00:04:38.840> that

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
fresh and I think they really did that

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.290 
fresh and I think they really did that
I've<00:04:39.110> noticed<00:04:39.560> on<00:04:39.770> all<00:04:40.340> of<00:04:40.640> the<00:04:40.730> songs<00:04:41.030> in<00:04:41.210> this

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
I've noticed on all of the songs in this

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.130 
I've noticed on all of the songs in this
album<00:04:41.510> there<00:04:42.020> is<00:04:42.290> they're<00:04:42.830> much<00:04:43.130> more<00:04:43.400> diverse

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
album there is they're much more diverse

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.440 
album there is they're much more diverse
than<00:04:45.140> some<00:04:45.800> of<00:04:45.920> the<00:04:45.980> previous<00:04:46.100> albums<00:04:46.700> I

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
than some of the previous albums I

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.020 
than some of the previous albums I
really<00:04:48.140> he'll<00:04:48.620> have<00:04:49.130> almost<00:04:49.550> like<00:04:49.760> some<00:04:50.000> kind

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
really he'll have almost like some kind

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.480 
really he'll have almost like some kind
of<00:04:50.300> Slayer<00:04:50.810> flash<00:04:51.200> black<00:04:51.530> backs<00:04:51.980> a<00:04:52.130> lot<00:04:52.340> in

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.750 
this album I can really I don't know
what<00:04:54.440> it<00:04:54.530> was<00:04:54.680> it<00:04:54.740> was<00:04:54.950> almost<00:04:55.190> like<00:04:55.460> there<00:04:55.670> was

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
what it was it was almost like there was

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.250 
what it was it was almost like there was
like<00:04:55.910> Cannibal<00:04:56.360> Corpse<00:04:56.390> kind<00:04:56.870> of<00:04:56.930> mixed<00:04:57.170> with

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
like Cannibal Corpse kind of mixed with

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.470 
like Cannibal Corpse kind of mixed with
some<00:04:57.440> Slayer<00:04:57.860> and<00:04:58.220> this<00:04:58.370> album<00:04:58.730> and<00:04:58.880> they<00:04:58.940> they

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
really made it interesting I think this

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.820 
really made it interesting I think this
albums<00:05:01.670> about<00:05:01.790> diversity<00:05:02.450> about<00:05:02.990> a<00:05:03.200> sort<00:05:03.620> of<00:05:03.680> a

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
albums about diversity about a sort of a

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.310 
albums about diversity about a sort of a
fresher<00:05:04.220> Bhoomi<00:05:04.700> or<00:05:04.790> sound<00:05:05.090> and<00:05:05.480> I<00:05:05.960> really

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
fresher Bhoomi or sound and I really

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.380 
fresher Bhoomi or sound and I really
they<00:05:06.680> really<00:05:06.980> pulled<00:05:07.250> it<00:05:07.370> off

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
they really pulled it off

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.010 
they really pulled it off
another<00:05:08.810> track<00:05:09.680> sadistic<00:05:10.370> embodiment<00:05:11.090> that

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
another track sadistic embodiment that

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.420
