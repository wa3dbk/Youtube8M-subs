the way up to 1995 common problem with

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.429 
the way up to 1995 common problem with
these<00:00:20.880> Ford's<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.689> they<00:00:21.840> like<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.230> leak

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
these Ford's is that they like to leak

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.939 
these Ford's is that they like to leak
at<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.369> intake<00:00:24.000> half<00:00:24.480> or<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.230> lower<00:00:25.470> in<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
middle that likes to usually leak and

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.080 
middle that likes to usually leak and
cause<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> vacuum<00:00:31.590> leak<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.279> they<00:00:32.399> aisle<00:00:32.700> too

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
cause a vacuum leak and they aisle too

fast<00:00:33.559> the<00:00:34.559> problem<00:00:35.040> with<00:00:35.219> my<00:00:35.579> Ford<00:00:36.950> it's<00:00:37.950> got<00:00:38.129> a

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
fast the problem with my Ford it's got a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:46.400 
fast the problem with my Ford it's got a
302<00:00:38.960> is<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.200> my<00:00:40.379> EGR<00:00:41.010> valve<00:00:42.980> is<00:00:45.410> stuck

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
302 is that my EGR valve is stuck

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.700 
302 is that my EGR valve is stuck
slightly<00:00:46.980> open<00:00:47.370> I'm<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.329> give<00:00:48.510> you

slightly open I'm going to give you
demonstration<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:50.070> its<00:00:50.399> stages<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.360> what<00:00:51.510> it

demonstration of its stages and what it

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.970 
demonstration of its stages and what it
likes<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.960> do<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> cold<00:00:53.219> start

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
likes to do this is a cold start

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:10.219 
likes to do this is a cold start

about<00:01:10.470> 2,000<00:01:11.189> rpms

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:50.359 

or<00:01:25.460> man<00:01:25.670> up

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.660 

about<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.299> idol<00:01:51.689> down<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.590> don't<00:01:53.100> back<00:01:53.430> up

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
about the idol down and I don't back up

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.179 
about the idol down and I don't back up
that<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.270> EGR<00:01:54.780> valve<00:01:55.110> opens<00:01:55.649> up<00:01:55.799> into<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
that so the EGR valve opens up into the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:32.930 
that so the EGR valve opens up into the
idol<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.640> fast

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:46.490 

now<00:02:33.780> I'll<00:02:34.050> do<00:02:34.320> because<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.890> pocket<00:02:35.130> board

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.970 

but<00:02:47.130> uh<00:02:48.020> another<00:02:49.020> thing<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.650> will<00:02:49.800> happen

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
but uh another thing that will happen

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.550 
but uh another thing that will happen
when<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:50.910> happens<00:02:51.510> when<00:02:51.900> they<00:02:52.020> idle<00:02:52.380> too

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
when this happens when they idle too

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.980 
when this happens when they idle too
fast<00:02:52.830> because<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.550> jar<00:02:53.940> valve<00:02:54.270> is<00:02:54.480> stuck<00:02:54.720> open

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
fast because you jar valve is stuck open

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.590 
fast because you jar valve is stuck open
is<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.370> will<00:02:56.490> start<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.820> follow<00:02:57.090> spark

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
is that it will start to follow spark

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.050 
is that it will start to follow spark
plugs<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:58.260> had<00:02:58.950> problems<00:02:59.430> with<00:02:59.610> this<00:02:59.790> thing

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
plugs I had problems with this thing

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.800 
plugs I had problems with this thing
following<00:03:00.540> spark<00:03:00.990> plugs<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:02.090> well<00:03:03.090> now<00:03:03.570> that

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
following spark plugs and well now that

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.070 
following spark plugs and well now that
it<00:03:03.930> idles<00:03:04.320> way<00:03:04.560> too<00:03:04.620> fast<00:03:05.209> when<00:03:06.209> it's<00:03:06.390> warm<00:03:06.720> it

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
it idles way too fast when it's warm it

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.720 
it idles way too fast when it's warm it
needs<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.590> be<00:03:07.680> taken<00:03:07.890> care<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:09.860> other<00:03:10.860> sensors

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
needs to be taken care of other sensors

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.440 
needs to be taken care of other sensors
such<00:03:12.209> as<00:03:12.240> the<00:03:12.750> intake<00:03:13.200> air<00:03:13.470> charged<00:03:14.840> sensor

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
such as the intake air charged sensor

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.290 
such as the intake air charged sensor
definitely<00:03:18.450> throttle<00:03:18.900> positioning<00:03:19.530> sensor

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
definitely throttle positioning sensor

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:27.470 
definitely throttle positioning sensor
coolant<00:03:21.300> temp<00:03:21.600> sensors<00:03:22.910> oxygen<00:03:23.910> I<00:03:26.209> will<00:03:27.209> do

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
coolant temp sensors oxygen I will do

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.760 
coolant temp sensors oxygen I will do
that<00:03:27.810> make<00:03:28.590> them<00:03:28.830> idle<00:03:29.220> too<00:03:29.400> fast<00:03:30.380> this<00:03:31.380> one<00:03:31.620> is

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
that make them idle too fast this one is

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.479 
that make them idle too fast this one is
too<00:03:31.980> old<00:03:32.010> they<00:03:32.370> have<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.520> mass<00:03:32.820> airflow<00:03:33.120> sensor

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
too old they have a mass airflow sensor

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.330 
too old they have a mass airflow sensor
but<00:03:35.489> that<00:03:35.760> will<00:03:35.970> also<00:03:36.180> cause<00:03:36.510> that<00:03:36.840> too<00:03:37.340> but

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
but that will also cause that too but

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.860 
but that will also cause that too but
always<00:03:38.670> keep<00:03:38.940> in<00:03:39.090> mind<00:03:39.330> that<00:03:39.480> these<00:03:39.690> things

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
always keep in mind that these things

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.990 
always keep in mind that these things
are<00:03:40.110> notorious<00:03:40.230> for<00:03:40.739> vacuum<00:03:41.370> leaks<00:03:41.610> where<00:03:41.880> the

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
are notorious for vacuum leaks where the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.240 
are notorious for vacuum leaks where the
two<00:03:42.180> intake<00:03:42.630> manifolds<00:03:43.350> come<00:03:43.590> together<00:03:44.870> so<00:03:45.870> I

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
two intake manifolds come together so I

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.890 
two intake manifolds come together so I
hope<00:03:47.250> this<00:03:47.520> video<00:03:47.730> helps<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:50.330> we'll<00:03:51.330> see<00:03:51.780> you

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
hope this video helps and we'll see you

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.930 
hope this video helps and we'll see you
later
