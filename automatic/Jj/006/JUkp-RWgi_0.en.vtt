hey<00:00:00.599> guys<00:00:00.810> are<00:00:01.079> some<00:00:01.199> de<00:00:01.350> sac<00:00:01.560> tech<00:00:01.800> and<00:00:01.949> today

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
hey guys are some de sac tech and today

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.039 
hey guys are some de sac tech and today
I<00:00:02.220> wanted<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.669> discuss<00:00:02.820> techniques<00:00:03.570> on<00:00:03.840> how<00:00:03.990> to

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
I wanted to discuss techniques on how to

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.260 
I wanted to discuss techniques on how to
transfer<00:00:04.529> files<00:00:04.560> for<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.069> new<00:00:05.220> computer<00:00:05.549> that

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
transfer files for a new computer that

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.690 
transfer files for a new computer that
does<00:00:06.390> not<00:00:06.420> have<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.899> CD<00:00:07.140> drive<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:08.370> reason<00:00:08.580> why

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
does not have a CD drive the reason why

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.770 
does not have a CD drive the reason why
I'm<00:00:08.820> making<00:00:08.910> this<00:00:09.120> video<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.480> because<00:00:09.540> I

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
I'm making this video is because I

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.780 
I'm making this video is because I
recently<00:00:09.990> got<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.440> MacBook<00:00:10.920> Pro<00:00:10.950> right<00:00:11.370> now<00:00:11.519> and

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
recently got a MacBook Pro right now and

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.400 
recently got a MacBook Pro right now and
as<00:00:12.030> you<00:00:12.150> probably<00:00:12.330> know<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.139> computer

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
as you probably know on this computer

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.829 
as you probably know on this computer
does<00:00:13.650> not<00:00:13.679> come<00:00:14.099> with<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.340> CD<00:00:14.549> drive<00:00:15.030> so<00:00:15.630> after

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
does not come with a CD drive so after

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.570 
does not come with a CD drive so after
some<00:00:16.020> research<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.440> findings<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.160> have<00:00:17.430> some

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
some research and findings I have some

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.800 
some research and findings I have some
techniques<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.000> like<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.270> share<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.630> how<00:00:18.660> to

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
techniques I like to share on how to

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.660 
techniques I like to share on how to
access<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.380> remote<00:00:19.470> disc<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.100> how<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.279> transfer

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
access a remote disc and how to transfer

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.700 
access a remote disc and how to transfer
files<00:00:20.910> wirelessly<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:22.080> if<00:00:22.140> not<00:00:22.289> for<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.560> dudes

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
files wirelessly so if not for the dudes

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:32.229 
files wirelessly so if not for the dudes
get<00:00:23.010> right<00:00:23.130> into<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.400> video

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.430 

before<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.270> begin<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.570> need<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.899> clarify<00:00:34.079> that

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
before I begin I need to clarify that

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.229 
before I begin I need to clarify that
all<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.710> computers<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.160> see<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.059> video

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
all the computers you see in this video

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.030 
all the computers you see in this video
are<00:00:36.360> writing<00:00:36.780> OS<00:00:37.050> 10<00:00:37.260> mountain<00:00:37.620> lion<00:00:37.800> ten

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
are writing OS 10 mountain lion ten

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.950 
are writing OS 10 mountain lion ten
point<00:00:38.309> eight<00:00:38.489> point<00:00:38.670> four<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.750> first

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
point eight point four so the first

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.810 
point eight point four so the first
technique<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.410> found<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.040> use<00:00:41.160> remote<00:00:41.370> disk

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
technique I found is to use remote disk

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.670 
technique I found is to use remote disk
sharing<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.510> requires<00:00:42.930> two<00:00:43.200> computers

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
sharing this requires two computers

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.830 
sharing this requires two computers
while<00:00:44.160> they<00:00:44.370> describe<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.910> course<00:00:45.149> now<00:00:45.629> for

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
while they describe of course now for

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.660
