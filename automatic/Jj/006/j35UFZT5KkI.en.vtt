00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
I really like those translucent parts

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.910 
I really like those translucent parts
and<00:01:20.880> I've<00:01:21.000> got<00:01:21.210> these<00:01:21.420> white<00:01:22.020> spikes<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.710> red

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
and I've got these white spikes and red

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.910 
and I've got these white spikes and red
spikes<00:01:25.220> so<00:01:26.220> moving<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:26.909> up<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:29.670> body

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
spikes so moving on up to the body

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.410 
spikes so moving on up to the body
didn't<00:01:31.920> really<00:01:32.250> change<00:01:32.549> much<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.090> at<00:01:33.270> all

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
didn't really change much of this at all

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.140 
didn't really change much of this at all
I<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:34.290> changed<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.920> configuration<00:01:35.400> of

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
I just changed the configuration of

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.120 
I just changed the configuration of
these<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.780> be<00:01:36.960> angled<00:01:37.439> because<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:37.979> think

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
these to just be angled because I think

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.359 
these to just be angled because I think
that<00:01:38.340> looks<00:01:38.700> cooler<00:01:39.740> and<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:40.950> lift<00:01:41.189> those

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
that looks cooler and just lift those

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.530 
that looks cooler and just lift those
red<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.360> white<00:01:42.840> spikes<00:01:43.200> alone<00:01:44.149> we<00:01:45.149> went<00:01:45.360> over

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
red and white spikes alone we went over

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.380 
red and white spikes alone we went over
to<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.780> arms<00:01:46.939> and<00:01:48.979> he's<00:01:49.979> got<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.460> giant<00:01:50.850> battle

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
to the arms and he's got a giant battle

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.719 
to the arms and he's got a giant battle
axe<00:01:51.659> now<00:01:52.280> one<00:01:53.280> from<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:54.049> Bionicle<00:01:55.369> series<00:01:56.369> and

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
axe now one from the Bionicle series and

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.690 
axe now one from the Bionicle series and
it<00:01:56.909> was<00:01:56.939> strike<00:01:57.780> who<00:01:58.649> originally<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.460> but

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
it was strike who originally in this but

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.090 
it was strike who originally in this but
I<00:01:59.909> really<00:02:00.600> like<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:01.079> X<00:02:03.290> and<00:02:04.290> then<00:02:04.469> we've<00:02:04.860> got

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
I really like this X and then we've got

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.069 
I really like this X and then we've got
this

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
this

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.869 
this
Bionicle<00:02:07.079> axe<00:02:07.350> right<00:02:07.649> here<00:02:07.979> which<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.520> really

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
Bionicle axe right here which I really

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.300 
Bionicle axe right here which I really
like<00:02:09.090> definitely<00:02:10.080> fitting<00:02:10.709> with<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.129> color

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
like definitely fitting with the color

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.199 
like definitely fitting with the color
scheme

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
scheme

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.190 
scheme
and<00:02:13.310> whenever<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.519> made<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.909> modifications

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
and whenever I made the modifications

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.280 
and whenever I made the modifications
originally<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.379> this<00:02:16.500> guy<00:02:17.689> his<00:02:18.689> little<00:02:18.989> sword

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
originally to this guy his little sword

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.250 
originally to this guy his little sword
just<00:02:19.379> looked<00:02:20.120> way<00:02:21.120> too<00:02:21.150> puny<00:02:21.870> in<00:02:22.200> comparison

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
just looked way too puny in comparison

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.470 
just looked way too puny in comparison
so<00:02:23.159> I<00:02:23.189> had<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.549> get<00:02:23.700> something<00:02:23.879> much<00:02:24.180> larger

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
so I had to get something much larger

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.800 
so I had to get something much larger
and<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:25.049> really<00:02:25.859> worked<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:27.420> it's<00:02:27.569> just<00:02:27.719> a

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
and this really worked and it's just a

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.050 
and this really worked and it's just a
really<00:02:27.989> cool<00:02:28.230> piece<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:30.420> now<00:02:31.549> here's<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.609> arms

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
really cool piece so now here's the arms

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.349 
really cool piece so now here's the arms
did<00:02:33.780> leave<00:02:33.989> that<00:02:34.170> little<00:02:34.349> spike<00:02:34.590> down<00:02:34.769> there

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
did leave that little spike down there

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:39.649 
did leave that little spike down there
just<00:02:36.359> for<00:02:36.569> originality<00:02:37.049> purposes<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:39.209> then

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
just for originality purposes and then

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.080 
just for originality purposes and then
the<00:02:39.780> arms<00:02:40.139> are<00:02:40.379> longer<00:02:40.650> get<00:02:41.370> more<00:02:41.579> armor<00:02:41.969> on<00:02:42.060> E

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
the arms are longer get more armor on E

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.990 
the arms are longer get more armor on E
or<00:02:42.269> larger<00:02:42.689> armor<00:02:43.079> got<00:02:43.769> red<00:02:44.010> spikes<00:02:44.370> here<00:02:44.790> that

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
or larger armor got red spikes here that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.649

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
like a lot better that way because it

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.379 
like a lot better that way because it
doesn't<00:03:25.319> get<00:03:25.409> snagged<00:03:25.829> on<00:03:26.069> anything<00:03:26.129> and<00:03:26.819> does

doesn't get snagged on anything and does

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.830 
doesn't get snagged on anything and does
not<00:03:27.569> limit<00:03:27.750> our<00:03:27.959> tick<00:03:28.139> you<00:03:28.260> layin<00:03:29.239> so<00:03:30.239> here<00:03:30.659> is

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
not limit our tick you layin so here is

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.110 
not limit our tick you layin so here is
the<00:03:31.139> back<00:03:32.060> now<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.120> main<00:03:33.599> torso<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:35.120> really

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
the back now the main torso I really

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.050 
the back now the main torso I really
didn't<00:03:36.389> modify<00:03:36.689> its<00:03:37.229> design<00:03:39.949> originally<00:03:41.060> and

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
didn't modify its design originally and

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.530 
didn't modify its design originally and
I<00:03:42.540> just<00:03:43.049> added<00:03:43.799> on<00:03:43.949> really<00:03:44.790> just<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.209> cover<00:03:45.419> up

I just added on really just to cover up
areas<00:03:46.109> that<00:03:46.319> I<00:03:46.379> thought<00:03:46.769> could<00:03:47.549> have<00:03:47.699> been

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
areas that I thought could have been

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.689 
areas that I thought could have been
done<00:03:48.120> better<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:49.169> I<00:03:49.620> think<00:03:49.979> it<00:03:50.099> really<00:03:50.370> has

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
done better and I think it really has

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:55.309 
done better and I think it really has
been<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.329> lot<00:03:52.109> better<00:03:52.409> I<00:03:52.680> really<00:03:53.519> like<00:03:54.259> that<00:03:55.259> I

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319
