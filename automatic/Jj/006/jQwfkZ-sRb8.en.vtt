00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.840 
difficult to explain it move so here's
the<00:03:12.300> basic<00:03:12.420> rundown<00:03:13.010> say<00:03:14.010> snake<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.490> falling

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
the basic rundown say snake is falling

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.880 
the basic rundown say snake is falling
towards<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.240> right<00:03:15.510> however<00:03:16.080> this<00:03:16.470> time<00:03:16.710> he's

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
towards the right however this time he's

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.530 
towards the right however this time he's
facing<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.310> opposite<00:03:17.850> direction<00:03:18.150> than<00:03:18.450> he

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
facing the opposite direction than he

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.330 
facing the opposite direction than he
normally<00:03:18.690> would<00:03:19.080> be<00:03:19.230> in<00:03:19.620> this<00:03:19.860> specific

situation you cannot do a normal pivot
need<00:03:22.740> it<00:03:23.250> will<00:03:23.370> just<00:03:23.550> stop<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:23.910> completely

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300

easily fortunately there is a way to

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.110 
easily fortunately there is a way to
pivot<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:28.950> same<00:03:29.130> direction<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:29.700> normally

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
pivot the same direction you normally

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.530 
pivot the same direction you normally
would

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
would

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.570 
would
the<00:03:30.870> downside<00:03:31.320> is<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.710> input<00:03:31.860> is<00:03:32.160> different

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
the downside is the input is different

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.130 
the downside is the input is different
and<00:03:32.730> more<00:03:32.910> strict<00:03:33.240> than<00:03:33.300> a<00:03:33.480> regular<00:03:33.630> pivot

it<00:04:04.830> is<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.010> great<00:04:05.280> move<00:04:05.460> to<00:04:05.670> catch<00:04:05.820> players<00:04:06.090> who

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
it is a great move to catch players who

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.150 
it is a great move to catch players who
fall<00:04:06.510> directly<00:04:06.990> into<00:04:07.320> you<00:04:07.470> instead<00:04:07.740> of<00:04:07.950> trying

fall directly into you instead of trying

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
cover more ground I believe there are

more<00:04:12.900> than<00:04:13.050> one<00:04:13.230> ways<00:04:13.440> to<00:04:13.650> pivot<00:04:13.800> grab<00:04:14.130> but<00:04:14.370> the

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
more than one ways to pivot grab but the

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.280 
more than one ways to pivot grab but the
general<00:04:14.820> way<00:04:14.970> most<00:04:15.270> players<00:04:15.510> seem<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:16.020> do<00:04:16.140> it

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
general way most players seem to do it

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.840 
general way most players seem to do it
is<00:04:16.440> to<00:04:16.560> start<00:04:16.739> dashing<00:04:17.220> in<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.400> opposite

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
is to start dashing in the opposite

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.760 
is to start dashing in the opposite
direction<00:04:18.150> that<00:04:18.330> you<00:04:18.540> want<00:04:18.720> to<00:04:18.810> grab<00:04:19.049> so<00:04:19.650> if

you want to grab an opponent falling
left<00:04:21.330> towards<00:04:21.690> you<00:04:21.870> then<00:04:22.230> you'll<00:04:22.380> start

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
left towards you then you'll start

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.830 
left towards you then you'll start
running<00:04:22.980> to<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.190> left<00:04:23.340> as<00:04:23.550> well<00:04:23.760> as<00:04:24.450> soon<00:04:24.750> as

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
the - animation starts you'll simply

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.460 
the - animation starts you'll simply
immediately<00:04:27.450> press<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.930> opposite<00:04:28.380> direction

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
immediately press the opposite direction

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.320 
immediately press the opposite direction

you dashed on the analog stick while

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.540 
you dashed on the analog stick while

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
at the same time if you do it right you

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.140 
at the same time if you do it right you
should<00:04:34.920> have<00:04:35.040> a<00:04:35.070> sliding<00:04:35.370> animation<00:04:35.970> while

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
should have a sliding animation while

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.030 
should have a sliding animation while
grabbing<00:04:36.390> if<00:04:36.990> you<00:04:37.170> do<00:04:37.290> it<00:04:37.440> wrong<00:04:37.620> you'll

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
grabbing if you do it wrong you'll

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.010 
grabbing if you do it wrong you'll
probably<00:04:38.280> do<00:04:38.640> a<00:04:38.670> smash<00:04:38.970> attack<00:04:39.300> or<00:04:39.540> not<00:04:39.750> move

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
probably do a smash attack or not move

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.720 
probably do a smash attack or not move
it'll<00:04:40.740> take<00:04:40.950> a<00:04:40.980> little<00:04:41.190> practice<00:04:41.700> to

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
it'll take a little practice to
