00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.840

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.429
 I would like to finish others now 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.320
 his idol his head here and there makes you 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:59.019
 it always so that you first that 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.780
 water is one so I 'm doing 500 now 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:07.690
 program the irrigation water because I need 250 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:10.960
 milliliter of water for that now I have 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:14.740
 I already filled the gis mass 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.360
 and I want this in and now 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.360
 people equal under careful 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:43.220
 should definitely not be mass 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.040
 and then this is such a homogeneous amount 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.560
 I can now here before you 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.540
 one fills but I just have to pay attention to that 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.840
 I try no bubbles great too 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.820
 and also that shut up 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.490
 and have a flat area with it 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.650
 I later put my plate on top 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.650
 comes then it said 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.670
 and now comes a bit of it 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.820
 raised and want to have the plate 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:18.760
 I 'm doing about one and a half now 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:20.890
 centimeters to rich and now distributed 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.990
 be careful with the spoon here 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.840
 it just like the cake a smooth 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.750
 surface and that's good too 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.880
 in this little groove on the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:37.060
 Edges do not go anywhere 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:41.310
 what is missing and then oh thereby only 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.510
 wait until it's dried out 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.490
 and I will do the same now 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.590
 here with the yoghurt cup the 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.709
 I fill now with the same gis 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.120
 mass and before we continue this now 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.980
 must be able to process first 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.440
 Dry well for at least two days 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.200
 then I always take that out of shape 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.690
 out and let it then again about three 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.420
 dry in the air for days because of it 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.420
 needs a relatively long time is it right 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.280
 is dry when the mass is now such a 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:25.750
 has about dried out day then you can 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:28.000
 which already bothers and here the 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.370
 It is usually so mug that you there 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.980
 Carve recently knife on the side 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.790
 you have to be careful that you are not 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:40.470
 cuts and then you can do it that way 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.470
 Carefully raise 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.660
 it looks like that but it has to be done now 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.760
 In any case, still a few days through 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.800
 dry out whoever is in a hurry can also 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.959
 at 50 degrees a few hours in the 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.730
 oven then make it dries 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.200
 you can see it by now 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.360
 that is not completely dry because of the 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.860
 back and all is dark and you are 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.950
 even if you notice it almost then 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.630
 there is still some moisture in it 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.430
 if it is well dried then 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.780
 I would now for example by 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.940
 Of course it can also be so 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.980
 remains the color so that is 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.600
 relatively bright or I ask you to 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.370
 example still with the buyer with wise 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.489
 to michael zech also bund once more 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.080
 you also want to know and influence 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.060
 do it again resist-it 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.390
 I do that is just white 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:30.280
 acrylic paint to make it tick again 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:31.750
 brighter and I use, however 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.950
 looks after in the pictures too 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.330
 if I have food now or something 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:41.890
 it is then I just do it 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:43.810
 if so pies paper under it 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.400
 you painted that accordingly 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.460
 or not depending on the taste thing 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.860
 then I have so little buttons here 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.320
 they come down here i live i 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.010
 me, as a kind of protection for the 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:06.250
 table surface so it does not scratch 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:10.300
 just down here and now 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:14.520
 comes montage was namely always around 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.520
 then connect the two parts 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:22.710
 I give it here accordingly 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.710
 a lot of glue on it 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:38.340
 So too much money is not his 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.229
 I was not even squeeze out so 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.370
 should not be on the sides then the 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:48.099
 montage want out glue 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:51.669
 so I have that and then I take 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:54.940
 here the back are my one 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:56.650
 pie plate and now you can do it after 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.810
 feeling or you can of course 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.490
 also measure and then you 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:07.180
 stick in the middle accordingly 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:08.979
 I usually like feeling and then 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.330
 I'm just waiting for a long time 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:12.039
 until the attachment because there you have to 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.130
 I would definitely at least 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:17.740
 wait an hour until you touch 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.720
 can and does not notice there is no more slipping 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:24.789
 and wait a bit longer 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:26.680
 lets him then put on too short if 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:28.539
 then your cake plate is ready 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.979
 you can, for example, right here 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:32.770
 if I have any small ones then 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:34.569
 cake or muffins are extra immediately 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.610
 Paper, for example, in small draws completely 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:39.520
 cute or you can of course 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.949
 also all the decorative elements too 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.620
 always want to make it out 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:47.409
 place whatever works are 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.060
 these bells for example on it and 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:51.940
 you can play it sometimes 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.979
 to eat under it or just too 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.080
 any decorative elements or 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:58.690
 for example, sees flowers or plants 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.759
 It's really beautiful from that 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.980
 This decoration is that here what 

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:04.330
 left has with which one then, so to speak 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.550
 Can make small cakes on those 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.470
 I am also happy now and me 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.330
 I hope it was fun, I'm happy 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.870

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.870
 because they
