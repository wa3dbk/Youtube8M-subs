doesn't<00:00:40.200> look<00:00:40.320> too<00:00:40.530> good<00:00:41.030> so<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.480> color<00:00:42.840> that

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
doesn't look too good so the color that

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.729 
doesn't look too good so the color that
I<00:00:43.230> went<00:00:43.559> with<00:00:43.620> was<00:00:44.129> aqua<00:00:45.230> there<00:00:46.230> was<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> closer

color<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.370> at<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.820> store<00:00:48.059> but<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.809> had<00:00:49.170> gloss

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
color that at the store but it had gloss

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.950 
color that at the store but it had gloss
and<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.219> didn't<00:00:50.579> really<00:00:50.789> want<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:50.969> get<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.300> but

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
and I didn't really want to get that but

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.630 
and I didn't really want to get that but
like<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.289> said<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.649> could<00:00:52.800> get<00:00:53.129> whatever<00:00:53.309> color

you want whatever suits you now for the
paint<00:00:56.550> brush<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.149> recommend<00:00:57.870> using<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.530> soft

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.830 
paint brush I recommend using a soft
paintbrush<00:00:59.370> because<00:00:59.670> you'll<00:01:00.030> get<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> smooth

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
paintbrush because you'll get a smooth

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.420 
paintbrush because you'll get a smooth
look<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.820> Thomas<00:01:03.449> toy<00:01:03.830> as<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.070> can<00:01:05.189> see<00:01:05.309> on

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
look on the Thomas toy as you can see on

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.920 
look on the Thomas toy as you can see on
mine<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.790> not<00:01:05.970> very<00:01:06.180> smooth<00:01:06.390> because<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.750> made

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
mine this not very smooth because I made

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.190 
mine this not very smooth because I made
a<00:01:06.960> lot<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.229> mistakes<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:08.100> next<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.210> purchased<00:01:10.049> a

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
a lot of mistakes so next I purchased a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.950 
a lot of mistakes so next I purchased a
sharpie<00:01:11.090> to<00:01:12.090> draw<00:01:12.810> out<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.880> letters<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.180> I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
sharpie to draw out the letters and I

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.050 
sharpie to draw out the letters and I
couldn't<00:01:16.200> find<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.590> red<00:01:16.799> or<00:01:16.920> yellow<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:18.030> I

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
couldn't find a red or yellow so I

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.240 
couldn't find a red or yellow so I
couldn't<00:01:18.390> draw<00:01:18.689> out<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.920> lbs<00:01:20.850> C<00:01:21.650> so<00:01:22.650> sadly<00:01:22.950> of

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
couldn't draw out the lbs C so sadly of

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.990 
couldn't draw out the lbs C so sadly of
the<00:01:23.400> pin<00:01:23.820> decided<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.049> explode<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.000> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the pin decided to explode and the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
the pin decided to explode and the
paint's<00:01:27.330> start<00:01:27.570> leaking<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:29.960> thought<00:01:30.960> I

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
paint's start leaking and I thought I

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.980 
paint's start leaking and I thought I
ran<00:01:31.320> out<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.530> options<00:01:31.799> but<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:33.000> didn't<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.960> I

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
ran out of options but I didn't I I

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.770 
ran out of options but I didn't I I
thought<00:01:34.799> hey<00:01:35.070> why<00:01:35.700> not<00:01:35.729> cut<00:01:36.150> small<00:01:36.479> thin

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
thought hey why not cut small thin

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.100 
thought hey why not cut small thin
pieces<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.259> paper<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.689> glue<00:01:39.689> them<00:01:39.900> onto

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
pieces of paper and glue them onto

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.249 
pieces of paper and glue them onto
Thomas<00:01:40.439> well<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.369> didn't<00:01:41.790> glue<00:01:42.030> them<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.509> used

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
Thomas well I didn't glue them I used

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.560 
Thomas well I didn't glue them I used
the<00:01:43.799> blue<00:01:43.950> paint<00:01:44.310> as<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> glue<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.390> made<00:01:45.540> it

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the blue paint as a glue so it made it

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.410 
the blue paint as a glue so it made it
easier<00:01:46.170> for<00:01:46.229> me<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.530> do<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.270> it<00:01:48.270> actually

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
easier for me to do that and it actually

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.280 
easier for me to do that and it actually
worked<00:01:48.869> okay<00:01:49.700> now<00:01:50.700> for<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.030> LVS<00:01:51.450> C<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.810> Thomas

it works okay I didn't put the red
around<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.790> letters<00:02:03.149> because<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:04.350> know<00:02:04.469> I

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500
