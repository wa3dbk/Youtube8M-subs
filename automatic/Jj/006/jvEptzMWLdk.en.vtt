00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.720 
and he's never been married had some
talent<00:03:49.920> but<00:03:49.950> his<00:03:50.239> size<00:03:51.239> does<00:03:51.870> not<00:03:52.079> compare<00:03:52.470> to

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
talent but his size does not compare to

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.710 
talent but his size does not compare to
craftsmen's<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:53.910> I<00:03:53.970> think<00:03:54.269> I<00:03:54.360> can<00:03:54.540> already

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
craftsmen's and I think I can already

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.520 
craftsmen's and I think I can already
tell<00:03:55.079> you<00:03:55.290> who<00:03:55.890> will<00:03:56.069> win<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.400> match<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:57.870> but

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
tell you who will win that match and but

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.410 
tell you who will win that match and but
the<00:03:58.650> other<00:03:58.769> reason<00:03:58.980> is<00:03:59.280> jackknife<00:03:59.819> Jacob<00:04:00.269> will

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
the other reason is jackknife Jacob will

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.849 
the other reason is jackknife Jacob will
