hello everybody welcome back to another
episode<00:00:15.490> of<00:00:15.820> minecraft<00:00:16.420> so<00:00:16.960> we<00:00:17.080> have<00:00:17.200> made<00:00:17.440> a

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
episode of minecraft so we have made a

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.840 
episode of minecraft so we have made a
trapdoor<00:00:18.070> armor<00:00:18.790> equipped<00:00:19.180> so<00:00:19.960> it's<00:00:20.470> the<00:00:20.619> same

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
trapdoor armor equipped so it's the same

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.730 
trapdoor armor equipped so it's the same
concept<00:00:21.850> as<00:00:21.939> exuma<00:00:22.540> voice<00:00:22.660> design<00:00:23.080> I<00:00:23.260> will<00:00:23.410> be

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
concept as exuma voice design I will be

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.830 
concept as exuma voice design I will be
put<00:00:23.980> a<00:00:24.010> link<00:00:24.160> in<00:00:24.250> the<00:00:24.369> description<00:00:24.849> but<00:00:25.570> it's

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
put a link in the description but it's

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.589 
put a link in the description but it's
just<00:00:26.169> a<00:00:26.349> hell<00:00:26.560> of<00:00:26.590> a<00:00:26.740> lot<00:00:26.860> smaller<00:00:27.599> swords

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
just a hell of a lot smaller swords

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.200 
just a hell of a lot smaller swords
design<00:00:28.900> was<00:00:29.140> five<00:00:29.739> by<00:00:29.980> five<00:00:30.250> and<00:00:30.579> he<00:00:30.880> said<00:00:31.090> it

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
design was five by five and he said it

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.569 
design was five by five and he said it
was<00:00:31.390> very<00:00:31.960> compact<00:00:32.410> but<00:00:32.650> mine<00:00:32.829> is<00:00:33.070> tree<00:00:33.400> by

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
was very compact but mine is tree by

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.220 
was very compact but mine is tree by
tree<00:00:33.850> so<00:00:34.150> mine<00:00:34.390> is<00:00:34.420> extremely<00:00:35.350> compact<00:00:36.070> so<00:00:37.230> I'm

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
tree so mine is extremely compact so I'm

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.889 
tree so mine is extremely compact so I'm
just<00:00:38.770> going<00:00:38.950> to<00:00:39.040> build<00:00:39.340> like<00:00:39.550> a<00:00:39.579> circuit<00:00:40.090> to<00:00:40.360> to

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
just going to build like a circuit to to

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.860 
just going to build like a circuit to to
get<00:00:41.020> the<00:00:41.170> wiring<00:00:41.380> up<00:00:41.769> because<00:00:42.370> it's<00:00:42.609> like

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
get the wiring up because it's like

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.439 
get the wiring up because it's like
quite<00:00:44.640> unconvinced<00:00:45.640> anding<00:00:45.910> up<00:00:46.000> here<00:00:46.239> that

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
quite unconvinced anding up here that

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.150 
quite unconvinced anding up here that
and<00:00:46.660> then<00:00:46.840> you<00:00:46.960> have<00:00:47.079> to<00:00:47.230> leave<00:00:47.379> you<00:00:47.530> down<00:00:48.100> here

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
and then you have to leave you down here

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.520 
and then you have to leave you down here
so<00:00:48.969> let<00:00:49.210> me<00:00:49.300> just<00:00:49.480> do<00:00:49.660> that<00:00:49.809> I<00:00:49.870> will<00:00:50.050> come<00:00:50.170> right

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
so let me just do that I will come right

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.150 
so let me just do that I will come right
back<00:00:50.800> I<00:00:51.100> have<00:00:52.090> now<00:00:52.269> built<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:52.690> circuit<00:00:53.050> and<00:00:53.199> so

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
back I have now built the circuit and so

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.340 
back I have now built the circuit and so
I<00:00:54.190> just<00:00:54.609> stand<00:00:55.359> in<00:00:55.449> the<00:00:55.510> middle<00:00:55.719> and<00:00:55.960> press<00:00:56.199> the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
I just stand in the middle and press the

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.349 
I just stand in the middle and press the
button<00:00:56.649> and<00:00:56.739> i<00:00:56.920> will<00:00:56.949> get<00:00:57.550> equipped<00:00:57.910> with<00:00:58.059> full

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
button and i will get equipped with full

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:00.959 
button and i will get equipped with full
armor<00:00:59.199> diamond<00:00:59.980> arm<00:01:00.129> or<00:01:00.280> whatever<00:01:00.519> you<00:01:00.670> put<00:01:00.879> in

the dispensers so now let me show you

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.450 
the dispensers so now let me show you
how<00:01:03.339> you<00:01:03.489> built<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.300> thing<00:01:05.130> to<00:01:06.130> build<00:01:06.310> it

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
how you built the thing to build it

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.890 
how you built the thing to build it
you're<00:01:06.580> going<00:01:06.730> to<00:01:06.910> need<00:01:07.060> need<00:01:07.540> these

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
you're going to need need these

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.740 
you're going to need need these
materials<00:01:08.550> these<00:01:09.550> are<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.880> extra<00:01:10.270> materials

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
materials these are the extra materials

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.420 
materials these are the extra materials
if<00:01:10.960> you<00:01:11.020> want<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.470> build<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:11.740> circuit<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:12.250> get

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
if you want to build the circuit to get

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.250 
if you want to build the circuit to get
the<00:01:12.700> wiring<00:01:12.909> down<00:01:13.300> it's<00:01:13.570> very<00:01:13.750> simple<00:01:14.020> and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
the wiring down it's very simple and

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.600 
the wiring down it's very simple and
basic<00:01:14.350> but<00:01:14.770> I<00:01:14.800> am<00:01:14.860> going<00:01:15.040> to<00:01:15.130> show<00:01:15.280> you<00:01:15.310> anyway

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
basic but I am going to show you anyway

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.310 
basic but I am going to show you anyway
so<00:01:16.510> to<00:01:17.470> build<00:01:17.650> the<00:01:18.100> main<00:01:18.280> thing<00:01:18.520> here<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:20.110> need

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
so to build the main thing here you need

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.280 
so to build the main thing here you need
for<00:01:21.040> redstone<00:01:21.430> three<00:01:21.730> torches<00:01:22.060> for<00:01:22.870> repeaters

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
for redstone three torches for repeaters

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.070 
for redstone three torches for repeaters
to<00:01:23.620> stay<00:01:23.860> pistons<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:24.430> for<00:01:24.730> dispensers<00:01:25.270> and

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
to stay pistons and for dispensers and

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.740 
to stay pistons and for dispensers and
ten<00:01:26.740> blocks<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:27.490> put<00:01:27.670> redstone<00:01:27.910> on<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.450> some

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
ten blocks to put redstone on and some

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.590 
ten blocks to put redstone on and some
building<00:01:29.140> blocks<00:01:29.170> and<00:01:29.760> then<00:01:30.760> to<00:01:31.330> build<00:01:31.510> the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
building blocks and then to build the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.170 
building blocks and then to build the
extra<00:01:31.870> circuit<00:01:32.260> you<00:01:32.470> need<00:01:32.620> nine<00:01:33.100> blocks<00:01:33.610> to

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
extra circuit you need nine blocks to

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.870 
extra circuit you need nine blocks to
put<00:01:34.570> redstone<00:01:34.750> on<00:01:35.140> like<00:01:35.950> nine<00:01:36.250> blocks<00:01:36.610> to

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
put redstone on like nine blocks to

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.140 
put redstone on like nine blocks to
build<00:01:37.090> it<00:01:37.810> with<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:38.370> six<00:01:39.370> redstone<00:01:39.790> one

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
build it with and six redstone one

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.740 
build it with and six redstone one
repeater<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:40.540> a<00:01:40.780> button<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:42.510> together<00:01:43.510> we're

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
repeater and a button so together we're

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.400 
repeater and a button so together we're
going<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.110> go<00:01:44.260> over<00:01:44.290> here<00:01:44.890> behind<00:01:45.160> and<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:47.200> need

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
going to go over here behind and we need

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.460 
going to go over here behind and we need
Pistons<00:01:48.060> dispensers<00:01:49.590> redstone<00:01:52.200> will<00:01:53.200> just

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
Pistons dispensers redstone will just

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.180 
Pistons dispensers redstone will just
start<00:01:53.680> by<00:01:53.860> using<00:01:54.010> a<00:01:54.220> lever<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:56.290> is<00:01:56.560> it<00:01:56.830> I

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
start by using a lever and that is it I

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.480 
start by using a lever and that is it I
guess<00:01:57.520> oh<00:01:57.820> yeah<00:01:58.150> we<00:01:58.300> need<00:01:58.420> some<00:01:59.490> building

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
guess oh yeah we need some building

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.760 
guess oh yeah we need some building
blocks<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:01.020> redstone<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:02.140> some<00:02:02.500> building

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.619 
three four five blocks away so we have
five<00:02:12.010> blocks<00:02:12.310> near<00:02:12.459> hotbar<00:02:12.819> but<00:02:13.390> i'm<00:02:13.569> just

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
five blocks near hotbar but i'm just

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.990 
five blocks near hotbar but i'm just
going<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.140> build<00:02:14.319> it<00:02:14.410> above<00:02:14.709> ground<00:02:14.980> so<00:02:15.819> it's

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
going to build it above ground so it's

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.780 
going to build it above ground so it's
easier<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.569> see<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:17.470> in<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.890> middle<00:02:18.130> using<00:02:18.370> put

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
easier to see so in the middle using put

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.640 
easier to see so in the middle using put
two<00:02:19.090> sticky<00:02:19.330> pistons<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:19.900> give<00:02:20.380> block

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
two sticky pistons and give block

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.930 
two sticky pistons and give block
building<00:02:21.100> block<00:02:21.310> above

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
building block above

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.830 
building block above
then<00:02:22.270> put<00:02:22.510> blocks<00:02:22.750> around<00:02:22.990> egg<00:02:23.410> like<00:02:23.680> this<00:02:23.950> and

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
then put blocks around egg like this and

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.830 
then put blocks around egg like this and
put<00:02:25.840> all<00:02:26.020> your<00:02:26.490> dispensers<00:02:27.490> oh<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:30.810> then<00:02:31.810> you

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
put all your dispensers oh and then you

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.950 
put all your dispensers oh and then you
can<00:02:32.230> remove<00:02:32.530> those<00:02:32.920> blocks<00:02:33.400> again<00:02:33.820> so<00:02:34.810> now<00:02:34.900> we

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
can remove those blocks again so now we

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.360 
can remove those blocks again so now we
need<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.260> build<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:35.530> circuit<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:35.920> just<00:02:35.980> build

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
need to build a circuit you just build

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.610 
need to build a circuit you just build
up<00:02:36.550> like<00:02:36.730> this<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.210> make<00:02:38.140> this<00:02:38.170> this<00:02:38.500> is

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
up like this and make this this is

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.080 
up like this and make this this is
basically<00:02:39.010> just<00:02:39.070> a<00:02:39.400> double<00:02:39.760> piston<00:02:39.880> extender

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
basically just a double piston extender

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.540 
basically just a double piston extender
as<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:40.660> have<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> tutorial<00:02:41.140> on<00:02:41.470> you<00:02:42.010> just<00:02:42.280> click

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
as I have a tutorial on you just click

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.460 
as I have a tutorial on you just click
right<00:02:43.300> here<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.630> get<00:02:43.900> a<00:02:43.960> tutorial<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:45.670> I'm

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
right here to get a tutorial so I'm

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.050 
right here to get a tutorial so I'm
building<00:02:47.470> this<00:02:47.740> right<00:02:47.950> now<00:02:48.070> etched<00:02:48.850> on

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
building this right now etched on

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.760 
building this right now etched on
towards<00:02:49.300> like<00:02:49.420> this<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:49.870> repeater<00:02:50.290> on<00:02:50.500> to

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
towards like this and repeater on to

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.250 
towards like this and repeater on to
tick<00:02:51.010> then<00:02:51.850> into<00:02:52.240> a<00:02:52.270> blog<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.660> into<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:52.960> torch

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
tick then into a blog and into a torch

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.230 
tick then into a blog and into a torch
and<00:02:53.470> on<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.370> other<00:02:54.460> side<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:54.850> need<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.090> put

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
and on the other side you need to put

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.940 
and on the other side you need to put
your<00:02:55.300> appear<00:02:55.600> on<00:02:55.780> three<00:02:56.020> ticks<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.500> a<00:02:56.650> sticky

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
your appear on three ticks and a sticky

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.130 
your appear on three ticks and a sticky
piston<00:02:57.100> in<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.400> ground<00:02:57.700> with<00:02:58.330> a<00:02:58.360> block<00:02:58.810> above

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
piston in the ground with a block above

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.340 
piston in the ground with a block above
and<00:02:59.440> then<00:03:00.040> a<00:03:00.280> no<00:03:00.640> repeater<00:03:01.090> on<00:03:01.180> no<00:03:01.810> tick<00:03:02.080> delay

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
and then a no repeater on no tick delay

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.840 
and then a no repeater on no tick delay
and<00:03:02.820> some<00:03:03.820> redstone<00:03:04.000> here<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:06.460> is<00:03:06.610> the

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
and some redstone here so that is the

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.190 
and some redstone here so that is the
double<00:03:07.120> piston<00:03:07.270> extender<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:07.780> let's<00:03:08.140> just

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
double piston extender and let's just

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.430 
double piston extender and let's just
test<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.860> out<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.760> Pistons<00:03:09.970> go<00:03:10.810> down<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.410> the

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
test it out the Pistons go down and the

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.920 
test it out the Pistons go down and the
Pistons<00:03:11.680> go<00:03:12.040> up<00:03:12.280> so<00:03:12.820> that's<00:03:12.940> that's<00:03:13.600> done<00:03:13.900> now

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
Pistons go up so that's that's done now

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.480 
Pistons go up so that's that's done now
so<00:03:14.770> to<00:03:14.830> build<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.820> circuit<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.960> get<00:03:17.170> the

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
so to build the circuit to get the

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.640 
so to build the circuit to get the
dispensers<00:03:18.960> you<00:03:19.960> just<00:03:20.200> need<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.380> put<00:03:20.500> redstone

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
dispensers you just need to put redstone

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.770 
dispensers you just need to put redstone
torch<00:03:21.040> on<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.250> side<00:03:21.430> here<00:03:21.610> from<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.880> front<00:03:22.150> so

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
torch on the side here from the front so

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.750 
torch on the side here from the front so
add<00:03:23.080> some<00:03:23.410> blocks<00:03:23.680> here<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.250> put<00:03:24.430> a<00:03:24.490> repeater

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
add some blocks here to put a repeater

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.750 
add some blocks here to put a repeater
on<00:03:24.910> full<00:03:25.300> take<00:03:25.540> full<00:03:26.200> full<00:03:26.440> delay<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:26.890> put

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
on full take full full delay and put

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.720 
on full take full full delay and put
some<00:03:28.120> dust<00:03:29.020> up<00:03:29.260> here<00:03:29.560> so<00:03:30.070> now<00:03:30.190> these<00:03:30.430> two

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
some dust up here so now these two

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.330 
some dust up here so now these two
dispensers<00:03:31.720> are<00:03:31.900> power<00:03:32.140> when<00:03:32.830> it's<00:03:32.980> go<00:03:33.130> down

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
dispensers are power when it's go down

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.220 
dispensers are power when it's go down
when<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:33.820> goes<00:03:33.970> down<00:03:34.000> so<00:03:34.780> from<00:03:34.959> here<00:03:35.080> you<00:03:35.140> just

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
when it goes down so from here you just

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.770 
when it goes down so from here you just
take<00:03:35.680> this<00:03:35.890> em<00:03:36.310> signal<00:03:37.209> put<00:03:37.510> it<00:03:37.630> down<00:03:37.750> like

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
take this em signal put it down like

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.080 
take this em signal put it down like
this<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.230> put<00:03:38.560> a<00:03:38.620> redstone<00:03:38.770> torch<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.550> the

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
this and put a redstone torch and the

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.910 
this and put a redstone torch and the
block<00:03:40.330> and<00:03:40.540> then<00:03:40.989> some<00:03:41.200> does<00:03:41.380> right<00:03:41.590> here<00:03:41.620> and

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
block and then some does right here and

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.910 
block and then some does right here and
that<00:03:42.220> is<00:03:42.370> it<00:03:42.580> so<00:03:43.390> when<00:03:44.110> you<00:03:44.230> go<00:03:44.380> down<00:03:44.590> it'll<00:03:44.830> say

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
that is it so when you go down it'll say

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.090 
that is it so when you go down it'll say
click<00:03:45.100> click<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:45.459> go<00:03:45.489> up<00:03:45.970> again<00:03:46.270> oh<00:03:47.070> yeah<00:03:48.070> I

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
click click and go up again oh yeah I

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.360 
click click and go up again oh yeah I
put<00:03:48.430> one<00:03:49.120> too<00:03:49.300> many<00:03:49.420> blocks<00:03:49.750> down<00:03:50.020> here<00:03:50.350> and<00:03:50.950> if

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
put one too many blocks down here and if

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.270 
put one too many blocks down here and if
you<00:03:51.459> oops<00:03:52.230> you<00:03:53.230> cannot<00:03:53.440> do<00:03:53.620> this<00:03:53.769> because<00:03:54.010> when

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
you oops you cannot do this because when

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.040 
you oops you cannot do this because when
the<00:03:54.430> piston<00:03:54.760> gets<00:03:55.000> power<00:03:55.269> it<00:03:55.450> will<00:03:55.570> push<00:03:55.840> all

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
the piston gets power it will push all

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.080 
the piston gets power it will push all
of<00:03:56.080> it<00:03:56.260> up<00:03:56.350> you<00:03:56.530> have<00:03:56.739> to<00:03:56.769> have<00:03:57.010> like<00:03:57.580> a<00:03:57.640> space

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
of it up you have to have like a space

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.620 
of it up you have to have like a space
in<00:03:58.330> here<00:03:58.600> so<00:03:59.590> now<00:03:59.890> it<00:04:00.040> should<00:04:00.250> work<00:04:00.430> go<00:04:01.390> down

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
in here so now it should work go down

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.520 
in here so now it should work go down
click<00:04:02.320> click<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:02.709> go<00:04:02.739> up<00:04:03.519> again<00:04:04.140> so<00:04:05.140> let's

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
click click and go up again so let's

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
this lever goes down and up we have all

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.600 
this lever goes down and up we have all
the<00:04:48.060> gmail<00:04:48.840> ammo<00:04:49.050> so<00:04:49.949> now<00:04:50.250> let<00:04:50.400> me<00:04:50.430> show<00:04:50.520> you

the gmail ammo so now let me show you

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.240 
the gmail ammo so now let me show you
how<00:04:50.729> to<00:04:50.820> build<00:04:51.000> a<00:04:51.090> circuit<00:04:51.479> fall<00:04:52.169> for<00:04:53.100> the

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
how to build a circuit fall for the

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.029 
how to build a circuit fall for the
extra<00:04:53.760> wiring<00:04:54.530> are<00:04:55.530> you<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.740> build<00:04:55.889> the

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
extra wiring are you to build the

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.409 
extra wiring are you to build the
circuit<00:04:56.220> you<00:04:56.400> need<00:04:56.520> to<00:04:56.610> remove<00:04:56.880> this<00:04:57.120> lever

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
circuit you need to remove this lever

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.270 
circuit you need to remove this lever
and<00:04:57.690> put<00:04:57.930> a<00:04:57.960> block<00:04:58.260> and<00:04:58.440> it<00:04:58.800> needs<00:04:58.949> to<00:04:59.070> be<00:04:59.250> a

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
and put a block and it needs to be a

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.610 
and put a block and it needs to be a
redstone<00:04:59.639> repeater<00:05:00.330> going<00:05:00.720> into<00:05:01.020> this<00:05:01.380> block

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
redstone repeater going into this block

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.650 
redstone repeater going into this block
else<00:05:01.889> it<00:05:02.190> wont<00:05:02.520> power<00:05:02.729> this<00:05:03.060> redstone<00:05:03.419> down

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
else it wont power this redstone down

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.540 
else it wont power this redstone down
here<00:05:03.930> so<00:05:04.620> then<00:05:04.740> you<00:05:04.830> just<00:05:04.949> put<00:05:05.130> a<00:05:05.160> block<00:05:05.370> behind

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
here so then you just put a block behind

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.790 
here so then you just put a block behind
so<00:05:06.150> the<00:05:06.479> redstone<00:05:06.810> is<00:05:06.840> connected<00:05:07.320> and<00:05:07.410> it<00:05:07.620> just

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
so the redstone is connected and it just

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.680 
so the redstone is connected and it just
build<00:05:08.100> up<00:05:08.310> like<00:05:09.000> a<00:05:09.030> circle<00:05:09.630> up<00:05:10.050> here<00:05:11.120> so<00:05:12.120> all

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
build up like a circle up here so all

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.670 
build up like a circle up here so all
the<00:05:13.199> way<00:05:13.289> up<00:05:13.560> to<00:05:13.590> this<00:05:13.919> to<00:05:14.370> your<00:05:14.520> feet<00:05:14.789> level

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
the way up to this to your feet level

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.560 
the way up to this to your feet level
like<00:05:16.680> this<00:05:16.919> so<00:05:17.130> it's<00:05:17.280> at<00:05:17.460> your<00:05:17.669> feet<00:05:17.880> and<00:05:18.090> then

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
like this so it's at your feet and then

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.050 
like this so it's at your feet and then
you<00:05:18.660> need<00:05:18.810> to<00:05:18.930> put<00:05:19.080> redstone<00:05:19.289> on<00:05:19.770> all<00:05:20.639> of<00:05:20.880> it

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
you need to put redstone on all of it

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.050 
you need to put redstone on all of it
and<00:05:21.210> then<00:05:21.600> you<00:05:21.720> can<00:05:21.870> put<00:05:22.169> some<00:05:23.130> blocks<00:05:23.400> with<00:05:24.030> a

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
and then you can put some blocks with a

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.230 
and then you can put some blocks with a
button<00:05:24.479> on<00:05:24.570> it<00:05:24.630> so<00:05:25.590> you<00:05:25.979> can<00:05:26.639> also<00:05:26.760> you<00:05:26.910> can

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
button on it so you can also you can

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.260 
button on it so you can also you can
only<00:05:27.450> use<00:05:27.570> this<00:05:27.960> if<00:05:28.200> you<00:05:28.260> are<00:05:28.440> and<00:05:28.860> in<00:05:29.610> survival

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
only use this if you are and in survival
