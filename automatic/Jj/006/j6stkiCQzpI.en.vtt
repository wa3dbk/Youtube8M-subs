first of all take a look at right here

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.850 
first of all take a look at right here
with<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.269> motherboard<00:02:09.600> goes<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:10.290> do<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:10.619> a

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
with a motherboard goes you do have a

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.850 
with a motherboard goes you do have a
cpu<00:02:11.519> retention<00:02:12.090> hole<00:02:12.329> so<00:02:13.049> basically<00:02:13.560> if<00:02:13.709> you

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
cpu retention hole so basically if you

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.500 
cpu retention hole so basically if you
want<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.220> change<00:02:14.459> your<00:02:14.519> cpu<00:02:14.970> cooler<00:02:15.269> change

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
your water block you can and that's

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:18.920 
your water block you can and that's
really<00:02:17.880> convenient<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.570> don't<00:02:18.720> think<00:02:18.870> the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
really convenient you don't think the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.780 
really convenient you don't think the
motherboard<00:02:19.169> out<00:02:19.410> which<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.680> big<00:02:20.040> pain<00:02:20.310> you

motherboard out which is a big pain you

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.250 
motherboard out which is a big pain you
just<00:02:20.970> take<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.180> back<00:02:21.329> panel<00:02:21.570> off<00:02:21.780> here<00:02:22.109> and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
just take the back panel off here and

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.990 
just take the back panel off here and
you<00:02:22.799> have<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.250> another<00:02:23.669> thing<00:02:23.790> I

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
you have this another thing I

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.970 
you have this another thing I
you<00:02:24.060> notices<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.510> up<00:02:24.630> here<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.560> can<00:02:25.710> rotate

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
you notices that up here so I can rotate

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.970 
you notices that up here so I can rotate
it<00:02:26.100> there<00:02:26.820> you<00:02:26.910> go<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.750> do<00:02:27.990> have<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.230> big<00:02:28.710> hole

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
it there you go you do have a big hole

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.710 
it there you go you do have a big hole
right<00:02:29.190> here<00:02:29.250> for<00:02:29.550> your<00:02:29.640> cable<00:02:30.030> management<00:02:30.210> so

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
right here for your cable management so

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.410 
right here for your cable management so
you<00:02:31.350> can<00:02:31.500> put<00:02:31.740> cables<00:02:32.100> from<00:02:32.190> behind<00:02:32.580> loop<00:02:33.240> them

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
you can put cables from behind loop them

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.730 
you can put cables from behind loop them
over<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.810> then<00:02:33.930> plug<00:02:34.110> them<00:02:34.260> right<00:02:34.290> into<00:02:34.590> your

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
over and then plug them right into your

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.230 
over and then plug them right into your
motherboard<00:02:35.220> that's<00:02:35.640> going<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:35.880> let<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.060> hide

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
motherboard that's going to let you hide

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.360 
motherboard that's going to let you hide
all<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.540> your<00:02:37.230> cables<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.650> can<00:02:37.740> also<00:02:37.980> kind<00:02:38.220> of

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
all of your cables you can also kind of

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.600 
all of your cables you can also kind of
do<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.550> same<00:02:38.760> thing<00:02:39.030> right<00:02:39.900> over<00:02:39.930> here<00:02:40.490> if<00:02:41.490> you

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
do the same thing right over here if you

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.540 
do the same thing right over here if you
notice<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:42.780> do<00:02:42.990> have<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.470> lot<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:43.860> space<00:02:44.250> right

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
notice you do have a lot of space right

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.460 
notice you do have a lot of space right
here<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:44.970> basically<00:02:45.270> these<00:02:45.390> cables<00:02:45.780> kind<00:02:46.410> of

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
here so basically these cables kind of

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.930 
here so basically these cables kind of
the<00:02:46.620> way<00:02:46.680> they<00:02:46.770> are<00:02:46.860> right<00:02:46.890> now<00:02:47.040> can<00:02:47.490> go<00:02:47.580> behind

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
the way they are right now can go behind

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.670 
the way they are right now can go behind
the<00:02:48.090> plate<00:02:48.330> they<00:02:48.720> can<00:02:48.900> pop<00:02:49.080> out<00:02:49.200> through<00:02:49.410> these

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
the plate they can pop out through these

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.980 
the plate they can pop out through these
two<00:02:49.950> holes<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:51.030> through<00:02:51.360> these<00:02:51.570> two<00:02:51.810> holes

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
two holes and through these two holes

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.199 
two holes and through these two holes
the<00:02:52.260> top<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.650> connect<00:02:52.980> directly<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.790> your

just<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.370> regular<00:03:17.820> type<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:18.330> basically<00:03:18.720> they

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
just the regular type so basically they

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.930 
just the regular type so basically they
kind<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.590> just<00:03:19.650> clip<00:03:20.040> in<00:03:20.220> with<00:03:20.670> these<00:03:20.820> little

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
kind of just clip in with these little

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.280 
kind of just clip in with these little
clips<00:03:21.300> and<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.510> do<00:03:21.600> have<00:03:21.690> little<00:03:21.959> brackets

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
clips and you do have little brackets

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.180 
clips and you do have little brackets
that<00:03:22.410> come<00:03:22.560> in<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.400> bag<00:03:23.610> but<00:03:24.020> regular<00:03:25.190> you

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
that come in the bag but regular you

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.759 
that come in the bag but regular you
know<00:03:26.280> 3.5<00:03:26.910> inch<00:03:27.090> drive<00:03:27.360> base<00:03:27.600> now<00:03:28.440> on<00:03:28.590> top<00:03:28.709> of

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
know 3.5 inch drive base now on top of

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.479 
know 3.5 inch drive base now on top of
that<00:03:28.980> are<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.549> other<00:03:30.769> 43<00:03:31.769> upside<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.220> regular

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
that are the other 43 upside the regular

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.130 
that are the other 43 upside the regular
for<00:03:32.730> 3.5<00:03:33.330> inch<00:03:33.450> drive<00:03:33.600> bays<00:03:33.720> these<00:03:33.840> ones<00:03:34.049> that

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
for 3.5 inch drive bays these ones that

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.830 
for 3.5 inch drive bays these ones that
have<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.320> hot<00:03:34.470> swappable<00:03:35.269> SATA<00:03:36.269> backplanes

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
have the hot swappable SATA backplanes

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.020 
have the hot swappable SATA backplanes
here<00:03:37.110> so<00:03:37.260> basically<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:38.340> can<00:03:38.459> plug<00:03:38.640> your<00:03:38.670> SATA

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
here so basically you can plug your SATA

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.390 
here so basically you can plug your SATA
ports<00:03:39.390> directly<00:03:40.350> in<00:03:40.500> there's<00:03:40.769> your<00:03:40.920> SATA<00:03:41.160> one

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
ports directly in there's your SATA one

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.550 
ports directly in there's your SATA one
SATA<00:03:41.670> 2<00:03:41.910> SATA<00:03:42.180> 3<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.540> side<00:03:42.660> of<00:03:42.750> 4<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:43.140> then

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
SATA 2 SATA 3 and side of 4 and then

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.130 
SATA 2 SATA 3 and side of 4 and then
they<00:03:43.950> power<00:03:44.190> both<00:03:44.790> drives<00:03:45.150> with<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.480> single

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
they power both drives with a single

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.020 
they power both drives with a single
molex<00:03:46.799> so<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.430> don't<00:03:47.549> even<00:03:47.700> really<00:03:47.820> need<00:03:47.940> to

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
molex so you don't even really need to

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.370 
molex so you don't even really need to
have<00:03:48.120> SATA<00:03:48.330> connectors<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:48.959> have<00:03:49.200> SATA

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
have SATA connectors you have SATA

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.110 
have SATA connectors you have SATA
motherboard<00:03:49.890> you're<00:03:50.610> going<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.820> plug<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.060> in

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
motherboard you're going to plug it in

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.580 
motherboard you're going to plug it in
via<00:03:51.239> molex<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:51.840> then<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.049> rest<00:03:52.170> of<00:03:52.260> them<00:03:52.410> is

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
via molex and then the rest of them is

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.690 
via molex and then the rest of them is
all<00:03:52.680> taken<00:03:52.980> care<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.280> don't<00:03:53.430> worry<00:03:53.640> about

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
all taken care of you don't worry about

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.150 
all taken care of you don't worry about
anything<00:03:53.910> else<00:03:54.269> now<00:03:54.840> as<00:03:54.989> far<00:03:55.200> as<00:03:55.350> those<00:03:55.890> go

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
anything else now as far as those go

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.250 
anything else now as far as those go
those<00:03:56.430> go<00:03:56.579> right<00:03:56.610> up<00:03:56.850> here<00:03:56.940> in<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.120> front<00:03:57.269> and

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
those go right up here in the front and

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.680 
those go right up here in the front and
does<00:03:58.620> come<00:03:58.799> with<00:03:58.860> a<00:03:58.950> couple<00:03:59.220> caddies<00:03:59.690> it's

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
does come with a couple caddies it's

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.500 
does come with a couple caddies it's
kind<00:04:00.989> of<00:04:01.049> a<00:04:01.200> click<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:01.860> open<00:04:02.030> there<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.150> go<00:04:03.299> and

kind of a click to open there you go and

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.600 
kind of a click to open there you go and
those<00:04:03.780> are<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.930> caddies<00:04:04.320> to<00:04:05.070> open<00:04:05.370> them<00:04:05.489> is

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
those are the caddies to open them is

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.490 
those are the caddies to open them is
pretty<00:04:05.970> simple<00:04:06.209> I'm<00:04:06.959> doing<00:04:07.200> this<00:04:07.260> backwards

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
pretty simple I'm doing this backwards

pretty simple I'm doing this backwards
on<00:04:07.769> a<00:04:07.799> monitor<00:04:08.010> so<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.670> kind<00:04:09.000> of<00:04:09.030> look<00:04:09.209> awkward

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
on a monitor so I kind of look awkward

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.390 
on a monitor so I kind of look awkward
but<00:04:09.890> because<00:04:10.890> I'm<00:04:10.980> doing<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.250> backwards

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
but because I'm doing it backwards

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.610 
but because I'm doing it backwards

between<00:05:55.260> the<00:05:55.470> the<00:05:56.250> psu<00:05:56.730> and<00:05:57.120> the<00:05:57.330> radiator<00:05:57.660> so

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
between the the psu and the radiator so

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.090 
between the the psu and the radiator so
just<00:05:58.200> keep<00:05:58.260> that<00:05:58.320> in<00:05:58.440> mind<00:05:58.680> there's<00:05:58.950> the

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
just keep that in mind there's the

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.440 
just keep that in mind there's the
raider<00:05:59.250> goes<00:05:59.490> in<00:05:59.610> the<00:05:59.670> top<00:05:59.820> i<00:05:59.880> mean<00:06:00.090> the<00:06:00.180> psu

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
raider goes in the top i mean the psu

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.390 
raider goes in the top i mean the psu
goes<00:06:00.600> on<00:06:00.660> the<00:06:00.750> top<00:06:00.780> so<00:06:01.200> the<00:06:01.980> amount<00:06:02.160> of<00:06:02.220> space

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
goes on the top so the amount of space

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.090 
goes on the top so the amount of space
you<00:06:02.460> have<00:06:02.580> in<00:06:02.970> here<00:06:03.510> is<00:06:03.570> not<00:06:03.840> very<00:06:04.110> much<00:06:04.320> so

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
you have in here is not very much so

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.990 
you have in here is not very much so
keep<00:06:05.220> that<00:06:05.250> in<00:06:05.370> mind<00:06:05.580> but<00:06:05.730> you<00:06:05.820> could

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
keep that in mind but you could

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.490 
keep that in mind but you could
definitely<00:06:06.090> mount<00:06:06.480> something<00:06:06.870> over<00:06:07.080> here<00:06:07.320> and

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
definitely mount something over here and

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.340 
definitely mount something over here and
use<00:06:08.010> it<00:06:08.420> lengthwise<00:06:09.420> across<00:06:09.870> the<00:06:09.990> top<00:06:10.140> of<00:06:10.290> the

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
use it lengthwise across the top of the

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.530 
use it lengthwise across the top of the
great<00:06:10.530> and<00:06:11.310> that's<00:06:11.400> basically<00:06:11.640> a<00:06:11.880> very<00:06:12.240> simple

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
great and that's basically a very simple

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.750 
great and that's basically a very simple
case<00:06:12.720> very<00:06:13.710> simple<00:06:13.980> very<00:06:14.040> affordable<00:06:14.580> but<00:06:14.670> it

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
case very simple very affordable but it

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.100
