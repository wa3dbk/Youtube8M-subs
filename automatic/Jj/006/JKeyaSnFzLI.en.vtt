so now I will take the mobile the
charging<00:01:04.950> will<00:01:05.070> off<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:06.000> see<00:01:06.240> now<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:06.930> lift

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
charging will off you can see now I lift

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.060 
charging will off you can see now I lift
them<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.530> bit<00:01:07.800> the<00:01:08.220> charger<00:01:08.640> oh<00:01:09.740> then<00:01:10.740> again

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
them a bit the charger oh then again

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.160 
them a bit the charger oh then again
I'll<00:01:11.280> keep<00:01:11.610> them<00:01:11.820> away<00:01:12.120> that<00:01:12.750> time<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
I'll keep them away that time the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.290 
I'll keep them away that time the
charging<00:01:13.620> will<00:01:13.800> on<00:01:16.160> see<00:01:17.160> now<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.550> charging<00:01:18.150> is

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
charging will on see now the charging is

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.680 
charging will on see now the charging is
own<00:01:22.100> then<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.430> show<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.790> both<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
own then you can show this both to the

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.150 
own then you can show this both to the
switchboard<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.470> mobile<00:01:25.770> I'll<00:01:25.920> switch

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
switchboard and the mobile I'll switch

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.980 
switchboard and the mobile I'll switch
off<00:01:26.370> that<00:01:26.430> time<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.910> charging<00:01:27.360> will<00:01:27.480> off<00:01:27.630> now

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
off that time the charging will off now

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.100 
off that time the charging will off now
see<00:01:28.260> and<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:29.160> chops<00:01:29.430> now<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.060> charger<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.750> off

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.590 

now<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.410> so<00:01:34.650> both<00:01:34.890> let<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.400> -<00:01:35.760> which<00:01:36.360> box

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
now we can so both let this - which box

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.710 
now we can so both let this - which box
also<00:01:36.840> now<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.560> switch<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.160> see<00:01:38.940> now<00:01:39.390> plus

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
also now I switch on see now plus

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.200 
also now I switch on see now plus
fabulous<00:01:40.260> the<00:01:40.380> charger<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.280> say<00:01:41.700> no<00:01:41.910> charge

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
fabulous the charger is on say no charge

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.630 
fabulous the charger is on say no charge
there<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.660> the<00:01:43.590> principle<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.280> nothing

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
there is so the principle is nothing

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.400 
there is so the principle is nothing
this<00:01:44.940> is<00:01:45.259> see<00:01:46.259> here<00:01:47.160> that<00:01:47.490> induction<00:01:48.200> see<00:01:49.200> this

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
this is see here that induction see this

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.749 
this is see here that induction see this
mobile<00:01:49.800> I'll<00:01:49.979> take<00:01:50.190> out<00:01:50.810> you<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:52.020> see<00:01:52.229> this

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
mobile I'll take out you can see this

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:59.570 
mobile I'll take out you can see this
induction<00:01:54.229> see<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:56.270> if<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.509> will<00:01:57.660> show<00:01:58.009> see<00:01:59.009> this

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
induction see so if I will show see this

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.630 
induction see so if I will show see this
is<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.790> charger

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
is the charger

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.890 
is the charger
nice<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.850> strong<00:02:03.000> each<00:02:03.180> other<00:02:04.310> see

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
nice and strong each other see

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.140 
nice and strong each other see
this<00:02:07.500> inductor<00:02:08.070> so<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:10.580> switch<00:02:11.580> off<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.940> phone

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
this inductor so I switch off the phone

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.390 
this inductor so I switch off the phone
with<00:02:12.390> somebody<00:02:12.840> calling<00:02:13.170> when<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.530> came<00:02:13.680> at<00:02:14.220> it

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
with somebody calling when I came at it

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.520 
with somebody calling when I came at it
it<00:02:14.640> will<00:02:14.850> switch<00:02:15.030> on<00:02:15.240> here<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.510> kept<00:02:16.020> say<00:02:16.260> that

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
it will switch on here I kept say that

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.030 
it will switch on here I kept say that
to<00:02:16.710> no<00:02:16.890> fear<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.430> use<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.360> coil<00:02:18.750> here<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.830> can

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
to no fear I use the coil here you can

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.880 
to no fear I use the coil here you can
see<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.400> coil<00:02:22.610> so<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.900> is<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.020> coil<00:02:25.320> that

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
see the coil so that is the coil that

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.240 
see the coil so that is the coil that
will<00:02:26.040> induce<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:27.390> if<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.840> keep<00:02:28.080> this<00:02:29.040> between

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
will induce so if I keep this between

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.110 
will induce so if I keep this between
charge<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:32.990> there<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.140> I'll<00:02:34.380> show<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:34.860> again

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
charge so there is I'll show you again

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.730 
charge so there is I'll show you again
see<00:02:37.910> this<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.120> induction<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.720> wrote<00:02:39.930> so

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
see this is the induction I wrote so

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.310 
see this is the induction I wrote so
when<00:02:41.070> I<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:42.030> mobile<00:02:42.390> is<00:02:42.540> coming<00:02:42.810> close<00:02:43.020> let's

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
when I the mobile is coming close let's

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.730 
when I the mobile is coming close let's
see<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.920> mobile<00:02:44.070> is<00:02:44.370> charging<00:02:48.410> no<00:02:49.410> need<00:02:49.620> of

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
see the mobile is charging no need of

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.250 
see the mobile is charging no need of
touching<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:51.000> for<00:02:51.209> that<00:02:51.390> only<00:02:51.660> I<00:02:51.810> kept<00:02:52.050> this

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
touching so for that only I kept this

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.790 
touching so for that only I kept this
book<00:02:52.400> this<00:02:53.400> book<00:02:53.459> or<00:02:53.910> card<00:02:54.180> or<00:02:54.360> anything<00:02:54.800> this

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
book this book or card or anything this

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.360 
book this book or card or anything this
small<00:02:55.950> any<00:02:56.310> paper<00:02:56.640> or<00:02:59.150> paper<00:03:01.070> that<00:03:02.070> is<00:03:02.280> the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
small any paper or paper that is the

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.210 
small any paper or paper that is the
cabinet<00:03:02.880> itself<00:03:03.209> then<00:03:03.570> if<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.959> keep<00:03:07.070> then<00:03:08.070> it

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
cabinet itself then if I keep then it

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.250 
cabinet itself then if I keep then it
will<00:03:08.370> charge

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.559 

so<00:03:12.770> there<00:03:12.950> is<00:03:13.129> no<00:03:13.340> need<00:03:13.550> of<00:03:13.610> any<00:03:13.879> connector

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
so there is no need of any connector
