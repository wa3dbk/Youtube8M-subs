00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.279 
the front here you'll see there's a port
where<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:08.090> audio<00:02:09.090> goes<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:09.780> oh<00:02:09.869> how<00:02:10.080> well

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
where the audio goes in and oh how well

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.500 
where the audio goes in and oh how well
you<00:02:10.530> can<00:02:10.680> actually<00:02:11.070> see<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.580> but<00:02:12.300> basically

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
you can actually see that but basically

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.670 
you can actually see that but basically
the<00:02:13.080> camera

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the camera

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.580 
the camera
self<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.790> completely<00:02:15.390> manual<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.200> even

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
self is completely manual so you even

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.530 
self is completely manual so you even
have<00:02:16.769> a<00:02:16.799> focus<00:02:17.430> ring<00:02:17.730> on<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:17.939> front<00:02:18.150> here

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
have a focus ring on the front here

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.110 
have a focus ring on the front here
where<00:02:18.989> you<00:02:19.140> can<00:02:19.409> dial<00:02:20.219> in<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.579> perfect<00:02:20.609> focus

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
where you can dial in the perfect focus

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.580 
where you can dial in the perfect focus
if<00:02:21.450> you're<00:02:21.599> zooming<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:22.049> on<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.290> guitar

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
if you're zooming in on the guitar

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.949 
if you're zooming in on the guitar
fingerboard<00:02:23.010> or<00:02:23.400> whatnot<00:02:23.579> and<00:02:23.969> then<00:02:24.599> you

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
fingerboard or whatnot and then you

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.990 
fingerboard or whatnot and then you
control<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.379> settings<00:02:26.040> just<00:02:26.280> up<00:02:26.519> front<00:02:26.760> here

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
control the settings just up front here

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.539 
control the settings just up front here
from<00:02:27.299> the<00:02:27.540> main<00:02:28.019> display<00:02:28.409> screen<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.219> you

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
from the main display screen that you

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.500 
from the main display screen that you
can<00:02:29.579> see<00:02:29.819> right<00:02:30.000> here

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
can see right here

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.129 
can see right here
so<00:02:31.139> the<00:02:31.920> camera<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.400> very<00:02:32.459> manual<00:02:32.969> one<00:02:33.959> other

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:34.139 
so the camera is very manual one other

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:35.240 
so the camera is very manual one other
thing<00:02:34.409> I<00:02:34.469> like<00:02:34.650> about<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.950> has<00:02:35.099> got<00:02:35.219> a

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
thing I like about it has got a

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.640 
thing I like about it has got a
headphone<00:02:35.519> out<00:02:36.060> jack<00:02:36.359> so<00:02:36.719> right<00:02:36.930> here<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.260> can

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
headphone out jack so right here I can

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.949 
headphone out jack so right here I can
listen<00:02:38.219> with<00:02:38.879> my<00:02:39.090> headphones<00:02:39.299> to<00:02:39.810> know

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
listen with my headphones to know

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.649 
listen with my headphones to know
exactly<00:02:40.709> what<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.579> sound<00:02:41.879> is<00:02:42.120> like<00:02:42.180> that's

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
exactly what the sound is like that's

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.110 
exactly what the sound is like that's
going<00:02:43.349> getting<00:02:43.680> recorded<00:02:44.159> now<00:02:44.879> if<00:02:44.969> we<00:02:45.090> just

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
going getting recorded now if we just

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.479 
going getting recorded now if we just
move<00:02:45.510> over<00:02:45.689> quickly<00:02:46.139> to<00:02:46.349> the<00:02:47.099> computer

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
move over quickly to the computer

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.460 
move over quickly to the computer
because<00:02:47.609> I<00:02:47.760> record<00:02:48.269> directly<00:02:48.930> into<00:02:49.319> my

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
because I record directly into my

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.970 
because I record directly into my
computer<00:02:50.069> so<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:51.120> can<00:02:51.359> see<00:02:51.569> here<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.709> can

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
computer so you can see here that I can

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.599 
computer so you can see here that I can
get<00:02:53.489> a<00:02:53.519> shot<00:02:53.819> of<00:02:54.090> what<00:02:54.599> I'm<00:02:55.220> seeing<00:02:56.220> through

get a shot of what I'm seeing through

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.000 
get a shot of what I'm seeing through
the<00:02:56.639> cam<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.389> I<00:02:58.019> can<00:02:58.200> control<00:02:58.590> all<00:02:58.709> my<00:02:58.859> editing

I<00:03:24.780> use<00:03:25.530> these<00:03:25.970> apex<00:03:26.970> mics<00:03:27.389> they're<00:03:27.720> condenser

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
I use these apex mics they're condenser

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.250 
I use these apex mics they're condenser
mic<00:03:28.819> they<00:03:29.819> require<00:03:30.150> phantom<00:03:30.659> power<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.109> you'll

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
mic they require phantom power so you'll

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.990 
mic they require phantom power so you'll
have<00:03:31.349> people<00:03:31.650> check<00:03:32.189> out<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.430> mixer<00:03:32.790> in<00:03:32.909> a

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
have people check out the mixer in a

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.610 
have people check out the mixer in a
moment<00:03:33.299> I<00:03:33.359> just<00:03:33.540> use<00:03:33.689> them<00:03:33.870> as<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:34.019> boom<00:03:34.349> mic

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
moment I just use them as a boom mic

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.449 
moment I just use them as a boom mic
over<00:03:34.859> top<00:03:35.189> of<00:03:35.810> where<00:03:36.810> I'm<00:03:37.139> doing<00:03:37.409> the<00:03:37.769> guitar

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
over top of where I'm doing the guitar

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.460 
over top of where I'm doing the guitar
lessons<00:03:38.939> and<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.419> can<00:03:39.569> see<00:03:39.689> it's<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:40.049> fairly

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
lessons and you can see it's a fairly

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.319 
lessons and you can see it's a fairly
decent<00:03:40.739> mic<00:03:41.069> stand<00:03:41.340> never<00:03:41.549> cheap<00:03:41.849> out<00:03:42.030> on<00:03:42.060> your

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
decent mic stand never cheap out on your

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.640 
decent mic stand never cheap out on your
mics<00:03:42.509> downs<00:03:42.840> it's<00:03:43.109> really<00:03:43.290> important<00:03:43.620> that

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
mics downs it's really important that

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.460 
mics downs it's really important that
you<00:03:43.799> get<00:03:43.889> decent<00:03:44.310> mic<00:03:44.430> stands<00:03:44.989> but<00:03:45.989> these<00:03:46.349> are

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
you get decent mic stands but these are

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.770 
you get decent mic stands but these are
great<00:03:46.590> mics<00:03:46.949> they're<00:03:47.639> fairly<00:03:48.030> inexpensive<00:03:48.150> I

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
great mics they're fairly inexpensive I

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.479 
great mics they're fairly inexpensive I
think<00:03:48.930> they're<00:03:49.019> about<00:03:49.169> $100<00:03:49.979> for<00:03:50.009> a<00:03:50.250> matched

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
think they're about $100 for a matched

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.509 
think they're about $100 for a matched
pair<00:03:50.669> they<00:03:51.569> have<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.810> drop-down<00:03:52.319> on<00:03:52.859> them<00:03:53.069> where

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
pair they have a drop-down on them where

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.509 
pair they have a drop-down on them where
you<00:03:53.639> can<00:03:53.870> take<00:03:54.870> down<00:03:55.109> minus<00:03:55.650> 10<00:03:55.859> DB<00:03:56.069> that's

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
you can take down minus 10 DB that's

construction amps in a another lamp over

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.460 
construction amps in a another lamp over
here<00:04:16.259> but<00:04:16.829> let's<00:04:17.220> go<00:04:17.370> over<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.780> mixer<00:04:19.229> I

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
here but let's go over to the mixer I

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.149 
here but let's go over to the mixer I
just<00:04:20.039> use<00:04:20.190> a<00:04:20.220> little<00:04:20.579> 402<00:04:21.180> Mackie<00:04:21.719> mixer<00:04:22.380> and

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
just use a little 402 Mackie mixer and

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.879 
just use a little 402 Mackie mixer and
this<00:04:23.490> cable<00:04:23.789> here<00:04:24.029> these

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
this cable here these

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.159 
this cable here these
in<00:04:26.189> show<00:04:26.520> they<00:04:26.849> come<00:04:27.060> out<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.360> 1/8<00:04:27.719> Jack

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
in show they come out of the 1/8 Jack

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.559 
in show they come out of the 1/8 Jack
stereo<00:04:29.129> and<00:04:29.400> then<00:04:29.490> they<00:04:29.580> go<00:04:29.729> into<00:04:29.939> a<00:04:30.060> left<00:04:30.360> and

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:30.569 
stereo and then they go into a left and

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.110 
stereo and then they go into a left and
right<00:04:30.629> channel<00:04:31.259> here<00:04:31.560> on<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:32.219> mixer<00:04:32.639> and<00:04:32.789> the

right channel here on the mixer and the

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.110 
right channel here on the mixer and the
mixer<00:04:33.389> has<00:04:33.509> fountain<00:04:34.020> power<00:04:34.229> because<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:35.120> the

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
mixer has fountain power because the the

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.600 
mixer has fountain power because the the
microphones<00:04:36.569> require<00:04:36.719> that<00:04:37.279> but<00:04:38.279> I<00:04:38.340> can<00:04:38.490> get

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
microphones require that but I can get

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.080 
microphones require that but I can get
all<00:04:38.699> my<00:04:38.729> levels<00:04:39.529> balanced<00:04:40.529> out<00:04:40.650> here<00:04:40.979> right<00:04:41.969> on

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
all my levels balanced out here right on

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.659 
all my levels balanced out here right on
the<00:04:42.180> mixer<00:04:42.599> and<00:04:43.009> anything<00:04:44.009> just<00:04:44.189> double<00:04:44.460> check

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
the mixer and anything just double check

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.089 
the mixer and anything just double check

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
it very quickly on the computer to see

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:48.980 
it very quickly on the computer to see
that<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.460> levels<00:04:47.819> are<00:04:48.060> working<00:04:48.870> and

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
that the levels are working and

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.719

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
you know the levels are too hot I can

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.739 
you know the levels are too hot I can
adjust<00:04:53.039> them<00:04:53.279> if<00:04:53.400> they're<00:04:53.610> not<00:04:54.029> loud<00:04:54.300> enough

00:04:54.739 --> 00:04:54.749 
adjust them if they're not loud enough

having some trouble with the auto fool
this<00:05:14.819> is<00:05:14.969> what<00:05:15.060> I<00:05:15.090> mean<00:05:15.300> about<00:05:15.569> cameras<00:05:16.439> that

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
this is what I mean about cameras that

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.700 
this is what I mean about cameras that
have<00:05:16.650> look<00:05:17.580> at<00:05:17.699> that<00:05:17.849> that<00:05:18.779> have<00:05:18.990> auto<00:05:19.259> focus

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
have look at that that have auto focus

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.649 
have look at that that have auto focus
on<00:05:19.830> them<00:05:19.949> you<00:05:20.039> can't<00:05:20.339> control<00:05:20.819> you<00:05:21.360> know<00:05:21.479> it'll

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
on them you can't control you know it'll

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.749 
on them you can't control you know it'll
kind<00:05:21.870> of<00:05:21.930> go<00:05:22.080> and<00:05:22.229> zoom<00:05:22.289> in<00:05:22.710> on<00:05:22.830> background<00:05:23.460> or

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
kind of go and zoom in on background or

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.550 
kind of go and zoom in on background or
you<00:05:23.999> know<00:05:24.060> zoom<00:05:24.300> in<00:05:24.479> on<00:05:24.599> the<00:05:24.719> front<00:05:25.020> you<00:05:25.469> know

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
you know zoom in on the front you know

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.230 
you know zoom in on the front you know
if<00:05:25.620> you're<00:05:25.770> gonna<00:05:25.889> be<00:05:25.979> filming<00:05:26.400> with<00:05:26.610> just<00:05:27.180> a

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
if you're gonna be filming with just a

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.879 
if you're gonna be filming with just a
basic<00:05:27.389> over-the-counter<00:05:28.110> camera<00:05:28.650> the<00:05:28.740> one

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
basic over-the-counter camera the one

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.249 
basic over-the-counter camera the one
recommendation<00:05:29.310> that<00:05:29.849> I<00:05:29.909> would<00:05:30.120> make<00:05:30.449> is<00:05:30.930> to

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 
recommendation that I would make is to

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:34.219 
recommendation that I would make is to
have<00:05:31.379> some<00:05:31.680> kind<00:05:31.710> of<00:05:32.009> background<00:05:32.750> that's<00:05:33.750> flat

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
have some kind of background that's flat

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.350 
have some kind of background that's flat
you<00:05:34.439> know<00:05:34.529> maybe<00:05:34.710> like<00:05:34.919> a<00:05:34.949> black<00:05:35.430> curtain<00:05:36.029> or

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
you know maybe like a black curtain or

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.269 
you know maybe like a black curtain or
something<00:05:36.389> behind<00:05:36.870> your<00:05:37.319> guitar<00:05:37.740> neck<00:05:37.979> and

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:38.279 
something behind your guitar neck and

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:40.189 
something behind your guitar neck and
then<00:05:38.580> you<00:05:38.699> won't<00:05:38.879> have<00:05:39.029> all<00:05:39.089> those<00:05:39.419> focusing

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
then you won't have all those focusing

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.350 
then you won't have all those focusing
problems<00:05:40.650> having<00:05:41.460> some<00:05:41.639> difficulty<00:05:42.149> getting
