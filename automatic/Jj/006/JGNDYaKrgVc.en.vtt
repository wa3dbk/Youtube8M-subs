00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
here two gigs of ram it's black windows

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.429 
here two gigs of ram it's black windows
7<00:00:23.970> 320<00:00:24.930> gigabyte<00:00:25.289> hard<00:00:25.439> drive<00:00:25.609> until<00:00:26.609> Adam<00:00:27.029> and

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
7 320 gigabyte hard drive until Adam and

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.830 
7 320 gigabyte hard drive until Adam and
280<00:00:28.439> processor<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.670> one<00:00:29.789> has<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.240> 3-cell

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
280 processor and this one has a 3-cell

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.709 
280 processor and this one has a 3-cell
battery<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.500> why<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.460> 1080<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.210> chase<00:00:33.480> of

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
battery so why it's a 1080 a chase of

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:48.560 
battery so why it's a 1080 a chase of
horses<00:00:42.649> alright<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:47.239> let's<00:00:48.239> go<00:00:48.329> ahead<00:00:48.450> open

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570
