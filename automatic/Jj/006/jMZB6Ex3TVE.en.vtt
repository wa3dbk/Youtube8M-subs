00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.550
 only of the sales package 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.070
 of the station 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.660

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.180

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.980

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.290
 let's start with the smartphone 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.100
 obviously this is a pack of 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:48.390
 for rehearsals and journalists 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.570

 we put it here after we go to see it 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.720
 more closely and we go instead to open 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.260
 the packaging of the station where 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.770
 we find practically only the 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:20.250
 10.1-inch tablet that we try a 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.100
 moment to remove ok and below 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.930
 instead quick use manuals e 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.890
 nothing else 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.500
 then also we put aside this 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.960
 package I speak to you a little 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.960
 technical features we have the for 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.079
 a smartphone a 5-inch display 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.180
 therefore with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.770
 full hd maybe we start to turn it on 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.350
 15 5-inch processor display 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.560
 qualcomm snapdragon 8 about 800 quads 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.399
 core from 2.2 giverso gpu adreno a330 e 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.740
 two gigabytes of ram internal memory is 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.790
 16 gigabytes expandable 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:02.670
 fortunately through the micro sd 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.619
 then up to an additional 64 gigabytes 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.200
 we then have a rear camera from 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.000
 13 megapixel with LED flash that allows 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.670
 to record videos up to 1080p wines in 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.090
 full hd 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.910
 and 2-megapixel front 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.730
 the android version is 4.2.2 we do 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.040
 a physical overview we have capsule of 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.480
 fly to the top with camera 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.000
 front proximity sensor e 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.300
 brightness and the asus logo below 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.440
 in addition to the three soft touch keys that are 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.760
 present here back and back home e 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.250
 multitasking 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.390
 we have already given and mm and a half with the 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.269
 microphone for deletion of 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.590
 rustling on the right the key 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.480
 turning on estimation and switching off 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.030
 this volume barbell is that 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.980
 it had to be a speaker at the bottom 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:53.110
 instead the micro usb port with the pin for 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.380
 the station is the main microphone 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.850
 on the left instead of microsim slot 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.850
 friend's sim and expansion slot 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.350
 micro sd cover and device is 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.769
 all aluminum really a 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.799
 nice material and with first impact it seems 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:12.190
 really that conveys that feeling 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.750
 the first ones very but very beautiful here is a 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.209
 leap of the logo and their pad go 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.609
 camera with LED flash and this 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.060
 small strip presumably in 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:24.190
 rubber or polycarbonate between the two 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.380
 we see between the two aluminum parts 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.380
 but more closely to the station than how 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.459
 always here for the housing for the 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.340
 smartphone 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.220
 we have a 10.1 display process 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.829
 inches with 1920 x 1200 resolution 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.140
 pixel and therefore higher than full hd 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.160
 the front camera while for 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.959
 regarding back camera 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.500
 obviously that of the is used 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.019
 smartphone 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.940
 let's try to put the smartphone 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:53.170
 within the of the attitude and 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.569
 so how do you see it very much 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.980
 simple the smartphone is transformed 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.120
 in a tablet thanks to the station la 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.910
 station also has an additional battery 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.100
 so thanks to which to charge the 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.109
 device and we will find all of them 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.700
 applications all and all programs 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.769
 the things we had open 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.090
 simultaneously on the tablet but 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.069
 this of this palermo inside 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.380
 of the complete review a point of 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.329
 physical view we have the button here 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.909
 ignition if necessary pearl shut-off 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.569
 for the station on the right we have the 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:26.979
 micro usb port in the lower right corner of the 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:29.409
 part where we have nothing on 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.770
 left the volume rocker instead 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:35.199
 in the back instead 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.569
 the housing for the device 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.979
 to the system speaker and how 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.020
 you see this housing is 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:44.189
 slightly protruding slightly 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.659
 compared to the surface of the tablet 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:48.939
 we will test this device thoroughly in 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:50.710
 these days meanwhile as always 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:52.810
 you can take the opportunity to talk to us 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.610
 yours your questions, ask yours 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.080
 trivia to which we will respond 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.620
 obviously within the review 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.169
 full 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.990
 I would say that for the moment it is all asus 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.780
 pad house nu pad with endless sayings 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.590
