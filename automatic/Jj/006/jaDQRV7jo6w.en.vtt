their<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.950> base<00:03:15.190> is<00:03:15.400> closest<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:15.940> their<00:03:16.120> spawn

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
their to base is closest to their spawn

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.130 
their to base is closest to their spawn
sometimes<00:03:16.989> three<00:03:17.410> are<00:03:17.620> easy<00:03:18.489> takes<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.630> oh

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
sometimes three are easy takes and oh

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.190 
sometimes three are easy takes and oh
