00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:56.069 
almost fatally you actually have a

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:58.279 
almost fatally you actually have a
chance<00:00:56.159> to<00:00:56.670> cling<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:56.969> life<00:00:57.149> as<00:00:57.569> it<00:00:57.780> seems<00:00:58.019> so

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
chance to cling to life as it seems so

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.319 
chance to cling to life as it seems so
what<00:00:58.499> how<00:00:58.620> does<00:00:58.679> that<00:00:58.920> work<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.699> when<00:01:00.089> you<00:01:00.209> go

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
what how does that work so when you go

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.199 
what how does that work so when you go
down<00:01:00.569> everyone<00:01:01.469> liked<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.789> not<00:01:02.940> class

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:03.209 
down everyone liked it's not class

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:05.090

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
progress through but if that class

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.170 
progress through but if that class
doesn't<00:01:31.920> do<00:01:32.160> that<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.550> whole<00:01:32.670> team<00:01:32.850> pickles

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
doesn't do that the whole team pickles

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.170 
doesn't do that the whole team pickles
falls<00:01:33.360> apart<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:33.990> what<00:01:34.410> we<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:35.180> these

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
falls apart so what we have is these

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.090 
falls apart so what we have is these
team<00:01:36.480> play<00:01:36.660> interactions<00:01:37.260> that<00:01:37.500> anyone<00:01:37.950> can

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
team play interactions that anyone can

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.310 
team play interactions that anyone can
do<00:01:38.220> at<00:01:38.400> any<00:01:38.520> given<00:01:38.820> time<00:01:38.970> how<00:01:39.900> many<00:01:40.050> different

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
do at any given time how many different

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.810 
do at any given time how many different
classes<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.830> loadouts<00:01:41.160> can<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.430> choose<00:01:41.640> from

come up with that so basically we needed

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.240 
come up with that so basically we needed
like<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:52.960> basically<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.410> killcam<00:02:53.770> that<00:02:54.010> that

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
like a basically a killcam that that

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.700 
like a basically a killcam that that
that<00:02:54.490> could<00:02:54.970> go<00:02:55.150> back<00:02:55.360> in<00:02:55.390> time<00:02:55.570> but<00:02:56.350> since<00:02:56.530> you
