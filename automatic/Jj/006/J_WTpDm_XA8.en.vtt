now<00:02:55.440> more<00:02:55.920> than<00:02:56.069> likely<00:02:56.310> he<00:02:57.269> probably<00:02:57.690> won't

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
now more than likely he probably won't

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.990 
now more than likely he probably won't
get<00:02:58.290> one<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:59.010> reason<00:02:59.340> he<00:02:59.400> probably<00:02:59.579> won't<00:02:59.849> get

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
get one the reason he probably won't get

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.640 
get one the reason he probably won't get
one<00:03:00.209> is<00:03:00.389> because<00:03:00.569> of<00:03:00.780> all<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.139> trouble<00:03:01.349> he<00:03:01.500> got

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
one is because of all the trouble he got

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.440 
one is because of all the trouble he got
into<00:03:01.980> while<00:03:02.220> he<00:03:02.400> was<00:03:02.489> out<00:03:02.609> at<00:03:02.790> copper<00:03:03.060> Erica
