00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.730 
the middle and then you have the two
different<00:03:31.130> sides<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:36.260> water<00:03:36.470> is<00:03:36.680> very

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
important as well for humidity and when

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.440 
important as well for humidity and when
it<00:03:39.800> comes<00:03:39.920> time<00:03:40.130> to<00:03:40.190> shed<00:03:40.490> I<00:03:40.520> do<00:03:40.700> put<00:03:41.180> them<00:03:41.300> into

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.030 
for them to slide out of their old skin
