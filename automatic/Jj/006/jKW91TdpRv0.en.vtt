00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
theme of global warming what will happen

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.279 
theme of global warming what will happen
if<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.640> do<00:01:08.759> something<00:01:09.060> or<00:01:09.810> what<00:01:09.930> will<00:01:10.049> happen

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
if we do something or what will happen

something<00:01:31.460> was<00:01:32.180> was<00:01:32.810> very<00:01:32.990> clever<00:01:33.290> because

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
something was was very clever because

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.280 
something was was very clever because
yes<00:01:34.310> I<00:01:34.490> identifies<00:01:35.090> all<00:01:35.120> the<00:01:35.450> problems<00:01:35.900> but<00:01:36.200> it

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
yes I identifies all the problems but it

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.540 
yes I identifies all the problems but it
also<00:01:36.440> makes<00:01:36.740> them<00:01:36.920> think<00:01:37.100> about<00:01:37.190> solutions

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
also makes them think about solutions

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.000 
also makes them think about solutions
and<00:01:38.120> that<00:01:38.660> really<00:01:39.080> came<00:01:39.230> across<00:01:39.560> during<00:01:39.830> the

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
and that really came across during the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.130 
and that really came across during the
presentations<00:01:40.820> they<00:01:41.240> were<00:01:41.300> aware<00:01:41.720> of<00:01:41.780> the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
presentations they were aware of the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.780 
presentations they were aware of the
issues<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:42.770> yet<00:01:43.220> they<00:01:43.340> were<00:01:43.430> thinking

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
issues and yet they were thinking

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.710 
issues and yet they were thinking
positively<00:01:44.330> about<00:01:44.540> how<00:01:45.020> we<00:01:45.080> can<00:01:45.290> solve<00:01:45.470> them

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.530 

we<00:01:50.720> had<00:01:50.900> Heather<00:01:51.080> read<00:01:51.410> along<00:01:51.920> today<00:01:52.100> who<00:01:52.430> is<00:01:53.360> a

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
we had Heather read along today who is a

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.720 
we had Heather read along today who is a
well-known<00:01:53.980> meteorologist<00:01:54.980> so<00:01:55.280> she<00:01:55.340> was<00:01:55.610> well

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
well-known meteorologist so she was well

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.770

pleased to share today's event and she

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.090 
pleased to share today's event and she
was<00:01:59.900> able<00:01:59.990> to<00:02:00.200> expand<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.770> points

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
was able to expand and the points

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.620 
was able to expand and the points
children<00:02:01.490> were<00:02:01.580> maybe<00:02:01.730> touching<00:02:02.030> on<00:02:02.300> but<00:02:02.480> your

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
children were maybe touching on but your

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.730 
children were maybe touching on but your
thoughts<00:02:02.810> create<00:02:03.140> that<00:02:03.260> she<00:02:03.380> has<00:02:03.500> a<00:02:03.530> knowledge

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
thoughts create that she has a knowledge

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.490 
thoughts create that she has a knowledge
to<00:02:04.040> do<00:02:04.160> that<00:02:04.340> we<00:02:05.000> also<00:02:05.120> had<00:02:05.390> a<00:02:05.570> close<00:02:06.200> mayor

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
to do that we also had a close mayor

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.050 
to do that we also had a close mayor

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
these schools have come together for

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.560 
these schools have come together for
this<00:03:35.530> sort<00:03:35.770> of<00:03:35.860> event<00:03:36.130> because<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:36.910> really<00:03:37.180> am

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
this sort of event because it really am

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.980 
this sort of event because it really am
it<00:03:38.160> extends<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.310> impact<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.270> reach<00:03:40.510> for

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
it extends the impact and the reach for

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.690 
it extends the impact and the reach for
the<00:03:41.110> messages<00:03:41.590> that<00:03:41.650> we're<00:03:42.010> hearing<00:03:42.550> about

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
the messages that we're hearing about

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.449 
the messages that we're hearing about
today<00:03:43.090> so<00:03:43.780> I<00:03:43.810> think<00:03:43.930> it<00:03:44.110> really<00:03:44.140> will<00:03:44.560> embed

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
today so I think it really will embed

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.630 
today so I think it really will embed
across<00:03:46.240> the<00:03:46.570> community<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.350> across

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
across the community and across

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.580 
across the community and across
education<00:03:48.640> as<00:03:48.850> a<00:03:48.880> result<00:03:49.390> of<00:03:49.600> this<00:03:50.170> sort<00:03:50.530> of

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
education as a result of this sort of

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.870 
education as a result of this sort of
event<00:03:50.800> because<00:03:51.160> you're<00:03:51.490> seeing<00:03:51.760> the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
event because you're seeing the

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.490 
event because you're seeing the
networking<00:03:52.240> you're<00:03:52.690> seeing<00:03:52.990> the<00:03:53.140> kids

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
networking you're seeing the kids

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.070 
networking you're seeing the kids
talking<00:03:53.860> to<00:03:54.160> different<00:03:54.340> schools<00:03:54.760> and<00:03:55.270> I<00:03:55.840> think

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
talking to different schools and I think

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.690 
talking to different schools and I think
that's<00:03:56.350> a<00:03:56.590> really<00:03:56.860> good<00:03:56.950> experience<00:03:57.190> for<00:03:57.550> them

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
that's a really good experience for them
