00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.860
 the family of camilo is of rooting 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.050
 santandereana because I have as 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.260
 fifth alien against a little bit more 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.330
 not really well see my mom is from 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.250
 ocaña north of santander my dad of the de 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.580
 Malaga that takes from close to 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.060
 bucaramanga and basically my family 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.860
 Well he came from Ocaña about 30 to 35 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.980
 years and they settled in the city 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.970
 bucaramanga for that time because I was born here 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.550
 I lived like 25 years in Bucaramanga and then 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.709
 I went back to Bogotá because I went 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.660
 issues of my mom my mom got married 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.020
 with my dad and they went to study 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:11.130
 Then they left and I was born 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.680
 over there vote instead I went to live in Bogota 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.870
 and you feel better is bucaramanga bogotá 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.330
 Well, the process that I had in Bogotá 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.490
 basically it was my study study 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.610
 because at school the university 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.440
 specialization then the graduate all 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.750
 that and then I went back to bucaramanga 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.370
 for reasons of destiny I think 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.370
 I finished the caravan field again 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:04.230
 Camilo and why did you decide to be a doctor 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.670
 from which moment to make that decision 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.550
 good the decision to be a doctor 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.440
 really no it was not it was not something that 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.170
 they had my head all the time 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.850
 I really did not even know what was going to be 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.560
 doctor because my parents have something that 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.989
 see with health nih just bacteriologist 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.239
 my parents dentist but never then 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.150
 I thought college really is , 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.770
 in school being a doctor really what 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.840
 what I wanted to do as such was 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.080
 footballer was what I'm passionate about and that 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.520
 is what I wanted to do but my parents 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.340
 they did not support me in this saying you 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.370
 You have to study and I ended up getting into 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.400
 medicine I think it was for the truth 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.160
 I presented to several things but medicine 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.190
 It was like what my mom wanted more than 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.380
 everything but finally I liked it 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.110
 He passionate the race and I fell in love 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.220
 and turn out to be what I am now 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.760
 quiet that I understand very well 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.760
 what is spoken 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.710
 Camilo that has been the most valuable and 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:34.060
 the hardest part of your exercise 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.890
 professional good I think the part I 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.480
 I think all of us who are doctors are 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.850
 those who develop an activity 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.820
 related to health always in the 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.950
 fund we have a humanitarian part the 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.750
 part of helping people to collaborate 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.140
 we have that sense and I think that's 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.880
 something that was carried in the blood but to 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.770
 me yes I was always like very from the 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.120
 on the side of helping the 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.580
 patient helps the people who 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.190
 you need something but I think that gives you 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.650
 an important value for life in 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:07.390
 everything, definitely, there is 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.650
 people who do certain activity and with 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.840
 dear what do I think what 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.420
 valuable it has given me life is 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.820
 to be able to have love and affection what I do 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.580
 to me to my work as a doctor and for now 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:21.000
 as a human being but always as 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:24.610
 I want to continue to adore what I do 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.780
 helping cheek has been difficult 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.470
 dabble in plastic surgery here 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:33.460
 bucaramanga 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:35.110
 it does not depend only generally, because I 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.910
 when I started coming to bucaramanga to 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.750
 do some procedures some 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:43.510
 cases since I saw my starting point was 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.920
 Bogota was my central square I worked 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.710
 in Bogota when I left the university 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.450
 I started working in Bogota 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.100
 patients they had were there but 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.710
 because of fate I started to come 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:57.430
 to operate certain patients but 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:59.140
 there are definitely things that are not 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.700
 it may be difficult to enter here in a 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.010
 Circus Circus Plastic Surgery in 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.720
 bucaramanga is quite closed because 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.150
 because here there are very good surgeons and 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.920
 also that many jobs are done 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.810
 but definitely if you're good what 

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.760
 what it does is place it in an excellent 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.860
 work and if you can present it to the 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.290
 people to patients a new option 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.940
 a different option 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.590
 definitely the santandereano is a 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:24.280
 person who likes good things 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:26.410
 then suddenly for me it was it was not 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.370
 so difficult to enter to venture into 

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.919
 bucaramanga work here 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.150
 so the first part that we're going to 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:35.320
 work on this patient in the 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:39.080
 imposition we will work all the 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:41.000
 back and let's take some fat 

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.919
 and we are going to project it is to do 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.050
 fat transfer in these areas 

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:46.910
 these zones are the pressure zones that 

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.220
 we will correct with the transfer of 

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:51.070
 grease 

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:55.980
 The first thing that is done is to put 

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:58.050
 a little bit is a bit of a solution 

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.730
 who seeks to make vasoconstriction wants 

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:02.760
 say it will close the false lines 

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:04.170
 to avoid bleeding we're going to put 

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.290
 this solution in the areas where it goes 

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:09.660
 show that fat and then we're going to 

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:11.250
 extract the fat with a technique of 

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.790
 Liposculpture or liposuction 

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.790
 professional
