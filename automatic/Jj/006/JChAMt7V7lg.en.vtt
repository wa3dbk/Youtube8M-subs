00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.410
 the man was submitted 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.920
 as the team only visited one more 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.529

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.019
 something you know that because I bought 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.109

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.140
 every once in a while, there goes the new pc 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.739
 ask to demand the skype was the one with some or 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.630
 be it is always varied customs or 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.170

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.399
 ready and many families in 11 weeks 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.489
 but it was not what I had been talking 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.960
 this video is was to say why not 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.410
 record a week because I went from 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:55.620
 Vacation , I went back on Monday. 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:59.309
 which is today do not remove the work is already 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.890
 I used to play crying I wanted to talk in this 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.549
 video or video that does not even seem to let me 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.170
 leave because I was not thinking of doing 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.869
 a balls team 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.409
 an alcohol team must be from outside 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.479
 with my friends who also play soon 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.689
 So why do not you make a team a lot 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.189
 with them you that I have clear friends 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.070
 We are going to continue playing as 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.810
 always is not exaggerated also with some 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.040
 subscribers and other friends and I do not know 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.140
 I am so I'm doing a team 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.939
 of the man who takes it seriously 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.759
 We are going to play the Chinese tournament and 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:41.430
 so I created a page there in the 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.000
 google for a document to make a 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.070
 application that we must in registration with 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.600
 the data if you want to enter the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.070
 team is not in principle does not mean 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.090
 who can not play online but in 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.579
 order principle you have already supported 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.939
 we have a more or less case cases 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.659
 an example you are a sport that 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.670
 is also focusing on the team 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.700
 when it is applied to 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.000
 house for example the ports that exposed 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.660
 is staying in the team can not come so 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.730
 they can replace so leaves more 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.470
 that raise everything armadillo in the publication that 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.690
 I'll leave you on the internet that is 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.250
 as I said it is in all 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.220
 plants in the application is for you to see 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.750
 Your name is the voice and data with tv 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.599
 are there to play 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.420
 which is the line that you want to 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:38.420
 apply from time if called too far 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.110
 such plan maintains the current plan and 17 years 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.840
 all who have the plan collor delson 5 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.819
 millions who play at this institute 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.310
 these kind of things all 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.720
 is also voice caip by chance you 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.750
 critical approach is contact with 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.549
 try you proteins but to 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.140
 any doubt any being can 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.129
 put in the comments that I go 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.470
 respond to everything 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.599
 for example I do not know very well how it is that 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.549
 is staff creta spent video 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.870
 to explain it better not to leave but to 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.209
 anything can put everything in 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.060
 Comments sporting explain everything to 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:14.389
 more so if they want to participate in 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.870
 team will be team i will play with me 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:22.340
 also called tournaments and these 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:25.220
 things all have this opportunity is and 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.410
 I hope you like the idea too. 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.209
 of opportunity is also us who 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.950
 would light the link is in the description that 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.130
 make the application because it is mandatory 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.380
 fill in the data all when filling out 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.690
 I'm going to solve this in the 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.359
 mobile and when I can or go after 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.450
 in the next video I'm going to give you a week 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:48.139
 young today is day 16 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:51.169
 I'm going to give it until Saturday. It's Wednesday. 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:54.950
 Thursday and Friday were messing four 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:57.709
 5 days position while stronger in 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.840
 five days and should cost the state but 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.629
 in principle it has worn down to 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.940
 command our application was started 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:08.030
 to train to talk and all the flames 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.639
 and is pro staff is hope you 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.600
 I liked the voice comment that 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:16.549
 idea is you do not like and why these 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.720
 things you thought important I hope you 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.630
 like 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.500
 I know it's done and I'll be all right and 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.500
 the next was
