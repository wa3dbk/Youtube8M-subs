00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
have thinner bezels now this is one of

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.439 
have thinner bezels now this is one of
the<00:00:25.619> rumors<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.220> I'm<00:00:26.369> not<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:27.000> sure<00:00:27.029> I'm

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
the rumors that I'm not so sure I'm

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.599 
the rumors that I'm not so sure I'm
going<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.930> be<00:00:28.080> happy<00:00:28.439> about<00:00:28.560> if<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.340> so

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
going to be happy about if it is so

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.690 
going to be happy about if it is so
because<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.480> LG<00:00:30.900> g2<00:00:31.170> if<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.650> remember<00:00:32.099> had

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
because the LG g2 if you remember had

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.690 
because the LG g2 if you remember had
thin<00:00:33.210> bezels<00:00:33.750> as<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.440> was<00:00:34.739> one<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
thin bezels as it was one of the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.549 
thin bezels as it was one of the
thinnest<00:00:36.090> bezels<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:36.630> any<00:00:36.870> phone<00:00:37.110> I've<00:00:37.290> seen

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
thinnest bezels on any phone I've seen

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.250 
thinnest bezels on any phone I've seen
so<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.920> think<00:00:38.250> if<00:00:38.399> decreasing<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.600> bezel<00:00:40.050> Steve

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
so I think if decreasing the bezel Steve

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.069 
so I think if decreasing the bezel Steve
in<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.530> smaller<00:00:40.920> size<00:00:41.280> may<00:00:41.700> interfere<00:00:42.090> with

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
in a smaller size may interfere with

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.930 
in a smaller size may interfere with
holding<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> device<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.850> know

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
holding the device and you know

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.790 
holding the device and you know
accidentally<00:00:45.600> touching<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> screen<00:00:46.469> or

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
accidentally touching the screen or

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.340 
accidentally touching the screen or
blocking<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.180> screen<00:00:48.360> when<00:00:48.840> you're<00:00:48.989> holding

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
blocking the screen when you're holding

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.959 
blocking the screen when you're holding
the<00:00:49.469> phone<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.129> right<00:00:50.160> now<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.460> think<00:00:50.610> that

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
the phone as of right now I think that

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.389 
the phone as of right now I think that
thinner<00:00:51.270> bezels<00:00:51.809> may<00:00:52.140> interfere<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:52.860> again

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
thinner bezels may interfere but again

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.549 
thinner bezels may interfere but again
we<00:00:53.550> won't<00:00:53.789> know<00:00:53.940> until<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.329> actually<00:00:55.140> have

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
we won't know until we actually have

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.840 
we won't know until we actually have
some<00:00:55.739> hands-on<00:00:56.100> time<00:00:56.160> with<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> phone

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
some hands-on time with the phone

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.880 
some hands-on time with the phone
another<00:00:57.390> thing<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.719> noticed<00:00:58.109> from<00:00:58.260> one<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
another thing I noticed from one of the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.580 
another thing I noticed from one of the
ebb<00:00:59.010> leaked<00:00:59.309> photos<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.870> seems<00:01:01.320> that

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
ebb leaked photos is that it seems that

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.799 
ebb leaked photos is that it seems that
LG<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:03.090> implementing<00:01:03.690> a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
LG is going to be implementing a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.770 
LG is going to be implementing a
circular<00:01:04.379> metallic<00:01:05.070> power<00:01:05.309> button<00:01:05.780> replacing

on the g2 on the back between the volume
rocker<00:01:11.640> now<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.750> good<00:01:12.930> because<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.260> lot<00:01:13.500> of

power button altogether I personally
never<00:01:24.420> really<00:01:24.720> had<00:01:24.900> much<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.170> an<00:01:25.380> issue<00:01:25.500> with

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
never really had much of an issue with

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.550 
never really had much of an issue with
this<00:01:25.890> since<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.310> LG<00:01:26.880> g2<00:01:27.210> had<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.930> double<00:01:28.350> tot

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
this since the LG g2 had that double tot

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.109 
this since the LG g2 had that double tot
feature<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.369> screen<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.790> shook<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
feature on the screen that shook the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.730 
feature on the screen that shook the
display<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.869> off<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.290> really<00:01:31.500> didn't

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
display on and off and I really didn't

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.260 
display on and off and I really didn't
find<00:01:31.890> myself<00:01:32.040> using<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.700> physical<00:01:33.090> power

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
find myself using the physical power

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.210 
find myself using the physical power
button<00:01:33.570> at<00:01:33.689> all<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:34.140> i<00:01:34.320> guess<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:34.920> nice<00:01:35.070> to

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
button at all but i guess it's nice to

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.440 
button at all but i guess it's nice to
see<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.520> they're<00:01:35.729> listening<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
see that they're listening to the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.539 
see that they're listening to the
customers<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.500> they're<00:01:37.740> also<00:01:38.070> adding

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
customers and that they're also adding

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.730 
customers and that they're also adding
more<00:01:39.030> metallic<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.869> design<00:01:40.170> what<00:01:40.590> we're

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
more metallic to the design what we're

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.350 
more metallic to the design what we're
talking<00:01:41.040> about<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.310> metallic<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:41.970> different

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
talking about the metallic and different

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.179

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
brushed aluminum back up to this point

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.710 
brushed aluminum back up to this point
LG<00:01:50.189> has<00:01:50.369> always<00:01:50.670> been<00:01:50.820> compared<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.450> samsung

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
LG has always been compared to samsung

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.719 
LG has always been compared to samsung
when<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.200> comes<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.649> devices<00:01:53.189> from<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.549> UI

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.780 
when it comes to the devices from the UI
to<00:01:54.329> certain<00:01:55.140> camera<00:01:55.530> features<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.700> the

to certain camera features to just the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.270 
to certain camera features to just the
overall<00:01:56.969> look<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.990> feel<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.530> device<00:01:58.950> and

overall look and feel of the device and

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.670 
overall look and feel of the device and
for<00:01:59.700> good<00:01:59.820> reason<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.540> now<00:02:00.659> pushing<00:02:01.290> forward

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
for good reason so now pushing forward

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.200 
for good reason so now pushing forward
with<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:01.979> aluminum<00:02:02.549> construction<00:02:02.759> and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
with this aluminum construction and

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.600 
with this aluminum construction and
being<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.479> first<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.840> do<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.409> no<00:02:04.920> samsung

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
being the first to do it and no samsung

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.479 
being the first to do it and no samsung
phone<00:02:05.820> yet<00:02:06.240> has<00:02:06.600> implemented<00:02:07.469> aluminum<00:02:08.340> in

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
phone yet has implemented aluminum in

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.940 
phone yet has implemented aluminum in
their<00:02:08.750> construction<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:09.959> if<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.259> LG<00:02:10.530> pushes

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
their construction so if the LG pushes

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.470 
their construction so if the LG pushes
forward<00:02:11.220> with<00:02:11.489> this<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.790> will<00:02:11.940> be<00:02:12.060> very<00:02:12.209> nice

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
forward with this this will be very nice

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.610 
forward with this this will be very nice
to<00:02:12.690> see<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.110> will

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
to see and will

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.690 
to see and will
put<00:02:13.709> it<00:02:13.799> in<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:14.010> whole<00:02:14.190> different<00:02:14.400> category

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
put it in a whole different category

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.839 
put it in a whole different category
with<00:02:15.180> phones<00:02:15.420> like<00:02:15.629> the<00:02:15.780> HTC<00:02:16.200> One<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.920> HTC<00:02:17.489> m8

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
with phones like the HTC One the HTC m8

the Nokia Lumia icon and the iphones and

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.030 
the Nokia Lumia icon and the iphones and
I'm<00:02:20.909> really<00:02:21.120> hoping<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.480> see<00:02:21.599> this<00:02:22.170> come<00:02:22.500> true

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
I'm really hoping to see this come true

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.490 
I'm really hoping to see this come true
because<00:02:23.849> you<00:02:24.239> know<00:02:24.360> who<00:02:24.840> doesn't<00:02:24.989> want<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.290> see

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
because you know who doesn't want to see

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.509 
because you know who doesn't want to see
an<00:02:26.069> aluminum<00:02:26.730> LG<00:02:27.330> g3<00:02:27.659> I<00:02:28.200> think<00:02:28.860> it's<00:02:28.980> also<00:02:29.159> safe

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
an aluminum LG g3 I think it's also safe

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.030 
an aluminum LG g3 I think it's also safe
to<00:02:29.549> assume<00:02:29.849> that<00:02:30.230> LG<00:02:31.230> might<00:02:31.409> bump<00:02:31.680> up<00:02:31.890> the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
to assume that LG might bump up the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.069 
to assume that LG might bump up the
camera<00:02:32.400> specs<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:33.000> 4k<00:02:33.900> recording

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
camera specs to 4k recording

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.069 
camera specs to 4k recording
capabilities<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.220> just<00:02:35.489> hope<00:02:35.579> if<00:02:35.790> they<00:02:35.970> do<00:02:36.079> do

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
capabilities I just hope if they do do

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.050 
capabilities I just hope if they do do
this<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.470> they<00:02:37.620> also<00:02:37.860> bring<00:02:38.730> along<00:02:38.879> their

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
this that they also bring along their

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.119 
this that they also bring along their
optical<00:02:39.629> image<00:02:39.930> stabilization<00:02:40.319> because<00:02:41.010> in

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
optical image stabilization because in

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.580 
optical image stabilization because in
my<00:02:41.250> opinion<00:02:41.400> 4k<00:02:42.360> recording<00:02:42.540> on<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.140> smartphone

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
my opinion 4k recording on a smartphone

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.430 
my opinion 4k recording on a smartphone
without<00:02:44.220> optical<00:02:44.970> image<00:02:45.209> stabilization<00:02:45.599> it's

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
without optical image stabilization it's

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.039 
without optical image stabilization it's
quite<00:02:46.650> useless<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:47.879> I<00:02:48.180> really<00:02:48.450> hope<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.810> o<00:02:48.959> is

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
quite useless so I really hope that o is

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.250 
quite useless so I really hope that o is
and<00:02:49.680> 4k<00:02:50.129> recording<00:02:50.400> come<00:02:51.120> in<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.690> package<00:02:51.900> deal

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
and 4k recording come in a package deal

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.890 
and 4k recording come in a package deal
please<00:02:53.160> LG<00:02:53.760> another<00:02:54.329> thing<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.599> think<00:02:54.780> it's

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
please LG another thing I think it's

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.289 
please LG another thing I think it's
safe<00:02:55.049> to<00:02:55.109> assume<00:02:55.319> is<00:02:55.769> that<00:02:55.799> LG<00:02:56.310> may<00:02:56.670> bump<00:02:57.090> up

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
safe to assume is that LG may bump up

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.630 
safe to assume is that LG may bump up
the<00:02:57.510> screen<00:02:57.870> resolution<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.859> maybe<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.129> 2k

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
the screen resolution to maybe a 2k

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.180 
the screen resolution to maybe a 2k
panel<00:03:00.120> or<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.299> 4k<00:03:00.810> panel<00:03:01.230> however<00:03:01.560> even<00:03:01.829> if<00:03:02.040> they

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
panel or a 4k panel however even if they

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.580 
panel or a 4k panel however even if they
don't<00:03:02.609> go<00:03:03.090> ahead<00:03:03.420> with<00:03:03.720> this<00:03:03.900> I'd<00:03:04.260> still<00:03:04.560> be

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
don't go ahead with this I'd still be

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.949 
don't go ahead with this I'd still be
very<00:03:05.040> satisfied<00:03:05.670> being<00:03:06.060> how<00:03:06.359> the<00:03:06.720> last

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
very satisfied being how the last

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.890 
very satisfied being how the last
display<00:03:07.680> on<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.010> g2<00:03:08.670> was<00:03:09.000> very<00:03:09.420> very

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
display on the g2 was very very

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.380 
display on the g2 was very very
phenomenal<00:03:10.590> very<00:03:11.250> bright<00:03:11.549> and<00:03:11.790> very<00:03:11.819> sharp

phenomenal very bright and very sharp
actually<00:03:12.900> one<00:03:13.049> of<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:13.200> brightest<00:03:13.650> and

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
actually one of the brightest and

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.009 
actually one of the brightest and
sharpest<00:03:14.310> displays<00:03:14.700> I've<00:03:14.909> yet<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.269> see<00:03:15.420> on<00:03:15.780> any

smartphone and honestly if you think

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.229 
smartphone and honestly if you think
about<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:18.870> 2k<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.889> 4k<00:03:19.940> resolution<00:03:20.940> is<00:03:21.060> going

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
about it 2k and 4k resolution is going

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.569 
about it 2k and 4k resolution is going
to<00:03:21.299> also<00:03:21.660> take<00:03:21.930> more<00:03:22.200> battery<00:03:22.560> life<00:03:22.650> so<00:03:23.160> if

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
to also take more battery life so if

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.220 
to also take more battery life so if
they<00:03:23.880> choose<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.389> go<00:03:24.510> with<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.750> old<00:03:24.870> display

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
they choose to go with the old display

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.900 
they choose to go with the old display
I'll<00:03:25.349> understand<00:03:25.829> why<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.340> I'll<00:03:26.430> be<00:03:26.579> just<00:03:26.790> as

I'll understand why and I'll be just as

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.940 
I'll understand why and I'll be just as
happy<00:03:26.940> unless<00:03:27.510> they<00:03:27.959> choose<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.470> go<00:03:28.560> in<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.769> big

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
happy unless they choose to go in a big

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.440 
happy unless they choose to go in a big
a<00:03:28.980> battery<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.609> then<00:03:29.879> bump<00:03:30.209> up<00:03:30.329> the

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
a battery and then bump up the

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.909 
a battery and then bump up the
resolution<00:03:30.989> while<00:03:31.049> we're<00:03:31.200> talking<00:03:31.349> about<00:03:31.620> the

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.920 
resolution while we're talking about the
g3<00:03:32.400> panel<00:03:32.970> one<00:03:33.209> thing<00:03:33.389> I<00:03:33.480> was<00:03:33.629> thinking<00:03:33.660> that

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
g3 panel one thing I was thinking that

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.599 
g3 panel one thing I was thinking that
would<00:03:34.109> be<00:03:34.230> really<00:03:34.500> crazy<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.190> really

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
would be really crazy and really

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:36.890 
would be really crazy and really
innovative<00:03:36.269> one<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.629> first

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
innovative one of the first

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.259 
innovative one of the first
manufacturers<00:03:37.859> to<00:03:38.129> use<00:03:38.310> this<00:03:38.519> technology<00:03:38.910> as

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
manufacturers to use this technology as

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.259 
manufacturers to use this technology as
if<00:03:39.419> LG<00:03:39.720> went<00:03:40.349> ahead<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.829> used<00:03:40.940> graphene<00:03:41.940> in

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
if LG went ahead and used graphene in

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.420 
if LG went ahead and used graphene in
their<00:03:42.660> display<00:03:43.109> and<00:03:43.349> now<00:03:43.859> for<00:03:44.129> those<00:03:44.220> that

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
their display and now for those that

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.909 
their display and now for those that
don't<00:03:44.549> know<00:03:44.699> graphene<00:03:45.359> technology<00:03:45.989> is<00:03:46.199> a

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
don't know graphene technology is a

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.530 
don't know graphene technology is a
technology<00:03:47.250> right<00:03:47.579> now<00:03:47.609> that<00:03:48.030> is<00:03:48.180> supposedly

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
technology right now that is supposedly

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.900 
technology right now that is supposedly
more<00:03:49.169> durable<00:03:49.620> than<00:03:49.680> Gorilla<00:03:50.220> Glass<00:03:50.400> 3<00:03:50.459> and

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
more durable than Gorilla Glass 3 and

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.479 
more durable than Gorilla Glass 3 and
also<00:03:51.569> conserves<00:03:51.989> battery<00:03:52.260> life<00:03:53.129> much<00:03:53.459> better

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
also conserves battery life much better

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.939 
also conserves battery life much better
than<00:03:53.910> any<00:03:54.120> other<00:03:54.329> screen<00:03:55.049> out<00:03:55.230> there<00:03:55.440> meaning

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
than any other screen out there meaning

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:58.879 
than any other screen out there meaning
that<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.310> takes<00:03:56.849> less<00:03:57.269> battery<00:03:57.480> to<00:03:57.930> display<00:03:58.500> an

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
that it takes less battery to display an

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.770 
that it takes less battery to display an
image<00:03:59.160> on<00:03:59.459> so<00:03:59.819> this<00:03:59.970> would<00:04:00.120> be<00:04:00.150> really<00:04:00.449> amazing

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
image on so this would be really amazing

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.710 
image on so this would be really amazing
being<00:04:01.680> how<00:04:01.949> again<00:04:02.340> LG<00:04:03.120> is<00:04:03.239> really<00:04:03.480> pushing

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
being how again LG is really pushing

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.409 
being how again LG is really pushing

Samsung because as up to this point

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.449 
Samsung because as up to this point
Samsung<00:04:16.139> is<00:04:16.169> rumored<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.650> with<00:04:17.070> their<00:04:17.190> next

Samsung is rumored to with their next
device<00:04:17.699> to<00:04:17.910> be<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.120> first<00:04:18.389> to<00:04:19.019> use<00:04:19.049> this

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
device to be the first to use this

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.469 
device to be the first to use this
technology<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.579> reason<00:04:20.849> why<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:20.970> hasn't<00:04:21.239> been

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
technology the reason why I hasn't been

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.330 
technology the reason why I hasn't been
used<00:04:21.719> thus<00:04:21.989> far<00:04:22.260> as<00:04:22.380> because<00:04:22.740> graphene<00:04:23.310> is

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
used thus far as because graphene is

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.930 
used thus far as because graphene is
very<00:04:24.090> expensive<00:04:24.599> to<00:04:24.870> produce<00:04:25.380> but<00:04:26.250> if<00:04:26.370> LG<00:04:26.640> has

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
very expensive to produce but if LG has

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.480 
very expensive to produce but if LG has
found<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.240> way

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
found a way

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.520 
found a way
to<00:04:27.639> use<00:04:28.150> graphene<00:04:28.630> in<00:04:28.780> their<00:04:28.900> production<00:04:29.110> at<00:04:29.500> a

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
to use graphene in their production at a

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.860 
to use graphene in their production at a
cost<00:04:29.770> effective<00:04:29.919> price<00:04:30.490> then<00:04:31.330> this<00:04:31.599> would<00:04:31.780> be

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
cost effective price then this would be

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.930 
cost effective price then this would be
really<00:04:32.289> exciting<00:04:32.800> and<00:04:32.889> would<00:04:33.340> also<00:04:33.490> offset

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
really exciting and would also offset

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.150 
really exciting and would also offset
some<00:04:34.780> of<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:34.930> battery<00:04:35.289> loss<00:04:35.530> if<00:04:35.770> they<00:04:35.979> also

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
some of the battery loss if they also

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.700 
some of the battery loss if they also
chose<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:36.849> bump<00:04:37.060> up<00:04:37.240> their<00:04:37.539> screen<00:04:38.139> resolution

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
chose to bump up their screen resolution

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.010 
chose to bump up their screen resolution
to<00:04:38.889> as<00:04:39.039> we<00:04:39.280> just<00:04:39.550> mentioned<00:04:39.639> like<00:04:40.030> a<00:04:40.060> 4k<00:04:40.569> or<00:04:40.750> 2k

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
to as we just mentioned like a 4k or 2k

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.870 
to as we just mentioned like a 4k or 2k
display<00:04:41.349> so<00:04:42.160> that's<00:04:42.430> going<00:04:42.580> to<00:04:42.639> do<00:04:42.729> it<00:04:42.849> for

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
display so that's going to do it for
