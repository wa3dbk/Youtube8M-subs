like<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.159> 49<00:01:35.729> years<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.630> know<00:01:36.750> something<00:01:37.140> like

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
like to 49 years you know something like

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.050 
like to 49 years you know something like
that<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.710> general<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.130> think<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.790> looks

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
that in general I think it looks

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.940 
that in general I think it looks
absolutely<00:01:39.600> stunning<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.829> once<00:01:41.610> again<00:01:42.890> if<00:01:43.890> we

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
absolutely stunning and once again if we

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.580 
absolutely stunning and once again if we
compare<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.970> two<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.420> them<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:46.439> know<00:01:46.560> and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
compare the two of them you know and

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.289 
compare the two of them you know and
that's<00:01:46.950> our<00:01:47.070> sure<00:01:47.280> which<00:01:47.700> one<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:47.939> would<00:01:48.119> choose

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
that's our sure which one I would choose

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.590 
that's our sure which one I would choose
but<00:01:49.170> i<00:01:49.229> think<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.100> grey<00:01:50.310> leather<00:01:50.549> strap<00:01:51.270> here

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
but i think the grey leather strap here

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.620 
but i think the grey leather strap here
is<00:01:52.280> quite<00:01:53.280> interesting<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:54.149> looks<00:01:54.420> really

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
is quite interesting it looks really

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.380 
is quite interesting it looks really
good<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.920> build<00:01:56.159> quality<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.909> mean<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.329> is

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
good the build quality I mean this is

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.660 
good the build quality I mean this is
this<00:01:58.020> should<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> metal<00:01:58.950> frame<00:01:59.159> shouldn't

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
this should be a metal frame shouldn't

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.560 
this should be a metal frame shouldn't
it<00:01:59.899> yeah<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.200> think<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.829> even<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.579> hook<00:02:02.729> well<00:02:03.030> it

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
it yeah I think so even the hook well it

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.450 
it yeah I think so even the hook well it
can't<00:02:03.840> feel<00:02:04.079> plasticky<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:05.189> know<00:02:05.310> what

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460

can't feel plasticky you know what
what's<00:02:06.000> very<00:02:06.180> important<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.899> mean<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.380> is

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
what's very important I mean this is

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.559 
what's very important I mean this is
