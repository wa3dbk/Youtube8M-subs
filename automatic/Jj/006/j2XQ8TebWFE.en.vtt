00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.930
 in this video we are going to solve a 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:09.260
 triangle problem in which they give us 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.500
 a side drawn and in the middle of said 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.630
 triangle to solve it let's play 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.970
 the triangle that would form that side and 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.939
 the center considered as vertex 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.490
 opposite is to say let's join the vertex 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:26.039
 with him and in center 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.650
 and the vertex of also with the center 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.750
 as you know to find the center of a 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.629
 triangle we draw the bisector this the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.760
 triangle so these are these two 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.790
 lines that we just drew would be 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.239
 those bisector is the sad times of the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.989
 vertex of the angle formed at the vertex 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.850
 by the vertex a and so that these 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.449
 angles that we have here these two 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.940
 angles come and instead they are half of the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.470
 corresponding angle with which is in 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.930
 this problem is practically as if 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.180
 give us one side and its two angles 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.610
 adjacent since if we take the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.740
 compass we take one of the 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.979
 vertices we adjust 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:13.270
 I'm going to draw an arc to continue 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.860
 go to this cut point adjust take 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.370
 measure 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.590
 of what will be half the angle and 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.600
 take it to the opposite side back where 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.310
 written and I get this cut point 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:30.040
 over here will pass the b side we're going to 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.440
 repeat the operation in angle b nos 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.140
 we take the measure with a measure 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.180
 we are going to draw a bow that 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.090
 let us copy the angle that 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.280
 we have that is half the angle that 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.250
 will have the triangle we go to the point 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.440
 cut and we adjust to copy the 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.369
 actually that angle we take the 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:55.240
 measure to the opposite side and trace arch 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.759
 Well, here the side to the 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.640
 triangle I will treat the lines for 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.700
 define well 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.280
 that triangle here we will have one and 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.179
 because we will have 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.869
 another one so that our triangle will be 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.869
 this 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.060
 we have already solved it we have obtained the 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.880
 vertex excel and we have already drawn the 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.420
 three sides of the triangle as you see a 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.740
 relatively simple problem I hope 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.340
 as long as the videos have 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.270
 useful result if you like, I like it 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.060
 favorite share it on social networks 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.160
 with other partners is the best support 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.670
 for the channel see you in the next 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.670
 video
