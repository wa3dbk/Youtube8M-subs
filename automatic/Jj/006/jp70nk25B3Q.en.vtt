00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.550 

I<00:02:23.430> think<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.550> still<00:02:24.760> needs<00:02:24.790> some<00:02:25.090> fine-tuning

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
I think it still needs some fine-tuning

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.440 
I think it still needs some fine-tuning
but<00:02:26.560> i'm<00:02:26.890> not<00:02:27.100> completely<00:02:27.490> dissatisfied<00:02:28.060> with

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.180 
but i'm not completely dissatisfied with
how<00:02:28.720> this<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.050> coming<00:02:29.200> out<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.650> can<00:02:29.890> still

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
how this is coming out I can still

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.110 
how this is coming out I can still
quickly<00:02:31.090> remove<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.510> plate<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:32.110> have<00:02:33.120> the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
cloth protecting the handlebars but I

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.790 
cloth protecting the handlebars but I
think<00:02:36.280> as<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.760> hammer<00:02:37.540> out<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.960> details<00:02:37.990> i

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
think as I hammer out the details i

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.680 
think as I hammer out the details i
think<00:02:39.100> i<00:02:39.220> may<00:02:39.430> end<00:02:39.460> up<00:02:39.790> seeing<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.180> result<00:02:40.510> in

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
think i may end up seeing a result in

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.660 
think i may end up seeing a result in
which<00:02:41.050> is<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.230> stable<00:02:42.900> bracket<00:02:43.900> for<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:44.680> very

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670
