00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
you're going from for a trip that's

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.479 
you're going from for a trip that's
gonna<00:02:08.700> be<00:02:08.909> driving<00:02:09.359> for<00:02:09.659> about<00:02:09.859> two<00:02:10.859> hours<00:02:10.890> or

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.760 
gonna be driving for about two hours or
so<00:02:11.760> then<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.540> would<00:02:12.780> recommend<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.349> you

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
so then I would recommend that you

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.590 
so then I would recommend that you
have<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.160> put<00:02:14.340> hay<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:14.670> there<00:02:14.820> just<00:02:15.210> because

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
have to put hay in there just because

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.570 
have to put hay in there just because
they<00:02:15.870> need<00:02:16.020> something<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.470> do<00:02:16.620> they<00:02:17.220> can<00:02:17.370> hide

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
they need something to do they can hide

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.140 
they need something to do they can hide
in<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.820> hay<00:02:17.970> if<00:02:18.030> they<00:02:18.300> want<00:02:18.570> to<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:20.150> basically

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
in the hay if they want to and basically

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.410 
in the hay if they want to and basically
it<00:02:21.330> entertains<00:02:21.810> them<00:02:22.050> now<00:02:23.000> if<00:02:24.000> you're<00:02:24.240> going

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
it entertains them now if you're going

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.030 
it entertains them now if you're going
during<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.870> night<00:02:25.020> I<00:02:25.050> would<00:02:25.320> recommend

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
during the night I would recommend

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.740 
during the night I would recommend
putting<00:02:26.490> a<00:02:26.820> bed<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.300> just<00:02:30.450> have<00:02:30.600> this

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
putting a bed in and so I just have this

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.490 
putting a bed in and so I just have this
cuddle<00:02:31.170> sack<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.680> this<00:02:32.130> would<00:02:32.310> be<00:02:32.460> for<00:02:33.350> two<00:02:34.350> to

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
cuddle sack and this would be for two to

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.790 
cuddle sack and this would be for two to
three<00:02:34.530> hour<00:02:34.890> trips<00:02:35.420> so<00:02:36.590> especially<00:02:37.590> if<00:02:37.680> you're

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
three hour trips so especially if you're

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.140 
three hour trips so especially if you're
going<00:02:37.980> in<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.250> night<00:02:38.430> because<00:02:38.880> they<00:02:39.000> can

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
going in the night because they can

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.670 
going in the night because they can
sleep<00:02:39.360> in<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.630> but<00:02:40.020> also<00:02:40.080> in<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.440> day<00:02:40.560> it's

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
sleep in it but also in the day it's

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.440 
sleep in it but also in the day it's
nice<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:40.980> have<00:02:41.100> just<00:02:41.400> because<00:02:41.730> they<00:02:41.970> can<00:02:42.180> hide

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
nice to have just because they can hide

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.530 
nice to have just because they can hide
and<00:02:42.810> be<00:02:43.650> cozy<00:02:43.920> in<00:02:44.730> case<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.030> car<00:02:45.210> is<00:02:45.300> kind<00:02:45.510> of

recommend getting a large carrier or

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.480 
recommend getting a large carrier or
using<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:47.940> pet<00:03:48.120> store<00:03:48.330> cage<00:03:48.570> as<00:03:48.840> your<00:03:49.050> carrier

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
using a pet store cage as your carrier

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.390 
using a pet store cage as your carrier
just<00:03:50.490> because<00:03:51.440> it's<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:52.620> lot<00:03:52.800> better<00:03:52.980> for<00:03:53.310> the
