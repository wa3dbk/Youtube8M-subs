00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.930
 I'll explain a little what what 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.330
 it is a conventional board a short board 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.800
 which is the goal of all 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.320
 surfers trying to surf with a 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.350
 table like this requires much more level 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.180
 and the table is much narrower in what 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.340
 what is the tip 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.670
 is narrower in what is the width of 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.060
 the table and then what is the singing is 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.510
 appropriate to what comes to be the 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.940
 surfer the weight according to characteristics and 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.100
 way of surfing as well as the tail in 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.680
 this case for example I like the 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.410
 tails a little bit more round 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.010
 I do not like squash school because 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.660
 as I print strength to the maneuvers myself 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.210
 I need a tail that holds me well and 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.010
 that I hold on well in the areas this 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.810
 table requires a lot more technique and 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.330
 It is also a table that allows you 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.990
 close much more the maneuvers is to say 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.930
 allows you to go down more straight and go up more 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.720
 straight make changes of direction a lot 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.960
 more radical from one side to the other of the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.990
 wave erotic float maneuvers or 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.090
 of elite are much more showy as a 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.810
 table of these that as a table more 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.390
 wider and at the same time if you get 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.759
 give the board enough speed 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.649
 in its end it is much more spectacular with 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.100
 a table of these that with any 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:40.619
 other summer boards or 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.670
 any other type of fish type table 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.640
 type wider tables this would be a 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.100
 software 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:57.280
 5 10 10 and a 18 25 difficult we know that 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.280
 are the measures that I use to stop 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.420
 your
