00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
what i end up with is you know this

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.770 
what i end up with is you know this
report<00:02:07.210> it's<00:02:07.810> obviously<00:02:08.940> PDF<00:02:09.990> when<00:02:10.990> i<00:02:11.020> open<00:02:11.560> it

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
report it's obviously PDF when i open it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.970 
report it's obviously PDF when i open it
the<00:02:13.780> PDF<00:02:14.320> reader<00:02:14.650> is<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.340> default<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.860> you

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
the PDF reader is the default so you

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.330 
the PDF reader is the default so you
would<00:02:18.130> think<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.730> would<00:02:18.970> work<00:02:20.340> but

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
would think that that would work but

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.290 
would think that that would work but
also<00:02:22.470> if<00:02:23.470> i<00:02:23.710> choose<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.490> make<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.820> default

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
also if i choose to make the default

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.220 
also if i choose to make the default
program<00:02:26.250> something<00:02:27.250> else<00:02:27.490> else<00:02:27.730> like<00:02:28.360> adobe

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
program something else else like adobe

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.190 
program something else else like adobe
reader<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:31.750> obviously<00:02:32.380> opens<00:02:33.870> but<00:02:34.870> even

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
reader it obviously opens but even

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.310 
reader it obviously opens but even
having<00:02:35.590> changed<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.580> default<00:02:36.820> program<00:02:37.690> to

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
having changed the default program to

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.160 
having changed the default program to
something<00:02:38.709> else<00:02:38.910> when<00:02:39.910> i<00:02:40.270> click<00:02:40.810> run<00:02:41.140> report

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
something else when i click run report

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.670 
something else when i click run report
and<00:02:42.010> i<00:02:42.910> choose<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.330> open<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:43.870> i<00:02:44.020> still<00:02:44.140> get<00:02:44.560> the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
and i choose to open it i still get the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.500 
and i choose to open it i still get the
same<00:02:44.709> error<00:02:45.100> so<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.910> really<00:02:46.120> doesn't<00:02:46.330> have

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
same error so it really doesn't have

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.370 
same error so it really doesn't have
anything<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:47.110> do<00:02:47.380> with<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.770> fact<00:02:49.230> with<00:02:50.230> the

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
anything to do with the fact with the

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.120 
anything to do with the fact with the
question<00:02:50.890> of<00:02:50.920> what<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:52.060> default<00:02:52.860> program<00:02:53.860> is

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
question of what the default program is

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.310 
question of what the default program is

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
for handling pdfs because even though

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.540 
for handling pdfs because even though
I've<00:02:56.470> changed<00:02:57.239> obviously<00:02:58.239> I've<00:02:58.480> changed

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.350

where did I put it it was in

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.320 
where did I put it it was in
nephilim<00:03:07.460> obviously<00:03:08.460> now<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:08.700> can<00:03:09.060> see<00:03:09.300> that

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330
