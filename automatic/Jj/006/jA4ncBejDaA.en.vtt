people I get put in a lobby within a
team<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.320> generally<00:02:26.890> playing<00:02:27.160> blindfolded<00:02:28.000> i

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
team a generally playing blindfolded i

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.690 
team a generally playing blindfolded i
believe<00:02:28.360> so<00:02:29.260> if<00:02:29.410> that's<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.800> reflection<00:02:30.070> of<00:02:30.460> my

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
believe so if that's a reflection of my

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.550 
believe so if that's a reflection of my
skill<00:02:31.030> then<00:02:31.240> my<00:02:31.630> feelings<00:02:32.050> are<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.230> little<00:02:32.290> hurt

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
skill then my feelings are a little hurt

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.610 
skill then my feelings are a little hurt
but<00:02:33.550> unfortunately<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.600> ratio<00:02:35.140> of<00:02:35.170> skill

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
but unfortunately the ratio of skill

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.230 
but unfortunately the ratio of skill
level<00:02:35.890> from<00:02:36.100> your<00:02:36.250> teammates<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:36.940> detrimental

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
level from your teammates is detrimental

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.360 
level from your teammates is detrimental
to<00:02:37.750> how<00:02:38.020> your<00:02:38.230> game<00:02:38.500> is<00:02:38.680> going<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:38.920> map<00:02:39.130> out

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
to how your game is going to map out

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.700 
to how your game is going to map out
therefore<00:02:40.330> if<00:02:40.570> your<00:02:40.900> teammates<00:02:41.410> are<00:02:41.560> all

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
therefore if your teammates are all

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.920 
therefore if your teammates are all
cannon<00:02:42.160> fodder<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.610> running<00:02:43.180> into<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.630> lot<00:02:43.870> of

cannon fodder and running into a lot of

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.020 
cannon fodder and running into a lot of
enemy<00:02:44.350> fire<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:44.650> racking<00:02:45.280> up<00:02:45.400> scorestreaks

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
enemy fire and racking up scorestreaks

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.760 
enemy fire and racking up scorestreaks
for<00:02:46.210> the<00:02:46.270> enemies<00:02:46.570> then<00:02:47.170> that's<00:02:47.470> going<00:02:47.680> to

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
for the enemies then that's going to

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.040 
for the enemies then that's going to
impose<00:02:48.160> on<00:02:48.430> your<00:02:48.580> gameplay<00:02:49.090> because<00:02:49.720> all<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:49.900> a

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
sudden when the enemy starts doing well

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.820 
sudden when the enemy starts doing well

who left me to deal with that situation

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.619 
who left me to deal with that situation
most<00:04:11.920> probably<00:04:12.370> facing<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:13.120> wall<00:04:13.299> with<00:04:13.480> his
