length<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.180> little<00:00:18.420> bit<00:00:18.570> more<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.109> can<00:00:19.439> see

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
length a little bit more so you can see

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.580 
length a little bit more so you can see
it's<00:00:20.220> not<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:21.060> like<00:00:22.010> flat<00:00:23.630> the<00:00:24.630> coils<00:00:25.109> are<00:00:25.289> still

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
it's not a like flat the coils are still

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.109 
it's not a like flat the coils are still
there<00:00:25.800> they're<00:00:26.099> still<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.550> think<00:00:26.760> good

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
there they're still I think good

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:37.280 
there they're still I think good
definition<00:00:27.769> show<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:36.170> still<00:00:37.170> good

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
definition show you still good

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.979 
definition show you still good
definition<00:00:37.829> I'm<00:00:38.100> not<00:00:38.550> as<00:00:38.760> shiny<00:00:39.030> as<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.690> was<00:00:39.840> so

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
definition I'm not as shiny as it was so

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.680 
definition I'm not as shiny as it was so
I<00:00:40.050> think<00:00:40.110> as<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:41.180> conditioner<00:00:42.180> starts<00:00:42.239> to

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
I think as the conditioner starts to

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.049 
I think as the conditioner starts to
break<00:00:42.899> down<00:00:43.129> it's<00:00:44.129> allowing<00:00:44.550> my<00:00:44.670> hair<00:00:44.879> before

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
break down it's allowing my hair before

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.750 
break down it's allowing my hair before
your<00:00:45.480> hair<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> nicer<00:00:47.039> look<00:00:47.610> this

your hair so this is a nicer look this
is<00:00:47.879> more<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.090> what<00:00:48.329> I'm<00:00:48.450> comfortable<00:00:48.840> with

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
seeing right now and it doesn't feel as

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.830 
seeing right now and it doesn't feel as
crunchy<00:02:59.489> my<00:02:59.790> hair<00:02:59.970> still<00:03:00.180> those<00:03:00.359> crunchy<00:03:00.690> not

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
as crunchy but i also think that's

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.240 
as crunchy but i also think that's
because<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.450> conditioner<00:03:04.139> is<00:03:04.560> starting<00:03:05.010> to

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
because the conditioner is starting to

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.809 
because the conditioner is starting to
wear<00:03:06.150> off<00:03:06.209> I<00:03:06.750> think<00:03:07.019> my<00:03:07.260> coils<00:03:08.190> are<00:03:08.370> fighting

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.000 
wear off I think my coils are fighting
against<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.480> conditioner<00:03:10.260> is<00:03:10.440> pushing<00:03:10.889> out
