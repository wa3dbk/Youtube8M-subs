it

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.660 
it
2:22<00:00:12.300> five<00:00:12.690> six

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
2:22 five six

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.540 
2:22 five six
I<00:00:14.960> had<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.080> motor<00:00:16.260> gone<00:00:16.500> through<00:00:16.890> they<00:00:17.250> honed

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
I had the motor gone through they honed

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.800 
I had the motor gone through they honed
it<00:00:19.189> put<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.220> new<00:00:20.250> valve<00:00:20.490> guides<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.689> ever

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
it put a new valve guides in it and ever

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.179 
it put a new valve guides in it and ever
since<00:00:22.050> they<00:00:22.140> put<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.350> new<00:00:22.439> valve<00:00:22.590> guides<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.070> it

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
since they put a new valve guides in it

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.769 
since they put a new valve guides in it
it<00:00:24.560> acts<00:00:25.560> like<00:00:25.740> sometimes<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.369> valve<00:00:26.580> stick<00:00:26.939> so

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
it acts like sometimes a valve stick so

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.050 
it acts like sometimes a valve stick so
I<00:00:27.840> don't<00:00:27.960> know<00:00:28.019> if<00:00:28.109> they<00:00:28.230> didn't<00:00:29.060> remove

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
I don't know if they didn't remove

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.530 
I don't know if they didn't remove
outright<00:00:30.539> or<00:00:30.810> what<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:32.640> did<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.180> car<00:00:33.420> in

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
outright or what I did have this car in

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.440 
outright or what I did have this car in
the<00:00:33.600> road<00:00:34.070> for<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.219> summer<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.760> then<00:00:36.270> I

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
the road for one summer and then I

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.479 
the road for one summer and then I
taught<00:00:36.690> apart<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.410> bodywork<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
taught apart to do the bodywork the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.690 
taught apart to do the bodywork the
frames<00:00:38.790> all<00:00:39.000> been<00:00:39.500> wire<00:00:40.500> brushed<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.070> painted

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
frames all been wire brushed and painted

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.799 
frames all been wire brushed and painted
was<00:00:42.420> rust-oleum<00:00:42.809> black<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:44.090> you<00:00:45.090> saw<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.329> if

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
was rust-oleum black and you saw the if

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:46.880 
was rust-oleum black and you saw the if
you<00:00:45.930> didn't<00:00:46.140> see<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.350> already<00:00:46.530> there's<00:00:46.829> a

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
you didn't see it already there's a

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.190 
you didn't see it already there's a
video<00:00:47.100> up<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.399> me<00:00:47.550> starting<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.000> after<00:00:48.270> seven

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
video up of me starting it after seven

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.690 
video up of me starting it after seven
or<00:00:49.260> eight<00:00:49.379> years<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.980> sitting<00:00:50.280> at<00:00:50.370> my<00:00:50.460> mom's

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
or eight years of sitting at my mom's

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.020 
or eight years of sitting at my mom's
house<00:00:51.199> and<00:00:52.280> I<00:00:53.280> was<00:00:53.399> running<00:00:53.610> like<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.760> John

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
house and I was running like a John

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.709 
house and I was running like a John
Deere<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.140> two<00:00:55.350> or<00:00:55.469> three<00:00:55.620> cylinders<00:00:56.719> so

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
Deere like on two or three cylinders so

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.490 
Deere like on two or three cylinders so
my<00:00:57.870> guess<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:59.039> plugs<00:00:59.309> all<00:00:59.460> look<00:00:59.670> good

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
my guess is the plugs all look good

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.900 
my guess is the plugs all look good
there's<00:01:01.500> compression<00:01:01.949> loss<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.609> couple

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
there's compression loss in a couple

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.310 
there's compression loss in a couple
cylinders<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.359> can't<00:01:03.539> find<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.840> paper<00:01:04.049> right

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
cylinders I can't find the paper right

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.250 
cylinders I can't find the paper right
now<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:05.479> I'm<00:01:06.479> guessing<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.020> there's<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
now but I'm guessing that there's a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.350 
now but I'm guessing that there's a
bunch<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.530> valve<00:01:07.770> stuck<00:01:08.130> now<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:09.030> gonna<00:01:09.150> do<00:01:09.330> a

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
bunch of valve stuck now it's gonna do a

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.510 
bunch of valve stuck now it's gonna do a
video<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.990> me<00:01:10.500> tearing<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.860> apart<00:01:10.950> but<00:01:11.310> it's

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
video of me tearing it apart but it's

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.240 
video of me tearing it apart but it's
very<00:01:11.729> crowded<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.330> here<00:01:12.390> where<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:12.840> at<00:01:13.250> but

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
very crowded in here where it's at but

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.630 
very crowded in here where it's at but
what<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.460> want<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.790> do<00:01:15.590> is<00:01:16.590> take<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.400> two<00:01:17.610> side

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
what I want to do is take the two side

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.670 
what I want to do is take the two side
covers<00:01:18.360> off<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.570> motor<00:01:20.180> which<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.330> right<00:01:21.479> here

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
covers off the motor which is right here

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.960 
covers off the motor which is right here
and<00:01:22.680> there's<00:01:23.250> another<00:01:23.340> one<00:01:23.640> back<00:01:23.820> there<00:01:24.409> I<00:01:25.970> may

pull the intake and exhaust manifolds

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.670 
pull the intake and exhaust manifolds
off<00:01:31.280> depends<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.369> what<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.520> see<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:33.930> it's<00:01:34.470> kind

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680

what's going on okay I got the side
cover<00:01:45.899> off<00:01:46.110> actually<00:01:46.950> got<00:01:47.070> both<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.520> side

cover off actually got both of the side
covers<00:01:48.060> off<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.290> see<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:50.210> lifters<00:01:51.210> and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
covers off you can see the lifters and

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.370 
covers off you can see the lifters and
the<00:01:51.570> adjusters<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.470> springs<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:54.380> first

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380

the adjusters and the springs and first
thing<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.590> noticed<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.979> haven't<00:01:56.130> even<00:01:56.250> rolled<00:01:56.520> it

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
thing I noticed I haven't even rolled it

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.580 
thing I noticed I haven't even rolled it
over<00:01:56.820> anything<00:01:57.229> but<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.380> one<00:01:58.560> right<00:01:58.680> here

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
over anything but this one right here

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.539 
over anything but this one right here
see<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.740> space<00:02:01.979> up<00:02:02.189> there

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
see the space up there

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.429 
see the space up there
yeah<00:02:03.360> that's<00:02:03.570> not<00:02:03.750> supposed<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.079> be<00:02:04.229> there

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
yeah that's not supposed to be there

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.679 
yeah that's not supposed to be there
this<00:02:04.920> spring<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.610> not<00:02:05.909> pushing<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.329> valve

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
this spring is not pushing that valve

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.219 
this spring is not pushing that valve
down<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:08.060> hope<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.390> doesn't<00:02:09.780> mean<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
down I hope that doesn't mean that the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.990 
down I hope that doesn't mean that the
shaft<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.679> all<00:02:10.830> rusty<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.250> hope<00:02:11.520> it's<00:02:11.700> just

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
shaft is all rusty I hope it's just

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.930 
shaft is all rusty I hope it's just
stuck<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> little<00:02:13.080> bit

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
stuck a little bit

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.430 
stuck a little bit
well<00:02:14.940> if<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.150> shaft<00:02:15.360> is<00:02:15.600> rusty<00:02:15.960> on<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.200> valve

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
well if the shaft is rusty on the valve

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.500 
well if the shaft is rusty on the valve
and<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.400> won't<00:02:17.670> be<00:02:17.790> good<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.120> push<00:02:18.300> that<00:02:18.450> down

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
and it won't be good to push that down

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.510 
and it won't be good to push that down
through<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.080> guide<00:02:19.740> especially<00:02:20.250> with<00:02:20.370> new

through the guide especially with new
guides<00:02:20.730> on<00:02:20.940> there<00:02:21.180> it's<00:02:21.330> gonna<00:02:21.480> score<00:02:22.380> that

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
guides on there it's gonna score that

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.800 
guides on there it's gonna score that
all<00:02:22.770> up<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.150> really<00:02:27.360> don't<00:02:27.540> want<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.690> do

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
all up and I really don't want to do

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.690 
all up and I really don't want to do
that<00:02:29.750> but<00:02:30.750> I<00:02:31.050> really<00:02:32.010> don't<00:02:32.160> want<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.400> tear<00:02:32.580> the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
that but I really don't want to tear the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.400 
that but I really don't want to tear the
motor<00:02:32.880> all<00:02:33.060> apart<00:02:33.330> either<00:02:33.740> so<00:02:34.740> I<00:02:34.800> guess<00:02:35.010> I'll

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
motor all apart either so I guess I'll

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.750 
motor all apart either so I guess I'll
roll<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.560> over<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.860> see<00:02:38.040> how<00:02:38.190> many<00:02:38.250> other<00:02:38.550> ones

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
roll it over and see how many other ones

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.910 
roll it over and see how many other ones
are<00:02:38.910> stuck<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.360> one<00:02:39.570> is<00:02:40.670> cylinder<00:02:41.670> 2<00:02:42.920> from

machinist do the valve guides they were
stiff<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:53.700> right<00:03:54.180> after<00:03:54.450> we<00:03:54.480> put<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.870> motor

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
stiff and right after we put the motor

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.560 
stiff and right after we put the motor
together<00:03:55.580> and<00:03:56.580> we're<00:03:56.790> running<00:03:56.910> at<00:03:57.150> that<00:03:57.330> first

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570

together and we're running at that first
summer<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:58.910> noticed<00:04:00.110> valves<00:04:01.110> sticking<00:04:01.740> every

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
summer I noticed valves sticking every

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.580 
summer I noticed valves sticking every
once<00:04:02.070> in<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.280> while<00:04:02.720> so<00:04:03.720> hopefully<00:04:04.410> they'll

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
once in a while so hopefully they'll

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.160 
once in a while so hopefully they'll
break<00:04:04.800> in<00:04:05.040> eventually<00:04:05.510> but<00:04:06.510> this<00:04:06.810> thing<00:04:07.020> has

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
break in eventually but this thing has

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.490 
break in eventually but this thing has
does<00:04:07.650> not<00:04:07.890> have<00:04:08.190> many<00:04:08.430> miles<00:04:08.670> on<00:04:08.940> it<00:04:09.120> since<00:04:09.300> I

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
does not have many miles on it since I

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.040 
does not have many miles on it since I
rebuilt<00:04:10.500> it<00:04:11.090> I've<00:04:12.090> got<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.540> battery<00:04:12.900> a

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
rebuilt it I've got the battery a

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.810 
rebuilt it I've got the battery a
12-volt<00:04:13.770> battery<00:04:14.040> hooked<00:04:14.160> up<00:04:14.370> so<00:04:14.520> I<00:04:14.580> can't

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
12-volt battery hooked up so I can't

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.280 
12-volt battery hooked up so I can't
crank<00:04:15.090> it<00:04:15.209> long<00:04:15.360> because<00:04:15.600> it<00:04:15.720> is<00:04:15.840> still<00:04:16.049> six

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
crank it long because it is still six

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.289 
crank it long because it is still six
volt<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.890> I'm<00:04:17.250> not<00:04:17.430> gonna<00:04:17.580> start<00:04:17.910> it<00:04:18.060> I<00:04:18.150> got

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
volt and I'm not gonna start it I got

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:47.260 
volt and I'm not gonna start it I got
the<00:04:18.480> plugs<00:04:18.930> out<00:04:19.140> to<00:04:19.320> crank<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.650> over<00:04:19.799> so

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.860 

so<00:04:48.270> I<00:04:48.570> might<00:04:49.820> put<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:50.940> side<00:04:51.150> plates<00:04:51.420> back<00:04:51.600> on

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
so I might put the side plates back on

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.140 
so I might put the side plates back on
it<00:04:52.050> I'll<00:04:53.010> probably<00:04:53.130> do<00:04:53.400> a<00:04:53.430> compression<00:04:53.790> check

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
it I'll probably do a compression check

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.480 
it I'll probably do a compression check
first<00:04:54.480> so<00:04:56.300> stand<00:04:57.300> by
