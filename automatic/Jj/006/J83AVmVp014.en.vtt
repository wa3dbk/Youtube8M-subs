00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hi hi hop people how do you know 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.589
 witness it's really very very very 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.359
 well I hope you will do my 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.550
 thing to me I was going to comment on this 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.139
 new video we find ourselves on call 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.349
 of duty kid to macerate tips 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.040
 hints with each weapon of this game 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.170
 today guys this is an episode 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.279
 quite special it's going to be a blow episode 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.660
 of heart somehow because 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.920
 tears that I want to present in this 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.980
 video is really a favorite 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.109
 so it's just the crb vector so 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.189
 it's a machine gun a very, very 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.590
 good machine gun my favorite 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.300
 for moment on black ops 2 so at 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.650
 level of its characteristics so at the 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.880
 a very very good precision it is 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.559
 really what makes the charm of tears 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.300
 a machine gun that kills quickly with 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.520
 not a lot of hindsight it's really a 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.899
 big plus point in terms of damage 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.399
 I want to say they are sufficient 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.370
 for a machine gun for a grape shot 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.149
 pardon at the level of his reach she did 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.950
 not a big 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.469
 it's a little bit negative but 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.390
 well I use the machine guns for 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.170
 rhj and so it's not necessarily 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.420
 long distance duels 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.800
 so that does not necessarily disadvantage me 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.270
 level of cadence so she is very 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.620
 very well the ridges high a good 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.149
 cadence for a good treat me with 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.350
 a lot of precision that's what makes 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.520
 the charm of victory I will you 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.500
 advise at this level then a good 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.909
 pace and especially a lot of mobility 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.710
 so that's really the best for a 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.150
 smg rotted teeth submachine gun being 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.159
 given that mobility is what makes 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.659
 the fluidity somehow you 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.830
 will have about the game at the level of 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.930
 accessories so I advise the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.250
 silencer the silencer because all 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.790
 just ghost for me is a game to 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.380
 quiet 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.580
 since he has no 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.710
 microstation people rely a lot 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.810
 to radars and any red dot that 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.759
 will appear on their radar or there you to 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.960
 your enemies you will be directly operated 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.310
 there will be a team that will arrive 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.689
 on you and so here is the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.759
 silent essential in any case 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.960
 for me I equip a loader 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.250
 big cape because I find that the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.659
 two bells go fast enough it's true 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.130
 that a good pace that consumes a 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.140
 little bit at the balls and so 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.299
 so here's the big cape loader that 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.530
 add 50% ammo 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.360
 extra in the chargers so 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.860
 it's really helpful at my level 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.360
 secondary mount mortals it's not very 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.890
 interesting it's mostly the combination 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.210
 that I put on the surrender so league 1 is going 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.770
 meet for part 2 of the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.850
 video so the part that I them 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.560
 comments from the few bits of 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.420
 gameplay that I could do on the game and 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.829
 So here we are we say ah everything is 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.630
 so here we are for the 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.479
 part so in gameplay somehow 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.590
 so with the silent cadix vector they 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.880
 did not put on a big cloak because 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.469
 I did not have it yet for ipad 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.179
 enough chips to buy it in 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.410
 somehow and so here is so we can 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.120
 see that these raid limits that you have 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.080
 pretty quickly have to say that on ghost 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.550
 in general 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.900
 so very very fast and so that's so 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.400
 at the level of duels guys it's 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.590
 really a weapon that I advise you 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.240
 to go see that she will save me from the 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.070
 dead several times and so that's so 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.680
 the muffler super important passage 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.030
 nice little hour so I was in ffa 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.020
 on the map I do not remember too much 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.700
 of his name the matches I know them 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.230
 not yet and so that's so I hope 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.460
 that in any case the party with a 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.810
 gameplay will pay you it's true that you 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.490
 had asked for it according to previous 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.450
 episodes that besides there will be a 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.160
 little reputation they display 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.300
 and I really invite you to throw a 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.030
 a quick look at this episode 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.590
 and so that's so you can see that 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.790
 it really falls relatively quickly I 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.080
 repeat me but frankly it's 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.760
 really a very very good and healthy I 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.930
 you really recommend it I had 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.890
 not yet put as you said the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.910
 loader great cape but I you 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.320
 really advise him but you 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.900
 see that it's a little bit more 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.400
 dutil then the balls by pretty fast and 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.110
 so here is so do not hesitate to put 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.000
 a maximum of like on this video the 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.680

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.410
 bathroom 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.990
