00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.919
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.829
 Catalyst is back at lenovo today 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:17.670
 the left is business development 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:20.950
 manager and responsible for the station 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.720
 civil hello hello and explain us normally 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.370
 a little something about the new brand new 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.010
 p300 like to do 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.260
 yes, that may have been the same 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.450
 At first sight we are gone 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.230
 we have redesigned the front panel 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.090
 have a new appearance clear 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.220
 design we have the whole here too 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.260
 frame structure changed a bit 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.380
 what you see here are these 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.710
 Structures derived from honeycombs 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.140
 that gives a very long very good 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.540
 breathability and that is new to us 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.850
 have tidied up a bit here 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.020
 design that we offer sd card already 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.579
 have firmly installed then both the 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.040
 adapter for this five aircraft still 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:10.030
 additional interfaces has multicard 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:12.159
 reader or not no we screw 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.500
 no screws screw more co2 heathen 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.000
 there was a duty that the ceiling 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.770
 not immediately flies away but that one 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.290
 to be able to set it up yourself something like that 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.920
 one sees is desktop design but for 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.780
 workstations certified we have one 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.909
 extremely good power supply 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.580
 Here you can get the maps relatively quickly 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.049
 So change without any 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.260
 screw or something in the direction 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.790
 two fans one can easily find in front 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.460
 We use it for the cooling of 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.290
 plates and for graphics cards up here 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.040
 we can then additional plates 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.810
 install 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.909
 generally two plates 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.580
 cages available here 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.830
 and what makes them different ? 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.530
 generally to a desktop 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.810
 Variation yes once in a good mood looks the 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.900
 you do not see yourself but the chipset c 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.580
 236 already it is not a desktop but it 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.810
 is a watch station that means he can 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.430
 Cleo processors can carry the i7 i5 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.590
 that means I can now 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.570
 lose from the desktop to high 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.220
 right workstation and that 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.150
 then certified the machine in 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.400
 direction always has that always at the topic 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.910
 target group for whom is this device 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.120
 intended target group entry level 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.280
 typical autodesk inventor works as well 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.510
 further we can ride outside riding 3d 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.600
 catia even creo limitation very clear 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.560
 if by the addition 32gb because that is 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.440
 so the grid graphic a 4000 that is too 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.720
 so the upper limit and then it borders 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.880
 off to the next series was the 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.380
 i start stinging virtual swab 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.010
 think you can already do a lot with 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:54.760
 depict and where are priced is it 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.070
 here already workstation level or is 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.290
 still with the wine the better clear 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.410
 statement if I give him seven area 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.660
 I will stay at the desktop level 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.430
 bit careful graphics cards k 4000 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.840
 is then already the next stage the 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.610
 mate also relatively fast then 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.720
 same with xeon processors so there 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.610
 we come then in the middle 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.980
 its award-range but that there are 1000 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.570
 I have much more but the performance is so 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.459
 say grandchild has now again explanation 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.250
 redone and there is the third one 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:28.120
 version of these three processors and 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.910
 they already have good performance then 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.130
 maybe final question is there 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.650
 the device already blatantly buy and if so 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.780
 where can you buy it at the moment 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.880
 internet via our trading partner 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.250
 so configure that will now 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.350
 go on to the lenovo online shop 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.150
 ie those devices sell themselves 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.040
 Dealer folder or online 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.290
 business then with firm 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.180
 Configuration if you are 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.010
 individual again must be larger 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.810
 of course, we also offer customers 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.910
 the configuration individually for the 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:02.530
 Customers will end up together like this 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:06.069
 Again , I would like to be thrilled 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.430
 and I am happy then I wish a lot 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.590
 Success in the device and thank you for 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.880
 the presentation and give back to the 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.880
 place then it's fight
