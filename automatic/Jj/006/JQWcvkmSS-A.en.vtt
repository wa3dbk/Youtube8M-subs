in<00:00:30.340> through<00:00:30.579> here<00:00:30.989> I'm<00:00:31.989> sure<00:00:32.200> because<00:00:32.559> it's<00:00:32.860> I

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
in through here I'm sure because it's I

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.709 
in through here I'm sure because it's I
say<00:00:33.190> new<00:00:33.399> it's<00:00:33.640> probably<00:00:34.180> been<00:00:34.390> here<00:00:34.539> for<00:00:34.690> a

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 
say new it's probably been here for a

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:37.590 
say new it's probably been here for a
long<00:00:34.809> time<00:00:35.110> but<00:00:35.820> there's<00:00:36.820> actually<00:00:37.030> an<00:00:37.300> older

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
long time but there's actually an older

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.990 
long time but there's actually an older
part<00:00:37.809> of<00:00:37.840> the<00:00:37.960> park<00:00:38.140> back<00:00:38.379> in<00:00:38.530> here<00:00:38.739> and<00:00:39.000> I

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
part of the park back in here and I

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.760 
part of the park back in here and I
think<00:00:40.390> at<00:00:40.510> one<00:00:40.660> time<00:00:40.899> there<00:00:41.440> used<00:00:41.590> to<00:00:41.710> be

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
think at one time there used to be

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.319 
think at one time there used to be
probably<00:00:42.340> a<00:00:42.430> house<00:00:42.670> or<00:00:42.940> a<00:00:42.970> building<00:00:43.120> over<00:00:43.390> here

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
probably a house or a building over here

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.550 
probably a house or a building over here
anyways<00:00:46.329> there's<00:00:46.510> a<00:00:46.540> path<00:00:46.780> that<00:00:47.050> runs<00:00:47.140> back<00:00:47.380> in

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560 
anyways there's a path that runs back in

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.770 
anyways there's a path that runs back in
there<00:00:47.770> and<00:00:48.430> then<00:00:48.880> there's<00:00:49.060> right<00:00:49.480> back<00:00:49.630> in

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
there and then there's right back in

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.870 
there and then there's right back in
this<00:00:49.870> area<00:00:50.140> there's<00:00:50.320> some<00:00:50.520> about<00:00:51.520> three<00:00:51.790> or

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
this area there's some about three or

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.690 
this area there's some about three or
four<00:00:52.030> picnic<00:00:52.420> benches<00:00:52.750> and<00:00:53.530> I've<00:00:54.250> walked<00:00:54.550> in

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
four picnic benches and I've walked in

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.670 
four picnic benches and I've walked in
that<00:00:54.820> area<00:00:55.149> pretty<00:00:55.360> good<00:00:55.630> I<00:00:55.660> pulled<00:00:56.140> out<00:00:56.230> a<00:00:56.290> lot

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
that area pretty good I pulled out a lot

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.049 
that area pretty good I pulled out a lot
of<00:00:56.860> pennies<00:00:57.160> you<00:00:57.489> cannot<00:00:57.670> believe<00:00:57.880> how<00:00:57.940> many

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
of pennies you cannot believe how many

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.880 
of pennies you cannot believe how many
pennies<00:00:58.300> back<00:00:58.450> there<00:00:58.630> anyway<00:00:59.620> there's<00:00:59.829> a

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
pennies back there anyway there's a

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.310 
pennies back there anyway there's a
creek<00:01:00.130> that<00:01:00.160> runs<00:01:00.430> through<00:01:00.730> here<00:01:01.000> and<00:01:01.210> you<00:01:01.320> can

quarters<00:03:06.260> but<00:03:07.260> they're<00:03:07.500> just<00:03:07.739> under<00:03:08.010> the

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
quarters but they're just under the

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:30.160 
quarters but they're just under the
surface

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.250 

and<00:03:32.000> so<00:03:33.000> far<00:03:33.180> not<00:03:33.329> too<00:03:33.480> much<00:03:33.629> luck<00:03:33.870> but<00:03:34.230> you

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
and so far not too much luck but you

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.940 
and so far not too much luck but you
know<00:03:34.439> I<00:03:35.659> there<00:03:36.659> it<00:03:36.840> is<00:03:36.930> there's<00:03:37.409> the<00:03:37.470> porter<00:03:37.890> I

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
know I there it is there's the porter I

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.119 
know I there it is there's the porter I
kind<00:03:40.950> of<00:03:41.010> believe<00:03:41.250> in<00:03:41.400> going<00:03:41.670> slow<00:03:42.650> so<00:03:43.650> I've

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
kind of believe in going slow so I've

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.319 
kind of believe in going slow so I've
kind<00:03:44.489> of<00:03:44.609> just<00:03:44.790> walked<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.180> fence<00:03:45.389> line<00:03:45.659> and

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
kind of just walked the fence line and

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.110 
kind of just walked the fence line and
that's<00:03:48.329> really<00:03:48.480> all<00:03:48.720> I've<00:03:48.900> done<00:03:49.139> and<00:03:50.120> he's

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
that's really all I've done and he's

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.300 
that's really all I've done and he's
kind<00:03:51.389> of<00:03:51.500> gone<00:03:52.500> into<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.829> middle<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.099> park

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
kind of gone into the middle the park

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.580 
kind of gone into the middle the park
which<00:03:53.489> is<00:03:53.609> probably<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.870> better<00:03:55.019> place<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.439> be

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
which is probably the better place to be

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.679 
which is probably the better place to be
but<00:03:55.859> then<00:03:55.980> I<00:03:56.220> always<00:03:56.760> like<00:03:56.879> to<00:03:57.209> tend<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.510> think

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
but then I always like to tend to think

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.649 
but then I always like to tend to think
that<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.220> people<00:03:59.220> ignore<00:03:59.579> the<00:03:59.730> you<00:04:00.419> know<00:04:00.540> the

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
that the people ignore the you know the

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.099 
that the people ignore the you know the
less<00:04:00.870> traveled<00:04:01.349> areas<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:02.689> you<00:04:03.689> might<00:04:03.870> be

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
less traveled areas and you might be

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.770 
less traveled areas and you might be
able<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.379> yield<00:04:04.560> something<00:04:04.889> that<00:04:05.780> detectors

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
able to yield something that detectors
