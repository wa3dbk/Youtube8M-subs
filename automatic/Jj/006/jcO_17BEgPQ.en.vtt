00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
high water content in it so we call it a

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.639 
high water content in it so we call it a
super<00:00:59.670> hydrated<00:01:00.390> dough<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.960> very<00:01:01.230> wet

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.389 

it's<00:01:16.479> actually<00:01:16.810> very<00:01:16.840> strong<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:18.250> that's

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
it's actually very strong and that's

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:19.859 
it's actually very strong and that's
what<00:01:18.640> we're<00:01:18.789> really<00:01:18.820> looking<00:01:19.119> for<00:01:19.359> in<00:01:19.570> a<00:01:19.659> chair

enough<00:03:45.180> because<00:03:45.420> otherwise<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:46.290> will<00:03:46.410> stick

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.420 

and<00:03:51.300> I<00:03:51.390> scale<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:52.430> here<00:03:53.430> I'm<00:03:54.390> looking<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.930> start

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
and I scale it here I'm looking to start

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:04.100 
and I scale it here I'm looking to start
about<00:03:56.430> four<00:03:56.880> inches<00:03:57.300> wide<00:04:02.540> so<00:04:03.540> that's<00:04:03.720> 600

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
about four inches wide so that's 600

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.810 
about four inches wide so that's 600
grams<00:04:04.620> just<00:04:06.410> shape<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:08.190> top<00:04:08.550> there<00:04:08.790> so

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
grams just shape it and top there so

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.460 
grams just shape it and top there so
I'll<00:04:09.030> just<00:04:09.210> roll<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.720> edges<00:04:09.840> over<00:04:10.110> a<00:04:10.350> little

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
I'll just roll the edges over a little

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.660 
I'll just roll the edges over a little
bit<00:04:10.710> and<00:04:12.709> that's<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.830> cheer<00:04:14.040> back<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.400> shaped

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
bit and that's the cheer back to shaped

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.789 
bit and that's the cheer back to shaped
that<00:04:15.240> look<00:04:15.540> ha<00:04:15.750> and<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:18.840> seam<00:04:19.170> is<00:04:19.470> going<00:04:19.590> to

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
that look ha and the seam is going to

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.300 
that look ha and the seam is going to
actually<00:04:20.010> go<00:04:20.340> down<00:04:20.959> onto<00:04:21.959> that<00:04:22.650> there<00:04:22.890> and<00:04:23.190> you

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
actually go down onto that there and you

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.530 
actually go down onto that there and you
can<00:04:23.520> see<00:04:23.730> from<00:04:25.640> shaping<00:04:26.640> of<00:04:26.910> it<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.240> doesn't

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
can see from shaping of it it doesn't

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.380 
can see from shaping of it it doesn't
take<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:27.960> lot<00:04:28.170> of<00:04:28.250> intense<00:04:29.250> work<00:04:29.400> it's<00:04:30.270> just

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
take a lot of intense work it's just

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.530 
take a lot of intense work it's just
holding<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:31.080> in<00:04:31.230> on<00:04:31.350> itself<00:04:32.030> okay<00:04:33.030> once<00:04:33.360> we've

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
holding it in on itself okay once we've

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.750 
holding it in on itself okay once we've
done<00:04:33.690> that<00:04:34.880> we'll<00:04:35.880> put<00:04:36.090> a<00:04:36.450> buffer<00:04:37.230> in<00:04:37.860> the

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
done that we'll put a buffer in the

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.390 
done that we'll put a buffer in the
caliper<00:04:39.320> so<00:04:40.320> that<00:04:40.620> I<00:04:40.650> can<00:04:40.950> repeat<00:04:41.250> that

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
caliper so that I can repeat that

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:59.839 
caliper so that I can repeat that
process<00:04:41.700> and<00:04:42.450> do<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.780> next<00:04:42.960> one

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.230 

you<00:05:00.629> can<00:05:00.809> see

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.540 

by<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:03.780> touch<00:05:04.050> test<00:05:04.440> I'm<00:05:04.770> just<00:05:04.979> pressing<00:05:05.220> in

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
by the touch test I'm just pressing in

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.460 
by the touch test I'm just pressing in
and<00:05:05.639> pushing<00:05:06.210> back<00:05:06.389> a<00:05:06.419> little<00:05:06.690> bit<00:05:06.900> as<00:05:07.080> well

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
and pushing back a little bit as well

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.290 
and pushing back a little bit as well
that's<00:05:08.130> actually<00:05:08.550> telling<00:05:08.759> me<00:05:09.000> that<00:05:09.180> they're

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
that's actually telling me that they're

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.490 
that's actually telling me that they're
ready<00:05:09.449> to<00:05:09.509> go<00:05:09.780> up<00:05:09.840> into<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:11.039> Oh<00:05:11.070> business
