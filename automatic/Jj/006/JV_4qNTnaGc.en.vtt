00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.960
 hi to all these kinds of requests for 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.329
 a new kills everything and if we end up 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.910
 to realize therefore a perspective a 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:27.540
 little 3d so brings out this man in 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:30.489
 moto2 the image so partly for that 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:35.260
 we have the fund layer we 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:37.180
 let's duplicate it so ok I 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.460
 will come create a new layer by 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.460
 on it so just new some 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:48.280
 games come and take the Rectangle tool 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.470
 selection i'm going to come the plot a 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.579
 square with capital letter down for 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:57.430
 to be square well, this is like this 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:05.110
 I put it to you more or less 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:11.549
 like that make me a little bigger grandfather 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.549
 and he sees there 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.259
 but I will come and fill it with the 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:22.009
 pot of paint so white I fill 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.229
 on the managed layer selected side for 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:29.570
 disarm it i want to come and go in 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.110
 perspective transformation edition it goes 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.869
 take them 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.390
 the left or right corner no matter 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.869
 loved depressed and go to the right 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.600
 to make perspective so like 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.940
 this one i 'm going to press on any 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.890
 which tool to apply it I'm going to 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.470
 come back this rally on editing and do 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.759
 manual transformation that's it and this 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.970
 once I'm going to take the middle in water 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:57.770
 and the bc and do like these and then 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.979
 player presses a tool for 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.530
 apply it so this will be a little bit of 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.940
 base of our picture so for now 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.560
 for now I'm going to come it the 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.069
 hide so I'm going to press the eye 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.510
 which are here like this I'm going 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.540
 come take one of the two holds that 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.600
 I had not used request to use 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.860
 pardon to become the master above is 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.950
 what I'm going to do now is 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.870
 select with the selection tool 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.940
 quick 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.810
 what I want in pocket of the white square 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.260
 you're going to understand so I'm going by 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.500
 example was coming to pick his 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.500
 arms 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.959
 boyer although I did it in a hurry 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:53.579
 correct it to appreciate was taken 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:53.579
 Too many elements I can let go 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:10.239
 here like this I will also take 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.239
 so that's just beyond the handle 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.159
 that's like this one 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:28.700
 this one and i'm going to come do not know if 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.140
 it fits in the white square jacques 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.410
 no it does not fit in the white square 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.550
 and I'm going to just come back 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:41.300
 the selection rectangles tool 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.470
 was going to make switch selection and 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.250
 now i'm going to press the key 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.870
 delete to delete 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.450
 and so I only keep what 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.010
 I selected I click anything 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.250
 where with the title elections fast for 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.590
 remove the section so there you see 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.950
 hand judged only 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.209
 otherwise what I selected so 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.280
 now I had to come and take the 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.790
 first layer place it over the 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.780
 white square that's like this and I want 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.830
 come do right click 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:16.160
 create a clipping mask and that's it 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.320
 like cefic so the way there you see 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.680
 well it's simple and it's already 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.780
 finished 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.470
 so to beautify you can do a 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.390
 new layer lemaitre all below 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:33.190
 we put for example some color 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:36.140
 black and like this I will come 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.700
 take this first case do it 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.310
 capitalized down until I'm here to 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:46.700
 all selected move more to the 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:47.960
 middle and that's it and now what I 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.650
 come on make sure that's a few 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:55.660
 so the square I'm going to come do click 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.810
 right option of merger and the m 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.770
 unavoidable 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:04.210
 so I'm going to put him in white have not 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.950
 quote 100% normal broadcast mode 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.590
 I will put a distance of 0.1 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:12.470
 madrid 100% and size 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:16.580
 it's like bull of vioques for that 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.260
 do a little more photo here like this 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.630
 so we'll put for example a you see 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.310
 there and I'm doing ok 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:28.320
 you see our picture with a 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.520
 little nice 3d effect just a trick 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.140
 is that I just saw now 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.620
 is that a little bit here he was 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.390
 unforeseen 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.050
 so what am I going to do simply 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.240
 so if you also have right click on 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.550
 the few zeros duplicate it as if 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.940
 we have back the picture remove the 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:50.520
 clipping mask like this and I'm going 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.880
 come back and select the part that me 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.370
 lack 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.110
 so I take back the tool 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.370
 quick selection 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.940
 I will take a little bit of the belly 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:08.240
 like this so very quickly I get 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:11.160
 redo select reverse invert deleted 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:15.510
 that's like these and it's already 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:18.770
 corrected pretty quickly what I'm going 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:21.150
 do it against now also it's 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.030
 as there are two different cases for this 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.130
 be better I'll come and do 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.560
 select the two merge the 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.660
 layers and there you see well with my 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.250
 second layer makes it small 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.740
 white pixels game it's enough 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.870
 simply have to go back 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.730
 went on the second element so the 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.280
 second 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:44.820
 or so for example play towards them 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:48.420
 merge you go zou may but come 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.650
 with the plot so the tool assault us 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.280
 to select them more or less the 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.540
 outline like those in pot 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.910
 selecting the droppings select 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:00.060
 that white outlines you're going to let go 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:04.620
 right click progressive contour and m 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.490
 for example 10 you may not be a 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:10.580
 little bit less 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:13.710
 m for example 6 and press the key 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.360
 delete but I'll even do a little 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:20.910
 little less cotton back between 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:22.470
 progressive to come deleted including 

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:28.280
 four the delete key and these are the 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:30.080
 white pixels remove so yes world 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.340
 some in fact normally with a 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.830
 Clipping mask is simply 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.680
 like this but thanks to the fact that I 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:39.350
 selected with the baguette 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:43.220
 it's a little 3d effect so in 

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:47.510
 perspective so here I hope this 

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:48.290
 you liked a little tutorial so thank you for having 

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.190
 watch video 

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.190
 Hi everybody
