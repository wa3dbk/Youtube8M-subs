00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:26.989 
having me in the show I just wanted to

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.490 
having me in the show I just wanted to
come<00:00:27.829> in<00:00:27.860> and<00:00:28.009> talk<00:00:28.640> about<00:00:28.939> cars<00:00:29.239> and<00:00:29.540> see<00:00:30.349> what

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
come in and talk about cars and see what

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.229 
come in and talk about cars and see what
it<00:00:30.619> takes<00:00:30.829> to<00:00:30.950> put<00:00:31.099> one<00:00:31.219> of<00:00:31.309> these<00:00:31.399> together<00:00:31.550> ok

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
it takes to put one of these together ok

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.209 
it takes to put one of these together ok
well<00:00:32.450> the<00:00:33.050> difference<00:00:33.379> between<00:00:33.500> building<00:00:33.920> a

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
well the difference between building a

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:36.910 
well the difference between building a
stock<00:00:34.670> engine<00:00:35.239> and<00:00:35.690> building<00:00:36.500> something<00:00:36.800> like

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
stock engine and building something like

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.400 
stock engine and building something like
what<00:00:37.160> Wally<00:00:37.399> is<00:00:37.579> looking<00:00:37.910> for<00:00:38.090> we<00:00:38.930> use<00:00:39.079> a<00:00:39.110> term

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
what Wally is looking for we use a term

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.410 
what Wally is looking for we use a term
called<00:00:39.620> blueprinting<00:00:40.250> blueprinting<00:00:41.210> means

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
called blueprinting blueprinting means

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.990 
called blueprinting blueprinting means
putting<00:00:42.110> everything<00:00:42.530> on<00:00:42.829> spec<00:00:43.310> and<00:00:43.640> that's

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
putting everything on spec and that's

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.260 
putting everything on spec and that's
everything<00:00:44.450> the<00:00:44.750> compression<00:00:45.380> ratio<00:00:46.270> your

checked it takes longer to build a blue

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.300 
checked it takes longer to build a blue
print<00:00:55.760> quality<00:00:56.120> engine<00:00:56.720> but<00:00:57.350> usually<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.100> end

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
print quality engine but usually the end

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.760 
print quality engine but usually the end
result<00:00:58.700> is<00:00:58.850> much<00:00:59.360> better<00:00:59.570> than<00:01:00.350> an<00:01:00.470> engine

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
result is much better than an engine

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.260 
result is much better than an engine
that's<00:01:00.950> just<00:01:01.190> been<00:01:01.340> production<00:01:01.820> built

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
that's just been production built

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.420 
that's just been production built
ok<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:03.200> what<00:01:03.470> you're<00:01:03.620> saying<00:01:03.829> is<00:01:03.950> if<00:01:04.280> you<00:01:04.399> just

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
ok so what you're saying is if you just

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.130 
ok so what you're saying is if you just
take<00:01:04.670> all<00:01:04.939> of<00:01:04.970> these<00:01:05.149> parts<00:01:05.509> together<00:01:05.840> even

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
take all of these parts together even

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.690 
take all of these parts together even
though<00:01:06.259> there's<00:01:06.470> specification<00:01:07.280> say<00:01:07.490> one

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
though there's specification say one

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.520 
though there's specification say one
thing<00:01:07.909> and<00:01:08.149> just<00:01:08.659> bolt<00:01:08.899> them<00:01:09.049> together<00:01:09.170> out<00:01:09.500> of

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
thing and just bolt them together out of

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.889 
thing and just bolt them together out of
the<00:01:09.680> box<00:01:09.890> you're<00:01:10.700> going<00:01:11.390> to<00:01:11.509> be<00:01:11.600> in<00:01:11.750> trouble

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
the box you're going to be in trouble

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:14.350 
the box you're going to be in trouble
then<00:01:12.229> if<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:12.469> weld<00:01:12.799> unnecessary<00:01:13.790> in<00:01:13.939> trouble

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
then if you weld unnecessary in trouble

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.530 
then if you weld unnecessary in trouble
but<00:01:14.509> you<00:01:14.690> your<00:01:15.290> chances<00:01:16.070> of<00:01:16.100> having<00:01:16.640> trouble

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
but you your chances of having trouble

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.469 
but you your chances of having trouble
are<00:01:17.690> quite<00:01:18.680> large<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.700> really<00:01:20.030> need<00:01:20.180> to<00:01:20.299> go<00:01:20.420> to

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
are quite large you really need to go to

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.360 
are quite large you really need to go to
a<00:01:20.630> shop<00:01:20.900> like<00:01:21.140> ours<00:01:21.350> it's<00:01:21.710> got<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:21.979> proper

a shop like ours it's got the proper
appointment<00:01:22.580> for<00:01:22.909> checking<00:01:23.299> things<00:01:23.390> things

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
appointment for checking things things

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.380 
appointment for checking things things
like<00:01:24.290> compression<00:01:24.650> ratio<00:01:25.340> you<00:01:25.880> can<00:01:26.090> look<00:01:26.270> in

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
like compression ratio you can look in

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.500 
like compression ratio you can look in
your<00:01:26.540> online<00:01:27.110> or<00:01:27.740> go<00:01:28.100> to<00:01:28.159> a<00:01:28.280> catalog<00:01:28.940> and<00:01:29.150> then

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
your online or go to a catalog and then

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.210 
your online or go to a catalog and then
they<00:01:29.659> say<00:01:29.869> that<00:01:29.900> with<00:01:30.290> this<00:01:30.440> piston<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:30.979> head

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
they say that with this piston and head

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.850 
they say that with this piston and head
combination<00:01:31.850> you're<00:01:32.000> making<00:01:32.299> Ted<00:01:32.510> go<00:01:32.659> on<00:01:32.860> but

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
combination you're making Ted go on but

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.649 
combination you're making Ted go on but
really<00:01:34.250> that's<00:01:34.400> doesn't<00:01:35.330> mean<00:01:35.450> you're<00:01:35.570> going

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
really that's doesn't mean you're going

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.480 
really that's doesn't mean you're going
to<00:01:35.720> make<00:01:35.810> ten<00:01:36.110> to<00:01:36.229> one<00:01:36.409> for<00:01:36.979> instance<00:01:37.280> you<00:01:37.369> may

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
to make ten to one for instance you may

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.880 
to make ten to one for instance you may
get<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:37.700> these<00:01:38.210> are<00:01:38.240> a<00:01:38.390> fr<00:01:38.930> cylinder<00:01:39.409> heads<00:01:39.650> and

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
get a these are a fr cylinder heads and

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.550 
get a these are a fr cylinder heads and
they<00:01:40.880> may<00:01:41.060> say<00:01:41.299> that<00:01:41.450> these<00:01:41.630> heads<00:01:41.869> are<00:01:42.049> for

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
they may say that these heads are for

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.530 
they may say that these heads are for
instance<00:01:42.799> 58<00:01:43.700> CCS

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
instance 58 CCS

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.380 
instance 58 CCS
but<00:01:45.409> you'll<00:01:45.560> check<00:01:45.920> them<00:01:46.159> and<00:01:46.369> you<00:01:46.909> do<00:01:47.060> that<00:01:47.210> by

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
but you'll check them and you do that by

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.870 
but you'll check them and you do that by
pouring<00:01:47.930> it<00:01:48.080> and<00:01:48.260> measuring<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:49.280> volume<00:01:49.520> of

if it's too much print pressure you take

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.430 
if it's too much print pressure you take
the<00:05:37.370> risk<00:05:37.610> of<00:05:37.820> taking<00:05:38.630> a<00:05:38.690> low<00:05:38.840> grade<00:05:39.080> off<00:05:39.290> the

you've<00:06:15.980> done<00:06:16.190> that<00:06:16.250> you're<00:06:16.670> going<00:06:16.700> to<00:06:16.900> work

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
you've done that you're going to work

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.640 
you've done that you're going to work
this<00:06:18.110> through<00:06:18.350> a<00:06:18.380> formula<00:06:19.010> which<00:06:19.370> again<00:06:19.700> we

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
this through a formula which again we

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.240 
this through a formula which again we
record<00:06:21.650> in<00:06:21.860> a<00:06:22.070> book<00:06:22.280> for<00:06:22.580> the<00:06:22.670> balancing<00:06:23.180> and

what<00:06:29.630> we<00:06:29.750> actually<00:06:29.960> do<00:06:30.440> is<00:06:30.650> we<00:06:30.710> have<00:06:31.610> what's

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
what we actually do is we have what's

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.590 
what we actually do is we have what's
called<00:06:32.150> a<00:06:32.270> bob<00:06:32.480> weight<00:06:32.780> and<00:06:32.990> we<00:06:33.110> make<00:06:33.290> them

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 
called a bob weight and we make them

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.570 
called a bob weight and we make them
way<00:06:33.720> exactly<00:06:34.110> the<00:06:34.470> same<00:06:34.740> as<00:06:34.980> your

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
way exactly the same as your

way exactly the same as your
reciprocating<00:06:36.390> mass<00:06:36.650> we<00:06:37.650> then<00:06:37.830> spin<00:06:38.160> it<00:06:38.280> on<00:06:38.400> a

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
reciprocating mass we then spin it on a

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.400 
reciprocating mass we then spin it on a
special<00:06:38.760> machine<00:06:39.150> that<00:06:39.330> has<00:06:39.600> sensors<00:06:40.110> front

and<00:06:40.650> back<00:06:40.860> and<00:06:41.160> it<00:06:42.060> will<00:06:42.180> tell<00:06:42.390> us<00:06:42.420> how<00:06:43.050> far<00:06:43.380> out

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
and back and it will tell us how far out

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.100 
and back and it will tell us how far out
of<00:06:43.920> balance<00:06:44.220> in<00:06:44.550> a<00:06:44.670> locational<00:06:45.270> credit<00:06:45.780> either

of balance in a locational credit either

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.790 
of balance in a locational credit either
add<00:06:46.620> or<00:06:46.920> remove<00:06:47.070> weight<00:06:47.520> and<00:06:47.960> basically<00:06:48.960> you

either add or remove weight at the front
or<00:06:51.720> the<00:06:51.810> back<00:06:51.960> of<00:06:52.140> the<00:06:52.380> crankshaft<00:06:52.740> and<00:06:53.700> we

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
or the back of the crankshaft and we

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.580 
or the back of the crankshaft and we
balance<00:06:54.510> them<00:06:54.660> down<00:06:54.840> to<00:06:55.260> within<00:06:55.440> the

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
balance them down to within the

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.400 
balance them down to within the
tolerance<00:06:56.130> of<00:06:56.250> one<00:06:56.490> gram<00:06:56.840> okay<00:06:57.840> and<00:06:57.990> then<00:06:58.110> that

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.410 
tolerance of one gram okay and then that

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.660 
tolerance of one gram okay and then that
covers<00:06:58.710> off<00:06:58.890> the<00:06:59.040> balancing<00:07:01.460> if<00:07:02.460> you're

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:02.670 
covers off the balancing if you're

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.970 
covers off the balancing if you're
running<00:07:02.880> a<00:07:03.060> race<00:07:03.090> engine<00:07:03.570> and<00:07:03.900> you<00:07:04.560> want<00:07:04.770> it<00:07:04.860> to

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:04.980 
running a race engine and you want it to

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.150 
running a race engine and you want it to
seal<00:07:05.820> as<00:07:06.030> good<00:07:06.270> as<00:07:06.390> it<00:07:06.510> can<00:07:06.720> what<00:07:07.650> we<00:07:07.800> do<00:07:07.950> when

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 
seal as good as it can what we do when

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.710 
seal as good as it can what we do when
we're<00:07:08.310> boring<00:07:08.550> the<00:07:08.760> block<00:07:08.970> is<00:07:09.150> will<00:07:09.330> actually

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 
we're boring the block is will actually

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.800 
we're boring the block is will actually
take<00:07:09.900> the<00:07:10.140> bores<00:07:10.610> to<00:07:11.610> within<00:07:11.910> five<00:07:12.210> paolo<00:07:12.570> of

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:12.810 
take the bores to within five paolo of

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.470 
take the bores to within five paolo of
our<00:07:12.930> finish<00:07:13.260> size<00:07:13.500> we<00:07:14.340> then<00:07:14.520> affixed<00:07:14.940> a<00:07:15.120> heavy

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:15.480 
our finish size we then affixed a heavy

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.510 
our finish size we then affixed a heavy
plate<00:07:15.930> on<00:07:16.200> top<00:07:16.440> of<00:07:16.650> the<00:07:16.710> text<00:07:17.010> of<00:07:17.220> the<00:07:17.280> block

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 
plate on top of the text of the block

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.670 
plate on top of the text of the block
and<00:07:17.820> torque<00:07:18.540> them<00:07:18.750> the<00:07:18.990> same<00:07:19.230> as<00:07:19.440> they're

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 
and torque them the same as they're

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.900 
and torque them the same as they're
going<00:07:19.800> to<00:07:19.860> be<00:07:19.980> torqued<00:07:20.340> when<00:07:20.490> the<00:07:20.580> engines

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:20.910 
going to be torqued when the engines

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.970 
going to be torqued when the engines
built<00:07:21.180> this<00:07:21.720> is<00:07:21.870> called<00:07:22.050> a<00:07:22.170> stress<00:07:22.500> plate<00:07:22.800> or<00:07:22.950> a

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:22.980 
built this is called a stress plate or a

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.300 
built this is called a stress plate or a
torque<00:07:23.310> plate<00:07:23.580> okay<00:07:24.390> if<00:07:24.600> you<00:07:24.930> do<00:07:25.110> this<00:07:25.350> what

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.310 
torque plate okay if you do this what

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.010 
torque plate okay if you do this what
you'll<00:07:26.460> find<00:07:26.730> is<00:07:27.000> when<00:07:27.030> you<00:07:27.300> torque<00:07:27.630> the<00:07:27.810> head

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 
you'll find is when you torque the head

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.140 
you'll find is when you torque the head
bolts<00:07:28.290> it<00:07:28.380> actually<00:07:28.710> pulls<00:07:29.070> the<00:07:29.640> top<00:07:29.880> of<00:07:30.090> the

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.150 
bolts it actually pulls the top of the

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.930 
bolts it actually pulls the top of the
bore<00:07:30.330> out<00:07:30.510> around<00:07:30.870> so<00:07:31.860> what<00:07:32.070> we<00:07:32.190> do<00:07:32.340> as<00:07:32.580> I<00:07:32.730> said

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 
bore out around so what we do as I said

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.270 
bore out around so what we do as I said
to<00:07:33.030> Wally<00:07:33.240> is<00:07:33.510> we<00:07:34.080> leave<00:07:34.320> five<00:07:34.770> thousand

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 
to Wally is we leave five thousand

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.720 
to Wally is we leave five thousand
removal<00:07:36.060> put<00:07:36.750> the<00:07:36.870> plate<00:07:37.110> on<00:07:37.140> torque<00:07:37.800> it<00:07:38.100> then

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:38.730 
removal put the plate on torque it then

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.670 
removal put the plate on torque it then
finish<00:07:39.240> on<00:07:39.450> the<00:07:39.630> board's<00:07:39.990> and<00:07:40.350> what<00:07:40.500> that

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680 
finish on the board's and what that

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.170 
finish on the board's and what that
means<00:07:40.890> is<00:07:41.070> when<00:07:41.220> you<00:07:41.250> go<00:07:41.430> to<00:07:41.460> build<00:07:41.760> your<00:07:41.970> motor

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.180 
means is when you go to build your motor

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.180 
means is when you go to build your motor
the<00:07:43.020> top<00:07:43.320> of<00:07:43.470> your<00:07:43.560> board<00:07:43.710> where<00:07:43.950> it's<00:07:44.100> the

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:44.190 
the top of your board where it's the

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:48.560 
the top of your board where it's the
most<00:07:44.220> important<00:07:44.970> would<00:07:45.270> be<00:07:45.450> exactly<00:07:45.930> round
