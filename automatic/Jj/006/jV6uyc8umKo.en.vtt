the<00:02:11.620> vaccines<00:02:12.100> are<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.550> worst<00:02:12.760> in<00:02:13.180> terms<00:02:13.330> of

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
the vaccines are the worst in terms of

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.710 
the vaccines are the worst in terms of
sickening<00:02:13.840> us<00:02:14.050> as<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.260> whole<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:15.570> like<00:02:16.570> in

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
sickening us as a whole and like in

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.190 
sickening us as a whole and like in
veterinary<00:02:17.290> medicine<00:02:17.410> when<00:02:18.750> they<00:02:19.750> did

veterinary medicine when they did

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.470 
veterinary medicine when they did
experiments<00:02:20.650> on<00:02:20.709> catteries<00:02:21.220> like<00:02:21.400> in<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:22.120> you

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
experiments on catteries like in it you

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.480 
experiments on catteries like in it you
know<00:02:22.510> these<00:02:22.690> are<00:02:22.750> medical<00:02:23.170> places<00:02:24.100> where<00:02:24.400> they

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
know these are medical places where they

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.790 
know these are medical places where they
have<00:02:24.850> kid<00:02:25.120> let's<00:02:25.270> say<00:02:25.330> a<00:02:25.360> bunch<00:02:25.570> of<00:02:25.720> cats<00:02:25.959> that

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
have kid let's say a bunch of cats that

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.880 
have kid let's say a bunch of cats that
were<00:02:26.830> they<00:02:27.250> fed<00:02:27.760> them<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:28.030> wrong<00:02:28.240> diet<00:02:28.570> say<00:02:29.260> just

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
were they fed them a wrong diet say just

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.750 
were they fed them a wrong diet say just
pure<00:02:30.100> meat<00:02:30.310> pair<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.760> skeletal<00:02:31.270> meat<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:32.080> was

pure meat pair of skeletal meat that was
it<00:02:33.760> wasn't<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.180> was<00:02:34.690> imbalance<00:02:35.230> right<00:02:35.410> so<00:02:35.590> they

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
it wasn't it was imbalance right so they

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.130 
it wasn't it was imbalance right so they
the<00:02:37.709> kittens<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.890> queens<00:02:39.130> were<00:02:39.280> produced

the kittens the queens were produced
deformed<00:02:41.140> kittens<00:02:41.560> but<00:02:42.100> they<00:02:42.310> took<00:02:42.610> them<00:02:42.910> they

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
deformed kittens but they took them they

said<00:02:43.360> three<00:02:43.690> generations<00:02:44.320> before<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:45.850> mess

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
said three generations before that mess

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.310 
said three generations before that mess
even<00:02:46.450> though<00:02:46.600> that<00:02:46.750> they<00:02:46.840> cleaned<00:02:47.140> up<00:02:47.260> the

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
even though that they cleaned up the

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.530 
even though that they cleaned up the
diet<00:02:47.620> got<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.100> balanced<00:02:48.459> again<00:02:48.700> before<00:02:49.150> those

kittens<00:02:49.870> were<00:02:50.200> born<00:02:50.260> normal<00:02:50.830> so<00:02:51.280> we<00:02:51.400> got<00:02:51.640> this

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
kittens were born normal so we got this

four or three or whatever in dogs
there's<00:03:22.480> at<00:03:22.600> least<00:03:22.630> four<00:03:22.989> you<00:03:23.500> give<00:03:23.620> to<00:03:23.739> two

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
there's at least four you give to two

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.070 
there's at least four you give to two
puppies<00:03:24.100> so<00:03:24.550> like<00:03:24.880> that's<00:03:25.000> totally<00:03:25.540> insulting

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
puppies so like that's totally insulting

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
puppies so like that's totally insulting
and<00:03:26.260> that's<00:03:27.010> why<00:03:27.930> these<00:03:28.930> viruses<00:03:29.590> they<00:03:29.800> don't

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
and that's why these viruses they don't

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.090 
and that's why these viruses they don't
even<00:03:30.280> know<00:03:30.370> what<00:03:30.489> they're<00:03:30.610> doing

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
even know what they're doing

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.010 
even know what they're doing
the<00:03:31.190> end<00:03:31.280> up<00:03:31.400> nervous<00:03:31.820> tissue<00:03:32.360> in<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.750> end<00:03:32.900> of

the end up nervous tissue in the end of

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.540 
the end up nervous tissue in the end of
growing<00:03:33.620> in<00:03:33.740> the<00:03:33.800> brains<00:03:34.040> of<00:03:34.220> these<00:03:34.370> babies

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
growing in the brains of these babies

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.280 
growing in the brains of these babies
and<00:03:35.000> that's<00:03:35.240> why<00:03:35.390> I<00:03:35.420> believe<00:03:35.660> we<00:03:35.930> were<00:03:36.020> seeing

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
and that's why I believe we were seeing

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.170 
and that's why I believe we were seeing
so<00:03:36.440> much<00:03:36.530> autism<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:37.190> learning<00:03:37.640> disabilities

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
so much autism and learning disabilities

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.880 
so much autism and learning disabilities
and<00:03:38.390> allergies<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:39.020> autoimmune<00:03:39.110> disorders

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
and allergies and autoimmune disorders

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.740 
and allergies and autoimmune disorders
plus<00:03:40.430> I<00:03:40.610> think<00:03:40.640> that<00:03:41.060> some<00:03:41.270> of<00:03:41.300> these<00:03:41.390> vaccines

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
plus I think that some of these vaccines

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.450 
plus I think that some of these vaccines
are<00:03:41.900> contaminated<00:03:42.590> with<00:03:42.650> retro<00:03:43.040> viruses<00:03:43.400> that

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
are contaminated with retro viruses that

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.840 
are contaminated with retro viruses that
