00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello welcome to play with me on 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.750
 this video I want to show you some of 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.929
 the things that can be done with the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.990
 game accessories the factory of 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.930
 candies candies and candies of play 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.750
 doh this game is one of those that includes 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.150
 the series the switch with which 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.650
 can make very nice 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:32.050
 today we will do in this tutorial candies or 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.230
 chocolates for this we will use 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.180
 four colored plasticine women 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.190
 each one of these play doughs 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.160
 we mold in this way that they remain in 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.739
 strip shape and each of these strips 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.850
 they must have more or less the same width and 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.850
 the same length 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:05.020
 when we have them ready we give 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.020
 some laps so they stay together 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.500
 and then we plan a little more in the 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.460
 surface where we are working the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.460
 to join 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.620
 that simply then when they are 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.620
 together we put them in the hole that 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:33.970
 has this upper part of the factory 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.940
 of chocolates then we look at this 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.510
 palanquita mulling way 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.530
 that start to come out through this hole 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:47.620
 the treats here already came out the first 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:52.220
 the betis come many other 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:55.490
 behind you have to help them a little 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.190
 here the machine does not do it alone or 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.430
 that moving them 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.490
 and here we are going to see what 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:08.690
 We are having beautiful candy or 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.300
 candies of many colors of colors 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.580
 mixed that is the main idea of 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.360
 use for fine colors 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:23.600
 different boards look how cute you look 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.600
 with totally different combinations 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.250
 here we are rolling the 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.340
 and well this is one of the things that 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.800
