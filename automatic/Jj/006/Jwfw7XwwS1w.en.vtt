less<00:02:27.709> sad<00:02:27.920> building<00:02:28.340> this<00:02:28.400> like<00:02:28.700> seven<00:02:29.480> months

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
less sad building this like seven months

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.260 
less sad building this like seven months
seven<00:02:30.739> months<00:02:30.890> ago<00:02:31.190> something<00:02:31.640> might<00:02:32.000> even<00:02:32.150> be

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
seven months ago something might even be

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.440 
seven months ago something might even be
longer<00:02:32.510> than<00:02:32.540> up<00:02:32.750> this<00:02:32.959> bit<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.260> long<00:02:33.470> time<00:02:34.450> one

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
longer than up this bit a long time one

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.120 
longer than up this bit a long time one
time<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:36.170> was<00:02:36.290> really<00:02:36.590> fun<00:02:36.769> building<00:02:37.010> this

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
time it was really fun building this

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.220 
time it was really fun building this
mapping<00:02:37.430> just<00:02:37.910> some<00:02:38.090> bits<00:02:38.300> on<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.510> which<00:02:38.780> and

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
mapping just some bits on it which and

mapping just some bits on it which and
you<00:02:40.190> can<00:02:40.340> honestly<00:02:40.489> tell<00:02:40.700> it<00:02:41.090> I'm<00:02:42.080> built<00:02:42.590> cos

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
you can honestly tell it I'm built cos

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.350 
you can honestly tell it I'm built cos
you're<00:02:43.400> not<00:02:43.489> very<00:02:43.670> good<00:02:43.760> like<00:02:44.090> for<00:02:44.300> instance
