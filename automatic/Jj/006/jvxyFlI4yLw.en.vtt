reason<00:00:42.989> behind<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.410> move<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.829> quite<00:00:44.100> simple

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
reason behind this move is quite simple

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.910 
reason behind this move is quite simple
to<00:00:44.879> understand<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:45.989> might<00:00:46.260> think<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
to understand one might think that the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.160 
to understand one might think that the
b-pawn<00:00:47.370> doesn't<00:00:48.270> have<00:00:48.420> much<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.840> do<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
b-pawn doesn't have much to do in the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.830 
b-pawn doesn't have much to do in the
center<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.739> actually<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.640> hasn't<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.629> it

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
center and actually it hasn't but it

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.590 
center and actually it hasn't but it
actively<00:00:52.379> blocked<00:00:52.739> c5<00:00:53.250> pawn<00:00:53.460> something<00:00:54.300> to

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
actively blocked c5 pawn something to

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.569 
actively blocked c5 pawn something to
think<00:00:54.809> about<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> black<00:00:55.649> will<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.190> some

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
think about is the black will have some

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.369 
think about is the black will have some
trouble<00:00:56.969> with<00:00:57.059> developing<00:00:57.570> his<00:00:57.840> Queen<00:00:58.109> side

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
trouble with developing his Queen side

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.979 
trouble with developing his Queen side
pieces<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.609> knight<00:00:59.850> can<00:01:00.120> only<00:01:00.329> place<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> cell

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
pieces the knight can only place a cell

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.110 
pieces the knight can only place a cell
from<00:01:01.109> d7<00:01:01.770> where<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.190> won't<00:01:02.399> be<00:01:02.550> able<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:03.000> do

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
from d7 where it won't be able to do

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.289 
from d7 where it won't be able to do
much<00:01:03.300> good<00:01:03.739> this<00:01:04.739> since<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.430> b-pawn<00:01:05.790> guards

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
much good this since the b-pawn guards

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.260 
much good this since the b-pawn guards
both<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.810> a6<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.710> c6<00:01:08.159> squared<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
both the a6 and the c6 squared and the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.710 
both the a6 and the c6 squared and the
e6<00:01:09.659> pawn<00:01:09.750> renders<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.770> bishop<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.610> CA<00:01:11.909> useless

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
e6 pawn renders the bishop on CA useless

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.080 
e6 pawn renders the bishop on CA useless
so<00:01:13.439> if<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.979> think<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.310> movements<00:01:14.850> with<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
so if you think that movements with the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.420 
so if you think that movements with the
b-pawn<00:01:15.509> loses<00:01:15.930> tempo<00:01:16.290> also<00:01:16.860> consider<00:01:17.250> that

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
b-pawn loses tempo also consider that

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.399 
b-pawn loses tempo also consider that
black<00:01:17.759> will<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.420> lose<00:01:18.630> at<00:01:18.840> least<00:01:19.049> as<00:01:19.229> much

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
black will have to lose at least as much

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.550 
black will have to lose at least as much
tempo<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.100> order<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.060> develop<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.659> previously

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
tempo in order to develop as previously

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.170 
tempo in order to develop as previously
said<00:01:22.860> white<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.250> after<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.820> center

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
said white is after in the center

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.480 
said white is after in the center
development<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:25.200> black<00:01:25.530> takes<00:01:25.770> opportunity

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
development so black takes opportunity

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.480 
development so black takes opportunity
and<00:01:26.610> place<00:01:26.790> c5<00:01:27.350> white<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.619> take<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.979> pawn<00:01:29.220> but

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
and place c5 white can take the pawn but

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.550 
and place c5 white can take the pawn but
that<00:01:29.729> would<00:01:29.939> release<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.450> night<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.530> is

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
that would release the night and that is

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.039 
that would release the night and that is
not<00:01:31.860> desirable<00:01:32.299> instead<00:01:33.299> white<00:01:33.570> should<00:01:33.840> play

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
not desirable instead white should play

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.179 
not desirable instead white should play
c4<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:36.270> position<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.500> pawn<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.979> the

white<00:01:41.369> nor<00:01:41.400> black<00:01:41.640> wants<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.390> ease<00:01:42.630> the
