hand all sorts of things you want to do
with<00:00:28.550> it

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
with it

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.510 
with it
so<00:00:29.540> I'm<00:00:29.840> just<00:00:30.020> gonna<00:00:30.230> explain<00:00:31.009> to<00:00:31.070> you<00:00:31.220> how<00:00:31.489> I

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
so I'm just gonna explain to you how I

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.510 
so I'm just gonna explain to you how I
make<00:00:31.849> those<00:00:32.090> just<00:00:32.840> make<00:00:32.989> this<00:00:33.140> set<00:00:33.520> reasonably

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
make those just make this set reasonably

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.100 
make those just make this set reasonably
it<00:00:34.670> burnt<00:00:34.880> them<00:00:35.030> once<00:00:35.180> or<00:00:35.270> twice<00:00:35.450> as<00:00:35.840> you<00:00:35.960> can

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
it burnt them once or twice as you can

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.790 
it burnt them once or twice as you can
see<00:00:36.370> so<00:00:37.660> basic<00:00:38.660> materials<00:00:39.200> needed<00:00:39.470> for<00:00:39.620> the

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
see so basic materials needed for the

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.160 
see so basic materials needed for the
set<00:00:40.010> of<00:00:40.130> three<00:00:40.160> like<00:00:40.550> these<00:00:40.790> is<00:00:41.059> an<00:00:41.780> aluminum

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
set of three like these is an aluminum

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.020 
set of three like these is an aluminum
to<00:00:42.350> aluminum<00:00:42.530> stick<00:00:43.780> something<00:00:44.780> between<00:00:46.030> six

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
to aluminum stick something between six

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.360 
to aluminum stick something between six
and<00:00:47.330> eight<00:00:47.810> millimeters<00:00:48.500> thick<00:00:48.740> oh<00:00:48.950> look

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
and eight millimeters thick oh look

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.420 
and eight millimeters thick oh look
that's<00:00:49.520> my<00:00:49.700> cat<00:00:49.940> hey<00:00:50.360> ray<00:00:50.540> go<00:00:50.750> away

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
that's my cat hey ray go away

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:59.010 
that's my cat hey ray go away
teaching<00:00:52.430> people<00:00:52.460> here<00:00:52.910> so<00:00:55.180> come<00:00:56.180> on<00:00:56.300> bastard

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.299 

just<00:01:00.020> put<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.260> cat<00:01:00.410> away<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.650> second<00:01:01.750> so<00:01:03.309> back

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
just put the cat away the second so back

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.890 
just put the cat away the second so back
to<00:01:04.339> thing<00:01:04.640> an<00:01:04.850> aluminium<00:01:05.390> stick<00:01:05.570> about

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
to thing an aluminium stick about

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.289 
to thing an aluminium stick about
between<00:01:06.710> six<00:01:07.189> and<00:01:07.400> eight<00:01:07.549> millimetres<00:01:08.150> I

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
between six and eight millimetres I

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.450 
between six and eight millimetres I
think<00:01:08.570> is<00:01:08.689> a<00:01:08.720> good<00:01:08.930> size<00:01:09.259> so<00:01:09.860> that<00:01:10.040> it's<00:01:10.310> not

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
think is a good size so that it's not

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.880 
think is a good size so that it's not
too<00:01:10.520> not<00:01:11.210> too<00:01:11.270> too<00:01:11.840> thick<00:01:12.079> but<00:01:12.500> you<00:01:12.530> can<00:01:12.710> also

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
too not too too thick but you can also

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.429 
too not too too thick but you can also
hold<00:01:13.159> it<00:01:13.340> nice<00:01:13.549> and<00:01:13.579> firmly<00:01:14.270> so<00:01:14.990> this<00:01:15.140> is<00:01:15.229> about

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
hold it nice and firmly so this is about

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.950 
hold it nice and firmly so this is about
six<00:01:15.770> millimeters<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:18.729> what<00:01:19.729> you<00:01:19.820> do<00:01:20.000> is<00:01:20.330> you

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
six millimeters and what you do is you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.240 
six millimeters and what you do is you
call<00:01:21.140> it<00:01:21.260> in<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.409> length<00:01:21.590> that<00:01:21.710> you<00:01:21.830> want<00:01:21.860> them

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
call it in the length that you want them

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.730 
call it in the length that you want them
so<00:01:22.640> those<00:01:22.880> are<00:01:23.210> which<00:01:23.450> I<00:01:23.570> think<00:01:23.900> a<00:01:24.200> really<00:01:24.620> good

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
so those are which I think a really good

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.450 
so those are which I think a really good
size<00:01:25.130> is<00:01:25.670> about<00:01:26.030> 34<00:01:26.990> centimeters<00:01:27.440> it's<00:01:28.280> about

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
size is about 34 centimeters it's about

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.460 
size is about 34 centimeters it's about
a<00:01:28.520> foot<00:01:28.790> a<00:01:29.090> bit<00:01:29.450> a<00:01:29.690> little<00:01:30.049> bit<00:01:30.140> more<00:01:30.290> than<00:01:30.409> a

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
a foot a bit a little bit more than a

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.610 
a foot a bit a little bit more than a
foot<00:01:30.740> a<00:01:30.920> piece<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:32.150> so<00:01:32.720> you<00:01:32.780> cut<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.170> aluminum

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
foot a piece and so you cut the aluminum

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.450 
foot a piece and so you cut the aluminum
and<00:01:33.860> then<00:01:34.840> you're<00:01:35.840> halfway<00:01:36.020> there<00:01:36.200> now<00:01:36.560> that

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
and then you're halfway there now that

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.140 
and then you're halfway there now that

need for a set of three and then you

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.460 
need for a set of three and then you
need<00:01:56.330> a<00:01:56.360> little<00:01:56.600> bit<00:01:56.689> of<00:01:56.750> cloth<00:01:56.990> tape<00:01:57.260> and

torch<00:02:08.539> at<00:02:08.750> all<00:02:08.989> I'm<00:02:09.200> just<00:02:09.229> going<00:02:09.409> to<00:02:09.560> explain

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
torch at all I'm just going to explain

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.240 
torch at all I'm just going to explain
you<00:02:10.069> how<00:02:10.549> you<00:02:10.610> might<00:02:11.530> as<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:12.650> said<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:12.950> cut<00:02:13.099> the

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
you how you might as I said you cut the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.289 
you how you might as I said you cut the
aluminum<00:02:13.580> tubes<00:02:13.790> in<00:02:13.879> the<00:02:13.939> length<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.239> you

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
aluminum tubes in the length that you

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:15.699 
aluminum tubes in the length that you
want<00:02:14.360> them<00:02:14.659> now<00:02:14.870> it's<00:02:15.080> time<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.319> get<00:02:15.560> the

want them now it's time to get the

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.339 
want them now it's time to get the
Kevlar<00:02:16.069> on<00:02:16.189> and<00:02:16.840> because<00:02:17.840> they<00:02:17.959> are<00:02:18.049> already

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
Kevlar on and because they are already

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:19.479 
Kevlar on and because they are already
done<00:02:18.500> I'm<00:02:18.650> just<00:02:18.680> going<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:19.040> show<00:02:19.159> you<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.370> you

on that one here what you do is you take

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.949 
on that one here what you do is you take
your<00:02:21.500> careful<00:02:21.889> are<00:02:21.980> just<00:02:22.129> about<00:02:22.779> now<00:02:23.779> get<00:02:23.930> a

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
your careful are just about now get a

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.929 
your careful are just about now get a
bit<00:02:24.109> of<00:02:24.200> cloth<00:02:24.379> tape<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:25.279> pretty<00:02:25.819> much

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
bit of cloth tape and pretty much

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.030 
bit of cloth tape and pretty much
centered

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
centered

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.880 
centered
the<00:02:28.849> Kevlar<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.450> around<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.620> stick<00:02:30.860> just

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
the Kevlar and around the stick just

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.289 
the Kevlar and around the stick just
imagine<00:02:31.280> that<00:02:31.370> will<00:02:31.489> be<00:02:31.519> here<00:02:31.790> it's<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.150> same

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
imagine that will be here it's the same

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.000 
imagine that will be here it's the same
way<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:32.510> did<00:02:32.659> it<00:02:32.780> here<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.319> then<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:33.560> start

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
way I did it here and then you start

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.009 
way I did it here and then you start
just<00:02:34.430> wrapping<00:02:34.819> it<00:02:34.909> around<00:02:34.970> it<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.569> because

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
just wrapping it around it and because

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.750 
just wrapping it around it and because
you<00:02:36.049> type<00:02:36.590> in<00:02:36.769> it<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:36.980> can<00:02:37.129> pull<00:02:37.370> that<00:02:37.400> all

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
you type in it you can pull that all

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.199 
you type in it you can pull that all
nice<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:38.480> firmly<00:02:38.720> really<00:02:39.290> really<00:02:39.500> tight<00:02:39.680> and

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
nice and firmly really really tight and

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.580 
nice and firmly really really tight and
so<00:02:41.209> you<00:02:41.269> take<00:02:41.599> which<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:41.989> have<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.140> length<00:02:42.379> you

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
so you take which I have a length you

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.339 
so you take which I have a length you
have<00:02:42.849> decided<00:02:43.849> on<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:44.420> just<00:02:44.900> pull<00:02:45.080> it<00:02:45.230> around

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
have decided on and just pull it around

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.740 
have decided on and just pull it around
there<00:02:45.739> really<00:02:46.010> really<00:02:46.340> tight<00:02:46.519> so<00:02:46.879> get<00:02:47.720> that

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
there really really tight so get that

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.520 
there really really tight so get that
nice<00:02:48.019> circle<00:02:48.500> looking<00:02:48.739> and<00:02:50.019> yeah<00:02:51.019> once<00:02:51.440> you

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
nice circle looking and yeah once you

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.800 
nice circle looking and yeah once you
come<00:02:51.799> to<00:02:51.830> an<00:02:52.099> end<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.430> important<00:02:52.910> thing<00:02:53.120> the

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
come to an end the important thing the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.350 
come to an end the important thing the
important<00:02:54.170> thing<00:02:54.349> is<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.829> not<00:02:55.010> just<00:02:55.430> stitch<00:02:56.329> it

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
important thing is to not just stitch it

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.750 
important thing is to not just stitch it
on<00:02:56.629> like<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:56.900> with<00:02:57.409> you<00:02:57.769> know<00:02:57.890> they<00:02:58.069> cut<00:02:58.519> in

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
on like that with you know they cut in

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.800 
on like that with you know they cut in
here

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
here

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.330 
here
because<00:03:00.260> otherwise<00:03:00.470> they'll<00:03:01.010> just<00:03:01.040> come

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
because otherwise they'll just come

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.240 
because otherwise they'll just come
loose<00:03:01.610> and<00:03:01.940> you<00:03:02.780> got<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:03.049> redo<00:03:03.470> that<00:03:03.500> every<00:03:04.010> I

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
loose and you got to redo that every I

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.699 
loose and you got to redo that every I
don't<00:03:04.730> know<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:05.209> couple<00:03:05.599> of<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:06.379> couple<00:03:06.560> of

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
don't know a couple of the couple of

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.410 
don't know a couple of the couple of
uses<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.220> know<00:03:07.609> what<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:07.879> want<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.090> do<00:03:08.209> is<00:03:08.269> you

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
uses you know what you want to do is you

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.289 
uses you know what you want to do is you

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
just want to take the end like that

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.869 
just want to take the end like that
don't<00:03:12.049> you<00:03:12.410> know<00:03:12.530> fold<00:03:13.099> it<00:03:13.190> over<00:03:13.310> too<00:03:13.640> much

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
stitching I mean you use a Kevlar thread

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.080 
stitching I mean you use a Kevlar thread
just<00:03:30.079> like<00:03:30.230> that<00:03:30.379> one<00:03:30.560> here<00:03:30.799> and<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.669> needle

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
just like that one here and the needle

metal bits of these because you didn't

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.810 
metal bits of these because you didn't
use<00:05:03.260> any<00:05:03.440> screws<00:05:03.740> about<00:05:03.980> here<00:05:04.160> there's<00:05:04.640> no

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
metal just up here and um the sticks to

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.260 
metal just up here and um the sticks to
sit<00:05:09.320> on<00:05:09.440> its<00:05:09.650> own<00:05:09.770> it's<00:05:10.190> not<00:05:10.310> getting<00:05:10.610> it's

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
sit on its own it's not getting it's

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.760 
sit on its own it's not getting it's
probably<00:05:11.510> getting<00:05:11.570> warm<00:05:11.990> till<00:05:12.260> about<00:05:12.440> here

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
probably getting warm till about here

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.450 
probably getting warm till about here
but<00:05:13.220> that's<00:05:13.460> at<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:14.150> most<00:05:14.330> and<00:05:14.750> so<00:05:15.740> you<00:05:16.100> know<00:05:16.190> I

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
but that's at the most and so you know I

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.150 
but that's at the most and so you know I
think<00:05:17.030> that's<00:05:17.240> a<00:05:17.360> pretty<00:05:17.510> good<00:05:17.630> design<00:05:17.870> for

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
think that's a pretty good design for

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.100 
think that's a pretty good design for
those<00:05:19.160> sorts<00:05:19.460> torches<00:05:19.910> so<00:05:20.510> I<00:05:20.540> hope<00:05:20.780> it<00:05:20.900> helps

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
those sorts torches so I hope it helps

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.330 
those sorts torches so I hope it helps
