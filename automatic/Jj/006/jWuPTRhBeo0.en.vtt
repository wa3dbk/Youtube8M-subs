00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.630 
legal version on blu-ray the disc
artwork<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:11.030> actually<00:02:12.030> fairly<00:02:12.390> similar<00:02:13.640> and

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
artwork is actually fairly similar and

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.130 
artwork is actually fairly similar and
you've<00:02:15.300> got<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.690> back<00:02:16.459> artwork<00:02:17.459> as<00:02:17.790> well<00:02:21.140> and

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
you've got the back artwork as well and

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.440 
you've got the back artwork as well and
so<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:23.010> big<00:02:23.160> question<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.730> how<00:02:23.910> does<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.120> look

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
so the big question is how does it look

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.210 
so the big question is how does it look
well<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.870> actually<00:02:25.020> looks<00:02:25.530> pretty<00:02:25.650> good

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
well it actually looks pretty good

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.390 
well it actually looks pretty good
especially<00:02:27.060> compared<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.870> bootleg<00:02:28.500> but

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
especially compared to a bootleg but

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.729 
especially compared to a bootleg but
it's<00:02:29.790> not<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:30.120> blu-ray<00:02:30.720> that's<00:02:30.959> going<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.530> be

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
it's not a blu-ray that's going to be

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.260 
it's not a blu-ray that's going to be
one<00:02:32.459> that<00:02:32.610> you're<00:02:32.730> going<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:32.940> show<00:02:33.090> your

one that you're going to show your
friends<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:34.290> incredible<00:02:34.800> prowess<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.489> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
friends the incredible prowess of the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.910 
friends the incredible prowess of the
blu-ray<00:02:35.940> format<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:36.840> your<00:02:36.989> HDTV

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
blu-ray format and your HDTV

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.210 
blu-ray format and your HDTV
it<00:02:38.130> looks<00:02:38.519> like<00:02:38.819> an<00:02:39.060> upscaled<00:02:39.630> DVD<00:02:40.380> with<00:02:41.190> a

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
it looks like an upscaled DVD with a

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.820 
it looks like an upscaled DVD with a
little<00:02:41.489> grain<00:02:41.790> throw<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.420> for<00:02:43.230> added<00:02:43.410> good

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
little grain throw in for added good

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.960 
little grain throw in for added good
measure<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:45.540> looks<00:02:45.840> great<00:02:46.739> though<00:02:47.040> in<00:02:47.550> terms

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
measure it looks great though in terms

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.650 
measure it looks great though in terms
of<00:02:48.269> what<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:48.780> rather<00:02:48.989> have<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.470> or<00:02:49.709> nothing

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
of what I rather have this or nothing

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.120 
of what I rather have this or nothing
obviously<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.319> something<00:02:52.560> that<00:02:53.100> I

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
obviously this is something that I

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.900 
obviously this is something that I
really<00:02:53.269> loved<00:02:54.269> seeing<00:02:54.780> released<00:02:55.200> on<00:02:55.470> blu-ray

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
really loved seeing released on blu-ray

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.170 
really loved seeing released on blu-ray
and<00:02:56.910> also<00:02:57.360> very<00:02:57.569> interestingly<00:02:59.030> there<00:03:00.030> are

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
and also very interestingly there are

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.000 
and also very interestingly there are
some<00:03:00.360> special<00:03:00.690> features<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:01.290> are<00:03:01.709> included

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
some special features that are included

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.410 
some special features that are included
with<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.340> blu-ray<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.850> they're<00:03:02.970> actually

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
with the blu-ray and they're actually

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.509 
with the blu-ray and they're actually
quite<00:03:03.569> good<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:03.930> watched<00:03:04.380> both<00:03:04.620> of<00:03:04.860> them<00:03:05.010> there

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
quite good I watched both of them there

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.240 
quite good I watched both of them there
is<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.000> making<00:03:06.269> of<00:03:06.510> Godzilla<00:03:07.350> vs.<00:03:07.739> biollante

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
is the making of Godzilla vs. biollante

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.090 
is the making of Godzilla vs. biollante
which<00:03:08.670> is<00:03:08.850> a<00:03:08.880> rather<00:03:09.269> in-depth<00:03:10.049> look<00:03:10.410> at<00:03:10.620> the

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
which is a rather in-depth look at the

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.180 
which is a rather in-depth look at the
special<00:03:11.790> effects<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.329> direction<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:13.530> design

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
special effects the direction the design

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.840 
special effects the direction the design
of<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:15.000> sets<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:17.250> way<00:03:17.430> they<00:03:17.640> had<00:03:17.820> to

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
of the sets and the way they had to

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.120 
of the sets and the way they had to
animate<00:03:18.780> all<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.230> different<00:03:19.530> tentacles<00:03:19.950> and

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
animate all the different tentacles and

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.729 
animate all the different tentacles and
things<00:03:20.370> of<00:03:20.609> the<00:03:20.760> different<00:03:21.620> iterations<00:03:22.620> of

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
things of the different iterations of

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.140 
things of the different iterations of
the<00:03:22.859> biollante<00:03:23.280> creature<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:25.790> care<00:03:26.790> and

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
the biollante creature and the care and

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.699 
the biollante creature and the care and
craftsmanship<00:03:27.959> that<00:03:27.989> goes<00:03:28.170> into<00:03:28.560> creating

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
craftsmanship that goes into creating

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.860 
craftsmanship that goes into creating
these<00:03:29.370> miniature<00:03:29.790> sets<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.450> are<00:03:30.540> used<00:03:30.720> in

the production of the movie and you can
see<00:04:05.340> how<00:04:05.579> it<00:04:05.700> was<00:04:05.790> sort<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.150> I<00:04:06.420> don't<00:04:07.230> want<00:04:07.410> to

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
see how it was sort of I don't want to

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.199 
see how it was sort of I don't want to
say<00:04:07.560> slap<00:04:07.890> together<00:04:08.310> but<00:04:08.549> put<00:04:08.700> together<00:04:08.850> in

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
say slap together but put together in

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.240 
say slap together but put together in
such<00:04:09.359> a<00:04:09.389> way<00:04:09.660> that<00:04:10.380> was<00:04:10.709> kind<00:04:10.889> of<00:04:10.979> unique

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
such a way that was kind of unique

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.920 
such a way that was kind of unique
because<00:04:11.280> in<00:04:11.820> some<00:04:12.180> parts<00:04:12.479> were<00:04:12.600> finished

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
because in some parts were finished

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:13.430 
because in some parts were finished
before

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
before

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.290 
before

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
interesting to see when you see how when

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.030
