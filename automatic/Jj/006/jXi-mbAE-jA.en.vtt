00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
color their hair again so I just decided

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.030 
color their hair again so I just decided
to<00:01:24.540> pick<00:01:24.689> them<00:01:24.840> up<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.170> dyed<00:01:25.530> my<00:01:25.560> hair<00:01:25.740> that

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
to pick them up I dyed my hair that

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.230 
to pick them up I dyed my hair that

down<00:01:29.670> below<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.570> trying<00:01:31.140> these<00:01:31.290> both<00:01:31.590> out<00:01:31.860> I

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
down below so trying these both out I

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.530 
down below so trying these both out I
tried<00:01:32.310> them<00:01:32.430> both<00:01:32.579> together<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.360> also

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
tried them both together and I also

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.170 
tried them both together and I also
tried<00:01:33.930> them<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.950> conjunction<00:01:35.520> with<00:01:35.939> other

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.420 
tried them in conjunction with other
products<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.200> didn't<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.650> them<00:01:37.799> at<00:01:37.920> all<00:01:38.070> I

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
products and I didn't like them at all I

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.190 
products and I didn't like them at all I
don't<00:01:38.790> feel<00:01:39.060> like<00:01:39.180> they<00:01:39.299> made<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.600> last<00:01:39.900> any

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
don't feel like they made it last any

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.300 
don't feel like they made it last any
longer<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.530> didn't<00:01:40.890> feel<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.070> they

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
longer I didn't feel like they

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.819 
longer I didn't feel like they
particularly<00:01:41.820> cleaned<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.630> well<00:01:42.960> if<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.680> did

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
particularly cleaned it well if I did

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.560 
particularly cleaned it well if I did
have<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.159> choose<00:01:44.399> which<00:01:44.729> one<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.149> best

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
have to choose which one I like best

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.359 
have to choose which one I like best
I'd<00:01:45.659> probably<00:01:45.869> say<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.229> shampoo<00:01:46.680> because<00:01:47.250> it

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
I'd probably say the shampoo because it

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.700 
I'd probably say the shampoo because it

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
conditioner I felt like it made my hair

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.730 
conditioner I felt like it made my hair
feel<00:02:05.939> very<00:02:06.270> dry<00:02:06.600> while<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.229> shower<00:02:07.439> and

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
feel very dry while in the shower and

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.330 
feel very dry while in the shower and
then<00:02:07.860> once<00:02:08.099> I

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
then once I

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.609 
then once I
out<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.819> shower<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.450> actually<00:02:10.379> felt

out of the shower it actually felt

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.500 
out of the shower it actually felt
really<00:02:10.709> really<00:02:11.220> greasy<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.060> was<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.180> very

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
really really greasy so it was a very

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.390 
really really greasy so it was a very
strange<00:02:12.900> combination<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:13.860> had<00:02:14.129> to<00:02:14.220> choose

strange combination so I had to choose
one<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.819> probably<00:02:15.330> choose<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.870> first<00:02:16.019> one<00:02:16.200> but

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860
