00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.380
 I pushed the hairstyle a little bit towards 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.159
 up to give you a little more 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.190
 volume 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.010
 all my pins I put them on 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.840

 It is very easy to do and you know how to do it 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.369
 a regular press of three ends is what 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.670

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.399

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.969
 fringe of our forehead what are they going to 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.700
 to do is they're going to win a comb and they're going to 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:00.520
 make a division and they will follow 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.950
 grabbing hair and going to twist the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.020
 hair to make churritos like 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.539
 of vido and then they are going to put their 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.970
 pin and this option must do it 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.709
 knowing good another hairstyle just that I 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.209
 liked it and I wanted to do it again 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.180
 has is one of the first favorites 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.160
 that you liked to remove 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.410
 secret of sale are only going to 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.129
 have giving the little volume and hairstyle 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.129
 but asia 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.769
 for option number 4 you're going to be defeated 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.170
 comb and you're going to make a division in 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:34.470
 the middle and you go to the remaining your hair 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.599
 and what you're going to do is based on the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.390
 trees and that in turn like the 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:43.409
 credits and this you 're going to do for 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.930
 the two sides in your hair and I would 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.659
 dictated from here with my mouth so you do not 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.790
 I did not know and then you're going to 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.859
 half what I like to put 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.739
 They are also pins for 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:58.379
 let's finish this movement writes 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:02.510
 the two pins in the form of letter x 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.510
 so that this hairdo lasts longer 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.190
 now option number 5 which is very 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.410
 easy to do that is a little bit 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.860
 similar to a hairstyle that I had already done 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.720
 ears of the cat are followed in 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.630
 I'm going to put the information box 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.910
 hang out in front of your hair and you're going to 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.489
 push up and you can 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.580
 leave so or the other option would be to grab 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:29.739
 little bit more hair but this is a 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.739
 little bit more and you put your pins 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.760
 those hairstyles are very easy to make 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.370
 you can do them alone and in your house 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.840
 for hairstyle number 6 which is very 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.580
 easy to do I always do it 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.319
 when I'm going to cook or something because I do not 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.080
 I want my fringe to be bothering me and 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.180
 itching my little eyes there like that is 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.000
 to be a little hair I put two 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.740
 pins 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.600
 and to leave then I leave my hair 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.370
 loose but when I go to cook I 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.370
 I pick up all my hair very well 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.570
 for option number 8 you are going to give 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.120

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.450
 three - strand braid for time 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.420
 French because you're going to grab 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.280
 hair but what's different about this braid 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.590
 is that he's going to take our hair out 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.320
 opposite you will not grab the 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.080
