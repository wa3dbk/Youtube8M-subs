lighting system we have ever seen but
first<00:00:16.860> let's<00:00:17.490> remember<00:00:17.730> how<00:00:18.300> simple<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:18.960> to

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
first let's remember how simple it is to

what makes this lighting system so good

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.440 
what makes this lighting system so good
is<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> new<00:01:04.470> adapter<00:01:04.980> it<00:01:05.580> allows<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.149> to<00:01:06.210> work

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
is the new adapter it allows you to work

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.179 
is the new adapter it allows you to work
with<00:01:06.509> shorter<00:01:07.079> strands<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.560> lights<00:01:07.770> which<00:01:08.040> are

with shorter strands of lights which are

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.550 
with shorter strands of lights which are
easier<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.670> wind<00:01:09.000> through<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.270> tree<00:01:09.600> plus<00:01:10.290> you
