handlebar in order to mount the lamp on
to<00:05:41.360> the<00:05:41.960> handlebars<00:05:42.589> or<00:05:43.009> onto<00:05:43.490> the<00:05:43.699> headband

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
to the handlebars or onto the headband

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.159 
to the handlebars or onto the headband
you<00:05:44.479> take<00:05:45.409> the<00:05:45.710> rubber<00:05:46.520> band<00:05:46.819> and<00:05:47.120> you<00:05:47.809> place

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
you take the rubber band and you place

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.829 
you take the rubber band and you place
it<00:05:48.399> onto<00:05:49.399> this<00:05:49.520> groove<00:05:49.879> it's<00:05:50.149> not<00:05:50.360> as<00:05:50.479> easy<00:05:50.629> as

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:50.839 
it onto this groove it's not as easy as

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:53.950 
it onto this groove it's not as easy as
it<00:05:50.990> looks<00:05:51.199> because<00:05:51.409> the<00:05:52.149> cable<00:05:53.149> actually

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
it looks because the cable actually

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.230 
it looks because the cable actually
comes<00:05:54.229> out<00:05:54.439> of<00:05:54.620> that<00:05:54.649> same<00:05:55.189> area<00:05:55.550> which<00:05:56.089> i

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
comes out of that same area which i

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.989 
comes out of that same area which i
think<00:05:56.479> is<00:05:56.629> a<00:05:56.659> flaw<00:05:56.990> and<00:05:57.050> design<00:05:57.580> you<00:05:58.580> make<00:05:58.759> sure

00:05:58.989 --> 00:05:58.999 
think is a flaw and design you make sure

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:03.820 
think is a flaw and design you make sure
it<00:05:59.089> is<00:05:59.180> tightly<00:05:59.949> mounted<00:06:00.949> and<00:06:01.210> then<00:06:02.589> you<00:06:03.589> wrap

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
it is tightly mounted and then you wrap

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.100 
it is tightly mounted and then you wrap
it<00:06:03.860> around<00:06:04.099> either<00:06:04.580> your<00:06:04.909> handlebars<00:06:05.509> or<00:06:05.689> the

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
it around either your handlebars or the

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:12.999 
it around either your handlebars or the
headset<00:06:07.069> plastic<00:06:07.580> component<00:06:09.159> like<00:06:10.159> so<00:06:12.009> you

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:13.009 
headset plastic component like so you

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.749 
headset plastic component like so you
pull<00:06:13.310> it<00:06:13.459> and<00:06:13.610> you<00:06:13.729> will<00:06:14.599> be<00:06:15.189> pulling<00:06:16.189> it<00:06:16.399> over

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759 
pull it and you will be pulling it over

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:21.579 
pull it and you will be pulling it over
this<00:06:16.999> groove<00:06:17.360> here<00:06:19.060> like<00:06:20.060> that<00:06:20.300> once<00:06:21.169> you<00:06:21.379> did

00:06:21.579 --> 00:06:21.589 
this groove here like that once you did

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:25.119 
this groove here like that once you did
that<00:06:21.620> the<00:06:22.990> lamp<00:06:23.990> is<00:06:24.229> actually<00:06:24.649> securely

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:25.129 
that the lamp is actually securely

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:28.299 
that the lamp is actually securely
fastened<00:06:25.819> and<00:06:26.199> you<00:06:27.199> can<00:06:27.409> either<00:06:27.770> put<00:06:28.099> it<00:06:28.189> on
