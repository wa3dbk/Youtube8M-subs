my Kimball said it was learning about

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.550 
my Kimball said it was learning about
relationship<00:03:34.510> building<00:03:34.540> but<00:03:34.959> also<00:03:35.110> actually

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
relationship building but also actually

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.770 
relationship building but also actually
doing<00:03:36.010> it<00:03:36.130> in<00:03:36.220> fast<00:03:36.459> because<00:03:36.819> while<00:03:37.269> sharing

doing it in fast because while sharing

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.240 
doing it in fast because while sharing
those<00:03:37.900> experiences<00:03:37.930> you<00:03:38.590> did<00:03:38.830> the

those experiences you did the

relationships with each other and just

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.940 
relationships with each other and just
it<00:03:42.760> was<00:03:42.880> very<00:03:43.750> reassuring<00:03:43.989> that<00:03:44.530> they're<00:03:44.650> more

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950

and<00:04:29.970> it's<00:04:30.540> hard<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.840> dehumanize<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.680> other<00:04:31.860> if

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
and it's hard to dehumanize the other if

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.530 
and it's hard to dehumanize the other if
you<00:04:32.190> have<00:04:32.340> a<00:04:32.370> relationship<00:04:32.850> with<00:04:33.030> them<00:04:33.270> so

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
you have a relationship with them so

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:43.070 
you have a relationship with them so
relationship<00:04:34.200> is<00:04:34.320> really<00:04:34.500> is<00:04:35.040> really<00:04:35.400> key

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.320 

I<00:04:43.370> think<00:04:44.370> it's<00:04:44.520> an<00:04:44.639> incredible<00:04:45.449> opportunity

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
I think it's an incredible opportunity

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.939 
I think it's an incredible opportunity
to<00:04:48.330> bring<00:04:48.870> together<00:04:49.080> people<00:04:49.379> that<00:04:49.830> are

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
to bring together people that are

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.070

from different places that wouldn't

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.010

builders<00:05:35.460> are<00:05:35.699> working<00:05:36.060> so<00:05:36.090> hard<00:05:36.509> on<00:05:36.750> the

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
builders are working so hard on the

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.019 
builders are working so hard on the
ground<00:05:37.139> they<00:05:37.949> often<00:05:38.520> don't<00:05:38.699> have<00:05:38.849> the

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:39.029 
ground they often don't have the

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:40.640 
ground they often don't have the
opportunities<00:05:39.659> to<00:05:39.840> learn<00:05:39.990> from<00:05:40.229> each<00:05:40.409> other

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
opportunities to learn from each other

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.860 
opportunities to learn from each other
and<00:05:40.919> so<00:05:41.430> if<00:05:42.180> we<00:05:42.330> can<00:05:42.479> create<00:05:42.719> some<00:05:43.139> space<00:05:43.319> to

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
and so if we can create some space to

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.379 
and so if we can create some space to
create<00:05:45.870> an<00:05:46.050> oasis<00:05:46.560> of<00:05:46.590> peace<00:05:46.949> to<00:05:47.389> encourage

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
them to inspire them to equip them even

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.290 
them to inspire them to equip them even
to<00:05:51.300> challenge<00:05:51.870> them<00:05:52.110> provoke<00:05:52.560> them<00:05:52.889> to<00:05:53.580> be

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300

think this will be a wonderful things in
building<00:06:01.139> peace<00:06:01.379> it's<00:06:02.279> very<00:06:02.849> often<00:06:03.180> the

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:03.779 
building peace it's very often the

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:05.450 
building peace it's very often the
one-to-one<00:06:04.319> relationships<00:06:05.069> and<00:06:05.339> those

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
one-to-one relationships and those

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.610 
one-to-one relationships and those
personal<00:06:05.969> connections<00:06:06.029> that<00:06:06.870> make<00:06:07.289> things

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
personal connections that make things

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.089 
personal connections that make things
work<00:06:07.979> and<00:06:08.219> so<00:06:08.460> when<00:06:09.089> you<00:06:09.210> get<00:06:09.389> people<00:06:09.719> from

those barriers for anybody wants to come

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.329 
those barriers for anybody wants to come
