one<00:03:21.830> real<00:03:22.010> good<00:03:22.130> reason<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.970> river<00:03:23.180> we<00:03:23.420> got<00:03:23.570> to

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
one real good reason the river we got to

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.680 
one real good reason the river we got to
cross<00:03:24.020> way<00:03:24.800> to<00:03:24.860> high<00:03:25.310> temp<00:03:26.090> was<00:03:26.270> 5:00<00:03:26.480> in<00:03:26.660> the

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
cross way to high temp was 5:00 in the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.960 
cross way to high temp was 5:00 in the
morning<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.260> I've<00:03:28.190> had<00:03:28.340> a<00:03:28.370> quick<00:03:28.610> look<00:03:28.640> at<00:03:28.880> the

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
morning and I've had a quick look at the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.270 
morning and I've had a quick look at the
river<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.840> room<00:03:29.990> is<00:03:30.050> actually<00:03:30.140> risen<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.920> few

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
river the room is actually risen a few

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.350 
river the room is actually risen a few
inches

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.510 

he's<00:03:38.870> got<00:03:39.080> chance<00:03:39.440> to<00:03:39.590> wash<00:03:39.740> our<00:03:39.920> feet<00:03:40.160> that's

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
he's got chance to wash our feet that's

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.040 
he's got chance to wash our feet that's
something<00:03:40.940> that's<00:03:41.480> starting<00:03:41.630> to<00:03:41.810> become<00:03:41.900> a

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
something that's starting to become a

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.050 
something that's starting to become a
bit<00:03:42.230> of<00:03:42.320> an<00:03:42.380> issue<00:03:42.500> anyway<00:03:43.040> maybe<00:03:43.550> if<00:03:43.850> we<00:03:44.000> can

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
bit of an issue anyway maybe if we can

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.430 
bit of an issue anyway maybe if we can
get<00:03:44.180> a<00:03:44.240> river<00:03:44.450> crossing<00:03:44.600> up<00:03:44.870> to<00:03:44.960> about<00:03:45.140> here

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
get a river crossing up to about here

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.640 
get a river crossing up to about here
that<00:03:45.890> will<00:03:46.010> solve<00:03:46.250> a<00:03:46.370> lot<00:03:46.400> of<00:03:46.520> problems

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
that will solve a lot of problems

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.590 
that will solve a lot of problems
you'll<00:03:48.650> also<00:03:48.830> need<00:03:49.100> a<00:03:49.160> good<00:03:49.550> understanding<00:03:50.420> of

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
you'll also need a good understanding of

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.330 
you'll also need a good understanding of
the<00:03:50.960> local<00:03:51.320> language<00:03:53.860> is<00:03:54.860> that<00:03:54.980> been<00:03:55.100> Jewish

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
the local language is that been Jewish

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.720 
the local language is that been Jewish
enough

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
enough

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.750 
enough
she<00:03:56.000> all<00:03:56.120> spoke<00:03:56.390> in<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.630> girl<00:03:56.750> identified

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.210 

I<00:04:04.000> think<00:04:05.000> I<00:04:05.090> could<00:04:05.239> just<00:04:05.269> make<00:04:05.599> out<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.870> word

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
I think I could just make out the word

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.690 
I think I could just make out the word
cafe<00:04:07.220> there<00:04:07.909> and<00:04:08.530> I<00:04:09.530> think<00:04:09.920> it<00:04:10.040> basically<00:04:10.400> says

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
cafe there and I think it basically says

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.050 
cafe there and I think it basically says
the<00:04:10.819> cafe<00:04:11.150> is<00:04:11.209> only<00:04:11.360> open<00:04:11.900> month<00:04:12.650> of<00:04:12.830> July<00:04:13.099> they

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
the cafe is only open month of July they

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.430 
the cafe is only open month of July they
should<00:04:14.239> sort<00:04:14.450> that<00:04:14.540> out<00:04:14.690> really<00:04:14.989> because

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
should sort that out really because

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.120 
should sort that out really because
we're<00:04:15.590> in<00:04:15.890> June<00:04:19.570> 3:30<00:04:20.570> in<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.810> morning<00:04:21.169> we're

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
the it's the thing for off-roading

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.430 
the it's the thing for off-roading
around<00:05:08.950> here<00:05:11.730> just<00:05:12.730> over<00:05:12.940> two<00:05:13.210> hours<00:05:13.440> should

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
around here just over two hours should

00:05:14.440 --> 00:06:25.700 
around here just over two hours should

well I guess an Afghan soldier rides up

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:31.080 
well I guess an Afghan soldier rides up
on<00:06:30.130> your<00:06:30.250> bike<00:06:30.400> and<00:06:30.729> he's<00:06:30.819> got<00:06:31.000> two

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 
semi-automatic on his back don't really

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:36.650 
semi-automatic on his back don't really
try<00:06:34.300> and<00:06:34.330> get<00:06:34.509> it<00:06:34.599> back<00:06:34.949> sure<00:06:35.949> it'll<00:06:36.099> come<00:06:36.250> back

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
try and get it back sure it'll come back

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.349 
try and get it back sure it'll come back
some<00:06:37.660> point
