00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
scallions and then the most distinct

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.940 
scallions and then the most distinct
part<00:02:36.970> I<00:02:37.060> think<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.690> this<00:02:37.870> recipe<00:02:38.349> is<00:02:38.590> the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
part I think of this recipe is the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.009 
part I think of this recipe is the
ginger<00:02:39.160> you<00:02:39.730> wanna<00:02:39.879> have<00:02:40.000> freshly<00:02:40.360> chopped

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
ginger you wanna have freshly chopped

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.550 
ginger you wanna have freshly chopped
ginger<00:02:41.290> about<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.769> teaspoon<00:02:42.599> and<00:02:43.599> that<00:02:44.410> is

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
ginger about a teaspoon and that is

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.770 
ginger about a teaspoon and that is
really<00:02:44.799> the<00:02:44.890> main<00:02:45.129> flavor<00:02:46.060> I<00:02:46.239> think<00:02:46.599> that

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
really the main flavor I think that

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.869 
really the main flavor I think that
really<00:02:46.959> brings<00:02:47.260> me<00:02:47.410> back<00:02:47.440> home<00:02:47.769> it's<00:02:48.580> a<00:02:48.640> really

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
really brings me back home it's a really

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.449 
really brings me back home it's a really
distinct<00:02:49.239> flavor<00:02:49.510> in<00:02:49.629> this<00:02:49.720> dumpling<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.290> so

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
distinct flavor in this dumpling and so

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.339 
distinct flavor in this dumpling and so
you<00:02:51.459> know<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:52.269> recipe<00:02:52.660> only<00:02:52.840> says<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:52.989> add<00:02:53.170> one

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.289

teaspoon<00:02:53.530> but<00:02:53.920> I<00:02:53.980> occasionally<00:02:54.940> add<00:02:55.060> a<00:02:55.090> little

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
dumpling with a bunch of little creases

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
dumpling with a bunch of little creases
all<00:04:11.230> right<00:04:11.349> so<00:04:11.500> then<00:04:11.650> you're<00:04:11.769> gonna<00:04:11.859> just<00:04:12.099> set

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250

all right so then you're gonna just set
it<00:04:12.340> on<00:04:12.459> top<00:04:12.489> of<00:04:13.030> some<00:04:13.900> blanched<00:04:14.139> cabbage<00:04:14.709> in

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
it on top of some blanched cabbage in

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.729 
it on top of some blanched cabbage in
your<00:04:15.489> steamer<00:04:16.320> and<00:04:17.320> if<00:04:17.440> you<00:04:17.500> don't<00:04:17.650> have

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
your steamer and if you don't have

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.589 
your steamer and if you don't have
cabbage<00:04:18.099> it's<00:04:18.250> perfectly<00:04:18.669> fine<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:19.000> use<00:04:19.359> some

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:19.599

parchment paper cut out with some little
holes<00:04:22.240> so<00:04:22.539> that<00:04:22.690> the<00:04:22.780> steam<00:04:23.020> comes<00:04:23.320> through

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
holes so that the steam comes through

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.230 
holes so that the steam comes through
and<00:04:23.919> then<00:04:24.340> you're<00:04:24.430> gonna<00:04:24.550> see<00:04:24.849> them<00:04:25.030> for<00:04:25.060> about

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
now when the jelly goes into the

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.420 
now when the jelly goes into the
dumpling<00:04:28.750> and<00:04:28.990> then<00:04:29.080> when<00:04:29.169> it

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
dumpling and then when it

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.980 
dumpling and then when it
into<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:29.880> steamer<00:04:30.150> and<00:04:30.300> it<00:04:30.389> heats<00:04:30.570> up<00:04:30.780> it's
