inch stable braid I have to force it a

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.830 
inch stable braid I have to force it a
little<00:03:33.070> but<00:03:34.070> under<00:03:34.459> tension<00:03:34.790> this<00:03:35.329> will<00:03:35.570> neck

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
little but under tension this will neck

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.530 
little but under tension this will neck
down<00:03:36.170> properly<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:37.840> settle<00:03:38.840> into<00:03:39.230> that<00:03:40.540> into

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
down properly and settle into that into

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.150 
down properly and settle into that into
that<00:03:41.720> beast<00:03:42.500> very<00:03:43.160> nicely<00:03:43.519> under<00:03:44.180> tension<00:03:45.160> the

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
that beast very nicely under tension the

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.580 
that beast very nicely under tension the
stable<00:03:46.820> braid<00:03:47.060> will<00:03:47.360> neck<00:03:47.630> down<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:48.320> you'll

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
stable braid will neck down and you'll

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.220

get<00:03:48.860> a<00:03:49.160> very<00:03:50.060> nicely<00:03:50.480> seated<00:03:52.989> assembly<00:03:53.989> there

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
get a very nicely seated assembly there

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.470 
get a very nicely seated assembly there
this<00:03:54.560> is<00:03:54.769> the<00:03:56.170> 38:28<00:03:57.170> with<00:03:57.799> one-inch<00:03:58.610> stable

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
this is the 38:28 with one-inch stable

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.680 
this is the 38:28 with one-inch stable
braid<00:03:59.750> and<00:04:00.170> I<00:04:00.650> think<00:04:00.860> that<00:04:01.070> works<00:04:01.370> fine<00:04:01.760> going

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
braid and I think that works fine going

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.920 
braid and I think that works fine going
anything<00:04:03.430> larger<00:04:04.430> than<00:04:04.459> that<00:04:04.640> I<00:04:04.820> think<00:04:05.090> is<00:04:05.510> not

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
anything larger than that I think is not

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.509 
anything larger than that I think is not
going<00:04:06.200> to<00:04:06.260> work<00:04:06.440> that's<00:04:06.799> inch-and-a-quarter

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
going to work that's inch-and-a-quarter

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.510 
going to work that's inch-and-a-quarter
stable<00:04:08.120> braid<00:04:08.360> that's<00:04:08.690> not<00:04:08.930> going<00:04:09.079> to<00:04:09.140> work<00:04:09.520> so

stable braid that's not going to work so
I<00:04:11.330> would<00:04:11.750> say<00:04:12.550> anything<00:04:13.550> from<00:04:13.879> 3/4<00:04:14.690> on

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
I would say anything from 3/4 on

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.050 
I would say anything from 3/4 on
three<00:04:15.569> quarters<00:04:16.070> seven<00:04:17.070> eighths<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.639> one

three quarters seven eighths and one

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.530 
three quarters seven eighths and one
inch<00:04:18.410> should<00:04:19.410> all<00:04:19.560> work<00:04:19.829> just<00:04:20.280> fine<00:04:23.510> some<00:04:24.510> of

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
with just two thoughts here one is the

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.600 
with just two thoughts here one is the
smaller<00:05:15.870> rings<00:05:16.320> are<00:05:16.650> certainly<00:05:17.190> going<00:05:17.490> to

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
smaller rings are certainly going to

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.640 
smaller rings are certainly going to
invite<00:05:18.150> people<00:05:18.479> to<00:05:18.810> think<00:05:19.050> about<00:05:19.140> it<00:05:19.470> in

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
invite people to think about it in

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.770 
invite people to think about it in
climbing<00:05:20.190> apparatus<00:05:20.910> and<00:05:21.180> I<00:05:21.300> think<00:05:21.539> that's

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
climbing apparatus and I think that's

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.730 
climbing apparatus and I think that's
fine<00:05:23.840> but<00:05:24.840> remember<00:05:25.050> these<00:05:25.530> are<00:05:25.710> not

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
fine but remember these are not

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.110 
fine but remember these are not
certified<00:05:26.460> for<00:05:26.490> climbing<00:05:27.270> and<00:05:28.669> not<00:05:29.669> against

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
that I did it when when I first launched

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.090 
that I did it when when I first launched
the<00:05:32.880> you<00:05:33.060> saver<00:05:33.419> I<00:05:33.780> was<00:05:34.440> using<00:05:34.710> a<00:05:34.950> none

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
the you saver I was using a none

the you saver I was using a none
certified<00:05:35.669> rigging<00:05:36.120> ring<00:05:36.390> and<00:05:38.300> you<00:05:39.300> know<00:05:39.330> I

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
certified rigging ring and you know I

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.090 
certified rigging ring and you know I
think<00:05:39.660> as<00:05:40.050> long<00:05:40.229> as<00:05:40.289> you<00:05:40.530> approach<00:05:40.860> it

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
think as long as you approach it

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.180 
think as long as you approach it
thoughtfully<00:05:41.340> and<00:05:41.970> and<00:05:42.740> make<00:05:43.740> your<00:05:43.919> choices

thoughtfully and and make your choices
carefully<00:05:44.669> I<00:05:44.970> think<00:05:45.360> that<00:05:45.510> can<00:05:45.690> work<00:05:45.840> out<00:05:46.050> fine

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
carefully I think that can work out fine

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.379 
carefully I think that can work out fine
but<00:05:46.770> just<00:05:47.010> just<00:05:47.460> be<00:05:47.610> aware<00:05:47.850> that<00:05:48.150> these<00:05:48.330> are

beasts<00:06:23.330> stacked<00:06:24.330> up<00:06:24.570> on<00:06:24.720> each<00:06:24.780> other<00:06:25.200> and<00:06:25.890> you

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
beasts stacked up on each other and you

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.490 
beasts stacked up on each other and you
can<00:06:26.490> see<00:06:26.700> there's<00:06:27.090> very<00:06:27.180> little

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
can see there's very little

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.850 
can see there's very little
difference<00:06:29.630> two<00:06:30.630> of<00:06:30.780> the<00:06:30.870> beasts<00:06:31.380> are<00:06:31.590> about

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
difference two of the beasts are about

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.780 
difference two of the beasts are about
an<00:06:32.190> eighth<00:06:32.340> of<00:06:32.550> an<00:06:32.670> inch<00:06:32.790> less<00:06:33.210> than<00:06:34.200> the<00:06:34.790> than

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790 
an eighth of an inch less than the than

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.880 
an eighth of an inch less than the than
the<00:06:35.820> height<00:06:36.330> of<00:06:36.540> the<00:06:36.750> three<00:06:37.500> of<00:06:37.620> the<00:06:37.740> original

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
the height of the three of the original

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.110 
the height of the three of the original
large<00:06:38.520> rings<00:06:39.680> and<00:06:40.680> it<00:06:40.890> strikes<00:06:41.220> me<00:06:41.370> that<00:06:41.490> two

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
large rings and it strikes me that two

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:48.280 
large rings and it strikes me that two
is<00:06:42.450> probably<00:06:43.550> alright<00:06:45.290> for<00:06:46.310> top<00:06:47.310> rigging

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.290 
is probably alright for top rigging

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:53.240 
is probably alright for top rigging
especially<00:06:49.580> because<00:06:50.580> the<00:06:51.360> center<00:06:52.020> ring<00:06:52.410> here

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
especially because the center ring here

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.540 
especially because the center ring here
of<00:06:53.430> the<00:06:53.820> of<00:06:54.060> the<00:06:54.330> of<00:06:54.660> the<00:06:54.840> three<00:06:55.140> ring<00:06:55.550> assembly

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
of the of the of the three ring assembly

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.420 
of the of the of the three ring assembly
the<00:06:56.760> center<00:06:57.090> ring<00:06:57.330> is<00:06:57.630> really<00:06:58.500> not<00:06:58.800> bending

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
the center ring is really not bending

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.940 
the center ring is really not bending
the<00:06:59.550> rope<00:06:59.790> at<00:07:00.060> all<00:07:00.330> it's<00:07:00.780> just<00:07:00.930> passing<00:07:01.560> the

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:01.950 
the rope at all it's just passing the

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:06.830 
the rope at all it's just passing the
rope<00:07:02.160> through<00:07:03.140> and<00:07:04.140> the<00:07:04.890> bend<00:07:05.700> radius<00:07:05.970> is<00:07:06.510> on

rope through and the bend radius is on

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.320 
rope through and the bend radius is on
the<00:07:07.140> beasts<00:07:07.440> are<00:07:07.919> certainly<00:07:08.370> softer<00:07:09.090> than

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.330 
the beasts are certainly softer than

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.450 
the beasts are certainly softer than
they<00:07:09.570> then<00:07:10.110> the<00:07:10.290> final<00:07:10.680> Bend<00:07:10.919> and<00:07:11.220> the<00:07:11.310> outer

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.010 
bend radius is on the original large

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.300 
bend radius is on the original large
rings<00:07:14.460> so<00:07:15.450> without<00:07:16.140> jumping<00:07:17.010> the<00:07:17.130> gun<00:07:17.160> here

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.909

and<00:07:17.970> without<00:07:18.270> you<00:07:19.080> know<00:07:19.110> without<00:07:19.350> David

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 
and without you know without David

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:21.800 
and without you know without David
having<00:07:20.100> done<00:07:20.430> his<00:07:20.700> testing<00:07:21.270> work<00:07:21.480> I'm

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810 
having done his testing work I'm

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.790 
having done his testing work I'm
certainly<00:07:22.260> not<00:07:22.410> in<00:07:22.590> a<00:07:22.680> position<00:07:22.860> to<00:07:23.270> to

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 
certainly not in a position to to

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.980 
certainly not in a position to to
recommend<00:07:25.800> this<00:07:26.040> but<00:07:26.880> it<00:07:27.300> strikes<00:07:27.660> me<00:07:27.870> that

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:27.990 
recommend this but it strikes me that

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:32.870 
recommend this but it strikes me that
the<00:07:28.440> the<00:07:28.680> beast<00:07:29.280> might<00:07:29.850> open<00:07:30.330> up<00:07:30.620> the<00:07:31.620> the<00:07:31.950> the

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 
the the beast might open up the the the

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.090 
the the beast might open up the the the
possibility<00:07:33.600> of<00:07:33.750> doing<00:07:33.960> some<00:07:34.140> top<00:07:34.590> rigging

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:35.100 
possibility of doing some top rigging

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:40.610 
possibility of doing some top rigging
with<00:07:35.310> only<00:07:35.520> with<00:07:36.450> only<00:07:36.660> two<00:07:37.020> rings<00:07:37.290> in<00:07:38.010> play<00:07:39.620> so

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:40.620 
with only with only two rings in play so

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.100 
with only with only two rings in play so
those<00:07:40.830> are<00:07:40.950> my<00:07:41.070> two<00:07:41.490> thoughts<00:07:41.820> David<00:07:42.720> I<00:07:42.840> think

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.110 
those are my two thoughts David I think

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.980 
those are my two thoughts David I think
you<00:07:43.260> you<00:07:43.919> just<00:07:44.190> continued<00:07:44.729> to<00:07:44.940> want<00:07:45.240> to<00:07:45.780> knock

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:45.990 
you you just continued to want to knock

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.380 
you you just continued to want to knock
the<00:07:46.169> cover<00:07:46.350> off<00:07:46.620> the<00:07:46.800> ball<00:07:46.830> here<00:07:47.400> I<00:07:47.580> know

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:48.390 
the cover off the ball here I know

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.960 
the cover off the ball here I know
you've<00:07:48.750> got<00:07:48.930> yet<00:07:49.290> another<00:07:49.590> thing<00:07:49.950> still<00:07:50.820> up

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:50.970 
you've got yet another thing still up

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.090 
you've got yet another thing still up
your<00:07:51.150> sleeve<00:07:51.450> and<00:07:51.479> I<00:07:52.169> look<00:07:52.380> forward<00:07:52.710> to<00:07:52.770> seeing

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:53.100 
your sleeve and I look forward to seeing

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.140 
your sleeve and I look forward to seeing
that<00:07:53.160> keep<00:07:53.970> up<00:07:54.120> the<00:07:54.240> good<00:07:54.360> work<00:07:54.419> David

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:56.150 
that keep up the good work David

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.390 
that keep up the good work David
thanks<00:07:57.150> for<00:07:57.270> watching
