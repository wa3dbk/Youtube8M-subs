00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:08.969
 dear friends of marco polo we now see the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.429
 first switching on of the iphone 5 and the 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.169
 activation procedure 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.940
 we remind you that it is not necessary 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:18.260
 use a computer to activate 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.430
 the iphone but just have one inserted 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.660
 sim card 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.170
 we remember they were sim to activate the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.170
 phone 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:40.890
 the first usual screen requires that 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.200
 both a slide and the first one 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.530
 request is that of the setting 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.579
 of the proposed default language 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.610
 the Italian 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:57.140
 we confirm here in the case of a sim 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:04.049
 card locked with pin code 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:06.450
 we have to enter this code is 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.780
 confirm 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.600
 if the sim card was set with 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.510
 unlock code to 0 all zeros 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.990
 this procedure would not be necessary 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.990
 go on 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.570
 the country is also required in this 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:37.020
 case it is shown Italy as values 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:41.500
 by default we proceed in the case of 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:46.539
 presence of wifi networks we can 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:50.409
 connect in this case it is about 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:53.729
 a protected network and proceed with 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.729
 entering the access password 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.049
 we confirm 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.330
 and let's go to the next screen 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.510
 this is the real procedure of 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.510
 activation 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.270
 in this case, if required 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.450
 enable or disable the services of 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.450
 geolocation 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:27.530
 we confirm from this screen we can 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.720
 decide whether to restore 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.660
 backup our old model 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.610
 iphone or configure the device 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:41.030
 as a new device 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:42.860
 we choose a new device from 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.390
 this screen we can choose if 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.370
 use an account of an apple id already 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.790
 existing or that to creating one 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.910
 new 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.910
 we will use an existing account 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:05.909
 here we see a series of conditions 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:08.819
 contractual conditions to be accepted 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:12.480
 necessarily to be able to proceed 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:16.769
 clearly few will read 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:20.079
 this endless series of clauses 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:23.099
 however we try to trust and ad 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.099
 accept them all 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.940
 here you are asked whether to use or not 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.630
 icloud services discretion 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.110
 user 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.560
 you can choose whether to synchronize the data 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:54.630
 with apple servers or not 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.630
 we decide not to use icloud 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.820
 here we see the activation of the 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.180
 of the Syrian voice assistant who with 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:10.090
 the onset of ios 6 was localized 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:17.080
 also in Italian 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:21.640
 we use and confirm from this 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:24.820
 screen will ask whether to send the 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:29.200
 diagnostic notifications we decide 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:33.640
 not to cooperate and not send them to 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.540
 this point iphone 5 active we can 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.540
 start using it
