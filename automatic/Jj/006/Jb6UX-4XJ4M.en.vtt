 the shape eco of the company makers europe 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:13.580
 is a tabletop cnc router the kit 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.410
 with all needed parts already can 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.410
 be realized with 400 euros 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.590
 thanks to the English-language instructions 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:32.210
 on the internet, the montage is right 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:34.370
 just dix and y ax dare 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.890
 roll out and store together 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.380
 and equipped with stepper motors the 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.850
 Dare were on the majors sorry profiles 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.850
 and move the cutter 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.350
 the axle spindle leaves the dremel 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.350
 go up and down 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.750
 The Baumarkt dremel was banned from the 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.850
 christ 1050 fmg freese exchanged the 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.820
 voltage supply takes over 1 19 per 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.979
 laptop power adapter the stepper motor card 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.070
 is via a parallel port with the pc 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.040
 banned or like here about a hp thin 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.869
 pc operated on this works the 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.869
 control software linux cnc 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.320
 This will be done with the help of a cad program 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.200
 test pattern then creates it by cnc 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.220
 software as an order to the ego eco 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.220
 given freese 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.240
 The mill starts to work 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.349
 And this is how the test pattern looks at the end
