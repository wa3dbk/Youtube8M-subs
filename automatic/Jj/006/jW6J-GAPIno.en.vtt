farm<00:01:52.290> factor<00:01:52.740> slider<00:01:54.649> pretty<00:01:55.649> small<00:01:55.950> smaller

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
farm factor slider pretty small smaller

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.249 
farm factor slider pretty small smaller
than<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.640> expected<00:01:56.759> kind<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> pre<00:01:58.020> but

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
there you go so here's the battery now

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.070 
there you go so here's the battery now
these<00:02:12.910> are<00:02:13.060> supposed<00:02:13.210> to<00:02:13.480> get<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.690> couple<00:02:13.930> days

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
these are supposed to get a couple days

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.320 
these are supposed to get a couple days
battery<00:02:14.800> worth<00:02:15.010> battery<00:02:15.880> life<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.180> that's

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
battery worth battery life so that's

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.320 
battery worth battery life so that's
going<00:02:16.570> to<00:02:16.630> be<00:02:16.750> pretty<00:02:17.130> impressive<00:02:18.330> little

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
going to be pretty impressive little
