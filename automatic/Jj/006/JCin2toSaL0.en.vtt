00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.750
 Welcome to god morning 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.040
 daily view on godmodetrader daily 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.250
 live from 8 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.010
 the price for a us for a barrel 1 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.580
 barrel for a 159 liter barrel of light oil 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.580
 wti the sinks even if the big bang 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.800
 yesterday stayed under $ 42 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.119
 Japan's economy shrank from April 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.550
 until June 16 was the us reporting season 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.500
 the weakest in six years and in 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.050
 The US shrinks the industrial 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.300
 Activity in Greater New York is so strong 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.280
 as it has not done since the financial crisis 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.670
 goldman sachs believes that the prices for 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.620
 iron ore will break in again 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.390
 and expect a sideways movement 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.579
 at the wallstreet at least until 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.950
 New Year highs are not 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.200
 foreseeable after a short shock moment 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.329
 Stocks were traded yesterday after the weak ones 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.329
 Industry data from the United States, however 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.190
 bought again because they know that 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.699
 the last few months and years bad 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.680
 data yes mean that the us bank 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.110
 Her first interest rate step later 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.970
 then I could do that through the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.760
 bad data also other central banks 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.799
 could be motivated to see more 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.460
 to distribute money gifts to the stock exchanges 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.280
 What is different this time is the gold 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.280
 at the same time, above all, the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.040
 Mine shares are wanted so there is 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.560
 rising mining shares and rising 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.049
 gold prices and rising stocks 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.970
 general everything at the same time and that 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.189
 is new and should be watched 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.189
 not that we overlook something 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.030
 know that the sp 500 index in the 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.900
 past 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.579
 last year here at year- end 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.649
 here one time high after the other 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.290
 In 2014 he jumped 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.210
 altogether 53 times on new record 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.020
 he moves this year 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.479
 sideways 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.220
 the same investors yesterday shares 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.549
 have bought raw materials the day before yesterday 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.860
 and commodity stocks in a big way at the 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.360
 thrown on the market here they are 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.290
 so Bavarian what the set 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.640
 real economy of the expectation selbiger 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.350
 development of the real economy 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.720
 is the reason for the shares 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.640
 Enthusiasm simply that there is no 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.310
 meaningful old 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.140
 Steven admits you can stick that in front 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.060
 especially the big quality shares 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.940
 the defensive sectors 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.770
 be as if then shares then loud 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.050
 the mother's happiness safe title 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.860
 this is the behavior of investors 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.450
 a weakening of the 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.000
 expect economic growth 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.620
 china plays an important role in this 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.990
 the international currency fund has 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.540
 calculates that the debt of China 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.970
 including the state of the 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.160
 state enterprise sector of 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.080
 it's not quite parastatal 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.930
 may all this come together 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.660
 a debt ratio is a share of 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.040
 the total debt on 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.519
 gross domestic product by 2020 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.190
 of 250 percent while that 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.430
 China's growth until then by the year 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.860
 2020 could have weakened to five 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.810
 But the Chinese debt can 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.380
 also be useful if china manages 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.050
 to make his yuan freely tradable and 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.269
 free trade or free trade 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.000
 I think that they do that 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.190
 should the us dollar has in 2011 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.890
 a cyclical multi-year low 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.750
 trained and likely to be coming 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.620
 years continue to appreciate also opposite 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.079
 the yuan 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.000
 The claim that China's central bank 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.459
 secretly larger amounts of gold than you 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.380
 I can buy publicly 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.900
 However, that would not connect 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.970
 not the yuan in the current environment 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.920
 weaken but strengthen and enter 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.799
 Strong yuan is against the interest 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.840
 Beijing They only want the yuan 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.880
 let recognize worldwide as a currency 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.320
 which is taken seriously by one 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.720
 replace the us dollars as 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.489
 World Reserve currency through the yuan can 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.280
 for a long time to be no speech 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.870
 this is mainly because of the us 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.090
 dollar lower market is that of 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.980
 liquidity is just that, too 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.410
 the reason why the euro in the present 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.720
 form no real threat than 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.730
 World Reserve currency is a threat 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.100
 for the us dollar this status 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.440
 Investors just can not get in 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.180
 flee the euro 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.560
 because which bonds should they buy 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.989
 they should be next to Greek 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.770
 Italian German already gives it 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.840
 hardly worth more 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.250
 Here is the current one 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.280
 greece negotiations show yes 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.080
 then every debtor actually carries 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.320
 another hardly any more 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.450
 calculable risk of the yuan has that 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.400
 same problem as the euro the market 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.170
 it just is not big enough there 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.690
 transparent enough so that the 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.760
 Capital there in a big way and before 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.770
 could flee everything quickly and there the 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.230
 emerging countries are becoming more and more problematic 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.220
 There is increasingly only one left 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.560
 alternative 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.750
 and that's the us dollar i think that 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.340
 parity to the us dollar only one 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.440
 Interim stop of the euro in the coming 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.810
 years will show it will be even deeper 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.670
 also go below 0.9 us dollars 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.310
 look at the situation in 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.170
 Malaysia on a swell land 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.940
 swell land on the one in the 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.760
 Great hopes in the past years 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.350
 has set the ring gives the 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.880
 national currency field too strong that 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.990
 memories are awakened to the year 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.370
 1998 came in the midst of the Asian crisis 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.310
 it is a collision of the 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.670
 Malaysian government there and 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.800
 george soros because of the speculator 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.630
 who has bet against the ring 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.520
 Today, the government is in 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.560
 Malaysia again foreign speculators 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.510
 responsible and the central bank 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.060
 boss just scolded george clean 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.780
 as weak head because he also 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.030
 speculation is because the government of Malaysia 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.290
 with interventions on the foreign exchange market 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.200
 attempted coup of the ring goes 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:45.260
 the foreign exchange reserves sank 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.720
 of the country this year by 17 percent 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.850
 to 96 billion US dollars 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.680
 and that in turn calls this development 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.510
 now more and more new speculators on 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.220
 the plan to bet against the ring 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.590
 as with dwindling 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.660
 currency reserves also the scope of the 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.300
 Government continues to restrict itself since 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.860
 The beginning of the year has the rings to the us dollar 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.020
 devalued by a quarter 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.330
 fall speed is last 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.290
 to the reason why I do it all 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.030
 tell 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.700
 The emerging countries are at almost eight 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.860
 trillion us dollar short in the us dollar 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.680
 and a short squeeze of only one part 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.600
 this position becomes a strong one 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.820
 push in the us dollar lead that at least 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.340
 My expectation I became yesterday 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.390
 asked where I got gold mines in three to 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.030
 to see five years 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:32.180
 i would say further in the crisis because 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.830
 burden a strong dollar gold price 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.860
 and thus the stitches of the 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.990
 gold mines the big biggest 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.240
 supporter of the gold price in the 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.010
 last years were the central banks 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.730
 the emerging countries the purchase 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:48.230
 supported by gold here the gold price 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.910
 have in this environment the just 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.580
 that should have happened 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:55.820
 However, these emerging countries could 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:58.370
 to completely discontinue your golf gold purchase 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:00.350
 They buy gold because they own theirs 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.270
 grown significantly foreign exchange reserves of the 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.270
 there are a normal balance again 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.890
 wanted to produce the gold share of the 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.870
 was relatively shrunk as they have 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.370
 gold purchase the share again 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.220
 normal historical 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.780
 average level rises again 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.240
 now where the fx reserves so the 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.560
 currency reserves would shrink 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.270
 actually only a coherent step 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.280
 that it is somewhere to stop the 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.840
 Gold purchases is coming and that maybe 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.090
 even in the next step to one 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.550
 Gold will come through the sale 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.440
 Central banks are only here 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.390
 supported goldpreis and find that 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.150
 It is a risk that the gold market 

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:38.270
 actually not here so big 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:40.730
 on the plan I did look forward to 

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:42.500
 I am looking forward to your thesis 

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:45.560
 opinion it is now around 38 

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:48.190
 until 39 again the live chat on my 

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.060
 Experts of the hospital take place until the same 

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.500
 that 's it for me again 

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.500
 today they will turn back tomorrow 

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:56.330
 a live 8 on the godmodetrader at 9.00
