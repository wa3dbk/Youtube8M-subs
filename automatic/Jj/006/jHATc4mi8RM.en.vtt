an unbelievable memory and I think what
the<00:00:31.040> the<00:00:32.040> memory<00:00:32.369> part<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.730> really<00:00:32.850> unique<00:00:33.329> but

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the the memory part is really unique but

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.780 
the the memory part is really unique but
