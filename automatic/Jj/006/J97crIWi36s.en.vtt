called the falsify ihd and I saw this

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.109 
called the falsify ihd and I saw this
when<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.619> was<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:16.800> Boots<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.190> other<00:00:17.400> day<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.970> I

when I was in Boots the other day and I

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.240 
when I was in Boots the other day and I

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
saw the before and after picture which I

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.950 
saw the before and after picture which I
will<00:00:20.460> zoom<00:00:20.490> up<00:00:20.789> on<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.359> thought<00:00:21.570> I'm<00:00:21.869> gonna

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
will zoom up on and I thought I'm gonna

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.349 
will zoom up on and I thought I'm gonna
have<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.320> try<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.070> since<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.789> was<00:00:23.939> new<00:00:24.119> I

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
have to try that and since it was new I

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.779 
have to try that and since it was new I
thought<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.750> would<00:00:24.900> try<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.890> camera<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.550> do

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
thought I would try it on camera and do

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:27.980 
thought I would try it on camera and do

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
one of the plastic bristles I'm not sure

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.010 
one of the plastic bristles I'm not sure
if<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.680> can<00:00:46.860> see<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.450> got<00:00:48.660> lots

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
if you can see that so and it's got lots

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.920 
if you can see that so and it's got lots
of<00:00:49.320> different<00:00:49.379> spikes<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.750> it<00:00:51.750> doesn't

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
of different spikes on it and it doesn't

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.459 
of different spikes on it and it doesn't
have<00:00:52.170> one<00:00:52.410> at<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.620> top<00:00:53.480> like<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:55.050> benefit

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
have one at the top like the benefit

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.130 
have one at the top like the benefit
ones<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.860> stuff<00:00:56.070> half<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.059> kind<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.480> goes

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
ones and stuff half but it kind of goes

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.590 
ones and stuff half but it kind of goes
to<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> point<00:00:59.219> I'm<00:00:59.460> not<00:00:59.489> sure<00:00:59.609> if<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.210> see

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
to a point I'm not sure if you can see

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.139 
to a point I'm not sure if you can see
um<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.800> probably<00:01:02.250> won't<00:01:02.670> be<00:01:02.760> able<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.969> see

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
um you probably won't be able to see

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.440 
um you probably won't be able to see
that<00:01:03.329> but<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.960> kind<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.409> goes<00:01:05.129> smaller<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.240> I've

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
that but it kind of goes smaller so I've

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.270 
that but it kind of goes smaller so I've
zoomed<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.840> up<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.110> little<00:01:07.260> bit<00:01:07.470> now<00:01:07.860> I'm<00:01:08.070> just

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
zoomed you up a little bit now I'm just

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.710 
zoomed you up a little bit now I'm just
going<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.580> curl<00:01:09.030> my<00:01:09.150> lashes<00:01:13.580> and<00:01:14.580> now<00:01:14.720> I'm

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
going to curl my lashes and now I'm

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.679 
going to curl my lashes and now I'm
going<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.049> get<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.350> with<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.100> first<00:01:17.369> coat<00:01:17.790> I

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.450 

can<00:01:24.689> definitely<00:01:24.960> see<00:01:25.590> them<00:01:25.799> at<00:01:25.950> lengthens

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
can definitely see them at lengthens

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.780 
can definitely see them at lengthens
your<00:01:26.580> lashes<00:01:27.180> quite<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> lot

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.970 

okay<00:01:35.720> so<00:01:35.780> I'm<00:01:36.050> gonna<00:01:36.230> leave<00:01:36.440> that<00:01:36.470> as<00:01:36.830> the

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
okay so I'm gonna leave that as the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.070 
okay so I'm gonna leave that as the
first<00:01:37.250> cool<00:01:37.580> now<00:01:38.240> you<00:01:38.330> can't<00:01:38.600> build<00:01:38.840> much

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
first cool now you can't build much

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.530 
first cool now you can't build much
volume<00:01:39.710> but<00:01:40.130> it<00:01:40.250> definitely<00:01:40.430> lengthens<00:01:41.300> them

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
volume but it definitely lengthens them

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.970 
volume but it definitely lengthens them
which<00:01:41.720> I<00:01:41.870> guess<00:01:42.050> is<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:42.410> point<00:01:42.440> of<00:01:42.830> the

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
which I guess is the point of the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.770 
which I guess is the point of the
mascara<00:01:43.340> is<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.850> really<00:01:44.180> lengthen<00:01:45.010> and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
mascara is to really lengthen and

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.120 
mascara is to really lengthen and
obviously<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:47.960> plastic<00:01:48.470> bristles<00:01:48.680> are

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
obviously the plastic bristles are

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.370 
obviously the plastic bristles are
really<00:01:49.400> helping<00:01:49.760> to<00:01:49.970> grip<00:01:50.270> on<00:01:50.480> from<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.170> base

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
really helping to grip on from the base

00:01:51.380 --> 00:02:05.430 
really helping to grip on from the base
of<00:01:51.740> your<00:01:51.770> lashes

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.260 

okay<00:02:06.440> I'm<00:02:06.590> now<00:02:06.710> gonna<00:02:06.860> go<00:02:07.070> in<00:02:07.250> with<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.790> second

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
okay I'm now gonna go in with the second

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.870 
okay I'm now gonna go in with the second
coat<00:02:08.509> and<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:12.440> can<00:02:12.650> really<00:02:12.890> see<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:13.310> that<00:02:13.520> has

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
coat and I can really see that that has

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.910 
coat and I can really see that that has
lengthened<00:02:14.480> them<00:02:14.690> quite<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.320> lot<00:02:15.680> the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
lengthened them quite a lot the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.850 
lengthened them quite a lot the
difference<00:02:16.460> between<00:02:16.990> my<00:02:17.990> right<00:02:18.260> eye<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.470> my

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
difference between my right eye and my

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.070 
difference between my right eye and my

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
give my full review I'd say I can't I

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.680 
give my full review I'd say I can't I
don't<00:03:48.620> know<00:03:48.829> if<00:03:48.920> you<00:03:49.010> can<00:03:49.190> see<00:03:49.549> but<00:03:50.209> the<00:03:50.389> Carl

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
don't know if you can see but the Carl

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.370 
don't know if you can see but the Carl
has<00:03:51.049> really<00:03:51.500> held<00:03:51.799> very<00:03:52.250> well<00:03:52.549> and<00:03:53.079> the<00:03:54.079> length

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
has really held very well and the length

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.650 
has really held very well and the length
is<00:03:54.650> still<00:03:54.859> completely<00:03:55.370> there<00:03:55.819> I<00:03:56.000> think<00:03:56.540> it's

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
is still completely there I think it's

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.050 
is still completely there I think it's
held<00:03:56.870> up<00:03:56.989> really<00:03:57.049> well<00:03:57.410> it<00:03:58.220> is<00:03:58.489> soft<00:03:58.819> to<00:03:59.030> touch

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
held up really well it is soft to touch

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.910 
held up really well it is soft to touch
so<00:03:59.569> I<00:03:59.600> can<00:03:59.840> imagine<00:04:00.019> it's<00:04:00.350> going<00:04:00.470> to<00:04:00.530> be<00:04:00.650> pretty

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
so I can imagine it's going to be pretty

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.370 
so I can imagine it's going to be pretty
easy<00:04:01.069> to<00:04:01.519> take<00:04:01.730> off<00:04:02.060> this<00:04:02.540> mascara<00:04:02.930> it's<00:04:03.230> not

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
easy to take off this mascara it's not

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.410 
easy to take off this mascara it's not
one<00:04:03.530> of<00:04:03.560> those<00:04:03.799> hard<00:04:04.160> mascara<00:04:05.120> is<00:04:05.209> you<00:04:05.329> know

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
one of those hard mascara is you know

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.300 
one of those hard mascara is you know
like<00:04:05.569> sometimes<00:04:05.810> the<00:04:06.170> benefit<00:04:06.590> mascara<00:04:06.709> can

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
like sometimes the benefit mascara can

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.490 
like sometimes the benefit mascara can
be<00:04:07.489> really<00:04:07.730> difficult<00:04:07.910> to<00:04:08.269> take<00:04:08.599> off<00:04:08.840> so<00:04:09.319> from

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
be really difficult to take off so from

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.160 
be really difficult to take off so from
that<00:04:09.620> point<00:04:09.799> of<00:04:10.010> view<00:04:10.069> I'm<00:04:10.370> very<00:04:10.609> very<00:04:10.790> happy

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
that point of view I'm very very happy

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.440 
that point of view I'm very very happy
for<00:04:12.170> me<00:04:12.410> personally<00:04:12.829> I<00:04:13.220> like<00:04:13.579> to<00:04:13.790> get<00:04:13.940> a<00:04:14.120> lot<00:04:14.329> of

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
for me personally I like to get a lot of

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.000 
for me personally I like to get a lot of
volume<00:04:14.690> and<00:04:14.989> so<00:04:15.200> I<00:04:15.230> would<00:04:15.380> maybe<00:04:15.560> do<00:04:15.829> three

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
volume and so I would maybe do three

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.400 
volume and so I would maybe do three
coats<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:16.669> box<00:04:16.910> advises<00:04:17.510> to<00:04:17.690> do<00:04:17.810> two<00:04:18.079> course

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
coats the box advises to do two course

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.469 
coats the box advises to do two course
and<00:04:18.709> I<00:04:19.370> think<00:04:19.489> it<00:04:19.789> would<00:04:19.910> get<00:04:20.120> a<00:04:20.180> bit<00:04:20.359> more

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
and I think it would get a bit more

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.960 
and I think it would get a bit more
clumpy<00:04:21.019> if<00:04:21.049> you<00:04:21.620> do<00:04:22.010> more<00:04:22.250> course<00:04:22.520> obviously

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
clumpy if you do more course obviously

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.930 
clumpy if you do more course obviously
and<00:04:23.389> so<00:04:23.780> I<00:04:23.840> just<00:04:24.020> did<00:04:24.169> a<00:04:24.200> two<00:04:24.500> that<00:04:25.220> tomorrow<00:04:25.789> I

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
and so I just did a two that tomorrow I

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.659 
and so I just did a two that tomorrow I
might<00:04:26.090> try<00:04:26.240> three<00:04:26.720> and<00:04:27.650> I<00:04:28.190> would<00:04:28.430> definitely

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
might try three and I would definitely

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.520 
might try three and I would definitely
say<00:04:29.120> it's<00:04:29.150> worth<00:04:29.450> it<00:04:29.660> if<00:04:29.840> you<00:04:30.020> typically<00:04:30.410> go

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
say it's worth it if you typically go

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.960 
say it's worth it if you typically go
for<00:04:30.560> a<00:04:30.770> lengthening<00:04:31.190> mascara<00:04:31.310> I<00:04:31.789> would

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
for a lengthening mascara I would

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.210 
for a lengthening mascara I would
definitely<00:04:32.510> recommend<00:04:32.660> this<00:04:33.260> it<00:04:33.770> hasn't

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
definitely recommend this it hasn't

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.190 
definitely recommend this it hasn't
fallen<00:04:34.520> at<00:04:34.820> all<00:04:35.030> you<00:04:35.240> know<00:04:35.360> how<00:04:35.479> sometimes<00:04:35.720> you

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
fallen at all you know how sometimes you

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.680 
fallen at all you know how sometimes you
think<00:04:36.620> we'll<00:04:36.770> get<00:04:36.889> the<00:04:37.039> little<00:04:37.220> marks<00:04:38.210> the

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
think we'll get the little marks the

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.960 
think we'll get the little marks the
little<00:04:38.900> dots<00:04:39.139> of<00:04:39.349> black<00:04:39.650> almost<00:04:40.160> crumbled<00:04:40.820> off

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
little dots of black almost crumbled off

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.480 
little dots of black almost crumbled off
from<00:04:41.300> your<00:04:41.539> mascara<00:04:42.020> that<00:04:42.650> hasn't<00:04:42.950> happened

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
from your mascara that hasn't happened

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.980 
from your mascara that hasn't happened
to<00:04:43.550> me<00:04:43.580> at<00:04:43.760> all<00:04:43.970> I<00:04:44.210> haven't<00:04:44.510> really<00:04:44.690> had<00:04:44.840> to

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
to me at all I haven't really had to

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.580 
to me at all I haven't really had to
touch<00:04:45.169> anything<00:04:45.620> up<00:04:46.960> yeah<00:04:47.960> I<00:04:48.169> really<00:04:48.380> think

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
touch anything up yeah I really think

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.230 
touch anything up yeah I really think
this<00:04:48.830> is<00:04:48.950> done<00:04:49.099> well<00:04:49.310> it's<00:04:49.610> completely

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
this is done well it's completely

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.510 
this is done well it's completely
separated<00:04:51.050> my<00:04:51.229> lashes<00:04:51.530> very<00:04:51.979> well

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
separated my lashes very well

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.969 
separated my lashes very well
I'll<00:04:52.669> see<00:04:53.150> if<00:04:53.330> I<00:04:53.479> can<00:04:53.659> do<00:04:53.840> a<00:04:53.870> nice<00:04:54.169> close-up<00:04:54.680> of

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
I'll see if I can do a nice close-up of

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.909 
I'll see if I can do a nice close-up of
my<00:04:55.250> eyes<00:04:55.630> as<00:04:56.630> you<00:04:56.870> can<00:04:57.050> see<00:04:57.349> they're<00:04:57.680> really

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
my eyes as you can see they're really

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:58.839 
my eyes as you can see they're really
really

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
really

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.320 
really
and<00:04:59.149> and<00:04:59.419> it<00:05:00.199> doesn't<00:05:01.039> look<00:05:01.279> too<00:05:01.580> clumpy<00:05:01.939> I've

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
and and it doesn't look too clumpy I've

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.409 
and and it doesn't look too clumpy I've
got<00:05:02.779> some<00:05:03.020> on<00:05:03.229> my<00:05:03.409> eyelids<00:05:04.039> but<00:05:04.639> I<00:05:04.939> don't<00:05:05.360> think

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
got some on my eyelids but I don't think

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.989 
got some on my eyelids but I don't think
made<00:05:05.659> too<00:05:05.869> much<00:05:06.020> about<00:05:06.259> that<00:05:06.529> but<00:05:07.039> yeah<00:05:07.249> as<00:05:07.550> you

00:05:07.989 --> 00:05:07.999 
made too much about that but yeah as you

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:10.209 
made too much about that but yeah as you
can<00:05:08.119> see<00:05:08.360> the<00:05:08.659> curl<00:05:08.929> is<00:05:09.229> held<00:05:09.469> really<00:05:09.709> well<00:05:09.949> and

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:10.219 
can see the curl is held really well and

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:13.480 
can see the curl is held really well and
as<00:05:10.339> I<00:05:10.459> said<00:05:10.669> this<00:05:10.819> is<00:05:10.999> about<00:05:11.089> 6<00:05:11.449> or<00:05:11.599> 7<00:05:12.199> hours<00:05:12.490> so

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
as I said this is about 6 or 7 hours so

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.629 
as I said this is about 6 or 7 hours so
I<00:05:13.520> think<00:05:13.699> it's<00:05:14.300> done<00:05:14.599> pretty<00:05:15.080> well<00:05:15.229> so<00:05:16.039> that<00:05:16.429> is

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
I think it's done pretty well so that is

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.149 
I think it's done pretty well so that is
