00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.190 
when I tasted it I realized that the
pudding<00:03:14.920> tasted<00:03:15.609> like<00:03:15.820> banana<00:03:16.239> without<00:03:16.870> a

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
pudding tasted like banana without a

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.130 
pudding tasted like banana without a
banana<00:03:17.650> slice<00:03:18.040> so<00:03:18.880> in<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.239> oven<00:03:19.540> I'm<00:03:19.720> guessing

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
banana slice so in the oven I'm guessing

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.880 
banana slice so in the oven I'm guessing
banana<00:03:20.560> oils<00:03:20.980> mix<00:03:21.310> into<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.670> pudding<00:03:22.060> maybe

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
banana oils mix into the pudding maybe

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.860 
banana oils mix into the pudding maybe
trust<00:03:23.890> me<00:03:24.100> it's<00:03:24.310> banana<00:03:24.790> pudding<00:03:25.150> so<00:03:25.630> we're

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
trust me it's banana pudding so we're

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.360 
trust me it's banana pudding so we're
going<00:03:26.049> to<00:03:26.170> bake<00:03:26.320> this<00:03:26.350> in<00:03:26.709> a<00:03:26.769> preheated<00:03:27.010> oven

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370
