00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
sword so yeah that's better than turn

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.760

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
creatures off his board yeah I think

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.729 
creatures off his board yeah I think
that<00:02:41.630> might<00:02:41.780> be<00:02:41.810> fine<00:02:42.079> actually<00:02:42.350> I'm<00:02:42.590> not

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
that might be fine actually I'm not

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.060 
that might be fine actually I'm not
going<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:42.980> be<00:02:43.070> short<00:02:43.250> on<00:02:43.400> creatures<00:02:43.850> to<00:02:44.000> equip

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
going to be short on creatures to equip

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.170 
going to be short on creatures to equip
whereas<00:02:46.070> if<00:02:46.220> he<00:02:46.310> starts<00:02:46.459> making<00:02:46.609> a<00:02:46.910> bunch<00:02:47.090> of

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
whereas if he starts making a bunch of

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.509 
whereas if he starts making a bunch of
blockers<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.600> it<00:02:47.810> gets<00:02:48.019> worse<00:02:48.290> for<00:02:48.799> me<00:02:48.950> so<00:02:49.310> I'm

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
blockers and it gets worse for me so I'm

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.310

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
going to not play it see what he does he

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.789

wave<00:03:34.900> dealing<00:03:35.900> with<00:03:35.989> Ross<00:03:36.230> yes<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:36.650> I<00:03:36.709> guess

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
wave dealing with Ross yes and I guess

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.750 
wave dealing with Ross yes and I guess
what<00:03:39.739> I<00:03:39.769> could<00:03:39.920> have<00:03:39.950> done<00:03:40.069> there<00:03:40.370> is<00:03:40.459> blocked

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
what I could have done there is blocked

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.309 
what I could have done there is blocked
because<00:03:40.970> then<00:03:41.209> it<00:03:41.299> forces<00:03:41.629> him<00:03:41.659> to<00:03:41.810> triple

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
because then it forces him to triple

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.410 
because then it forces him to triple
pump<00:03:42.560> and<00:03:43.430> then<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:43.640> royal<00:03:43.819> assassin<00:03:44.209> gets

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
pump and then the royal assassin gets

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.270 
pump and then the royal assassin gets
him

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
him

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.830 
him
and<00:03:45.700> really<00:03:46.000> think<00:03:46.270> that's<00:03:46.390> through<00:03:46.569> I<00:03:46.600> should

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
and really think that's through I should

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.180 
and really think that's through I should
have<00:03:46.930> thought<00:03:47.020> of<00:03:47.080> that<00:03:47.170> before<00:03:47.290> I<00:03:47.920> blocked<00:03:48.220> ah

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.540 
that even though I already had too
acidic<00:04:23.530> side<00:04:23.770> it<00:04:23.950> might<00:04:24.070> be<00:04:24.220> worth<00:04:24.340> bringing

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
acidic side it might be worth bringing

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.790 
acidic side it might be worth bringing
in<00:04:24.790> just<00:04:25.450> for<00:04:25.540> the<00:04:25.630> mind<00:04:25.780> control<00:04:25.930> I<00:04:28.590> did<00:04:29.590> not

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
in just for the mind control I did not

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.350 
in just for the mind control I did not
see<00:04:29.980> any<00:04:30.130> stabbing<00:04:30.550> good<00:04:30.850> stabbing<00:04:31.210> pain

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
see any stabbing good stabbing pain

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.050 
see any stabbing good stabbing pain
targets<00:04:31.870> although<00:04:32.650> is<00:04:32.800> good<00:04:33.010> with<00:04:33.190> Z<00:04:33.460> royal

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
targets although is good with Z royal

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.400 
targets although is good with Z royal
assassin<00:04:34.480> especially<00:04:34.810> when<00:04:34.930> he's<00:04:35.020> blue<00:04:35.169> black

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
assassin especially when he's blue black

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.230 
assassin especially when he's blue black
so<00:04:35.530> you<00:04:35.590> might<00:04:35.710> have<00:04:35.800> ways<00:04:36.010> of<00:04:36.160> dealing<00:04:36.370> with

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
so you might have ways of dealing with

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.550 
so you might have ways of dealing with
royal<00:04:37.479> assassin<00:04:37.870> so<00:04:38.020> it<00:04:38.080> wouldn't<00:04:38.290> just<00:04:38.440> sit

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
royal assassin so it wouldn't just sit

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.120 
royal assassin so it wouldn't just sit
there<00:04:38.710> forever<00:04:38.860> not<00:04:39.220> doing<00:04:39.400> anything<00:04:41.130> attempt

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
there forever not doing anything attempt

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.440 
there forever not doing anything attempt
to<00:04:42.250> take<00:04:42.400> up<00:04:42.550> doom<00:04:42.729> blade<00:04:42.850> I<00:04:42.940> didn't<00:04:43.210> see<00:04:43.300> any
