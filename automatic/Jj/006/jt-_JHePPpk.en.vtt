 hello asshole has come the god of death in his first video to fuck them 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.410
 lives a little while since I'm out of business today is I come to talk about a topic 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.110
 that although it is something old the assholes fanboys continue to affirm it is about 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.560
 that the metal gear solid 4 guns of the patriots is supposed to come out 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.260
 the xbox 360 and I'll tell you once that this is a piece of putrid shit 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.679
 due to the following reasons 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:29.359
 good let's start first and main so that the game stop a city of divide 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.210
 and they would have to remove graphics from the game and also some scenes and then 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.820
 that would be like taking away realism from the game and I guess the 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.670
 fanboys prefer to play a complete game and with better graphics than 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.640
 would be the metal gear solid 4 of the ps3 that one fully edited and with graphics 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.680
 terrible that would be the xbox 360 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.750
 seconds and in such a case that the game was made in several cidís I would say 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.690
 that it would take three or four cid and if I do not think that some favor and asshole 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.300
 will buy or burn three or four cidís of the same game that would be very 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.260
 stupid 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.570
 and it would also be very annoying to change the cider in the middle of the game and more 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.780
 if when you finish the first city and you do not have the other third I do not think 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.780
 those of sony are so stupid to let escape the exclusivity of metal 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.670
 gear solid since I've played the whole saga and for me it's a game to play it 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.470
 over and over and over and over again until the control disintegrated it says 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.930
 let me go damn 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.560
 in a nutshell the metal gear solid 4 and all its predecessors are very games 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.530
 good and high quality 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.150
 For all those who have not played, I recommend that you go and buy a 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.590
 ps2 that is ok baratitas and play the first three sagas that are 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.190
 metal gear solid 3 mil and metal gear solid 2 sons of liberty metal gear solid 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.990
 3 esne and that terrifies and then if you want to play the metal gear solid 4 go to a 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.940
 where you rented in ps3 or fuck some of your friends so you can buy 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.140
 a ps3 and play it 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.480
 by the way if you find the special editions of the metal gear solid 2 that is 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.780
 metal gear solid 2 substance the metal gear solid 3 which is subsistence 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.890
 buy them instead of the originals because they bring very cool extras 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.780
 good here finish and video I hope you liked it is well cut 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.610
 because I'm not one of those who get excited about the program I've been writing for 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.749
 hours and hours and hours and hours 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:19.359
 good let them that death accompanies them and wait for my next video
