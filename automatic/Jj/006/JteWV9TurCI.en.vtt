Rufus<00:00:06.810> surfaces<00:00:07.319> I've<00:00:08.220> got<00:00:08.400> it<00:00:08.550> here<00:00:08.820> in<00:00:09.000> a

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
Rufus surfaces I've got it here in a

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.789 
Rufus surfaces I've got it here in a
tool<00:00:09.330> bar<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.870> let's<00:00:10.110> go<00:00:10.260> ahead<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.559> run<00:00:10.650> it

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
tool bar and let's go ahead and run it

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.310 
tool bar and let's go ahead and run it
okay<00:00:13.799> here<00:00:14.160> we<00:00:14.250> go

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.620 

the<00:00:17.160> script<00:00:17.430> will<00:00:17.490> actually<00:00:17.880> create<00:00:18.240> some

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
the script will actually create some

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.920 
the script will actually create some
images<00:00:19.470> on<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.710> fly<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.689> so<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.779> need<00:00:21.900> a

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
images on the fly and so you need a

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.410 
images on the fly and so you need a
place<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.199> storm<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:23.010> before<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.090> get<00:00:24.210> started

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
place a storm so before you get started

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.060 
place a storm so before you get started
make<00:00:24.630> sure<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.140> go<00:00:25.289> ahead<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.650> select<00:00:25.980> a

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
make sure that you go ahead and select a

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.480 
make sure that you go ahead and select a
folder<00:00:26.779> the<00:00:27.779> second<00:00:28.170> option<00:00:28.380> here<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:29.039> to

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
folder the second option here is to

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.900 
folder the second option here is to
create<00:00:30.349> some<00:00:31.349> underlying<00:00:31.920> geometry<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.880> that

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
create some underlying geometry so that

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.049 
create some underlying geometry so that
when<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.660> displacement<00:00:33.989> renders<00:00:34.850> you<00:00:35.850> don't

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
when the displacement renders you don't

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.060 
when the displacement renders you don't
actually<00:00:36.270> see<00:00:36.450> underneath<00:00:37.050> any<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.620> tiles

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
actually see underneath any of the tiles

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.340 
actually see underneath any of the tiles
you<00:00:38.969> don't<00:00:39.360> want<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.540> see<00:00:39.660> any<00:00:39.780> blue<00:00:39.989> sky

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
you don't want to see any blue sky

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.740 
you don't want to see any blue sky
underneath<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.030> creates<00:00:42.450> just<00:00:42.629> some

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
underneath so this creates just some

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.779 
underneath so this creates just some
black<00:00:42.960> geometry<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:44.010> it's<00:00:44.160> basically<00:00:44.430> just<00:00:44.550> a

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
black geometry but it's basically just a

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.840 
black geometry but it's basically just a
copy<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:46.309> here's<00:00:47.309> our<00:00:47.489> displacement

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
copy of this here's our displacement

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.880 
copy of this here's our displacement
options<00:00:48.510> I'm<00:00:49.110> going<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.320> go<00:00:49.410> ahead<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.800> use

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
options I'm going to go ahead and use

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.459 
options I'm going to go ahead and use
the<00:00:50.070> v-ray<00:00:50.840> displacement<00:00:51.840> option<00:00:52.110> it'll<00:00:52.289> just

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
the v-ray displacement option it'll just

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.569 
the v-ray displacement option it'll just
go<00:00:52.710> ahead<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.160> create<00:00:54.469> modifiers<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.860> are

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
go ahead and create modifiers that are

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.630 
go ahead and create modifiers that are
appropriate<00:00:57.180> for<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:58.140> roof<00:00:58.260> tile<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.859> then

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
appropriate for the roof tile and then

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.450 
appropriate for the roof tile and then
for<00:01:00.239> our<00:01:00.270> UV<00:01:00.840> map<00:01:01.020> control<00:01:01.530> parameters<00:01:02.160> here

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
for our UV map control parameters here

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.700 
for our UV map control parameters here
I'm<00:01:02.850> going<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.059> go<00:01:03.149> ahead<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.510> make<00:01:04.500> these<00:01:04.680> a

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
I'm going to go ahead and make these a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.330 
I'm going to go ahead and make these a
little<00:01:04.830> bit<00:01:05.129> larger<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:06.710> you<00:01:07.710> want<00:01:07.950> them<00:01:08.130> to

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
little bit larger you you want them to

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.609 
little bit larger you you want them to
exceed<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.180> size<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> largest<00:01:10.290> roof

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
exceed the size of the largest roof

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.740 
exceed the size of the largest roof
plane<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.250> since<00:01:12.210> we're<00:01:12.360> dealing<00:01:12.450> with<00:01:12.689> a

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
plane and since we're dealing with a

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.539 
plane and since we're dealing with a
fairly<00:01:12.960> large<00:01:13.229> roof<00:01:13.560> here<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.770> think<00:01:14.040> 50<00:01:14.369> foot

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
fairly large roof here I think 50 foot

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.520 
fairly large roof here I think 50 foot
by<00:01:14.729> 50<00:01:14.790> foot<00:01:15.330> should<00:01:15.540> be<00:01:15.720> enough<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.110> cover<00:01:16.320> it

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
by 50 foot should be enough to cover it

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.280 
by 50 foot should be enough to cover it
okay<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.700> first<00:01:18.240> thing<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.600> want<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:18.990> here

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
okay so first thing we want to do here

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.310 
okay so first thing we want to do here
is<00:01:19.409> go<00:01:19.680> ahead<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:19.920> pick<00:01:20.189> our<00:01:20.369> roof<00:01:20.549> object<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
is go ahead and pick our roof object and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.749 
is go ahead and pick our roof object and
then<00:01:22.320> go<00:01:22.560> ahead<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:22.950> select<00:01:23.159> edges<00:01:23.640> that

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
then go ahead and select edges that

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.660 
then go ahead and select edges that
we'll<00:01:23.909> see<00:01:24.150> receive<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.930> ridge<00:01:25.140> tiles<00:01:25.670> this

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
we'll see receive the ridge tiles this

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.420 
we'll see receive the ridge tiles this
would<00:01:26.820> be<00:01:26.939> any<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.479> tiles<00:01:27.990> these<00:01:28.740> upper

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
would be any of the tiles these upper

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.940 
would be any of the tiles these upper
ridges<00:01:30.110> Gables<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:33.049> hips<00:01:34.049> I've<00:01:34.710> got<00:01:34.920> a

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
ridges Gables and and hips I've got a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.550 
ridges Gables and and hips I've got a
selection<00:01:35.729> set<00:01:36.119> already<00:01:36.540> created<00:01:37.079> here<00:01:37.320> and

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
selection set already created here and

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.270 
selection set already created here and
so<00:01:38.310> there<00:01:38.520> they<00:01:38.670> are

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.690 

it's<00:01:42.030> quite<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> few<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.369> then<00:01:44.369> we<00:01:44.460> go<00:01:44.579> ahead

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
it's quite a few and then we go ahead

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.600 
it's quite a few and then we go ahead
and<00:01:44.970> click<00:01:45.210> create<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:46.070> you<00:01:47.070> go<00:01:47.250> ahead<00:01:47.340> and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
and click create and you go ahead and

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.789 
and click create and you go ahead and
see<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.090> progress<00:01:48.479> bar<00:01:48.720> tells<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.500> what<00:01:49.680> it's

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
see the progress bar tells you what it's

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.910 
see the progress bar tells you what it's
doing<00:01:51.049> it's<00:01:52.049> going<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.290> go<00:01:52.409> ahead<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.799> create

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
doing it's going to go ahead and create

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.139 
doing it's going to go ahead and create
UV<00:01:53.369> coordinates<00:01:53.909> for<00:01:54.060> each<00:01:54.090> face<00:01:54.740> where<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
UV coordinates for each face where the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.969 
UV coordinates for each face where the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
map gizmo is aligned to the bottom edge

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.740 
map gizmo is aligned to the bottom edge
of<00:01:59.250> every<00:01:59.490> roof<00:02:00.119> plane<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:03.570> roof

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
of every roof plane so that the roof

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.200 
of every roof plane so that the roof
tiles<00:02:04.020> look<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:04.560> they<00:02:05.100> would<00:02:05.369> be<00:02:05.579> installed

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
tiles look like they would be installed

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.499 
tiles look like they would be installed
as<00:02:06.509> they<00:02:06.780> install<00:02:07.350> them<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.069> real<00:02:08.250> world

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
as they install them in the real world

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.479 
as they install them in the real world
with<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.539> full<00:02:09.810> tile<00:02:10.050> on<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.319> bottom<00:02:10.709> edge<00:02:10.890> not

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
with a full tile on the bottom edge not

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.480 
with a full tile on the bottom edge not
at<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.760> top<00:02:11.970> edge

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
at the top edge

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.420 
at the top edge
now<00:02:14.490> it's<00:02:14.670> creating<00:02:15.330> geometry<00:02:15.770> for<00:02:16.770> each<00:02:17.100> and

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
now it's creating geometry for each and

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.760 
now it's creating geometry for each and
every<00:02:17.820> one<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.000> those<00:02:18.180> ridges<00:02:18.690> which<00:02:19.620> you'll

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
every one of those ridges which you'll

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.580 
every one of those ridges which you'll
see<00:02:20.010> here<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.340> moment<00:02:21.110> okay

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.030 

this<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.770> what<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.040> looks<00:02:26.400> like<00:02:26.610> first<00:02:27.890> then<00:02:28.890> go

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
this is what it looks like first then go

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.530 
this is what it looks like first then go
ahead<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.250> close<00:02:29.490> these<00:02:29.730> rollouts<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:32.540> you

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
ahead and close these rollouts and you

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.710 
ahead and close these rollouts and you
can<00:02:33.720> shift<00:02:34.170> back<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.470> forth<00:02:34.680> here<00:02:35.160> between

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
can shift back and forth here between

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.300 
can shift back and forth here between
the<00:02:36.720> diffuse<00:02:37.080> color<00:02:37.290> map<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.950> the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
the diffuse color map and the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.730 
the diffuse color map and the

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.510 
displacement image the main displacement
map<00:02:40.890> anyway<00:02:42.560> on<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.800> fly<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.040> can<00:02:44.220> go<00:02:44.430> ahead

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
map anyway on the fly you can go ahead

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.310 
map anyway on the fly you can go ahead
and<00:02:44.970> change<00:02:45.480> your<00:02:45.660> color<00:02:47.690> it's<00:02:48.690> pretty<00:02:48.990> slick

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
and change your color it's pretty slick

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.590 
and change your color it's pretty slick
and<00:02:51.140> you<00:02:52.140> can<00:02:52.770> also<00:02:52.920> adjust<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:53.820> variation<00:02:54.480> in

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
and you can also adjust the variation in

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.110 
and you can also adjust the variation in
the<00:02:54.690> tiles<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.320> mean<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.190> future<00:02:56.520> release<00:02:56.820> we're

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
the tiles I mean a future release we're

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.020 
the tiles I mean a future release we're
hoping<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:58.370> do<00:02:59.370> something<00:02:59.670> with<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.850> little

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
hoping to do something with a little

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.880 
hoping to do something with a little
more<00:03:00.210> detail<00:03:00.690> on<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.960> tiles<00:03:01.320> as<00:03:01.500> far<00:03:01.680> as<00:03:01.770> the

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
more detail on the tiles as far as the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.590 
more detail on the tiles as far as the
coloring<00:03:02.310> with<00:03:02.460> some<00:03:02.640> splotches<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.300> streaks

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
coloring with some splotches and streaks

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.530 
coloring with some splotches and streaks
and<00:03:03.810> stuff<00:03:04.050> like<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.500> now<00:03:05.460> in<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.760> tile<00:03:06.150> size

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
and stuff like that now in the tile size

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.540 
and stuff like that now in the tile size
these<00:03:07.020> tiles<00:03:07.350> are<00:03:07.650> definitely<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.220> bit<00:03:08.490> large

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
these tiles are definitely a bit large

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.680 
these tiles are definitely a bit large
you<00:03:11.550> know<00:03:11.580> right<00:03:11.880> now<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.210> looks<00:03:12.270> like<00:03:12.450> they're

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
you know right now it looks like they're

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.350 
you know right now it looks like they're
running<00:03:12.840> about<00:03:13.100> 23<00:03:14.100> inches<00:03:14.490> tall<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:14.940> 16

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
running about 23 inches tall and 16

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.650 
running about 23 inches tall and 16
inches<00:03:15.600> wide<00:03:15.810> which<00:03:16.110> is<00:03:16.670> too<00:03:17.670> big<00:03:17.850> so<00:03:18.120> let's

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
inches wide which is too big so let's

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.990 
inches wide which is too big so let's
take<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.020> tile<00:03:19.290> height<00:03:19.530> down<00:03:19.740> to<00:03:19.980> about<00:03:20.190> 14

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
take the tile height down to about 14

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.330 
take the tile height down to about 14
inches<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:22.880> then<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.600> width<00:03:25.350> down<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.160> about

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
inches and then the width down to about

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.010 
inches and then the width down to about
8<00:03:26.610> or<00:03:26.640> 9<00:03:26.790> usually<00:03:27.420> looks<00:03:27.630> pretty<00:03:27.930> nice<00:03:30.020> that

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
8 or 9 usually looks pretty nice that

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.380 
8 or 9 usually looks pretty nice that
looks<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.350> lot<00:03:31.530> scaled<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.130> lot<00:03:32.310> nicer<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:35.390> then

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
looks a lot scaled a lot nicer and then

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.120 
looks a lot scaled a lot nicer and then
you<00:03:36.510> can<00:03:36.630> go<00:03:36.720> ahead<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.020> close<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:37.500> now<00:03:37.770> if

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
you can go ahead and close this now if

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.310 
you can go ahead and close this now if
you<00:03:38.280> want<00:03:38.490> to<00:03:38.730> make<00:03:39.390> modifications<00:03:40.140> at<00:03:40.290> a

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
you want to make modifications at a

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.150 
you want to make modifications at a
later<00:03:40.560> time<00:03:42.080> you<00:03:43.080> can<00:03:43.260> go<00:03:43.410> ahead<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:43.950> open

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
later time you can go ahead and open

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.220 
later time you can go ahead and open
your<00:03:44.370> material<00:03:44.970> editor<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.600> what<00:03:46.080> you'll

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
your material editor and what you'll

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.920 
your material editor and what you'll
find<00:03:46.290> here<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:47.130> a<00:03:48.090> multi/sub-object<00:03:48.900> material

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
find here is a multi/sub-object material

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.890 
find here is a multi/sub-object material
with<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.100> main<00:03:50.550> roof<00:03:50.790> tile<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.420> then<00:03:51.720> the

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
with the main roof tile and then the

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.220 
with the main roof tile and then the
bridge<00:03:52.260> tiles<00:03:52.640> materials<00:03:53.870> you<00:03:54.870> can<00:03:54.960> close

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
bridge tiles materials you can close

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.660 
bridge tiles materials you can close
that<00:03:55.260> rollout<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:56.040> then<00:03:56.160> you'll<00:03:56.280> find<00:03:56.550> these

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
that rollout and then you'll find these

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.350 
that rollout and then you'll find these
same<00:03:56.940> controls<00:03:57.450> down<00:03:57.750> here<00:03:57.810> where<00:03:58.710> you<00:03:58.920> can<00:03:59.360> go

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
same controls down here where you can go

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.260 
same controls down here where you can go
ahead<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:01.250> tweak<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.400> tile<00:04:02.640> width<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.180> the

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
ahead and tweak the tile width and the

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.440 
ahead and tweak the tile width and the
vertical<00:04:04.340> dimensions<00:04:05.340> of<00:04:05.490> them<00:04:05.610> as<00:04:05.760> well<00:04:05.940> same

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
vertical dimensions of them as well same

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.680 
vertical dimensions of them as well same
thing<00:04:06.480> with<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.870> color<00:04:07.080> you<00:04:08.150> can<00:04:09.150> open<00:04:09.570> and

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
thing with the color you can open and

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.330 
thing with the color you can open and
close<00:04:09.930> these<00:04:10.140> max<00:04:10.440> files<00:04:10.740> and<00:04:11.040> when<00:04:11.160> you

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
close these max files and when you

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.670 
close these max files and when you
reopen<00:04:12.300> them<00:04:12.450> you'll<00:04:12.810> still<00:04:13.050> find<00:04:13.230> these<00:04:13.440> same

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
reopen them you'll still find these same

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.130 
reopen them you'll still find these same
controls<00:04:14.160> here<00:04:14.460> so<00:04:14.760> pretty<00:04:15.420> slick<00:04:15.660> I<00:04:15.870> hope<00:04:16.020> you

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140
