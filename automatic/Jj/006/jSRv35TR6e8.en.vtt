happens the last seven matches I played
and<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.939> doesn't<00:01:24.270> really<00:01:24.360> matter<00:01:25.729> what<00:01:26.729> we

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
and it doesn't really matter what we

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.460 
and it doesn't really matter what we
were<00:01:27.030> against<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.689> mean<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> enemies<00:01:28.259> weren't

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470

games<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.380> won<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.950> what<00:01:47.130> games<00:01:47.369> I've

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
games I have won and what games I've

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.289 
games I have won and what games I've
lost<00:01:47.850> then<00:01:48.390> here<00:01:48.869> they<00:01:49.110> are<00:01:49.290> as<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:50.790> see<00:01:51.030> I

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
lost then here they are as you can see I

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.200 
lost then here they are as you can see I
lost<00:01:51.869> every<00:01:52.439> single<00:01:52.740> game<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.490> played<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
lost every single game I played in the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.749 
lost every single game I played in the
past<00:01:54.479> month<00:01:55.170> or<00:01:55.500> two<00:01:55.860> months<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.549> date

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
past month or two months the date

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.940 
past month or two months the date
doesn't<00:01:57.000> really<00:01:57.240> matter<00:01:57.540> since<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.680> see<00:01:58.829> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
doesn't really matter since you see the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.310 
doesn't really matter since you see the
results<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.610> they're<00:02:00.420> pretty<00:02:00.659> bad<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.899> mean

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
results and they're pretty bad I mean

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.020 
results and they're pretty bad I mean
most<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.799> those<00:02:01.950> games<00:02:02.189> weren't<00:02:02.490> even<00:02:02.820> close

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
most of those games weren't even close

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.740 
most of those games weren't even close
and<00:02:03.740> I<00:02:04.740> think<00:02:05.100> that's<00:02:05.250> just<00:02:05.369> horrible<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.509> I

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
and I think that's just horrible and I

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.850 
and I think that's just horrible and I
don't<00:02:06.810> know<00:02:06.960> what<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.200> think<00:02:07.409> about<00:02:07.469> these

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
don't know what you think about these

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.440 
don't know what you think about these
two<00:02:08.069> districts<00:02:08.459> guys<00:02:08.640> but<00:02:08.879> for<00:02:09.090> me<00:02:09.239> they<00:02:09.420> are

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
two districts guys but for me they are

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.559 
two districts guys but for me they are
pretty<00:02:09.810> bad

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
pretty bad

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.220 
pretty bad
and<00:02:11.549> if<00:02:12.549> you've<00:02:12.879> noticed<00:02:13.150> if<00:02:13.599> you've<00:02:13.780> read<00:02:14.049> my

you probably saw that too many people

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.839 
you probably saw that too many people
who<00:02:19.569> ask<00:02:19.749> what's<00:02:20.620> my<00:02:20.739> rank<00:02:20.980> is<00:02:21.249> I<00:02:21.280> said<00:02:21.670> it's

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
was master Guardian 1 before becoming

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.649 
was master Guardian 1 before becoming
inactive<00:02:28.989> and<00:02:29.519> I<00:02:30.519> became<00:02:30.879> an<00:02:31.030> active<00:02:31.299> about<00:02:31.480> 2

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
inactive and I became an active about 2

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.420 
inactive and I became an active about 2
months<00:02:31.810> ago<00:02:32.019> then<00:02:32.379> later<00:02:32.590> I<00:02:32.709> didn't<00:02:33.069> play<00:02:33.250> the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
months ago then later I didn't play the

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.209 
months ago then later I didn't play the
game<00:02:33.639> and<00:02:33.879> that<00:02:34.659> became<00:02:34.870> unranked<00:02:35.200> so<00:02:36.159> to

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:36.219 
game and that became unranked so to

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:38.099 
game and that became unranked so to
everybody<00:02:36.760> who<00:02:36.939> asked<00:02:37.239> what<00:02:37.359> my<00:02:37.540> rank<00:02:37.810> is<00:02:38.079> I

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
everybody who asked what my rank is I

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.440 
everybody who asked what my rank is I
said<00:02:38.530> it's<00:02:38.650> master<00:02:39.010> Guardian<00:02:39.310> 1<00:02:39.579> because<00:02:40.060> I've

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
said it's master Guardian 1 because I've

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.259 
said it's master Guardian 1 because I've
thought<00:02:40.480> I'd<00:02:41.290> go<00:02:41.739> into<00:02:41.889> a<00:02:42.040> game<00:02:42.370> I'd<00:02:42.790> will<00:02:43.090> it

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
thought I'd go into a game I'd will it

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.080 
thought I'd go into a game I'd will it
and<00:02:43.480> get<00:02:44.439> my<00:02:44.590> rank<00:02:44.829> back<00:02:45.069> but<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:45.790> looks<00:02:46.000> like

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
and get my rank back but it looks like

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.659 
and get my rank back but it looks like
it<00:02:46.750> ain't<00:02:46.930> happening<00:02:47.500> just<00:02:48.189> because<00:02:48.489> they've

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:48.669 
it ain't happening just because they've

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.149 
it ain't happening just because they've
lost<00:02:48.849> last<00:02:49.209> 7<00:02:49.750> matches<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.319> I<00:02:50.409> think<00:02:50.769> I<00:02:50.980> will

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
lost last 7 matches and I think I will

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.990 
lost last 7 matches and I think I will
be<00:02:51.280> down<00:02:51.519> to<00:02:51.730> Nova<00:02:52.389> I<00:02:52.599> mean<00:02:53.139> over<00:02:53.620> 3<00:02:54.040> or<00:02:54.069> Nova<00:02:54.699> -

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
be down to Nova I mean over 3 or Nova -

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.809 
be down to Nova I mean over 3 or Nova -
I<00:02:55.870> just<00:02:56.409> hope<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:56.709> don't<00:02:56.769> become<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.159> silver<00:02:57.639> oh

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
I just hope I don't become a silver oh

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.599 
I just hope I don't become a silver oh
my<00:02:58.120> god<00:02:58.419> and<00:02:58.750> I<00:02:59.319> would<00:02:59.469> definitely<00:02:59.650> prefer<00:03:00.099> to

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
my god and I would definitely prefer to

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.699 
my god and I would definitely prefer to
have<00:03:00.819> a<00:03:00.879> higher<00:03:01.209> rank<00:03:01.659> because<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.290> probably

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
have a higher rank because that probably

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.619 
have a higher rank because that probably
gives<00:03:02.919> me<00:03:03.129> a<00:03:03.159> status<00:03:03.699> and<00:03:03.939> the<00:03:04.150> ability<00:03:04.599> to

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
gives me a status and the ability to

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.659 
gives me a status and the ability to
play<00:03:04.840> against<00:03:05.169> better<00:03:05.379> enemies<00:03:05.919> and<00:03:06.189> to

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:06.669 
play against better enemies and to

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:09.119 
play against better enemies and to
improve<00:03:07.120> my<00:03:07.569> game<00:03:07.599> and<00:03:08.290> stuff<00:03:08.469> like<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.889> but

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
improve my game and stuff like that but

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.399 
improve my game and stuff like that but
maybe<00:03:09.310> it's<00:03:09.579> also<00:03:09.730> good<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.150> I<00:03:10.359> have<00:03:11.260> the

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
maybe it's also good that I have the

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:12.839 
maybe it's also good that I have the
ability<00:03:11.469> to<00:03:11.829> start<00:03:12.159> everything<00:03:12.489> from<00:03:12.669> the

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
ability to start everything from the

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.089 
ability to start everything from the
beginning<00:03:13.060> since<00:03:13.569> my<00:03:13.750> skill<00:03:14.139> also<00:03:14.889> has

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
beginning since my skill also has

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:16.979 
beginning since my skill also has
dropped<00:03:15.489> while<00:03:15.819> I<00:03:15.879> was<00:03:16.120> away<00:03:16.329> from<00:03:16.389> Counter

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
dropped while I was away from Counter

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.589 
dropped while I was away from Counter
Strike<00:03:17.019> and<00:03:17.489> maybe<00:03:18.489> it's<00:03:18.669> even<00:03:18.790> good<00:03:19.239> it's<00:03:19.479> my

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
Strike and maybe it's even good it's my

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.259 
Strike and maybe it's even good it's my
rank<00:03:19.870> drop<00:03:20.199> but<00:03:20.919> I've<00:03:21.699> been<00:03:21.909> playing<00:03:22.060> with
