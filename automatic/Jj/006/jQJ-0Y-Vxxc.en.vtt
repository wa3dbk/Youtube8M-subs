00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.599
 have you ever noticed that it starts 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.340
 blood while brushing your teeth 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:26.050
 this is not magic 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:29.280
 perhaps this is familiar 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.640
 with the bright red in the gum 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.990
 bad breath mobility and sensitivity 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.540
 dental 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.640
 if he answered that if at least three of 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:44.060
 these questions be careful because 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:48.950
 it can be can be there's how it was called 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:51.400
 so if the periodontal disease or 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.400
 the gums 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.200
 but what is the periodontium the tooth is 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.850
 divides into two parts a visible one that 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.350
 serves to chew and another that does not 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.870
 we can see it is sunk in the 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.880
 bone that we call root the 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.100
 periodonto is everything that surrounds the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.900
 root of our teeth and gives you 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.630
 protection while giving you 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.410
 stability to the tooth is composed of 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.420
 cement ligaments roland bone and gum 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.060
 in the mouth we have lots of 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.460
 bacteria when we eat the combination 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.310
 of bacteria remains of food and saliva 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.500
 shape the dental plaque is necessary 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.330
 remove by brushing as 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.729
 that if he stays too long in 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.170
 mouth solidifies and this is called 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.690
 Dental calculus 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.150
 the dental calculus causes an infection 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.310
 in the gum and at that moment initiates a 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.170
 pitched battle our body sends 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.760
 defense cells to fight the 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.760
 bacteria that attack the periodontium 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:58.170
 as a defense mode the gum becomes inflamed 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.350
 This is known as gingivitis 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.900
 If gingivitis is not treated soon, it 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.390
 will turn into periodontitis the 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.849
 periodontitis causes the separation of 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.069
 tooth of the period removing the tooth 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.080
 the protection and stability that you 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.120
 provides the one that rose for what it is 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.700
 common that patients with disease 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.730
 periodontal suffer from sensitivity and 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.819
 dental movement this due to which the 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.010
 plate lowers bone and gum 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.690
 and even cause the loss of these 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.090
 tissues 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.370
 without proper hygiene habits 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.680
 disease advances the gum and bone 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.770
 sow leaving only someone provoking 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.380
 lost sale 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.900
 Periodontitis is irreversible but 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.750
 can be controlled and avoid 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.549
 so pay close attention to the stress 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.489
 the depression the smoking and the 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.890
 alcoholism favor this disease 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.019
 so avoid them at all costs is 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.360
 important to remove the plate for it 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.890
 we have numerous weapons as they are 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.540
 brushes tooth brushes 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.540
 interdental and dental floss
