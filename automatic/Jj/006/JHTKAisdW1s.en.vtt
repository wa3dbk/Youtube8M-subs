bitter<00:00:38.129> dragons<00:00:38.550> can't<00:00:38.790> see<00:00:39.000> those<00:00:39.239> so

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
bitter dragons can't see those so

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.950 
bitter dragons can't see those so
although<00:00:40.320> they<00:00:40.710> may<00:00:40.920> sleep<00:00:41.370> at<00:00:41.640> night<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.719> it

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
although they may sleep at night they it

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.450 
although they may sleep at night they it
still<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.350> mess<00:00:43.469> up<00:00:43.500> their<00:00:43.739> sleep<00:00:44.010> patterns<00:00:44.190> a

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
still can mess up their sleep patterns a

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.860 
still can mess up their sleep patterns a
little<00:00:44.700> bit<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:45.149> better<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.480> get<00:00:45.660> these

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
little bit so it's better to get these

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.840 
little bit so it's better to get these
which<00:00:46.680> provide<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.280> right<00:00:47.460> amount<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.789> heat

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
which provide the right amount of heat

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.729 
which provide the right amount of heat
but<00:00:48.360> no<00:00:48.539> light<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.020> i<00:00:49.050> can't<00:00:49.289> disturb<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
you use a riot cage clamp clamp to

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.389 
you use a riot cage clamp clamp to
prevent<00:00:55.050> back<00:00:55.289> kidding<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.070> that's<00:00:56.219> what

the ceramic thing on this will actually

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.030 
the ceramic thing on this will actually
kind<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.820> explode<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.590> was<00:01:07.770> twenty

recommend<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.820> compact<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.869> quail

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
recommend is this compact and quail

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.960 
recommend is this compact and quail
lights<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.710> cause<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.189> problems<00:01:14.640> with<00:01:14.760> bearded

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
lights can cause I problems with bearded

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.280 
lights can cause I problems with bearded
dragons<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.540> i'm<00:01:15.630> pretty<00:01:15.900> sure<00:01:16.080> other

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
dragons and i'm pretty sure other

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.560 
dragons and i'm pretty sure other
reptiles<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.790> completely<00:01:18.150> avoid

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
reptiles to so just completely avoid

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.510 
reptiles to so just completely avoid
these<00:01:18.750> these<00:01:18.960> are<00:01:19.020> no<00:01:19.259> good<00:01:19.290> spend<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.280> money

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
these these are no good spend the money

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.880 
these these are no good spend the money
and<00:01:20.790> get<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.119> more<00:01:21.299> expensive<00:01:21.600> ones<00:01:21.960> mercury

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
and get the more expensive ones mercury

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.890 
and get the more expensive ones mercury
vapors<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.490> mean<00:01:23.790> they<00:01:23.970> work<00:01:24.330> better<00:01:24.570> and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
vapors I mean they work better and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.960 
vapors I mean they work better and
they're<00:01:25.830> not<00:01:25.950> going<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.280> negatively<00:01:26.850> affect

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
they're not going to negatively affect

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.289 
they're not going to negatively affect
your<00:01:27.450> animal<00:01:28.009> I'm<00:01:29.009> also<00:01:29.310> use<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.119> green

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
your animal I'm also use the green

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.859 
your animal I'm also use the green
terrarium<00:01:30.780> liner<00:01:30.960> i<00:01:31.259> don't<00:01:32.070> use<00:01:32.250> any<00:01:32.280> honey

terrarium liner i don't use any honey
substrate<00:01:33.869> they<00:01:34.140> can<00:01:34.350> cause<00:01:34.770> impaction<00:01:35.130> for

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
substrate they can cause impaction for

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.730 
substrate they can cause impaction for
my<00:01:36.210> bigger<00:01:36.420> dragons<00:01:36.840> because<00:01:37.079> i<00:01:37.140> actually<00:01:37.320> did

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
my bigger dragons because i actually did

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.830 
my bigger dragons because i actually did
have<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> bigger<00:01:38.640> dragon<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.119> was<00:01:39.270> impacted

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
have a bigger dragon that was impacted

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.230 
have a bigger dragon that was impacted
so<00:01:40.680> let<00:01:40.799> me<00:01:40.829> show<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.070> what<00:01:41.220> i<00:01:41.250> used<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.610> get

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
so let me show you what i used to get

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.109 
so let me show you what i used to get
him<00:01:42.420> under<00:01:42.689> factorization<00:01:43.439> i<00:01:43.500> don't<00:01:43.649> know<00:01:43.740> i

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
him under factorization i don't know i
