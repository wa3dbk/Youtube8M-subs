first of all told me that it's normal
for<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> front<00:00:43.350> end<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.649> fall<00:00:43.890> out<00:00:44.100> every

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
for the front end to fall out every

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.000 
for the front end to fall out every
thirty<00:00:44.820> five<00:00:45.059> thousand<00:00:45.600> miles<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:46.110> disagree

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
thirty five thousand miles I disagree
