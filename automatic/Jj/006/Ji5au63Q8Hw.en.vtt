yeah I mean I've been playing about this
for<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.040> few<00:02:43.520> days<00:02:43.670> actually<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.239> it's

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
for a few days actually and it's

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.100 
for a few days actually and it's
unreasonably<00:02:45.890> impressed<00:02:46.370> with<00:02:46.519> it<00:02:46.670> sir<00:02:47.110> you

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
unreasonably impressed with it sir you

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.840 
unreasonably impressed with it sir you
know<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.320> he<00:02:48.680> said<00:02:48.920> it's<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.310> mid-range<00:02:49.670> device

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
know it he said it's a mid-range device

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.300 
know it he said it's a mid-range device
it's<00:02:50.330> not<00:02:50.540> particularly<00:02:51.019> expensive<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:52.070> I

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
it's not particularly expensive and I

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.710 
it's not particularly expensive and I
think<00:02:52.489> what<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:52.880> know<00:02:52.970> on<00:02:53.090> contract<00:02:53.540> you'll

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
think what you know on contract you'll

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.640 
think what you know on contract you'll
get<00:02:53.870> this<00:02:53.930> for<00:02:54.820> a<00:02:55.820> nice<00:02:56.360> lower<00:02:56.660> amount<00:02:56.989> but

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
get this for a nice lower amount but

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.479 
get this for a nice lower amount but
obviously<00:02:57.920> this<00:02:58.069> is<00:02:58.220> running<00:02:58.459> a<00:02:58.670> HTC<00:02:59.569> Sense
