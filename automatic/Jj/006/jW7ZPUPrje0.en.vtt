just a good rotation of cleansers keeps
your<00:01:28.610> skin<00:01:28.789> kind<00:01:29.209> of<00:01:29.479> guessing<00:01:30.229> yeah<00:01:30.649> I<00:01:31.280> think

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:01.460 
and I actually designed that you did not

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.670 
and I actually designed that you did not
from<00:07:01.729> a<00:07:01.819> picture<00:07:02.210> not<00:07:02.690> from<00:07:02.930> a<00:07:03.020> celebrity<00:07:03.530> not

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 
from a picture not from a celebrity not

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.499

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
to create sure and once we got the

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.059 
to create sure and once we got the
pattern<00:07:11.509> down<00:07:11.660> right<00:07:11.990> and<00:07:12.259> the<00:07:12.380> fit<00:07:12.650> and<00:07:12.949> it
