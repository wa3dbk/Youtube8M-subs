00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
firstly the door ideally it should be

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.249 
firstly the door ideally it should be
light<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.700> easy<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:12.059> use<00:00:12.300> with<00:00:12.509> one<00:00:12.540> hand<00:00:12.719> as

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
light and easy to use with one hand as

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.870 
light and easy to use with one hand as
well<00:00:13.830> as<00:00:13.950> staying<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.370> position<00:00:14.759> without

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
slamming sharp or falling open it's also

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.010 
slamming sharp or falling open it's also
pretty<00:00:17.699> important<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.480> window<00:00:18.869> is

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
pretty important that that window is

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.660
