preview of that sound so here we go with

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.749 
preview of that sound so here we go with
environmental<00:01:37.470> interactions<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.640> just

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
environmental interactions and you just

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:39.740 
environmental interactions and you just
click<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.329> should<00:01:39.509> hear<00:01:39.720> a

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.020 
click on that and you should hear a
sound<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.770> anyways<00:01:41.070> um<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.549> only<00:01:41.670> plays<00:01:41.790> one

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
sound but anyways um it only plays one

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.240 
sound but anyways um it only plays one
sound<00:01:42.270> out<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.750> entire<00:01:43.409> database<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.130> it's

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
sound out of the entire database so it's

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.789 
sound out of the entire database so it's
not<00:01:44.399> very<00:01:44.640> reliable<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.020> know<00:01:46.439> pick<00:01:46.619> and
