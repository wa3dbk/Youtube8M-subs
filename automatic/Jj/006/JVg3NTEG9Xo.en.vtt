from bit more difficult you know to

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.669 
from bit more difficult you know to
start<00:00:12.150> from<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.389> really<00:00:12.809> back<00:00:12.990> and

start from the really back and

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.620 
start from the really back and
especially<00:00:14.340> after<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.969> start<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.450> first

especially after the start in the first

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.279 
especially after the start in the first
corner<00:00:15.929> he<00:00:16.049> was<00:00:16.230> so<00:00:17.039> close<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.930> block<00:00:19.140> my

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
even the strategy the Williams guys did

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.140 
even the strategy the Williams guys did

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
think that perhaps you both got a little

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.889

bit<00:00:53.610> overexcited<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.390> maybe<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.780> both

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
bit overexcited and maybe you both

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.350 
bit overexcited and maybe you both
deserved<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.530> bit<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.890> telling-off

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
only me I got the the penalty I know

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.340 
only me I got the the penalty I know
know<00:01:06.750> him<00:01:06.990> but<00:01:07.799> uh<00:01:08.299> anyway<00:01:09.299> that's<00:01:09.689> racing<00:01:10.200> you

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
know him but uh anyway that's racing you

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.429 
know him but uh anyway that's racing you
know<00:01:10.380> we<00:01:10.710> need<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.979> look<00:01:11.640> forward<00:01:12.140> that's<00:01:13.140> pass

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
know we need to look forward that's pass

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.580 
know we need to look forward that's pass
and<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.939> only<00:01:15.090> bad<00:01:15.330> thing<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.600> he<00:01:16.049> did<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
and the only bad thing is he did the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.640 
and the only bad thing is he did the
same<00:01:16.740> today<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.970> think<00:01:18.360> he<00:01:18.659> need<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.470> more

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
same today I think he need to be more

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.859 
same today I think he need to be more
focused<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.159> his<00:01:20.549> race<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.119> I'm<00:01:21.420> not<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.780> do

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
focused on his race and I'm not to do

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:22.340 
focused on his race and I'm not to do
that

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
that

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.200 
that
movement<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.460> think<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.850> Lewis's

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
movement but you think that Lewis's

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.640 
movement but you think that Lewis's
incident<00:01:24.540> today<00:01:24.630> was<00:01:24.869> similar<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
incident today was similar to the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.690 
incident today was similar to the
incident<00:01:25.979> with<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.310> put<00:01:26.430> him<00:01:26.549> out<00:01:26.670> of

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
incident with you that put him out of

to<00:01:52.259> say<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.439> was<00:01:52.530> critical<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.399> yesterday

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
to say I was critical of you yesterday

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.700 
to say I was critical of you yesterday
because<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.509> looked<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.990> me<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.560> were

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
because it looked to me that you were

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.770 
because it looked to me that you were
trying<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.100> make<00:01:56.219> some<00:01:56.729> statement<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.509> Luis

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
trying to make some statement to Luis

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.819 
trying to make some statement to Luis
and<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.020> looked<00:01:58.170> like<00:01:58.229> he<00:01:58.409> was<00:01:58.530> trying<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.740> make

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
and it looked like he was trying to make

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.410 
and it looked like he was trying to make
some<00:01:59.009> statement<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.820> my<00:02:00.390> advice

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
some statement to you and my advice

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.330 
some statement to you and my advice
would<00:02:00.899> be<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.409> do<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.740> face<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.159> face

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
would be that you do that face to face

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.639 
would be that you do that face to face
and<00:02:02.610> not<00:02:02.729> using<00:02:03.030> your<00:02:03.149> car<00:02:03.360> do<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.290> think<00:02:04.500> that

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
and not using your car do you think that

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.230 
and not using your car do you think that
there's<00:02:04.829> any<00:02:04.979> any<00:02:05.250> credence<00:02:05.759> on<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.090> because

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
there's any any credence on that because

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.310 
there's any any credence on that because
it<00:02:06.420> didn't<00:02:06.570> look<00:02:06.630> like<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.869> two<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.200> were

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
it didn't look like the two of you were

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.469 
it didn't look like the two of you were
just<00:02:07.590> driving<00:02:07.920> back<00:02:08.700> after<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.179> checkered

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
just driving back after the checkered

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.699 
just driving back after the checkered
flag<00:02:09.509> not<00:02:09.869> paying<00:02:10.080> attention<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.470> each<00:02:10.530> other

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
flag not paying attention to each other

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.380 
flag not paying attention to each other
yeah

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
yeah

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.750 
yeah
sure<00:02:11.569> I<00:02:12.050> think<00:02:12.110> we<00:02:12.470> we<00:02:12.890> both<00:02:13.100> say<00:02:13.250> slow<00:02:13.490> down

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
sure I think we we both say slow down

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.330 
sure I think we we both say slow down
after<00:02:14.750> turn<00:02:15.260> one<00:02:15.440> but<00:02:16.220> then<00:02:17.209> I<00:02:17.569> think<00:02:18.020> we<00:02:18.380> lose

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
after turn one but then I think we lose

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.309 
after turn one but then I think we lose
the<00:02:19.520> country<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:20.060> concentration<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.170> know

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
the country the concentration you know

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.600 
the country the concentration you know
and<00:02:22.060> we<00:02:23.060> were<00:02:23.209> fighting<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:24.170> know<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:25.400> was<00:02:25.580> a

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.240 
and we were fighting you know it was a
bad<00:02:25.970> things<00:02:26.240> but<00:02:26.959> that's<00:02:27.709> right<00:02:27.830> thing<00:02:28.040> you

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
bad things but that's right thing you

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.730 
bad things but that's right thing you
know<00:02:28.280> that's<00:02:28.640> racing<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.120> former<00:02:29.480> one<00:02:29.740> we

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
know that's racing that former one we

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.690
