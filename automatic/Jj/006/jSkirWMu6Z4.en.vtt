Chief Reconnaissance Officer: Summit Series

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.910
We're out here in the South Berry Island marine
protected area.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.730
Nine months ago, we held our annual summit
series event about twenty miles north from

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.000
here in the South Berry Islands.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.061
While we were out here we got wind that there
was a marine protected area in the Berry Island

00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:31.650
chain that we visited that needed help.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.730
It had been established ten years ago but
there was no funding to actually get it online

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.080
or enforcement or infrastructure.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.329
We needed a management plan.

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.480
Eleanor Phillips
N. Caribbean Program Director: Nature Conservancy

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.399
In the nature conservancy we have the global
marine team, and that’s how I got hooked

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.469
up with Summit Series to get involved in this
work we do in the Berry Islands on the marine

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.710
protected areas that where designated back
in 2000.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.760
That park had been a paper park.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.750
And now it is going to be transformed through
the help of the summit series and their network.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.210
It’s really a huge opportunity for the Bahamas
and we are very, very grateful for support.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.120
This is an extremely collaborative affair.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.110
The Waite institute has offered us their research
vessel for a week to explore the area down

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.150
here.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.580
The Nature Conservancy is also a major player
here.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.910
They were involved in actually creating this
as a marine protected area more than ten years

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.210
ago.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.740
My organization, Summit Series, helped fund
and protect the area.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:37.930
MPA’s are areas that you would basically
earmark as some heightened management so you

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.710
would remove them from pressures such as fishing,
development, dredging, any of those threats.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.470
You know, we manage to also get in a number
of dives while we are out here and that was

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.320
a lot of fun but it also served a pretty specific
purpose, which was to actually come face to

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.441
face with the physical environment that we
are trying to protect.

00:01:56.441 --> 00:01:56.460
We are excited to see diversity bloom in this
newly managed marine protected area .
