today squeaks and I thought we'd do a
little<00:00:16.440> sightseeing<00:00:17.180> using<00:00:18.180> our<00:00:18.330> telescope

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
planets as it went and it took over 35

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.510 
planets as it went and it took over 35
years<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.449> reach<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.870> edge<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.829> big<00:00:56.100> that

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
years to reach the edge it's so big that

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.920 
years to reach the edge it's so big that
today<00:00:56.730> we're<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.090> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.239> cover<00:00:57.390> half<00:00:57.780> of

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
today we're just going to cover half of

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.810 
today we're just going to cover half of
it<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.260> keep<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.739> mind<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:59.100> took<00:00:59.280> Voyager<00:00:59.670> 1

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
it and keep in mind it took Voyager 1

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.849 
it and keep in mind it took Voyager 1
all<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.390> time<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:01.050> fly<00:01:01.230> from<00:01:01.410> Earth<00:01:01.620> and

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
all that time to fly from Earth and

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.889 
all that time to fly from Earth and
earth<00:01:02.309> isn't<00:01:02.670> even<00:01:03.059> at<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.270> middle<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.780> our

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
solar system the Sun is so let's start

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.789 
solar system the Sun is so let's start
there<00:01:06.420> right<00:01:06.450> at<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.170> center<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.650> action

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
there right at the center of the action

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.800 
there right at the center of the action
the<00:01:08.250> Sun<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> star<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.119> like<00:01:09.270> most<00:01:09.540> stars

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the Sun is a star and like most stars

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.690 
the Sun is a star and like most stars
it's<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.049> huge<00:01:10.350> ball<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.710> superhot<00:01:11.250> gas<00:01:11.490> that

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
it's a huge ball of superhot gas that

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.730 
it's a huge ball of superhot gas that
gives<00:01:11.880> off<00:01:12.030> light<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.450> heat<00:01:12.570> without<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.530> Sun

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
gives off light and heat without the Sun

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.890 
gives off light and heat without the Sun
earth<00:01:14.010> would<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> dark<00:01:14.820> frozen<00:01:15.390> world<00:01:15.570> with

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
earth would be a dark frozen world with

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.140 
earth would be a dark frozen world with
no<00:01:16.049> life<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:16.890> Earth<00:01:17.070> isn't<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> closest

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
no life but Earth isn't the closest

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.969 
no life but Earth isn't the closest
planet<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.570> Sun<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:19.229> would<00:01:19.409> be<00:01:19.530> mercury

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
planet to the Sun that would be mercury

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.770 
planet to the Sun that would be mercury
not<00:01:20.369> only<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.700> mercury<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.240> closest<00:01:21.750> planet

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
not only is mercury the closest planet

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.080 
not only is mercury the closest planet
to<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> Sun<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.530> also<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.250> smallest<00:01:23.430> it's

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
to the Sun it's also the smallest it's

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.609 
to the Sun it's also the smallest it's
less<00:01:24.420> than<00:01:24.570> half<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:25.080> size<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.590> earth

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
less than half the size of the earth

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.890 
less than half the size of the earth
mercury<00:01:26.580> doesn't<00:01:26.850> have<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> lot<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.360> gases

liquid<00:03:14.069> water<00:03:14.099> anywhere<00:03:14.790> in<00:03:14.909> Mars<00:03:15.120> because

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
liquid water anywhere in Mars because

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.020 
liquid water anywhere in Mars because
it's<00:03:15.629> so<00:03:15.810> cold<00:03:16.199> Mars<00:03:16.769> also<00:03:17.069> has<00:03:17.430> mountains<00:03:17.879> and

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
it's so cold Mars also has mountains and

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.670 
it's so cold Mars also has mountains and
canyons<00:03:18.269> like<00:03:18.569> Earth<00:03:18.900> in<00:03:19.109> fact

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
canyons like Earth in fact

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.550 
canyons like Earth in fact
it's<00:03:19.799> home<00:03:20.069> to<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.340> solar<00:03:20.669> system's<00:03:20.759> biggest

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
it's home to the solar system's biggest

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.960 
it's home to the solar system's biggest
volcano<00:03:22.560> scientists<00:03:23.400> have<00:03:23.519> named<00:03:23.729> it<00:03:23.819> Olympus

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
volcano scientists have named it Olympus

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.330 
volcano scientists have named it Olympus
Mons<00:03:24.449> and<00:03:24.780> it's<00:03:24.930> nearly<00:03:25.199> three<00:03:25.709> times<00:03:26.040> larger

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
Mons and it's nearly three times larger

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.369 
Mons and it's nearly three times larger
than<00:03:26.669> Mount<00:03:26.819> Everest<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.599> tallest<00:03:28.079> mountain

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
than Mount Everest the tallest mountain

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.909 
than Mount Everest the tallest mountain

clearly<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.549> solar<00:03:29.819> system<00:03:30.239> is<00:03:30.359> an<00:03:30.509> amazing

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
clearly the solar system is an amazing

clearly the solar system is an amazing
place<00:03:31.319> full<00:03:31.620> of<00:03:31.650> different<00:03:31.889> worlds<00:03:32.310> with<00:03:32.400> all

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
kinds of extreme environments and we've

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.009 
kinds of extreme environments and we've
only<00:03:34.949> covered<00:03:35.250> four<00:03:35.669> planets<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.479> far<00:03:36.509> and

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
only covered four planets so far and
