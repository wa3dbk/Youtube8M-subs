00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.470
 Dr was waiting for it 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.290

 also analyst Prime Minister Hannelore Kraft is there and 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.640
 Duisburg Mayor Adolf Sauerland but it seems like the 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.950
 you have something to do with him apart from the press 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.290
 the Symphony of the 1000 revolves in a similar way as the Love should too 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.170
 Being a highlight for Duisburg today is not only my beautiful concert 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.630
 go 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.080
 instead of only 20 10 CEO Fritz Pleitgen 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.930
 and on the other side 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.270
 if we take the opportunity 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.270
 and once again the victims 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.759
 World in memory 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.080
 the citizens have lost their lives or become heavy 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.849
 Damage to body and soul have taken that will 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.849
 take place before this event process 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.240

 One more look at the notes every day they have this week 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.510
 I rehearsed for example the dirt from work always driven to rehearsals 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:36.339
 and since when must be neat 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:40.789
 but an hour before the concert finally arrived the nervousness increases 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:41.840

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.200

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.329
 Ester Peter Great is a very different experience based on the musician 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:51.889
 to stand on the stage 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.319
 Percent from other singers that's just something else is not 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.019
