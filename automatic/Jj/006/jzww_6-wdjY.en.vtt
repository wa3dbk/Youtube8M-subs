process just use a little at a time

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:36.319

people with dark brows like mine because

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.049 
people with dark brows like mine because

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
hair pretty well and usually it's pretty

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.420 
hair pretty well and usually it's pretty
hard<00:00:46.420> to<00:00:46.480> achieve<00:00:46.629> colored<00:00:47.110> brows<00:00:47.320> with<00:00:47.650> thick

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:59.520 
hard to achieve colored brows with thick
and<00:00:48.790> dark<00:00:49.150> brows<00:00:57.660> then<00:00:58.660> afterwards<00:00:59.140> in<00:00:59.379> that

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
and dark brows then afterwards in that

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.619 
and dark brows then afterwards in that
process<00:00:59.980> if<00:01:00.190> some<00:01:00.430> hairs<00:01:00.670> didn't<00:01:01.180> get<00:01:01.269> covered

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
process if some hairs didn't get covered

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.079 
process if some hairs didn't get covered
you<00:01:02.050> can<00:01:02.170> always<00:01:02.410> go<00:01:02.589> back<00:01:02.620> with<00:01:03.040> a<00:01:03.309> light<00:01:03.730> coat
