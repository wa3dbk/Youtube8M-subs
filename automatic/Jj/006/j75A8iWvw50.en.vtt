is<00:03:30.530> how<00:03:30.860> long<00:03:31.069> no<00:03:31.280> botanist<00:03:31.730> but<00:03:31.910> my<00:03:32.000> educated

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
is how long no botanist but my educated

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.120 
is how long no botanist but my educated
guess<00:03:32.630> would<00:03:32.930> be<00:03:32.959> that<00:03:33.110> it's<00:03:33.410> an<00:03:33.560> empty<00:03:33.709> air<00:03:34.010> is

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
guess would be that it's an empty air is

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.400 
guess would be that it's an empty air is
