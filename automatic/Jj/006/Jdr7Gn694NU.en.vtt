cut<00:01:59.420> some<00:01:59.720> from<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.110> top<00:02:00.380> here<00:02:00.800> and<00:02:01.520> when<00:02:01.759> you

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
cut some from the top here and when you

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.820 
cut some from the top here and when you
cut<00:02:02.090> from<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.570> top<00:02:02.780> on<00:02:02.990> this<00:02:03.110> plant<00:02:03.440> it<00:02:03.619> just

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
cut from the top on this plant it just

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.560 
cut from the top on this plant it just
makes<00:02:04.009> it<00:02:04.159> bush<00:02:04.369> out<00:02:04.610> more<00:02:04.850> on<00:02:04.909> the<00:02:04.970> sides<00:02:05.270> and

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
makes it bush out more on the sides and

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.320 
makes it bush out more on the sides and
I<00:02:06.170> really<00:02:06.500> like<00:02:06.649> that<00:02:06.680> cascade<00:02:07.460> look<00:02:07.700> as

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
I really like that cascade look as

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.530 
I really like that cascade look as
you'll<00:02:08.660> see<00:02:08.929> in<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:10.550> video<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:10.850> I<00:02:11.030> show<00:02:11.239> you

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
you'll see in the video that I show you

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.170 
you'll see in the video that I show you
so<00:02:12.290> all<00:02:12.650> this<00:02:12.890> that<00:02:13.100> I'm<00:02:13.190> taking<00:02:13.610> will<00:02:13.850> be<00:02:13.970> for

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
so all this that I'm taking will be for

00:02:14.180 --> 00:03:29.970 
so all this that I'm taking will be for
juicing<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:16.660> replanting<00:02:17.860> somewhere<00:02:18.860> else

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.040
