00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:43.979 
travel with it but it is a little bit

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:46.280 
travel with it but it is a little bit
bulky<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.699> I<00:00:45.330> mean<00:00:45.479> if<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.750> look<00:00:46.110> how<00:00:46.260> I

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
bulky and I mean if you look how I

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.960 
bulky and I mean if you look how I
actually<00:00:46.739> constructed<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.760> is

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
actually constructed it this is

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.359 
actually constructed it this is
cardboard<00:00:48.540> that<00:00:49.290> I've<00:00:49.470> used<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.040> it's<00:00:50.190> it's

cardboard that I've used and it's it's
it<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.909> a<00:00:50.940> little<00:00:51.269> bit<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.629> ghetto<00:00:51.809> engineering

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
it is a little bit of ghetto engineering

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:54.740 
it is a little bit of ghetto engineering
not<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.369> most<00:00:53.610> professional<00:00:53.820> way<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.479> look

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
not the most professional way to look

there<00:00:58.619> is<00:00:58.799> something<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.400> might<00:00:59.729> be<00:00:59.879> a

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
there is something that might be a

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:00.380 
there is something that might be a
little<00:00:59.970> bit<00:01:00.150> better

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
little bit better

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.670

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
for people who fly multirotors of course

you're going to be able to put your
craft<00:03:19.590> right<00:03:19.980> in<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.220> middle<00:03:20.400> which<00:03:20.610> is<00:03:20.760> nice

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
craft right in the middle which is nice

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.270 
craft right in the middle which is nice
because<00:03:21.210> this<00:03:21.630> is<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:22.080> unwieldy<00:03:22.860> part<00:03:23.100> of

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
because this is the unwieldy part of

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.430 
because this is the unwieldy part of
flying<00:03:24.120> these<00:03:24.420> things<00:03:24.480> especially<00:03:25.230> something

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
flying these things especially something

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.230

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
it always looks strange now you can

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.850 
it always looks strange now you can
adjust<00:03:36.300> it<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:36.900> could<00:03:37.110> use<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.380> on<00:03:37.470> pretty

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
adjust it so you could use it on pretty

it's still making its way to the market
but<00:04:11.490> I'd<00:04:11.610> say<00:04:11.790> give<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.090> a<00:04:12.300> couple<00:04:12.690> of<00:04:12.810> weeks

and<00:04:13.230> you're<00:04:13.380> going<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:13.530> start<00:04:13.740> to<00:04:13.860> see<00:04:13.890> these

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
and you're going to start to see these

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.020

I<00:04:18.420> would<00:04:19.080> like<00:04:19.290> to<00:04:19.590> have<00:04:19.799> had<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.250> few<00:04:20.730> more

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
I would like to have had a few more

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
strapping options but the velcro is cool

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.560 
strapping options but the velcro is cool
because<00:04:23.190> it's<00:04:23.310> it's<00:04:23.580> very<00:04:23.790> quick<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.120> move

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
because it's it's very quick to move

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.130 
because it's it's very quick to move
around<00:04:24.810> but<00:04:25.470> I'd<00:04:25.740> like<00:04:26.070> to<00:04:26.280> be<00:04:26.400> able<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:27.140> strap

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
around but I'd like to be able to strap

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.450 
around but I'd like to be able to strap
things<00:04:28.380> down<00:04:28.560> when<00:04:28.680> I<00:04:28.740> really<00:04:29.130> don't<00:04:29.310> want

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
things down when I really don't want

things down when I really don't want
them<00:04:29.580> to<00:04:29.700> move<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.419> thing<00:04:30.600> that<00:04:30.750> I<00:04:30.780> would

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
them to move and the thing that I would

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.380 
them to move and the thing that I would
really<00:04:31.260> have<00:04:31.560> liked<00:04:31.830> is<00:04:32.010> if<00:04:32.700> they<00:04:32.880> made<00:04:33.120> this<00:04:33.330> a

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
really have liked is if they made this a

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.290 
really have liked is if they made this a
backpack<00:04:34.080> instead<00:04:34.410> of<00:04:34.620> just

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
backpack instead of just

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.939 
backpack instead of just
we<00:04:35.389> strap<00:04:35.659> if<00:04:35.840> they<00:04:36.259> had<00:04:36.379> a<00:04:36.409> couple<00:04:36.680> of<00:04:36.740> straps

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
we strap if they had a couple of straps

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:38.980 
we strap if they had a couple of straps
over<00:04:37.099> the<00:04:37.250> top<00:04:37.340> they<00:04:38.120> could<00:04:38.300> have<00:04:38.389> put<00:04:38.569> a<00:04:38.599> strap

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
over the top they could have put a strap

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.080 
over the top they could have put a strap
here<00:04:39.229> on<00:04:39.289> the<00:04:39.500> back<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:40.009> it<00:04:40.669> would<00:04:40.819> have<00:04:40.879> made

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
here on the back and it would have made

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.480 
here on the back and it would have made
this<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.509> ultimate<00:04:41.990> in<00:04:42.139> backpack<00:04:42.919> capable
