00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello galaxy with you and we 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.250
 continue the galactic series 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.130
 starbound tutorials 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.110
 and in this video I will talk about how 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.530
 repair tools 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.870
 about how to go into this sector and answer 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.720
 some questions that are pretty 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.890
 often set in comments so way 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.289
 many asked what falls out 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.660
 ways from the first one we killed in 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.300
 the last part of the tutorial falls out of it 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.230
 Here is such a draw I molten core and she 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.030
 we need to 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.410
 For crafting, we will not improve on anyone 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.570
 so called a little differently here 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.309
 metalworking station something like that 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.890
 let's mine skrafti 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:53.190
 and install somewhere here 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:55.110
 let's say yes and see what we see 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.770
 what is there that is it includes 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.770
 yourself and 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:04.530
 anvil and new recipes too 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.979
 it adds that we have such an upgrade 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.619
 just for i can use this 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.869
 upgrade for beta sector flights 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.590
 beautiful let's use now 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.259
 this is top grade 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.799
 like this dash star map of 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.490
 gray red 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.670
 and now we can go to this 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.710
 sector this is done here and so we 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.780
 we move away to the maximum card right 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.630
 click here to select a button 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.240
 and this is the beta sector let's see 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.990
 what planets do we have here 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:45.299
 Well, of course, I think that 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:49.409
 to 20 to 20 16 and 17 10 to 20 from 11 to 20 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:53.009
 the bar and I constantly ask questions like 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:57.600
 how to fill the ship where to get 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:00.420
 fuel for this i thought it was quite 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.840
 obviously but it turns out there is no fuel 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.570
 for ship 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.670
 is a tree let's say a tree is kind of well 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.550
 In general, the tree naturally gives the wrong 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.590
 a lot of fuel as the same decrease 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.150
 yes it is quite normal that the ship 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.390
 found it melts on coal 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:22.210
 this is the norm let us fill up a little bit 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.910
 only yes read in up to 57 carbon 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:31.760
 four times so about 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:35.600
 more efficiently than a tree, we press a button 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.640
 fil yes fill now when the beams 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.560
 our ship is filled with fuel and 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.910
 we can go to the beta sector not 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.860
 let's see for how much is it to us 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.220
 it will cost us somewhere just 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.380
 let's go see what of course 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.410
 17 catching the planet do not want to fly but 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.780
 no matter what we see is not so expensive 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.050
 there is not some kind of intergalactic world 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.600
 flight which is a lot of fuel will 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.750
 borrow there just the same way 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.020
 go to any other planet 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:12.170
 exactly so what's the difference here 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.820
 fuel consumption plan and only after 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.190
 transition to the beta sector 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.489
 at our metalworking station which 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.830
 we built not so long ago appeared 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.680
 new recipes 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.400
 many new recipes of this first 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.600
 robotic craft table it 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.530
 opportunity to collect your own 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.510
 the robot also refine ari which here 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.570
 it is desirable to make it faster 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:42.410
 will get rid of unnecessary things and 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:45.260
 receive for them pixel and many other 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:49.269
 recipes steel armor rest scrolls 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.610
 and so on so on but anyway 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:55.660
 new sector new opportunities new 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.850
 technology new monsters new planets and 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.980
 new tutorials are waiting for us more people 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.989
 quite often asked how are we 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.600
 fix a pickaxe yes i mean itâ€™s obvious that 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.310
 she has wear even though i'm no difference 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.160
 noticed when I had her at all 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.920
 worn out but it never broke 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.780
 Well, you can fix it, I think that's just 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.610
 as if before the initial mechanic breakage 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.709
 items that are just not completely 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.019
 Ali unrealized and tails something 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.440
 just doesn't understand let's take this 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.530
 pickaxe 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.360
 object repaired I think that everyone will 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.600
 object repaired in the same way a cat 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:34.820
 whip because without breaking things is wrong 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:37.010
 interesting to me it seems repaired by the same 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.350
 material raw material from which 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.140
 and that is, we have a copper pick and 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.580
 it is repaired by copper ore not by ingots but 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.360
 just ore to fix 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.790
 you need to take this ore and click right 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.070
 key we see how the ore is consumed and 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.610
 everything is no longer spent and we 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.290
 little pickaxe 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.080
 whole thing let's go now 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.700
 check see if what we buy 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.780
 anything yes and see what ki strength 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:07.220
 spent and as I always say if u 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.720
 do you have any suggestions for new 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.720
 tutorial if you have any 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.180
 questions about the game then leave all these 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.370
 questions and suggestions in the comments so 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.990
 if the information was not helpful to you 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.330
 Remember to put the Huskies and subscribe 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.100
 to the channel if you are not already subscribed and all 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.180
 thanks for watching everyone bye 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.180
 see you in the next series
