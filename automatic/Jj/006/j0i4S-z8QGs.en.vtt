00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.340
 a margin the previous tutorial 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.760
 explain algorithms for how to get the two lines 

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:13.579
 Well the institute day what I'm going to do 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:16.089
 Espigares base 3 algorithms 

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:17.669
 each one for a case 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:21.019
 to get here a cross 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.079
 percent 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:24.210
 we will see 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.829
 the first drawer you have it 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:27.839
 an I 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.319
 it can have any shape 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:31.579
 If that 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.900
 the hall indicates the club's general manager 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.500
 until the l 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.270
 in this position I came to be like this you do the following Sunday 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.280
 efe 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.710
 its immense 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.010
 the investment 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.010
 i is inverse you already have the cross 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.200
 the following case 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.500
 what can be left is the next we will wait at the moment what happened 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.340
 Adolfo 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.220
 they forgot the corners, we're just going to focus on the edges 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.330
 here when we have a girl 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
 what we do we look at the line horizontally 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.530
 what do we do the algorithm 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.579
 reverse 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:24.509
 the previous 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.620
 which would be 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.800
 r 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.950
 reverse reverse or reverse the one that enters 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.190
 incendies 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.430
 worth it 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.430
 and in the last case 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.890
 when 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.830
 you only have the central date does not have any well oriented edge 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.740
 terrorism is easy to remember is a little too long term 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.720
 it does not matter how we take the cube whenever the box is in this box 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.290
 year 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.960
 we can not continue like this 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.960
 same and we do selfishness 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.639
 the half down with the queen 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:19.429
 lime 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:22.579
 unicaja almeria 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:23.799
 Andean 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.079
 above 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.179
 Madrid community 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:31.179
 and in Argentina we will have this already 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:34.869
 Now what are we going to get 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:37.229
 is that these chips 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:40.309
 the edges that see well we see fairies 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:43.599
 for this we now have to go creating the top 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.230
 and go looking we have to have how are you worth but only one until here not 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.230
 ok because we already have the 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:53.999
 well we have only one 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:57.579
 if we did not have any very complicated this same Sunday on any 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.119
 face 

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:02.119
 gergorin worcester 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.819
 Brazil 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:12.759
 that's all 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:15.619
 jay-z we have is well done 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:17.239
 if we did not have it 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.339
 that's why we should do the coup on the same tent 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:24.529
 the next step 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:27.529
 permutation of 

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:30.589
 until now we have 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:34.569
 we have to see that there is a well-permuted vertex as we do 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.249
 this 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:39.989
 we demand of its colors this for example it would be well permutado because 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:42.349
 because it has blue color 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.679
 the color red and the color yellow 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:47.679
 if we find fines in November, we'll keep it here on the right 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.819
 valeria fears of algorithms 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.359
 is an algorithm that exchanges the other three vertices - and that we have the 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.599
 right 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:58.329
 and it is already 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:03:59.789
 we already have it 

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:01.709
 and now 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.549
 the last step of the rubik's cube 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.039
 consisting of 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:07.769
 Orient good from rubik's cube 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.209
 the vehicles 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.309
 the last step 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:15.499
 Hector fuenzalida different forms but consists of the orientation of the 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:19.269
 vertices as we do with the basic algorithm which are four 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.479
 movements 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:23.779
 percent 

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:27.179
 remember the headquarters of the delegation of our tourism 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.939
 and we keep repeating it 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:37.999
 until we have it right in this case we have repeated twice 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.259
 and now we are well oriented we did not do the cube no please 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.210
 we rotate the top to have here a tab 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:51.279
 is not well oriented that shows that in tourism 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.650
 and we keep pulling 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.650
 and also 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:05.539
 and others and we have left 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:09.139
 something like that we simply fit it and we have to play loose 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.770
 well I hope you liked this method of how to solve the cube of 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.150
 rubik after falling specifically to the president of beginners 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.729
 If you have any doubt about any movement, some case to what is 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:23.150
 forgot to comment 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.460
 you can put a comment below the world video of a private 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.770
 and others I will answer 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.419
 well thanks for coming and I hope you liked it 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.619
