00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.839
 hello and accidents and this techno kitchen 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.359
 we continue the theme of garbage from zotac 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.400
 on the queue we have a model based on intu 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.949
 platform inside dual core processor 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.359
 celeron 847 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:31.080
 with a frequency of 1.1 gigahertz of each core and 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.600
 integrated graphics nvidia geforce 610m 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.750
 Perhaps we will begin the most interesting at 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.629
 watching full hd movies vmk format 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.640
 CPU usage average 10 percent 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.450
 twice as good as it was on 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.390
 a platform 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.629
 lmd but when watching a video from youtube 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.360
 the load above is no longer 80 but under 90 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.050
 percent in terms of speed wi-fi all that 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.809
 same 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.780
 18 megabits or 2 megabytes per second 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.370
 the limit of file sharing is basically more 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.649
 what's enough to remotely 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.399
 view full hd movies from 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.280
 libraries 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.860
 bottleneck as a freeze can 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.700
 become only a processor but in terms of games 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.850
 this option box with graphics gifors 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.490
 610m is better than the version with hd 7340 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.409
 particulars you can play skyrim and deus 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.330
 ex human revolution 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.909
 if for you the game has some 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.710
 value then notice in terms of 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.350
 interfaces all the same for 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.829
 except that yusbi ports are no longer 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.130
 6 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.670
 a4 but instead of one gigabit card 2 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.340
 from realtek two antennas they are 1 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.990
 if the router is within 8 meters then the number 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.509
 antenne is irrelevant 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.729
 two antennas help with distance or 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.340
 when between computer and router more 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.750
 two walls still that noticed this time 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.170
 ventilation grille 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.509
 a larger one in principle netbox and not 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.509
 overheat and works extremely quietly 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.460
 4 ports of yusbi will become a real inconvenience 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.070
 when installing the operating room 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.170
 the system which is so hard not to 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.200
 put the user have to get 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.080
 bootable flash drive or beat drive when 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.290
 This port will take the mouse and keyboard yusbi 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.239
 30 ports 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.640
 can be used after installation 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.859
 drivers at least boot from 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.900
 flash drive anyway you understand what you need 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:22.180
 drive to install drivers 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.280
 without them you can't even go online 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.349
 developer site generally has 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.189
 search for another computer download on 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.890
 him driver 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:32.260
 transfer to a USB flash drive and revive the z box 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.780
 now the question is why not make three 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.909
 Use double connector and do not put in 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.260
 USB flash drive kit as an option 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.659
 drivers can be placed on 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.069
 supplied vinci style in separate 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.290
 other section 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.540
 that did not really like the sensory 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.489
 power button can it be fashionable and 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.560
 beautiful but several times the sensor 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.959
 triggered when accidentally in front of him was 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.659
 any item or just a person 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.169
 passed by and everything else was fine 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.040
 style compact stand mount 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:01.930
 for monitor 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.659
 remote control model 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.239
 upgrade one memory slot busy 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.329
 samsung module with a capacity of 4 gigabytes 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.459
 you can add four more gigabytes 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:14.620
 winchester and so more 500 capacity 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.019
 gigabyte but you can install and model on 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.909
 1 terabyte integrated network card 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.389
 intel centrino gives not only 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:25.209
 tested Wi-Fi 802.11 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:28.000
 nth bluetooth 40 so useful for 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.280
 communication with intel cell phones 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.500
 platform will delight gamers or 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.690
 please those who have not been brought greetings 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.690
 and by la marine all bye 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:53.819
