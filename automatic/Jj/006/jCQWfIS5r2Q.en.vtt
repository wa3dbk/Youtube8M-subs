today I'm proud to introduce the

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.610 
today I'm proud to introduce the
brand-new<00:00:03.840> nitrocharge<00:00:04.580> 1.0<00:00:06.560> it's<00:00:07.560> a

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
brand-new nitrocharge 1.0 it's a

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.709 
brand-new nitrocharge 1.0 it's a
completely<00:00:08.099> new<00:00:08.370> silo<00:00:08.670> for<00:00:09.090> us<00:00:09.240> for<00:00:09.570> the

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
completely new silo for us for the

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.180 
completely new silo for us for the
engine<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.320> team<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.740> player<00:00:10.980> that

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
engine of the team the player that

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.770 
engine of the team the player that
really<00:00:11.250> gets<00:00:11.610> stuck<00:00:11.880> in<00:00:12.030> on<00:00:12.150> tackles<00:00:12.599> does<00:00:12.750> a

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
really gets stuck in on tackles does a

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.380 
really gets stuck in on tackles does a
lot<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.110> running<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.469> lot<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.590> dirty<00:00:14.009> work<00:00:17.390> on

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
lot of running a lot of dirty work on

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.960 
lot of running a lot of dirty work on
the<00:00:18.510> upper<00:00:18.930> we<00:00:19.380> have<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:20.310> energy<00:00:20.580> sling<00:00:20.939> that

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
the upper we have the energy sling that

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.609 
the upper we have the energy sling that
goes<00:00:21.180> across<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.630> forefoot<00:00:22.140> here

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
goes across the forefoot here

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.640 
goes across the forefoot here
now<00:00:22.920> that's<00:00:23.100> SL<00:00:23.550> rubber<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.539> really<00:00:24.930> helps<00:00:25.380> you

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
now that's SL rubber it really helps you

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.130 
now that's SL rubber it really helps you
reduce<00:00:26.279> energy<00:00:26.730> loss<00:00:27.000> when<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.570> move<00:00:27.779> side<00:00:28.109> to

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
reduce energy loss when you move side to

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.049 
reduce energy loss when you move side to
side<00:00:30.080> when<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.140> move<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> outsole<00:00:32.189> we<00:00:33.030> have

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
side when we move to the outsole we have

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.590 
side when we move to the outsole we have
energy<00:00:33.690> poles<00:00:33.989> we've<00:00:34.440> actually<00:00:35.510> injected<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
energy poles we've actually injected a

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.569 
energy poles we've actually injected a
highly<00:00:37.050> elastic<00:00:37.440> element<00:00:38.129> here<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
highly elastic element here in the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.479 
highly elastic element here in the
forefoot<00:00:39.120> what<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.809> allows<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.620> more<00:00:41.070> energy

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
forefoot what this allows is more energy

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.940 
forefoot what this allows is more energy
in<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:41.820> toe<00:00:42.329> off<00:00:42.540> movement<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.770> those

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
in this toe off movement so in those

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.069 
in this toe off movement so in those
straight<00:00:44.340> line<00:00:44.550> Sprint's<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.780> really

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
straight line Sprint's this really

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.350 
straight line Sprint's this really
allows<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:46.850> 63<00:00:47.850> percent<00:00:48.210> more<00:00:48.510> explosion<00:00:49.440> a

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
allows for 63 percent more explosion a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.400 
allows for 63 percent more explosion a
great<00:00:51.360> part<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.750> shoe<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.170> we've

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
great part of this shoe is that we've

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.290 
great part of this shoe is that we've
really<00:00:52.440> put<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.039> some<00:00:53.219> protective<00:00:53.850> elements

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
really put in some protective elements

first<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.830> here<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.100> Seattle<00:01:20.580> we<00:01:20.700> actually

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
first so here in Seattle we actually

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.080 
first so here in Seattle we actually
were<00:01:21.330> able<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.840> get<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.619> blacked<00:01:23.280> out<00:01:23.460> prototype

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.480 
were able to get a blacked out prototype
on<00:01:24.360> us<00:01:24.509> although<00:01:24.720> Alonso<00:01:25.470> about<00:01:25.890> six<00:01:26.220> months

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
on us although Alonso about six months

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.249 
on us although Alonso about six months
before<00:01:26.640> launch<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.450> really<00:01:27.750> important<00:01:28.200> for

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
before launch it's really important for

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.530 
before launch it's really important for
us<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.530> get<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.770> player<00:01:29.040> feedback<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.240> we<00:01:30.390> can

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
us to get that player feedback so we can

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.880 
us to get that player feedback so we can
really<00:01:30.689> validate<00:01:31.290> what<00:01:31.439> we're<00:01:31.560> doing<00:01:31.740> with<00:01:31.860> a
