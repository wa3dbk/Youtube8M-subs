modes I'm Louis skeebo you know I'm
fixing<00:00:26.189> up<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.400> old<00:00:26.550> 800<00:00:27.060> motor<00:00:27.210> here<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.510> got

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
fixing up this old 800 motor here I got

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.300 
fixing up this old 800 motor here I got
to<00:00:27.720> put<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.869> fresh<00:00:28.080> set<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.349> Pistons<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.070> for

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
to put a fresh set of Pistons in it for

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.220 
to put a fresh set of Pistons in it for
the<00:00:29.460> next<00:00:29.970> little<00:00:30.210> bit<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.510> riding<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.929> have<00:00:31.080> to

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the next little bit of riding I have to

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.600 
the next little bit of riding I have to
do<00:00:31.349> here<00:00:31.560> at<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.710> end<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.040> season<00:00:32.460> and

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
do here at the end of the season and

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.760 
do here at the end of the season and
before<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.510> get<00:00:33.630> these<00:00:33.840> Pistons<00:00:34.260> all<00:00:34.440> set<00:00:34.649> up

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
before I get these Pistons all set up

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.920 
before I get these Pistons all set up
and<00:00:34.950> put<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> sled<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.880> got<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.420> measure<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
and put in the sled I got to measure the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.709 
and put in the sled I got to measure the
piston<00:00:37.260> ring<00:00:37.500> gap<00:00:37.850> that's<00:00:38.850> pretty<00:00:39.120> simple<00:00:39.540> all

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
piston ring gap that's pretty simple all

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.090 
piston ring gap that's pretty simple all
it<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.430> gap<00:00:42.200> between<00:00:43.200> these<00:00:43.620> two<00:00:43.890> ends

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
it is is the gap between these two ends

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.160 
it is is the gap between these two ends
of<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.730> piston<00:00:45.059> ring<00:00:45.270> I'm<00:00:45.809> gonna<00:00:45.930> show<00:00:46.079> you

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
of the piston ring I'm gonna show you

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.490 
of the piston ring I'm gonna show you
how<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.320> do<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:47.930> now<00:00:48.930> you're<00:00:49.079> gonna<00:00:49.170> want<00:00:49.440> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
how to do that now you're gonna want to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.639 
how to do that now you're gonna want to
slip<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.219> inside<00:00:50.340> your<00:00:50.670> cylinder<00:00:51.649> just

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
slip it inside your cylinder just

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.080 
slip it inside your cylinder just
compress<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.190> ring<00:00:53.340> slightly<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.789> push<00:00:53.940> it

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
compress the ring slightly and push it

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.290 
compress the ring slightly and push it
down<00:00:54.410> then<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.530> used<00:00:55.800> your<00:00:55.980> piston<00:00:56.399> just

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
down then just used your piston just

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.700 
down then just used your piston just
square<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.719> up<00:00:57.899> inside<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.440> cylinder<00:01:00.710> just

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
square it up inside the cylinder just

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.710 
square it up inside the cylinder just
push<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.010> down<00:01:02.039> slightly<00:01:05.150> and<00:01:06.150> you'll<00:01:06.360> see

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
push it down slightly and you'll see

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.630 
push it down slightly and you'll see
right<00:01:08.479> there<00:01:09.710> that<00:01:10.710> little<00:01:10.950> gap<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.220> there

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
right there that little gap in there

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.310 
right there that little gap in there
that's<00:01:12.000> what<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.270> want<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.540> measure<00:01:12.720> will<00:01:13.140> use

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
that's what we want to measure will use

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.050 
that's what we want to measure will use
feeler<00:01:13.740> gauges<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.280> do<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:16.820> now<00:01:17.820> according

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
feeler gauges to do that now according

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.749 
feeler gauges to do that now according
to<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.390> manufacturer<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.110> gap<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.770> here<00:01:20.070> has

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
to the manufacturer the gap in here has

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.580 
to the manufacturer the gap in here has
to<00:01:20.970> be<00:01:21.000> somewhere<00:01:21.479> between<00:01:23.000> 10025<00:01:24.000> towel<00:01:24.590> this

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
to be somewhere between 10025 towel this

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.520 
to be somewhere between 10025 towel this
is<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.240> 10,000<00:01:27.240> it's<00:01:27.720> actually<00:01:28.049> slipping<00:01:28.409> in

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
is a 10,000 it's actually slipping in

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.030 
is a 10,000 it's actually slipping in
there<00:01:28.650> no<00:01:28.770> problem<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.369> want<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> see<00:01:30.119> how<00:01:30.240> much

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
there no problem I want to see how much

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.740 
there no problem I want to see how much
clearance<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.250> do<00:01:32.310> have<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:35.240> there's<00:01:36.240> 14th

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
clearance I do have on it there's 14th

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:45.650 
clearance I do have on it there's 14th
Oh<00:01:37.070> still<00:01:38.070> room<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.490> there<00:01:38.759> let's<00:01:39.600> try<00:01:39.810> 25

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.780 

25

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.130 

and<00:01:51.790> it's<00:01:52.300> too<00:01:52.660> tight<00:01:52.870> for<00:01:52.900> the<00:01:53.140> 25000<00:01:55.140> now

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
and it's too tight for the 25000 now

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.590 
and it's too tight for the 25000 now
this<00:01:56.320> ring<00:01:56.500> gap<00:01:56.680> seems<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.130> be<00:01:57.250> in<00:01:57.340> specs<00:01:57.700> if<00:01:58.000> it

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
this ring gap seems to be in specs if it

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.030 
this ring gap seems to be in specs if it
weren't<00:01:58.870> let's<00:01:59.140> say<00:01:59.290> it<00:01:59.380> we're<00:01:59.530> a<00:01:59.560> little<00:01:59.890> too

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
weren't let's say it we're a little too

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.650 
weren't let's say it we're a little too
tight<00:02:00.340> what<00:02:00.610> would<00:02:00.760> happen<00:02:01.120> is<00:02:01.270> your<00:02:01.510> engine

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
tight what would happen is your engine

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.870 
tight what would happen is your engine
had<00:02:01.930> heat<00:02:02.110> up<00:02:02.320> your<00:02:02.890> piston<00:02:03.310> heat<00:02:03.550> up<00:02:03.700> this

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
had heat up your piston heat up this

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.210 
had heat up your piston heat up this
ring<00:02:04.150> would<00:02:04.420> expand<00:02:04.900> and<00:02:05.170> when<00:02:05.770> it<00:02:05.890> came<00:02:06.040> in

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
ring would expand and when it came in

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.580 
ring would expand and when it came in
contact<00:02:06.250> with<00:02:06.940> either<00:02:07.060> R<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:07.450> you<00:02:08.200> wouldn't

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
contact with either R and you wouldn't

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.740 
contact with either R and you wouldn't
have<00:02:08.649> enough<00:02:09.010> room<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.280> expand<00:02:10.000> inside<00:02:10.210> the

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
have enough room to expand inside the

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.560 
have enough room to expand inside the
cylinder<00:02:11.230> walls<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:12.010> you'd<00:02:12.340> end<00:02:12.460> up<00:02:12.670> creating

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
cylinder walls and you'd end up creating

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.300 
cylinder walls and you'd end up creating
a<00:02:13.720> lot<00:02:13.750> of<00:02:13.900> excessive<00:02:14.440> force<00:02:14.470> with<00:02:14.860> this<00:02:15.070> ring

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
a lot of excessive force with this ring

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.770 
a lot of excessive force with this ring
and<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:15.790> would<00:02:15.880> probably<00:02:16.240> end<00:02:16.360> up<00:02:16.510> scoring

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
and it would probably end up scoring

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.780 
and it would probably end up scoring
your<00:02:17.110> cylinder<00:02:17.620> walls<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.190> it<00:02:18.520> might<00:02:18.670> even

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
your cylinder walls and it might even

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.670 
your cylinder walls and it might even
bulge<00:02:19.090> out<00:02:19.270> your<00:02:19.450> exhaust<00:02:19.810> port<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.440> then

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
bulge out your exhaust port and then

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.590 
bulge out your exhaust port and then
you're<00:02:20.830> into<00:02:20.980> real<00:02:21.280> troubles<00:02:21.760> this<00:02:22.270> thing<00:02:22.480> is

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
you're into real troubles this thing is

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.170 
you're into real troubles this thing is
gonna<00:02:22.690> bust<00:02:22.990> up<00:02:23.170> your<00:02:23.200> motor<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:24.910> want<00:02:25.090> to

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
gonna bust up your motor so you want to

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.680 
gonna bust up your motor so you want to
make<00:02:25.300> sure<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.750> it's<00:02:25.900> within<00:02:26.680> specs<00:02:27.690> specs

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
make sure that it's within specs specs

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.050 
make sure that it's within specs specs
on<00:02:28.870> this<00:02:29.050> was<00:02:29.290> about<00:02:29.620> ten<00:02:30.250> thousand<00:02:30.700> five

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060
