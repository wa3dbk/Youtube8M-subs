00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
I mean that DD 500 DDS actually not sure

I mean that DD 500 DDS actually not sure
what<00:02:17.210> the<00:02:17.300> DDS<00:02:17.630> stands<00:02:18.350> for<00:02:18.530> but<00:02:19.130> we<00:02:19.220> have<00:02:19.370> to

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
what the DDS stands for but we have to

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.360 
what the DDS stands for but we have to
wait<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:19.670> see<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:21.470> yes<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:21.740> is<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:21.830> disc<00:02:22.100> player

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370

with<00:02:55.520> the<00:02:55.610> lens<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:56.180> there<00:02:56.300> might<00:02:56.450> need

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
with the lens and there might need

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.199 
with the lens and there might need
replacing<00:02:56.930> or<00:02:57.230> it<00:02:57.530> could<00:02:57.680> be<00:02:57.800> that<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.970> unit

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
replacing or it could be that the unit

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.750 
replacing or it could be that the unit
is<00:02:59.300> so<00:02:59.480> all<00:02:59.660> this<00:02:59.840> is<00:02:59.989> about<00:03:00.170> 20<00:03:00.770> 25<00:03:01.160> plus<00:03:01.730> years

it's<00:03:24.459> going<00:03:24.489> to<00:03:24.640> be<00:03:24.700> very<00:03:24.970> difficult<00:03:25.150> to

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
it's going to be very difficult to

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
prepare finding spare parts but this is

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.289 
prepare finding spare parts but this is
near<00:03:28.030> impossible<00:03:29.670> so<00:03:30.670> that's<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:30.879> internals

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
near impossible so that's the internals

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.740 
near impossible so that's the internals
there<00:03:32.370> but<00:03:33.370> any<00:03:33.489> when<00:03:33.579> you<00:03:33.670> close<00:03:33.849> it<00:03:33.970> down<00:03:34.090> it

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
there but any when you close it down it

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.490 
there but any when you close it down it
makes<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:34.989> lovely<00:03:35.579> clicking<00:03:36.579> noise<00:03:37.500> now

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
makes a lovely clicking noise now

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.960

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
recording this near a window so you

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.039 
recording this near a window so you
might<00:03:40.209> hear<00:03:40.359> some<00:03:40.510> interference<00:03:40.959> from

this is a bit dark that this is a

so<00:04:45.500> my<00:04:45.620> cables<00:04:46.010> from<00:04:46.190> today<00:04:46.760> we're<00:04:46.910> still<00:04:47.060> fit

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
so my cables from today we're still fit

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.920 
so my cables from today we're still fit
back<00:04:48.230> there<00:04:48.640> a<00:04:49.640> remote<00:04:50.210> I<00:04:50.450> presume<00:04:50.810> he

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
back there a remote I presume he

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.490 
back there a remote I presume he
proposed<00:04:51.260> into<00:04:51.560> car<00:04:51.890> or<00:04:52.600> from<00:04:53.600> the<00:04:54.140> distance

maybe<00:04:54.650> as<00:04:54.830> a<00:04:54.890> wireless<00:04:55.070> transmitter<00:04:55.220> I'm<00:04:55.730> not

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
maybe as a wireless transmitter I'm not

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.190 
maybe as a wireless transmitter I'm not
exactly<00:04:56.090> sure<00:04:56.240> actually<00:04:56.660> what<00:04:56.780> it<00:04:56.870> means<00:04:57.020> but

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
exactly sure actually what it means but

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.050 
exactly sure actually what it means but
it's<00:04:57.320> blue<00:04:57.530> colored<00:04:57.890> so<00:04:58.580> it's<00:04:58.700> all<00:04:58.760> kind<00:04:59.000> of

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
it's blue colored so it's all kind of

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.720 
it's blue colored so it's all kind of
coded<00:04:59.390> there<00:04:59.540> as<00:04:59.630> well<00:04:59.810> a<00:05:00.020> hold<00:05:00.770> switch<00:05:01.040> no

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730

it's<00:05:01.880> not<00:05:01.940> turned<00:05:02.150> on<00:05:02.330> this<00:05:02.570> is<00:05:02.720> orange<00:05:04.150> plate

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
it's not turned on this is orange plate

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.900 
it's not turned on this is orange plate
they're<00:05:05.420> stuck<00:05:05.810> in<00:05:05.990> an<00:05:06.740> attraction<00:05:07.310> system<00:05:07.580> so

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
they're stuck in an attraction system so

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.640 
they're stuck in an attraction system so
you<00:05:08.030> know<00:05:08.360> what<00:05:08.510> track<00:05:08.690> you're<00:05:08.720> playing<00:05:09.050> my

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
you know what track you're playing my

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.410 
you know what track you're playing my
number<00:05:09.980> not<00:05:10.130> sure<00:05:10.280> which<00:05:10.430> shows<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:11.030> name<00:05:11.270> of

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
number not sure which shows the name of

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.180 
number not sure which shows the name of
the<00:05:11.540> song<00:05:12.010> but<00:05:14.170> then<00:05:15.170> a<00:05:15.260> short<00:05:15.530> brief<00:05:15.740> to<00:05:15.980> tell

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
the song but then a short brief to tell

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.830 
the song but then a short brief to tell
you<00:05:16.310> that<00:05:16.430> this<00:05:16.520> is<00:05:16.670> a<00:05:16.700> very<00:05:16.970> rare<00:05:17.330> player<00:05:17.660> to

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
you that this is a very rare player to

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.490 
you that this is a very rare player to
find<00:05:18.250> very<00:05:19.250> rare<00:05:19.460> indeed<00:05:19.690> very<00:05:20.690> difficult<00:05:21.320> to

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
find very rare indeed very difficult to

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.430 
find very rare indeed very difficult to
repair<00:05:22.630> very<00:05:23.630> difficult<00:05:24.020> to<00:05:24.080> find<00:05:24.230> parts

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
repair very difficult to find parts

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.050 
repair very difficult to find parts
that's<00:05:24.740> why<00:05:24.860> it's<00:05:25.310> not<00:05:25.370> difficult<00:05:25.550> repairing

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
that's why it's not difficult repairing

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.270 
that's why it's not difficult repairing
it<00:05:26.330> so<00:05:26.510> it's<00:05:27.170> difficult<00:05:27.350> to<00:05:27.560> find<00:05:27.710> any<00:05:27.860> parts

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
it so it's difficult to find any parts

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.600 
it so it's difficult to find any parts
for<00:05:28.310> it

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.390 

and<00:05:31.180> apart<00:05:31.509> from<00:05:31.539> that<00:05:31.689> I<00:05:32.139> learned<00:05:33.129> a<00:05:33.159> video

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
and apart from that I learned a video

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.389 
and apart from that I learned a video
here<00:05:33.580> fake<00:05:33.879> you<00:05:34.030> see<00:05:34.270> it
