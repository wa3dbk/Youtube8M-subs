00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.660
 hello youtube channel I present our 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:13.210
 first video it's about the moon shell 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:17.780
 tic tac tic is already a housing of 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:21.380
 advanced and the best that exists for the 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:24.700
 iphone smartphone here you can see the 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.700
 main characteristics 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.030
 the seal protector already has 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.030
 resistance 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.120
 to moisture 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.470
 Y 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.800
 hit 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.040
 and minor impacts 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.399
 the housing is high impact has 9 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:50.480
 millimeters of anti-gas silicone that 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:55.610
 means that before anti rubbing already and a 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:58.780
 stamp to protect the screen now 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.780
 let's do the unboxing 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.790
 we proceed 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.790
 open the box 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.650
 we skip the packaging 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:16.560
 and we find this wonder 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.560
 well here we can observe 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.609
 and the structure 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:28.070
 in detail where you can see the 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.070
 button application 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.610
 the volume 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.610
 the back cover that in this case 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.030
 it comes off 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.300
 it says down here 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.900
 I do not know how to be very firm in that way 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.900
 complete now 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.640
 good here we have 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.090
 the device well for the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.250
 jac 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.870
 and now let's proceed with the 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.500
 tools that come inside 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.500
 April 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.020
 look at the key that comes hard with the moon 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.250
 of tactic and let's start has to be 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.790
 send 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.790
 one 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.459
 we finish with three children 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.069
 we are going to leave there so that they are not 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.609
 lose 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.609
 to 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.700
 we have the other 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.970
 these procedures shows that 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.060
 really the amount of screws that 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.360
 brings this casing grants a protection 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.680
 100% to the phone in no time 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.650
 after the installation of our 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.450
 phone is going to open and it's going to 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.700
 part of the house 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.930
 I must remind you that this case is not 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.410
 plastic that 100% aluminum and electro 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.410
 painted 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.409
 they use special bolts 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.409
 and I think they are 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.069
 type to ours 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.640
 now 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.470
 we lift the lid what we 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.310
 we found the structure of the lid 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.379
 we can see that it is a solid structure 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.409
 that has support supports that do not 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:49.410
 they will go bankrupt because 100% aluminum 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:52.349
 the protection of glass with gorilla 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.590
 glass that should have approximately one 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.830
 more than one millimeter 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.620
 is not a simple friend of abs that 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.620
 can be noticed by the sound that measures 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.600
 the glass that really is a housing 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.920
 insertion 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.020
 we leave that there the advertising appears on 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.280
 outside and then we find ourselves with 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:19.640
 the cloth in this country is to clean 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:23.750
 the houses after we have game two days 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.900
 additional that come inside you 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.270
 the protector 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.270
 and then we find this that 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.690
 is really the most interesting thing about this 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:38.710
 housing this type of structure that 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.979
 cell denomination allows that when not 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.770
 they are known face to the ground to occur 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:47.770
 a situation therefore the vacuum that 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:51.340
 occurs inside the thickness of 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.139
 this rubber generates an air and soam 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.470
 filed the blow more than if this rubber 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:58.380
 out of full plastic we take out the 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.770
 rubber 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.690
 if we establish here we take out the rubber and 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.180
 here we have the second part of the 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.690
 aluminum structure if you can 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.690
 observe 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.150
 because the sounds can realize 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.950
 which is aluminum 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.980
 and we have the casing 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.750
 what is a rubber shell very very 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.780
 resistant basically from a 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.639
 silicone structure and here we have the 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.439
 piece that you like in front 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.439
 and for the connection input 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:40.150
 and that cow after the relatives and after 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.550
 obviously the phone we will ensure 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.569
 that this is the state 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:49.089
 enter in this position 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:49.089
 and we put the back leg 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.240
 and after today we are going to put 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.729
 the front cover 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.539
