00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.180
 box in the corridor to use this item 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.789

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.280
 it's just a question of you fighting 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.890
 they just as you would any other 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.069
 mascot on the map and as a starter before 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.620
 they appear in two different colors and 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.239
 they are the beast type so it can be a 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.670
 good idea you bring some things from 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.590
 flying type 25 that will receive 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.360
 less damage that can help you have 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.980
 more time to capture it when 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.720
 you are shortlived 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.090
 the mascots of the back line are 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.080
 but they do not offer much 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.090
 challenge 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.849
 and note that this box stays 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.830
 approximately one hour at the base and 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.319
 whenever a battle has been completed with 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.600
 the new rodents will give spal 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.819
 immediately and it is also worth noting that 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.130
 any player can reach and capture 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.380
 the mascots you evoked as well as 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.750
 you can also battle and capture the 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.150
 rodents evoked by other players 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.959
 and that's it I hope you enjoyed it and 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.959
 to the next
