00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.420
 on the way to nuremberg 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.269
 today i meet rap the verbeek since 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.549
 eight weeks coach at the fcm no easier 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.450
 outing for 16 games has the club 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.310
 not won anymore 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.470
 also not under the dutchman 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.350
 last the az alkmaar twice europe 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.760
 and led to the cup victory what is that for 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.340
 a guy who does something like that 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.130
 The last Nuremberg coach was considered 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.650
 to love now they wanted the exact one 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.239
 on the contrary a man with herta already as 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.270
 player guide can act as a tough dog 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.170
 but what does that mean anyway 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.940
 how does one live with such a reputation as 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.390
 important is the image of a sales trainer 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.890
 For his job, it is a blessing or a blessing 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.210
 curse 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.650
 how do you want to be yourself towards the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.060
 gamblers they want the type were pals 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.200
 always knows or wants from the club 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.000
 To be that way you need them 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.810
 distance we magath from the felix 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.280
 knows how the players react immediately 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.590
 Of course I 'm not the field marker 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.989
 as well as the club operators of welck and 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.520
 the players have to get to know me and 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.359
 I always have with many 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.009
 I enjoy my work and stuff 

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:14.950
 important because it says the body language 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:18.509
 already out and that it has to be 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.759
 also know if you are a coach 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.810
 The games do not just belong to this one, too 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:29.020
 too conscious 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.880
 well know that you are the good role model 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.289
 has to see how did it ever come 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.700
 that you can tell them that they like this 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:39.140
 got a hard dog label 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.159
 something happens in the training or something to be 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.920
 in the game 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.909
 and you have a clear opinion of you 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.740
 you are a personality 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.240
 yes and then 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.410
 take the other from that evil 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:57.340
 if anything calls an oval the 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.480
 that and we get but they are yes 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.400
 but also quite different than that 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.260
 this this hard dog and as soon as she 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.550
 More citizens like you write with 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.840
 sometimes they have a game with them 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.920
 taken home as that with the 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.330
 nurses do not work then in 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.570
 Internat I believe then in the 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.800
 raised this socially in puberty 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.230
 that is actually what it shows 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.640
 a very different type are considered as 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.770
 of its public ness to stand 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.030
 or explain how the people 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:25.209
 We only sometimes 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.100
 the attachment will have something of you 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.410
 and then I have too 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.910
 you said the reality and 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.560
 that I'm not the reality 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.840
 I have another one, too 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.940
 Imagination of myself as many 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.780
 people and maybe that too 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.590
 not quite the idea the reality 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.980
 maybe I am about myself 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.350
 positive then the other but somewhere 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.180
 in the middle of millions and 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.420
 meet and say okay that's that 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.250
 I know what I can I am convinced 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.500
 from myself and I need that in 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.810
 my work at your last club 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.519
 it was said at the end, so to speak, the 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.860
 chemistry between the team and the 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.860
 coach was completely destroyed 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.600
 and they said after that I got that 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.720
 not felt so first I have 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.989
 already he said sometimes hard at me 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.350
 mm if you separate yourself for the right one 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.420
 talk to explain why you 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.140
 to come apart 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:25.600
 and yes people want something when 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.430
 you also made the game has 30 points 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.560
 and won before and a lot 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.390
 Can not be won that says 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.400
 also no chemistry is me I have there 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.400
 this worked with a lot of fun 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:42.459
 the good in my sense and yes then 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:47.819
 but for a moment it is designed that 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:50.140
 I'm in between two of my wife 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.110
 for years worked well together and 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.470
 Stayed together and lived and took 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.050
 lived and one time that is that 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.430
 Happens you have a great set 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.099
 said to have come here now 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.390
 I do not have to adapt now 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.400
 I have to adapt to myself 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.140
 that is a great challenge I am 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.660
 as I am and I have to respect 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.489
 that the standards were to be are one 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.829
 Club yes that they are different so 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.979
 somewhere else abroad that is too 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:20.680
 Well, then most of it has to be done 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.150
 I feel very excited about the people 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.910
 they are actually still on or are 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.310
 she totally relaxes i do not do that 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.280
 what the people like to see or 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.510
 or what they shrink people 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.510
 feel good 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:40.699
 to have my hello life in hand and 

00:04:36.739 --> 00:04:41.599
 things now the army do much and 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:42.289
 then they are also with themselves 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:46.209
 in pure 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:50.599
 I can not handle that 

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:53.959
 unfortunately as was unfortunately not for me 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:56.349
 for those for the other people altogether 

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:56.349
