00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.630
 my mother, how disgusting the news that I am leaving you 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:31.460
 to tell is real news of the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.750
 famous fast food company kfc 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.360
 surely the vast majority of you 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.830
 you will have eaten there sometime 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.050
 how many chicken drumsticks as well 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.809
 Today I'm going to talk about a boy of 19 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.230
 years that you found in one of these 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.560
 chicken drumsticks a kind of body 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.880
 strange that it seemed like a brain 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.850
 some say it's just so 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.309
 of a good kidney at least that 's the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.320
 explanation gave the company another 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.780
 they say to be a kidney of a chicken 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.290
 it's too big that it would be a lung 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.630
 but nobody is clear that it is really 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.930
 what was inside this piece of 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.690
 chicken and is that you can not trust the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.330

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.979
 king are in all the places that 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.120
 they prepare the food in a matter of 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.270
 minutes 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.900
 all the crap that remains of the animal 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:38.000
 that's where we can find this 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.610

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.729
 beneficial to eat in these places 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.940
 causes serious damage to health no longer 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.900
 only for the oil used with the 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.760
 which are elaborated are you good is that the 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.680
 used oil to more than 180 degrees 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.250
 centigrade releases carcinogens 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.470
 but good removing that the raw material 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.950
 that is, the chickens that are used to 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.590
 the making of those chicken thighs 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.099
 it's not prime meat are chickens 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.590
 sick people who are raised en masse under a 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.230
 food that the only thing that favors 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.080
 is that in order in a quick way a 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.000
 transgenic feed one 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.180
 artificial feeding that can 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.360
 generate variations in your genes so 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.120

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.220

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.989

 and this was found good company 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.630

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.819
 open an investigation according to them and 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.209

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.010
 break that scandals are created 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.370

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.010
