whose Jets teams missed the playoffs of
past<00:02:35.120> four<00:02:35.480> seasons<00:02:35.780> it's<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.349> guy<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.620> change

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:37.609 
past four seasons it's the guy to change

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:39.369 
past four seasons it's the guy to change
all<00:02:37.849> of<00:02:37.879> that<00:02:38.049> doesn't<00:02:39.049> really<00:02:39.169> make<00:02:39.319> much

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
all of that doesn't really make much

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.349 
all of that doesn't really make much
sense<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.919> me<00:02:40.069> you<00:02:40.579> would<00:02:40.730> think<00:02:40.760> if<00:02:41.239> you

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
sense to me you would think if you

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.270 
sense to me you would think if you
wanted<00:02:41.689> to<00:02:41.810> get<00:02:42.049> to<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.319> playoffs<00:02:42.620> that<00:02:43.189> you

wanted to get to the playoffs that you

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.069 
wanted to get to the playoffs that you
would<00:02:43.430> bring<00:02:43.549> somebody<00:02:43.909> who<00:02:44.510> has<00:02:44.689> recently

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
on that side of the ball look at the

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.420 
on that side of the ball look at the
numbers<00:04:05.629> they<00:04:06.079> bear<00:04:06.349> it<00:04:06.500> out<00:04:06.620> I<00:04:06.859> promise<00:04:07.340> you

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
numbers they bear it out I promise you

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.009 
numbers they bear it out I promise you
and<00:04:07.579> the<00:04:07.639> record<00:04:07.969> will<00:04:08.120> certainly<00:04:08.540> bears<00:04:08.810> it

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
and the record will certainly bears it

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.809 
and the record will certainly bears it
up<00:04:09.139> so<00:04:09.799> now<00:04:10.009> you<00:04:10.069> bring<00:04:10.370> him<00:04:10.519> into<00:04:10.639> another

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
up so now you bring him into another

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.069 
up so now you bring him into another
situation<00:04:11.150> where<00:04:11.479> you<00:04:11.629> could<00:04:11.689> potentially

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
situation where you could potentially

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.229 
situation where you could potentially
would<00:04:12.169> be<00:04:12.229> doing<00:04:12.469> the<00:04:12.560> same<00:04:12.590> damn<00:04:13.129> thing<00:04:13.549> it

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
would be doing the same damn thing it

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:15.490 
would be doing the same damn thing it
really<00:04:14.539> doesn't<00:04:14.840> make<00:04:14.900> a<00:04:14.959> whole<00:04:15.019> lot<00:04:15.169> of<00:04:15.319> sense

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
really doesn't make a whole lot of sense

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.439

it<00:04:59.480> just<00:04:59.780> don't<00:04:59.930> really<00:05:00.260> add<00:05:00.440> up<00:05:00.470> and<00:05:00.770> frankly

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
suggest that this move just doesn't make

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.000 
suggest that this move just doesn't make
a<00:05:03.860> whole<00:05:04.070> lot<00:05:04.310> of<00:05:04.670> sense<00:05:05.170> now<00:05:06.170> it<00:05:06.350> could<00:05:06.740> work

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
a whole lot of sense now it could work

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.190 
a whole lot of sense now it could work
out<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.820> bills<00:05:08.120> could<00:05:08.540> get<00:05:08.750> to<00:05:08.870> the<00:05:08.960> playoffs

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
out the bills could get to the playoffs

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.160 
out the bills could get to the playoffs
as<00:05:09.500> soon<00:05:09.740> as<00:05:09.890> 2015<00:05:10.850> and<00:05:11.030> in<00:05:11.150> fact<00:05:11.420> I<00:05:11.630> might<00:05:11.840> very

making a change even though you didn't

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:18.610 
making a change even though you didn't

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:18.620 
necessarily choose this change because

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.180 
necessarily choose this change because
Marrone<00:07:19.039> cut<00:07:19.370> tail<00:07:19.639> and<00:07:19.879> ran<00:07:20.000> out<00:07:20.270> of<00:07:20.300> town<00:07:20.599> is

Marrone cut tail and ran out of town is
to<00:07:22.190> upgrade<00:07:22.789> its<00:07:23.659> not<00:07:23.900> to<00:07:24.169> make<00:07:24.319> a<00:07:24.469> lateral

00:07:25.089 --> 00:07:25.099 
to upgrade its not to make a lateral

move in potentially even a downgrade and

move in potentially even a downgrade and
that's<00:07:28.400> exactly<00:07:28.580> what<00:07:29.180> this<00:07:29.300> looks<00:07:29.629> like<00:07:29.750> this

00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 
that's exactly what this looks like this

that's exactly what this looks like this
looks<00:07:30.379> like<00:07:30.740> at<00:07:31.099> best<00:07:31.490> a<00:07:31.759> lateral<00:07:32.569> move<00:07:32.599> that

looks like at best a lateral move that

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:34.480 
looks like at best a lateral move that
will<00:07:33.440> have<00:07:33.620> just<00:07:33.889> a<00:07:33.979> little<00:07:34.279> bit<00:07:34.370> of

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:34.490 
will have just a little bit of

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.219 
will have just a little bit of
short-term<00:07:34.969> payoff<00:07:35.330> but<00:07:35.509> long<00:07:35.779> term<00:07:35.810> will

00:07:36.219 --> 00:07:36.229 
short-term payoff but long term will

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:38.529 
short-term payoff but long term will
ultimately<00:07:36.680> become<00:07:36.889> another<00:07:37.340> Jeff<00:07:37.729> situation

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:38.539

ultimately become another Jeff situation
and<00:07:38.779> if<00:07:39.650> anything<00:07:39.889> will<00:07:40.250> eventually<00:07:40.729> prove

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:40.969 
and if anything will eventually prove

and if anything will eventually prove
itself<00:07:41.240> out<00:07:41.449> to<00:07:41.599> be<00:07:41.719> a<00:07:41.750> downgrade<00:07:42.080> I'm<00:07:42.729> really

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:43.729 
itself out to be a downgrade I'm really

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:46.360 
itself out to be a downgrade I'm really
really<00:07:44.300> having<00:07:45.110> trouble<00:07:45.259> figuring<00:07:45.710> out<00:07:46.099> how

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:46.370 
really having trouble figuring out how

really having trouble figuring out how
this<00:07:46.580> makes<00:07:46.879> much<00:07:47.150> sense<00:07:47.180> for<00:07:47.690> the<00:07:48.080> Buffalo

00:07:48.249 --> 00:07:48.259 
this makes much sense for the Buffalo

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:51.070 
this makes much sense for the Buffalo
Bills<00:07:48.529> organization<00:07:49.490> and<00:07:49.669> maybe<00:07:50.270> just<00:07:50.810> maybe

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 
Bills organization and maybe just maybe

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.619 
Bills organization and maybe just maybe
this<00:07:51.979> is<00:07:52.190> just<00:07:52.219> further<00:07:52.699> proof<00:07:53.090> of<00:07:53.300> why<00:07:53.569> this

00:07:53.619 --> 00:07:53.629 
this is just further proof of why this

00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:55.950 
this is just further proof of why this
organization<00:07:54.620> hasn't<00:07:54.889> made<00:07:55.219> the<00:07:55.339> playoffs<00:07:55.580> in

organization hasn't made the playoffs in
over<00:07:56.960> 15<00:07:57.409> seasons<00:07:58.009> it's<00:07:58.669> because<00:07:58.940> of

over 15 seasons it's because of
