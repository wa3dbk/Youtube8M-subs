00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.950
 cinnamon turned on the most open television 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.089
 that never 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.160
 Well, the analysis is very interesting 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.740
 What does Mr. Lopez do to us? 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.179
 fat and good because I think there are several 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.700
 conclusions that the game leaves 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.730
 interesting I think that the most 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.970
 interesting the most remarkable is that the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.859
 players that are in america and that 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.689
 they necessarily entered as starters 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.580
 because they are far from level 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.470
 it requires to be global I mean 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.710
 specifically to the mañad rodríguez 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.030
 extremely violent in both goals the mole 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.300
 nothing to see 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.000
 there is an email but, but not 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.760
 he does one and very much he was put there 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.440
 opposite and well, yes, I think it's still 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.940
 leaving many doubts the defensive issue to 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.829
 I'm worried about the line of three why 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.649
 I will not stop commenting that he created 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.750
 difficult for mexico to have a great 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.979
 worldwide with those flaws with those mistakes 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.110
 but it was revealing 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:01.750
 that there are elements that have nothing to 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.940
 do there and he gave those that do have 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.220
 to be with those who could be in 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.410
 talavera for example has to be in 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.990
 to be global if they saw clear 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.090
 It is the best time even to 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.560
 is joseph jesus crown I think it could 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.570
 be the holder of the selection I think 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.090
 that the three goalkeepers make talavera 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.310
 in corona and ochoa 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.740
 obviously miguel herrera who can 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.109
 appear and see what can happen there 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.060
 back to rogelio chávez it seems that few 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:30.640
 training days the pressure does not 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.350
 shone not to brightness guaranteed lost 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.609
 endorsing has lost and mexico in the 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.500
 first time especially did not have the 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.060
 ball does not want and will recover 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.590
 zavala does not grip and will recover 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.909
 so then that did not allow 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.069
 will shine brizuela did not allow that 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.909
 will shine will mark fabian did not allow 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:49.119
 I was still in the lead and 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.689
 back and nothing in a minor 70 30 had of 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:55.299
 USA micro position the ball changed 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.920
 the panorama remarkably thanks to the goal 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.689
 and thanks to the changes in the second 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.099
 time that men entered that 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.659
 remarkably they made it out of the 

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:03.159
 That's how you mention that goal 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.629
 gave encouragement to the team put the 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.090
 fans are in the stadium a bit 

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:09.160
 turned off and allowed to see a better 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.920
 national team but I still insist 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.660
 the doubts remain there there are players 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.160
 that are exceeded at this time and 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.079
 that surely if the 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.060
 previous process as it happened I am not even 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.519
 it would even be nationally conditioned
