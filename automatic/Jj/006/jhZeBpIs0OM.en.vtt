as in this piece right here I can either
one<00:00:25.860> get<00:00:26.860> it<00:00:27.009> off<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.750> pair<00:00:29.079> of<00:00:29.169> snippers<00:00:31.140> or

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
one get it off the pair of snippers or

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.470 
one get it off the pair of snippers or
two<00:00:33.000> we<00:00:34.000> can<00:00:34.290> use<00:00:35.290> a<00:00:35.320> thermal<00:00:35.620> tool<00:00:35.890> and<00:00:36.480> cut

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
two we can use a thermal tool and cut

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.650 
two we can use a thermal tool and cut
around<00:00:37.600> each<00:00:37.870> piece<00:00:38.140> of<00:00:38.410> a<00:00:38.440> rock<00:00:39.210> or<00:00:40.210> we<00:00:40.480> could

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
around each piece of a rock or we could

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.340 
around each piece of a rock or we could
always<00:00:40.809> break<00:00:41.379> it<00:00:41.410> off<00:00:42.629> okay<00:00:43.629> so<00:00:43.690> we'll<00:00:44.230> start

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
always break it off okay so we'll start

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.450 
always break it off okay so we'll start
with<00:00:44.770> the<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:46.900> regular<00:00:47.550> snipping

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
with the just the regular snipping

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.910 
with the just the regular snipping
we'll<00:00:52.550> take<00:00:53.550> our<00:00:53.790> piece<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.329> be<00:00:54.590> crying<00:00:55.879> and

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
we'll take our piece to be crying and

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.639 
we'll take our piece to be crying and
we'll<00:00:58.920> go<00:00:59.040> ahead<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.340> just<00:01:00.019> snip<00:01:01.019> a<00:01:01.199> real<00:01:01.440> big

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
we'll go ahead and just snip a real big

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.660 
we'll go ahead and just snip a real big
part<00:01:01.890> off

what we'll do is we'll take the same
snip<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.619> you'll<00:01:23.950> find<00:01:24.250> where<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.520> rock<00:01:24.760> is

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
snip and you'll find where the rock is

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.469 
snip and you'll find where the rock is
snip<00:01:26.979> one<00:01:27.190> piece<00:01:27.430> there<00:01:28.140> first<00:01:29.140> one<00:01:30.300> with<00:01:31.300> a

want to take a single like sometimes
we'll<00:02:15.319> get<00:02:15.470> straight<00:02:15.770> A's<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.069> fall<00:02:16.220> off

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
we'll get straight A's that fall off

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.770 
we'll get straight A's that fall off
best<00:02:18.770> way<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:18.980> do<00:02:19.220> this<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.640> make<00:02:20.300> sure<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.569> has

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
best way to do this is make sure it has

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.770 
best way to do this is make sure it has
some<00:02:21.050> type<00:02:21.319> of<00:02:21.730> area<00:02:22.730> on<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.090> bottom<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.750> be

glue gel and you formerly usually works
or<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:42.080> can<00:02:42.290> use<00:02:42.500> coral<00:02:42.980> balloon<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:45.350> we'll

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
or you can use coral balloon and we'll

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.620 
or you can use coral balloon and we'll
take<00:02:45.650> our<00:02:45.830> friar<00:02:46.100> plug<00:02:47.170> put<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.200> nice<00:02:49.630> good

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.059 
take our friar plug put a nice good
building

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.339 

good<00:02:54.580> on<00:02:54.819> their<00:02:55.030> missions<00:02:55.569> kept<00:02:55.810> on<00:02:55.989> so<00:02:56.170> that

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
good on their missions kept on so that

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.170 
good on their missions kept on so that
you<00:02:56.409> get<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.560> roar

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.140 

take<00:02:59.780> that<00:02:59.900> little<00:03:00.079> piece<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.739> rock<00:03:01.150> and

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
take that little piece of the rock and

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.459 
take that little piece of the rock and
we'll<00:03:02.299> stick<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:02.659> right<00:03:02.750> down<00:03:02.930> in<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.260> middle

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:03.469 
we'll stick it right down in the middle

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:09.360 
we'll stick it right down in the middle
of<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.620> superglue

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.190 

and<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.879> easiest<00:03:10.150> way<00:03:10.300> to<00:03:10.480> get<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.780> superglue

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
and the easiest way to get the superglue

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.720 
and the easiest way to get the superglue
set<00:03:11.650> is<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:12.340> put<00:03:12.489> it<00:03:12.580> back<00:03:12.760> in<00:03:13.030> water<00:03:14.550> and<00:03:15.550> it

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
set is to put it back in water and it

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.350 
set is to put it back in water and it
should<00:03:15.940> take<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:17.670> 15-20<00:03:18.670> seconds<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.120> start

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
should take a 15-20 seconds to start

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.630 
should take a 15-20 seconds to start
earning

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.070 

and<00:03:24.120> then<00:03:24.240> if<00:03:24.330> we<00:03:24.420> want<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.750> get<00:03:24.870> real

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
and then if we want to get real
