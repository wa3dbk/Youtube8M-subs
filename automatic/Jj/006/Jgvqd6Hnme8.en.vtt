00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.390 

all<00:00:05.440> right<00:00:05.650> now<00:00:05.950> for<00:00:06.490> the<00:00:06.550> double<00:00:06.970> stop<00:00:07.600> sauce

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
all right now for the double stop sauce

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.760 
all right now for the double stop sauce
to<00:00:09.400> get<00:00:09.520> that<00:00:09.700> nasty<00:00:09.940> gritty<00:00:10.450> sound<00:00:10.780> the<00:00:11.530> first

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:11.770 
to get that nasty gritty sound the first

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.520 
to get that nasty gritty sound the first
one<00:00:11.950> I<00:00:11.980> started<00:00:12.280> with<00:00:12.460> the<00:00:13.090> nastiest<00:00:13.660> of<00:00:13.990> all

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.530 
one I started with the nastiest of all

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.620 
one I started with the nastiest of all
intervals<00:00:15.039> the<00:00:15.250> flat<00:00:15.459> five<00:00:15.699> and<00:00:16.090> playing

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
intervals the flat five and playing

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.540 
intervals the flat five and playing
those<00:00:16.840> together

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
those together

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.259 
those together
as<00:00:19.029> very<00:00:19.449> abrasive<00:00:19.840> and<00:00:20.560> I'm<00:00:21.279> taking<00:00:21.970> this<00:00:22.090> and

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:22.269 
as very abrasive and I'm taking this and

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.999 
as very abrasive and I'm taking this and
I'm<00:00:22.359> just<00:00:22.630> kind<00:00:22.810> of<00:00:22.869> bending<00:00:23.230> it<00:00:23.349> a<00:00:23.439> little<00:00:23.650> bit

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:26.009 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:32.639 

and<00:00:27.009> then<00:00:27.130> ending<00:00:27.430> on<00:00:27.520> the<00:00:27.669> farm<00:00:30.960> just<00:00:31.960> bending

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
and then ending on the farm just bending

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:40.850 
and then ending on the farm just bending
into<00:00:32.890> the<00:00:33.129> minor<00:00:33.309> third<00:00:35.519> doing<00:00:36.519> a<00:00:36.640> string<00:00:37.329> jump

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.590 

down<00:00:41.860> to<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.190> flat<00:00:42.370> five<00:00:42.699> here

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.140 

so<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.380> have<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.950> double<00:00:50.190> stops<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:50.880> phrase

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
so I have to double stops in this phrase

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.460 
so I have to double stops in this phrase
the<00:00:51.329> first<00:00:51.570> one

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.660 

so<00:00:58.280> eggs<00:00:58.550> extra<00:00:59.390> beef<00:00:59.720> extra<00:01:00.320> angst<00:01:00.950> when<00:01:01.580> you

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
so eggs extra beef extra angst when you

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.980 
so eggs extra beef extra angst when you
have<00:01:01.910> double<00:01:02.270> stops<00:01:02.450> especially<00:01:02.840> with

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
have double stops especially with

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.390 
have double stops especially with
distortion<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:03.650> get<00:01:03.800> those<00:01:03.950> overtones

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
distortion you get those overtones

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.020 
distortion you get those overtones
ringing<00:01:04.940> out<00:01:05.090> and<00:01:05.300> it's<00:01:05.420> a<00:01:05.600> little<00:01:06.350> some<00:01:07.030> extra

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
ringing out and it's a little some extra

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.080 
ringing out and it's a little some extra
spice<00:01:08.300> in<00:01:08.570> your<00:01:08.600> sauce<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:10.460> next<00:01:10.700> double<00:01:10.940> stop

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
spice in your sauce the next double stop

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.210 
spice in your sauce the next double stop
I'm<00:01:11.240> going<00:01:11.330> to<00:01:11.420> get<00:01:11.540> into<00:01:11.690> is<00:01:12.080> a<00:01:12.350> unison<00:01:12.950> Bend

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
I'm going to get into is a unison Bend

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.340 
I'm going to get into is a unison Bend
where<00:01:13.850> I'm<00:01:14.150> playing<00:01:14.830> this<00:01:16.870> and<00:01:17.870> I'm<00:01:18.170> also

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
where I'm playing this and I'm also

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.300 
where I'm playing this and I'm also
bending<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:18.860> D<00:01:19.100> up<00:01:19.400> to<00:01:19.730> e<00:01:20.260> and<00:01:21.260> the<00:01:21.950> harmony

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
bending the D up to e and the harmony

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.370 
bending the D up to e and the harmony
for<00:01:22.490> this<00:01:22.610> whole<00:01:22.820> thing<00:01:22.850> is<00:01:23.330> a<00:01:23.360> C<00:01:23.840> sharp<00:01:23.870> minor

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
for this whole thing is a C sharp minor

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.740 
for this whole thing is a C sharp minor
so<00:01:25.280> I'm<00:01:25.460> basically<00:01:26.030> taking<00:01:26.270> a<00:01:26.540> C<00:01:26.720> sharp

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
so I'm basically taking a C sharp

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.109 
so I'm basically taking a C sharp
pentatonic<00:01:27.620> and<00:01:27.740> do<00:01:28.160> a<00:01:28.190> unison<00:01:28.700> bends<00:01:28.910> where<00:01:29.090> I

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
pentatonic and do a unison bends where I

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.990 
pentatonic and do a unison bends where I
play<00:01:29.330> them<00:01:29.450> at<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:29.600> same<00:01:29.750> time<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:31.700> it's

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
play them at the same time and it's

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.719 
play them at the same time and it's
gonna<00:01:32.210> be<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.450> little<00:01:32.990> bit<00:01:33.110> off<00:01:33.320> so<00:01:33.729> that's

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
gonna be a little bit off so that's

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:42.040 
gonna be a little bit off so that's
where<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.150> sauce<00:01:35.360> comes<00:01:35.660> on<00:01:40.390> and<00:01:41.390> that's

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
where the sauce comes on and that's

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.570 
where the sauce comes on and that's
that's<00:01:42.350> what<00:01:42.590> you<00:01:42.680> want<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:42.979> do<00:01:43.070> is<00:01:43.160> get<00:01:43.340> it<00:01:43.490> a

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
that's what you want to do is get it a

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.430 
that's what you want to do is get it a
little<00:01:43.729> bit<00:01:43.880> off<00:01:44.180> so<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:44.540> get<00:01:45.050> those<00:01:45.200> extra

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
little bit off so you get those extra

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.530 
little bit off so you get those extra
overtones<00:01:45.920> coming<00:01:46.280> out<00:01:46.400> and<00:01:46.820> then<00:01:47.390> I'm

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
overtones coming out and then I'm

00:01:47.540 --> 00:02:09.570 
overtones coming out and then I'm
basically<00:01:48.259> taking<00:01:49.160> a<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:50.270> blue<00:01:50.540> note<00:01:50.840> taken

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.880 

making<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.479> whole<00:02:10.630> thing<00:02:10.930> very<00:02:11.290> bluesy<00:02:11.620> it's

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
making the whole thing very bluesy it's

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.250 
making the whole thing very bluesy it's
a<00:02:11.920> very<00:02:12.100> common<00:02:12.520> thing<00:02:12.730> within<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.600> C<00:02:14.110> chart

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
a very common thing within the C chart

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.600 
a very common thing within the C chart
pentatonic<00:02:14.800> any<00:02:14.980> point<00:02:15.220> of<00:02:15.280> time<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:18.220> take<00:02:18.430> the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
pentatonic any point of time to take the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.500 
pentatonic any point of time to take the
double<00:02:19.000> stops<00:02:19.240> here<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.860> then<00:02:24.580> I'm<00:02:25.210> doing

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
double stops here and then I'm doing

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.420 
double stops here and then I'm doing
kind<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.320> a<00:02:26.440> trick<00:02:26.770> where<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.010> take<00:02:27.250> this

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
kind of a trick where I take this

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.600 
kind of a trick where I take this
pentatonic<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:30.090> jump<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.690> minor<00:02:32.170> third<00:02:32.470> down

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
pentatonic and jump a minor third down

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.160 
pentatonic and jump a minor third down
where<00:02:33.610> I'm<00:02:33.790> it's<00:02:34.270> actually<00:02:34.630> making<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:34.990> sound

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
where I'm it's actually making it sound

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:42.000 
where I'm it's actually making it sound
major<00:02:38.070> so<00:02:39.070> I<00:02:39.100> can<00:02:39.310> do<00:02:39.460> riffs<00:02:39.730> like<00:02:40.980> take<00:02:41.980> it

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
major so I can do riffs like take it

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.930 
major so I can do riffs like take it
down<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.640> minor<00:02:42.850> third<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:45.160> exact<00:02:45.460> same<00:02:45.640> thing

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
down a minor third the exact same thing

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.450 
down a minor third the exact same thing
makes<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:46.300> sound<00:02:46.450> major<00:02:46.720> C<00:02:47.620> sharp<00:02:47.920> is<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.130> root

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
makes it sound major C sharp is the root

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.090 
makes it sound major C sharp is the root
so<00:02:49.300> that<00:02:49.330> was<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:50.260> harmonic<00:02:50.650> thinking<00:02:50.980> behind

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
so that was the harmonic thinking behind

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.240 
so that was the harmonic thinking behind
it

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.710 

Here<00:02:58.250> I<00:02:58.310> am<00:02:58.430> bending<00:02:58.910> into<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.240> major<00:02:59.450> third

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
Here I am bending into the major third

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:07.170 
Here I am bending into the major third
from<00:02:59.930> the<00:02:59.960> minor<00:03:00.260> once<00:03:00.800> gin

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.759 

very<00:03:08.180> last<00:03:08.480> thing<00:03:08.750> I'm<00:03:09.110> bending<00:03:09.530> with<00:03:09.650> my

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
very last thing I'm bending with my

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.949 
very last thing I'm bending with my
index<00:03:10.159> finger<00:03:10.519> which<00:03:10.730> is<00:03:11.000> not<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.810> most

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
index finger which is not the most

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.720 
index finger which is not the most
common<00:03:12.200> finger<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.769> bend<00:03:12.980> with<00:03:13.159> but<00:03:13.400> if<00:03:13.519> that's

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
common finger to bend with but if that's

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.280 
common finger to bend with but if that's
what<00:03:13.909> you're<00:03:14.060> left<00:03:14.239> with<00:03:14.360> it<00:03:14.750> works<00:03:14.989> just<00:03:15.200> fine

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
what you're left with it works just fine

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.559 
what you're left with it works just fine
and<00:03:15.650> it's<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.280> lot<00:03:16.580> easier<00:03:16.610> to<00:03:17.150> bend<00:03:17.299> the<00:03:17.450> lower

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
and it's a lot easier to bend the lower

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.390 
and it's a lot easier to bend the lower
strings<00:03:17.989> with<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.230> first<00:03:18.500> finger<00:03:18.680> than<00:03:19.040> the

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
strings with the first finger than the

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.960 
strings with the first finger than the
upper<00:03:19.640> ones<00:03:19.819> so<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.629> root<00:03:21.489> I'm<00:03:22.489> taking<00:03:22.879> the

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
upper ones so the root I'm taking the

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:40.570 
upper ones so the root I'm taking the
minor<00:03:23.209> seventh<00:03:23.629> and<00:03:23.840> bending<00:03:24.410> up

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.140 

and<00:03:41.580> then<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:43.680> very<00:03:43.890> last<00:03:43.950> one<00:03:44.280> I'm<00:03:44.670> taking<00:03:45.060> a

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
and then the very last one I'm taking a

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.480 
and then the very last one I'm taking a
very<00:03:45.360> common<00:03:45.870> thing<00:03:46.110> that's<00:03:46.860> used<00:03:47.100> in<00:03:47.250> blues<00:03:47.460> a

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
very common thing that's used in blues a

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.350 
very common thing that's used in blues a
lot<00:03:47.820> where<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.180> have<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.570> root<00:03:49.050> the<00:03:49.740> c-sharp

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
lot where you have the root the c-sharp

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:58.190 
lot where you have the root the c-sharp
the<00:03:51.360> minor<00:03:51.600> third<00:03:52.190> and<00:03:53.330> in<00:03:54.330> the<00:03:54.540> fourth<00:03:57.170> here<00:03:58.170> I

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
the minor third and in the fourth here I

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.220 
the minor third and in the fourth here I
was<00:03:58.380> using<00:03:58.560> my<00:03:58.710> fingers<00:03:59.070> to<00:03:59.100> grab<00:03:59.520> it<00:04:00.230> getting

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
was using my fingers to grab it getting

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.510 
was using my fingers to grab it getting
a<00:04:01.260> little<00:04:01.290> bit<00:04:01.560> of<00:04:01.650> skin<00:04:01.860> under<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.130> strings

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
a little bit of skin under the strings

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.610 
a little bit of skin under the strings
and<00:04:02.760> flicking<00:04:03.300> it<00:04:03.390> up<00:04:03.540> or<00:04:04.020> you<00:04:04.200> can<00:04:04.260> do<00:04:04.440> it<00:04:04.530> with

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
and flicking it up or you can do it with

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.950 
and flicking it up or you can do it with
just<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.890> pick<00:04:08.210> here<00:04:09.210> I<00:04:09.240> get<00:04:09.480> I'm<00:04:09.600> going<00:04:09.780> from

the<00:04:10.110> minor<00:04:10.290> 3rd<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.740> major<00:04:10.950> third<00:04:11.220> minor

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
the minor 3rd to the major third minor

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.410 
the minor 3rd to the major third minor
sliding<00:04:14.130> into<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.400> major<00:04:14.700> 3rd<00:04:15.200> and<00:04:16.370> doing<00:04:17.370> a

I<00:04:30.790> started

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.390 

I'm<00:04:38.870> bending<00:04:39.199> from<00:04:39.319> the<00:04:39.470> six<00:04:39.740> into<00:04:40.129> the<00:04:40.220> minor

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
I'm bending from the six into the minor

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.600 
I'm bending from the six into the minor
17<00:04:44.110> and<00:04:45.110> bending<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:45.830> minor<00:04:46.039> third<00:04:46.280> to<00:04:46.430> major
