kind of wanted to show you guys only
hopped<00:01:45.920> my<00:01:46.190> other<00:01:46.400> world<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:47.120> can<00:01:47.270> actually

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
hopped my other world you can actually

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.490 
hopped my other world you can actually
paste<00:01:48.050> multiple<00:01:48.710> maps<00:01:48.890> together<00:01:49.220> to<00:01:50.470> be<00:01:51.470> able

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
paste multiple maps together to be able

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.530 
paste multiple maps together to be able
to<00:01:51.860> actually<00:01:52.190> look<00:01:52.490> at<00:01:52.610> them<00:01:52.700> like<00:01:52.820> a<00:01:52.880> full<00:01:53.240> big

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
to actually look at them like a full big

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.480 
to actually look at them like a full big
map<00:01:53.840> so<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.020> can<00:01:54.200> see<00:01:54.320> I<00:01:54.350> have<00:01:54.440> map<00:01:54.770> three<00:01:55.190> here

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
map so you can see I have map three here

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.810 
map so you can see I have map three here
map<00:01:55.850> one<00:01:56.300> and<00:01:56.570> it<00:01:56.690> actually<00:01:56.869> just<00:01:57.550> looks<00:01:58.550> like

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
map one and it actually just looks like

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.880 
map one and it actually just looks like
a<00:01:59.000> whole<00:01:59.300> map<00:01:59.540> but<00:02:00.020> it's<00:02:00.260> actually<00:02:00.380> two<00:02:00.710> maps

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
a whole map but it's actually two maps

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.560 
a whole map but it's actually two maps
pasted<00:02:01.340> together<00:02:01.430> and<00:02:01.820> you<00:02:02.150> can<00:02:02.270> see<00:02:02.420> where

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
pasted together and you can see where

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.940 
pasted together and you can see where
the<00:02:02.660> line<00:02:02.900> goes<00:02:02.930> across<00:02:03.320> between<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.800> two

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
the line goes across between the two

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.160 
the line goes across between the two
maps<00:02:04.160> there's<00:02:04.400> no<00:02:04.550> like<00:02:04.790> a<00:02:05.330> definite<00:02:05.960> line

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
maps there's no like a definite line

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.199 
maps there's no like a definite line
between<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.740> terrain<00:02:07.100> on<00:02:07.369> this<00:02:07.790> map<00:02:07.970> you<00:02:08.119> can

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
between the terrain on this map you can

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.430 
between the terrain on this map you can
see<00:02:08.270> is<00:02:08.450> just<00:02:08.479> one<00:02:08.720> big<00:02:08.750> piece<00:02:09.080> of<00:02:09.260> terrain

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
see is just one big piece of terrain

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.320 
see is just one big piece of terrain
which<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:09.740> really<00:02:09.920> like<00:02:10.190> there's<00:02:11.000> no<00:02:11.150> like<00:02:11.180> a

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
which I really like there's no like a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.480 
which I really like there's no like a
like<00:02:11.810> big<00:02:12.230> line<00:02:12.560> through<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.040> middle<00:02:13.070> of<00:02:13.400> it

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
like big line through the middle of it

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.250 
like big line through the middle of it
because<00:02:13.670> of<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.790> there's<00:02:14.270> two<00:02:14.420> maps<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:15.140> it's

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
because of the there's two maps so it's

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.660 
because of the there's two maps so it's
a<00:02:15.350> very<00:02:15.380> key<00:02:15.800> feature<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.250> can<00:02:16.340> see<00:02:16.520> though

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
a very key feature you can see though

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.000 
a very key feature you can see though
that<00:02:16.700> this<00:02:17.000> this<00:02:17.480> map<00:02:17.959> is<00:02:17.990> very<00:02:18.380> dark<00:02:18.680> that's

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
that this this map is very dark that's

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.040 
that this this map is very dark that's
kind<00:02:19.220> of<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.400> bug<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:19.940> mod<00:02:20.360> I<00:02:20.570> don't<00:02:20.930> really
