disappointing today I was hoping the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.919 
disappointing today I was hoping the
poor<00:00:17.550> grass<00:00:17.789> we<00:00:18.029> had<00:00:18.240> done<00:00:18.449> we<00:00:18.599> might<00:00:18.810> have

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:18.929 
poor grass we had done we might have

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.859 
poor grass we had done we might have
escaped<00:00:19.349> and<00:00:20.339> we<00:00:20.939> don't<00:00:21.210> have<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.419> reasonable

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
dating so and a slightly scuppered but

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.019 
dating so and a slightly scuppered but
there<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.529> go<00:00:25.679> that's<00:00:25.919> the<00:00:26.039> way<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.400> so

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
there you go that's the way it is so

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.429 
there you go that's the way it is so
this<00:00:27.179> was<00:00:27.359> solstice<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:27.989> we<00:00:28.079> cut<00:00:28.319> this

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439

morning averaged about 17 and a half

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:32.990 
morning averaged about 17 and a half
percent<00:00:31.589> moisture<00:00:32.220> so<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.669> here<00:00:32.880> at<00:00:32.970> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
percent moisture so just here at the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.360 
percent moisture so just here at the
dryer<00:00:33.410> just<00:00:34.410> watching<00:00:34.739> go<00:00:34.859> through<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.190> is

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
dryer just watching go through this is

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.509 
dryer just watching go through this is
the<00:00:35.489> sort<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.789> the<00:00:35.910> cooling<00:00:36.329> stage<00:00:36.629> over<00:00:36.930> here

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:37.519 
the sort of the cooling stage over here

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:39.470 
the sort of the cooling stage over here
it's<00:00:38.519> probably<00:00:38.730> some<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.000> best<00:00:39.059> weekly

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
it's probably some of the best weekly

anybody's listening
so<00:00:51.280> this<00:00:51.550> is<00:00:51.730> the<00:00:51.880> dryer<00:00:52.530> as<00:00:53.530> a<00:00:53.770> continuous

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
so this is the dryer as a continuous

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.120 
so this is the dryer as a continuous
flow<00:00:54.520> dryer

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
flow dryer

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.130 
flow dryer
those<00:00:56.640> are<00:00:56.790> the<00:00:56.820> two<00:00:57.090> burners<00:00:57.630> there<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.050> are

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
those are the two burners there that are

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.260 
those are the two burners there that are
going<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.130> road

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
going on the road

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.950 
going on the road
and<00:01:00.530> that's<00:01:01.530> where<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.980> gray<00:01:02.810> enters<00:01:03.810> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
and that's where the gray enters the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.870 
and that's where the gray enters the
dryer<00:01:04.230> on<00:01:04.440> the<00:01:04.530> right<00:01:04.710> hand<00:01:04.949> side<00:01:05.100> man<00:01:05.610> and

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
dryer on the right hand side man and

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.200 
dryer on the right hand side man and
that's<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.270> depth<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.870> at<00:01:06.990> 14<00:01:07.470> inches

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
that's the depth of it at 14 inches

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.450 
that's the depth of it at 14 inches
so<00:01:09.570> all<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> way<00:01:10.290> down<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.710> top<00:01:10.920> half<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
so all the way down the top half of the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.870 
so all the way down the top half of the
dryer<00:01:11.820> that's<00:01:12.210> blowing<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.960> hot<00:01:13.140> air<00:01:13.350> into<00:01:13.799> it

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
dryer that's blowing the hot air into it

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.480 
dryer that's blowing the hot air into it
it<00:01:14.880> drops<00:01:15.299> down

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
it drops down

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:27.450 
it drops down
we<00:01:17.610> cool<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.000> had<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.390> drive<00:01:18.780> too<00:01:19.110> late

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.399 

gonna<00:01:27.790> back<00:01:28.060> into<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.540> blood

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
gonna back into the blood

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.240 
gonna back into the blood
we're<00:01:30.530> going<00:01:30.920> off<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.460> story

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
we're going off the story

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.410 
we're going off the story

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.320 
is the day to thank there and yeah so
far<00:01:36.630> week

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.780 

eighteen<00:01:39.990> thousand<00:01:40.500> liters<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.010> fuel<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
eighteen thousand liters of fuel in the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.010 
eighteen thousand liters of fuel in the
harvest<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.300> far<00:01:42.600> we're<00:01:42.810> halfway<00:01:42.990> through

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
harvest so far we're halfway through

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.390 
harvest so far we're halfway through
obviously<00:01:46.020> that's<00:01:46.200> quite<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> cost<00:01:46.890> but<00:01:47.220> we

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
obviously that's quite a cost but we

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
obviously that's quite a cost but we
can't<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.970> crops

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
can't have the crops

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.660 
can't have the crops
sitting<00:01:50.290> out<00:01:50.380> into<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:50.830> field<00:01:51.100> otherwise<00:01:51.400> we

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
sitting out into the field otherwise we

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.280 
sitting out into the field otherwise we
lose<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.970> quality<00:01:52.450> and<00:01:52.479> potentially<00:01:53.200> the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
lose the quality and potentially the

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.930 
lose the quality and potentially the
premium<00:01:53.860> so

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
premium so

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.620 
premium so
although<00:01:55.870> it's<00:01:56.410> not<00:01:56.560> ideal<00:01:56.710> to<00:01:56.920> be<00:01:57.190> trying<00:01:57.520> it

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
although it's not ideal to be trying it

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.370 
although it's not ideal to be trying it
education<00:01:59.320> having<00:01:59.649> to<00:01:59.920> cut<00:02:00.670> it<00:02:01.140> don't<00:02:02.140> fight

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
education having to cut it don't fight

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.149 
education having to cut it don't fight
at<00:02:02.590> any<00:02:02.740> moisture<00:02:03.310> but<00:02:03.460> they<00:02:04.770> certainly<00:02:05.770> once

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
at any moisture but they certainly once

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.830 
at any moisture but they certainly once
it<00:02:06.340> gets<00:02:06.549> around<00:02:06.820> twenty<00:02:07.210> percent<00:02:07.509> for<00:02:07.720> this

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
it gets around twenty percent for this

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.930 
it gets around twenty percent for this
milling<00:02:08.170> wheat<00:02:08.200> will<00:02:08.590> need<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.950> get<00:02:09.069> on<00:02:09.250> and

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
milling wheat will need to get on and

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.449 
milling wheat will need to get on and
get<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.179> harvested<00:02:10.980> looking<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.040> bit<00:02:12.069> brighter
