you're curious to see what i thought of

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.819 
you're curious to see what i thought of
it<00:00:59.640> but<00:01:00.030> other<00:01:00.420> than<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:01.530> know<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.739> can

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
it but other than that you know you can

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:02.840 
it but other than that you know you can
see<00:01:01.980> along<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.190> bottom<00:01:02.430> there<00:01:02.640> are<00:01:02.699> some
