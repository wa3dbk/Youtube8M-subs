what we have now we have one of these

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.450 
what we have now we have one of these
dark<00:00:27.539> squares<00:00:27.869> right<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.380> middle<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.800> this

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
dark squares right in the middle of this

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.730 
dark squares right in the middle of this
row<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.910> here<00:00:30.510> we<00:00:30.689> come<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.170> really<00:00:31.470> getting

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
row and here we come to really getting

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.530 
row and here we come to really getting
down<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.160> gist<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.520> how<00:00:33.000> double<00:00:33.390> knitting

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
down to the gist of how double knitting

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.870 
down to the gist of how double knitting
works<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.930> how<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.140> make<00:00:34.410> these<00:00:35.040> designs<00:00:35.579> that

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
works and how we make these designs that

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.389 
works and how we make these designs that
are<00:00:35.940> reversible<00:00:36.480> right<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:38.129> we're<00:00:38.250> going

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
are reversible right so what we're going

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.000 
are reversible right so what we're going
to<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.960> do<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.079> edge<00:00:40.290> stitch<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:40.680> usual

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
to do is do this edge stitch as usual

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.830 
to do is do this edge stitch as usual
then<00:00:41.790> we're<00:00:41.910> going<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.090> do<00:00:42.149> these<00:00:42.300> first<00:00:42.629> three

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
then we're going to do these first three

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.270 
then we're going to do these first three
stitches<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.469> same<00:00:43.649> color<00:00:43.980> as<00:00:44.160> our

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
stitches in the same color as our

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.970 
stitches in the same color as our
background<00:00:44.730> color<00:00:44.820> which<00:00:45.690> let's<00:00:46.620> see<00:00:46.770> when

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
background color which let's see when

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.799 
background color which let's see when
we're<00:00:47.100> knitting<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:48.270> side<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.750> be

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
we're knitting the side is going to be

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.310 
we're knitting the side is going to be
purple<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.760> then<00:00:50.840> we're<00:00:51.840> going<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.020> take<00:00:52.170> care

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
purple and then we're going to take care

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.270 
purple and then we're going to take care
of<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.530> one<00:00:52.710> I'm<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.949> show<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.100> how

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
of this one I'm going to show you how

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.220 
of this one I'm going to show you how
we're<00:00:53.520> going<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.670> do<00:00:53.789> more<00:00:53.820> background<00:00:54.239> like

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
we're going to do more background like

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.970 
we're going to do more background like
that<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.649> our<00:00:56.250> edge<00:00:56.399> stitch<00:00:57.500> so<00:00:58.500> looking<00:00:58.890> at

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
that and our edge stitch so looking at

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.760 
that and our edge stitch so looking at
this<00:00:59.190> knitting<00:01:00.140> you<00:01:01.140> can<00:01:01.260> see<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.620> this

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
this knitting you can see that on this

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.609 
this knitting you can see that on this
side<00:01:02.010> our<00:01:02.190> background<00:01:02.550> color<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.940> purple<00:01:03.180> and

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
side our background color is purple and

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.770 
side our background color is purple and
that's<00:01:04.619> why<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.949> haven't<00:01:05.220> put<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:06.030> our<00:01:06.390> chart

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
that's why I haven't put on our chart

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.820 
that's why I haven't put on our chart
like<00:01:08.210> knit<00:01:09.210> with<00:01:09.450> green<00:01:09.780> or<00:01:10.080> knit<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:10.409> purple

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
like knit with green or knit with purple

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.700 
like knit with green or knit with purple
because<00:01:11.520> since<00:01:12.090> we<00:01:12.210> really<00:01:12.450> are<00:01:12.630> doing<00:01:12.900> one

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
because since we really are doing one

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.520 
because since we really are doing one
color<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.040> each<00:01:14.340> side<00:01:15.080> what<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.320> really

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
color on each side what we can really

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.830 
color on each side what we can really
think<00:01:16.590> about<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.490> terms<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.390> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
think about is in terms of is it is it

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.660 
think about is in terms of is it is it
the<00:01:18.960> background<00:01:19.320> color<00:01:19.619> or<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.460> color

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the background color or is it the color

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.880 
the background color or is it the color
of<00:01:20.850> our<00:01:20.970> little<00:01:21.180> design<00:01:21.450> art<00:01:21.720> our<00:01:21.990> contrasting

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
of our little design art our contrasting

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.410 
of our little design art our contrasting
color<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.400> color<00:01:23.580> that's<00:01:23.729> opposite<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
color the color that's opposite to the

background color so that's what we want

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.060 
background color so that's what we want
to<00:01:26.460> think<00:01:26.549> about<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.060> here<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.829> side

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
to think about and here on this side

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.130 
to think about and here on this side
purple<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.119> our<00:01:30.240> background<00:01:30.420> color<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.869> can

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
see that right we've got this whole

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.370 
see that right we've got this whole
field<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.150> purple<00:01:33.509> here<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.110> we're<00:01:34.200> going<00:01:34.320> to

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
field of purple here and we're going to

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.819 
field of purple here and we're going to
start<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.740> create<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.659> green<00:01:36.659> heart<00:01:36.930> right

there and the green is going to be the
opposite<00:01:39.930> color<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.680> background<00:01:40.979> color

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
opposite color to the background color

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.280 
opposite color to the background color
that's<00:01:42.210> all<00:01:42.360> we're<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.600> think<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.079> in

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
that's all we're going to think of is in

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.410 
that's all we're going to think of is in
terms<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.770> same<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.060> background<00:01:45.210> color

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
terms of same as the background color

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.120 
terms of same as the background color
and<00:01:45.780> opposite<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.380> background<00:01:46.770> color<00:01:46.979> and

and opposite to the background color and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.280 
and opposite to the background color and
this<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.490> how<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.670> do<00:01:47.880> that

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.050 

knitting<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.040> first<00:01:55.310> stitch<00:01:55.580> with<00:01:55.820> both

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
knitting the first stitch with both

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.210 
knitting the first stitch with both
yarns<00:01:56.470> like<00:01:57.470> we<00:01:57.620> always<00:01:57.950> always<00:01:58.130> do<00:02:00.040> we<00:02:01.040> come

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
yarns like we always always do we come

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.650 
yarns like we always always do we come
to<00:02:01.370> the<00:02:01.490> first<00:02:01.670> square<00:02:02.030> on<00:02:02.120> the<00:02:02.210> chart<00:02:02.450> which

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
to the first square on the chart which

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.960 
to the first square on the chart which
is<00:02:02.800> knit<00:02:03.800> a<00:02:03.830> stitch<00:02:04.070> in<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.430> same<00:02:04.640> color<00:02:04.880> as

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
is knit a stitch in the same color as

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.150 
is knit a stitch in the same color as
the<00:02:05.090> background<00:02:05.120> color<00:02:05.510> now<00:02:05.930> when<00:02:06.770> I<00:02:06.800> say<00:02:06.980> knit

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
the background color now when I say knit

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.919 
the background color now when I say knit
a<00:02:07.190> stitch<00:02:07.400> I<00:02:07.550> mean<00:02:07.700> this<00:02:07.820> first<00:02:08.090> one<00:02:08.270> and<00:02:08.450> we

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
a stitch I mean this first one and we

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.180 
a stitch I mean this first one and we
see<00:02:09.080> that<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.290> background<00:02:09.470> color<00:02:09.679> is<00:02:09.950> purple

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
see that the background color is purple

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.440 
see that the background color is purple
so<00:02:10.399> we're<00:02:10.580> going<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:10.759> knit<00:02:10.880> this<00:02:11.090> stitch<00:02:11.150> with

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
so we're going to knit this stitch with

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.180 
so we're going to knit this stitch with
purple<00:02:11.780> just<00:02:12.230> like<00:02:12.380> we<00:02:12.500> have<00:02:12.620> been<00:02:12.800> right<00:02:13.010> it's

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
purple just like we have been right it's

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.820 
purple just like we have been right it's
going<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.430> continue<00:02:14.300> our<00:02:14.330> purple<00:02:14.990> theme<00:02:15.290> of

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
going to continue our purple theme of

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.650 
going to continue our purple theme of
having<00:02:15.980> purple<00:02:16.430> on<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.610> front<00:02:16.820> and<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.030> see<00:02:17.510> my

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
having purple on the front and I see my

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.750 
having purple on the front and I see my
yarns<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:17.990> little<00:02:18.200> twisted<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:18.710> I<00:02:18.740> can<00:02:18.950> go<00:02:19.640> ahead

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
yarns a little twisted so I can go ahead

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.760 
yarns a little twisted so I can go ahead
and<00:02:19.880> straighten<00:02:20.090> those<00:02:20.270> out<00:02:20.500> like<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:21.740> I

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
and straighten those out like that so I

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.500 
and straighten those out like that so I
don't<00:02:21.950> have<00:02:22.010> any<00:02:22.190> twists<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.850> worry<00:02:23.060> about

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
don't have any twists to worry about

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.240 
don't have any twists to worry about
so<00:02:24.170> knitting<00:02:24.470> that<00:02:24.590> first<00:02:24.890> stitch<00:02:25.070> with

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
so knitting that first stitch with

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.390 
so knitting that first stitch with
purple<00:02:25.640> that<00:02:26.510> is<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:27.050> same<00:02:27.380> color<00:02:27.770> as<00:02:28.010> our

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
purple that is the same color as our

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.910 
purple that is the same color as our
background<00:02:28.790> color<00:02:29.000> we<00:02:29.900> immediately<00:02:30.530> move<00:02:30.800> the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
background color we immediately move the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.650 
background color we immediately move the
arms<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.340> front<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:31.730> purl<00:02:32.000> with<00:02:32.510> the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
arms to the front and purl with the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.010 
arms to the front and purl with the
opposite<00:02:33.110> color<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:33.920> we<00:02:34.040> just<00:02:34.190> knitted<00:02:34.430> with

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
opposite color that we just knitted with

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.350 
opposite color that we just knitted with
so<00:02:36.020> it's<00:02:36.320> sort<00:02:36.500> of<00:02:36.700> this<00:02:37.700> knit<00:02:37.970> stitch<00:02:38.180> has<00:02:38.330> a

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
so it's sort of this knit stitch has a

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.940 
so it's sort of this knit stitch has a
partner<00:02:38.750> in<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.930> opposite<00:02:39.290> color<00:02:39.470> always

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
partner in the opposite color always

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.730 
partner in the opposite color always
let's<00:02:40.910> undo<00:02:41.209> that<00:02:41.360> twist<00:02:41.630> there<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.080> again<00:02:42.620> we

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
let's undo that twist there and again we

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.199 
let's undo that twist there and again we
have<00:02:42.830> another<00:02:42.920> white<00:02:43.310> square<00:02:43.730> on<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:43.970> chart

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209

you<00:03:30.049> did<00:03:30.200> not<00:03:30.350> just<00:03:30.530> work<00:03:30.709> with<00:03:30.890> so<00:03:31.010> that<00:03:31.130> would

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
you did not just work with so that would

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.550 
you did not just work with so that would
be<00:03:31.340> purple<00:03:31.549> in<00:03:31.730> our<00:03:31.850> case<00:03:32.049> so<00:03:33.049> you<00:03:33.140> can<00:03:33.260> see<00:03:33.470> we

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
be purple in our case so you can see we

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.310 
be purple in our case so you can see we
have<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.709> little<00:03:33.890> flip-flop<00:03:34.489> pair<00:03:35.080> three<00:03:36.080> pairs

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
have a little flip-flop pair three pairs

grain<00:03:40.700> purple<00:03:41.170> now<00:03:42.170> let's<00:03:42.350> go<00:03:42.470> back<00:03:42.620> to<00:03:42.650> purple

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
rest of the row that was pretty much as

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.479 
rest of the row that was pretty much as
hard<00:03:48.019> as<00:03:48.110> it<00:03:48.200> gets<00:03:48.320> for<00:03:48.470> this<00:03:48.620> row<00:03:51.310> like<00:03:52.310> that

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
hard as it gets for this row like that

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:53.920 
hard as it gets for this row like that
so<00:03:52.670> we're<00:03:52.820> continuing<00:03:53.299> now<00:03:53.330> to<00:03:53.450> work<00:03:53.720> on<00:03:53.840> our

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
so we're continuing now to work on our

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.870 
so we're continuing now to work on our
background<00:03:54.140> color<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:54.799> the<00:03:55.310> design<00:03:55.430> is<00:03:55.730> not

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
background color and the design is not

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.060 
background color and the design is not
going<00:03:56.000> to<00:03:56.060> be<00:03:56.150> obvious<00:03:56.510> right<00:03:56.570> away<00:03:57.070> but

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
going to be obvious right away but

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.860 
going to be obvious right away but
you'll<00:03:58.220> see<00:03:58.400> it<00:03:58.519> start<00:03:58.790> to<00:03:58.820> emerge<00:03:59.209> as<00:03:59.510> we<00:03:59.660> do<00:03:59.840> a

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
you'll see it start to emerge as we do a

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.949 
you'll see it start to emerge as we do a
few<00:04:00.170> more<00:04:00.320> rows<00:04:01.359> it's<00:04:02.359> definitely<00:04:02.750> hard<00:04:02.900> to

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
few more rows it's definitely hard to

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.900 
few more rows it's definitely hard to
see<00:04:03.169> it<00:04:03.290> when<00:04:03.470> it's<00:04:03.500> on<00:04:03.769> the<00:04:04.400> needle<00:04:04.669> but<00:04:04.760> once

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
see it when it's on the needle but once

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.390 
see it when it's on the needle but once
it<00:04:05.030> gets<00:04:05.090> down<00:04:05.299> here<00:04:05.329> it's<00:04:05.630> easy<00:04:05.810> to<00:04:05.930> see

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
it gets down here it's easy to see

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:14.199 
it gets down here it's easy to see
so<00:04:11.019> last<00:04:12.019> stitch<00:04:12.560> knit<00:04:13.370> with<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:13.760> background

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209
