now<00:00:06.569> we've<00:00:06.779> got<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.020> tension<00:00:07.230> removed<00:00:07.649> from

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
now we've got the tension removed from

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.250 
now we've got the tension removed from
the<00:00:08.010> strut<00:00:08.910> assembly<00:00:09.000> we<00:00:09.870> need<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.019> come<00:00:10.230> in

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
the strut assembly we need to come in

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.879 
the strut assembly we need to come in
here<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.800> remove<00:00:11.309> this<00:00:11.490> little<00:00:12.269> bolt<00:00:12.889> this

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
here and remove this little bolt this

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.689 
here and remove this little bolt this
also<00:00:14.219> takes<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.910> 19<00:00:15.750> millimeter<00:00:16.699> ratchet

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
also takes a 19 millimeter ratchet

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.349 
also takes a 19 millimeter ratchet
socket<00:00:18.270> wrench<00:00:18.480> you'll<00:00:19.260> probably<00:00:19.380> need<00:00:19.590> both

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
socket wrench you'll probably need both

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.840 
socket wrench you'll probably need both
so<00:00:21.890> it<00:00:22.890> comes<00:00:23.070> out<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.400> can't<00:00:23.550> be<00:00:23.609> kind<00:00:23.789> of

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
so it comes out it can't be kind of

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.359 
so it comes out it can't be kind of
tight<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.180> might<00:00:24.300> as<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.539> use<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> breaker<00:00:25.019> bar

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
tight you might as you use a breaker bar

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.130 
tight you might as you use a breaker bar
to<00:00:26.369> bust<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.699> loose<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.210> after<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.960> comes

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
to bust it loose but after that it comes

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.189 
to bust it loose but after that it comes
out<00:00:28.320> pretty<00:00:28.920> easily<00:00:29.539> so<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.630> control<00:00:30.929> arms

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
out pretty easily so the control arms

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.490 
out pretty easily so the control arms
out<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.500> way<00:00:31.529> let's<00:00:32.099> drop<00:00:32.340> free<00:00:33.410> and<00:00:34.410> now

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
out of the way let's drop free and now

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.690 
out of the way let's drop free and now
the<00:00:34.559> strut<00:00:34.860> assembly<00:00:34.950> just<00:00:35.309> needs<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> be

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
the strut assembly just needs to be

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:47.000 
the strut assembly just needs to be
pulled<00:00:35.940> from<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:37.050> truck<00:00:45.530> well<00:00:46.530> as<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.739> saw<00:00:46.890> in

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
pulled from the truck well as you saw in

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.369 
pulled from the truck well as you saw in
the<00:00:47.070> previous<00:00:47.250> video<00:00:47.550> our<00:00:48.539> top<00:00:48.809> hat<00:00:48.989> bushings

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
the previous video our top hat bushings

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.319 
the previous video our top hat bushings
are<00:00:49.829> pretty<00:00:50.129> mangled<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> next<00:00:51.030> step<00:00:51.180> for

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
are pretty mangled so the next step for

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.080 
are pretty mangled so the next step for
us<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.780> actually<00:00:52.440> remove<00:00:52.739> these<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:54.059> that

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
us is to actually remove these so that

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.670 
us is to actually remove these so that
we<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.449> replace<00:00:54.870> them<00:00:55.110> with<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> new<00:00:55.379> ones

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
we can replace them with the new ones

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.420 
we can replace them with the new ones
the<00:00:55.920> three<00:00:56.850> bolts<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.239> top<00:00:57.449> use<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.710> fourteen

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
the three bolts on top use a fourteen

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.880 
the three bolts on top use a fourteen
millimeter<00:00:59.750> wrench<00:01:00.750> or<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.559> fourteen

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
millimeter wrench or a fourteen

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:15.450 
millimeter wrench or a fourteen
millimeter<00:01:02.039> socket

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.950 

so<00:01:16.460> we<00:01:16.549> just<00:01:16.700> pull<00:01:16.850> the<00:01:16.939> top<00:01:17.119> hat<00:01:17.329> off<00:01:17.509> of<00:01:17.899> the

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
so we just pull the top hat off of the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.990 
so we just pull the top hat off of the
passenger<00:01:18.409> side<00:01:18.619> you<00:01:19.250> can<00:01:19.460> see<00:01:19.490> it<00:01:19.759> has<00:01:19.850> the

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
passenger side you can see it has the

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.429 
passenger side you can see it has the
same<00:01:21.009> kind<00:01:22.009> of<00:01:22.100> wallowing<00:01:22.520> effect<00:01:23.350> that<00:01:24.350> we

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
same kind of wallowing effect that we

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.050 
same kind of wallowing effect that we
had<00:01:24.590> over<00:01:24.979> here<00:01:25.009> on<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.280> driver's<00:01:25.640> side<00:01:25.670> so

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
had over here on the driver's side so

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.969 
had over here on the driver's side so
these<00:01:26.630> for<00:01:27.200> us<00:01:27.289> they<00:01:27.500> definitely<00:01:27.710> need<00:01:27.950> to

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
these for us they definitely need to

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.490 
these for us they definitely need to
need<00:01:28.490> it<00:01:28.610> to<00:01:28.670> be<00:01:28.789> replaced<00:01:29.179> and<00:01:29.509> if<00:01:30.380> you're

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
need it to be replaced and if you're

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.169 
need it to be replaced and if you're
doing<00:01:30.619> this<00:01:30.799> I<00:01:31.070> would<00:01:31.640> recommend<00:01:32.060> at<00:01:32.149> least

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
doing this I would recommend at least

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:33.899 
doing this I would recommend at least
pulling<00:01:32.600> these<00:01:32.689> out<00:01:32.869> it's<00:01:33.079> only<00:01:33.140> three<00:01:33.439> bolts

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
pulling these out it's only three bolts

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.490 
pulling these out it's only three bolts
it's<00:01:34.909> very<00:01:35.360> quick<00:01:35.659> very<00:01:35.720> easy<00:01:35.990> to<00:01:36.259> pull<00:01:36.409> these

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
it's very quick very easy to pull these

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.429 
it's very quick very easy to pull these
out<00:01:36.679> and<00:01:36.740> inspect<00:01:37.399> these<00:01:37.549> as<00:01:37.789> well<00:01:38.140> and<00:01:39.140> just

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
out and inspect these as well and just

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.719 
out and inspect these as well and just
like<00:01:39.940> on<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.060> driver<00:01:41.299> side<00:01:41.420> shock<00:01:42.729> the

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
like on the driver side shock the

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.999 
like on the driver side shock the
passenger<00:01:44.209> side<00:01:44.360> has<00:01:44.630> that<00:01:44.780> kind<00:01:45.020> of<00:01:45.110> notched

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
passenger side has that kind of notched

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.219 
passenger side has that kind of notched
area<00:01:46.490> looks<00:01:47.179> like<00:01:47.330> somebody's<00:01:47.659> been<00:01:47.750> trying

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
area looks like somebody's been trying

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.749 
area looks like somebody's been trying
to<00:01:48.409> chop<00:01:48.619> down<00:01:48.649> a<00:01:48.830> tree<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.310> now<00:01:49.340> we're<00:01:49.580> ready

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
to chop down a tree so now we're ready

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.300 
to chop down a tree so now we're ready
to<00:01:49.819> reinstall<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.959> new<00:01:51.200> strut<00:01:51.799> assembly<00:01:51.890> we

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
to reinstall the new strut assembly we

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.289 
to reinstall the new strut assembly we
have<00:01:52.459> the<00:01:52.670> new<00:01:53.119> top<00:01:53.360> hat<00:01:53.569> in<00:01:53.689> place<00:01:55.179> the<00:01:56.179> new

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
have the new top hat in place the new

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.230 
have the new top hat in place the new
one<00:01:56.450> just<00:01:56.530> goes<00:01:57.530> right<00:01:57.770> in<00:01:57.830> just<00:01:58.819> like<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:59.090> old

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
one just goes right in just like the old

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:13.900 
one just goes right in just like the old
one<00:01:59.360> came<00:01:59.539> out<00:02:08.560> get<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:09.649> set<00:02:09.860> in<00:02:09.979> place<00:02:12.880> run<00:02:13.880> a

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
one came out get it set in place run a

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:28.520 
one came out get it set in place run a
bolt<00:02:14.209> back<00:02:14.390> through

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.289 

so<00:02:29.530> this<00:02:29.680> is<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:29.830> part<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.069> the<00:02:30.159> project<00:02:30.370> where

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
so this is the part of the project where

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.360 
so this is the part of the project where
it<00:02:31.360> helps<00:02:31.510> have<00:02:31.720> two<00:02:31.930> people<00:02:32.260> need<00:02:33.069> one<00:02:33.220> person

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
it helps have two people need one person

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.710 
it helps have two people need one person
to<00:02:33.579> help<00:02:33.819> dad<00:02:34.689> shaft<00:02:35.170> up<00:02:35.590> through<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:37.239> top<00:02:37.450> hat

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
to help dad shaft up through the top hat

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.899 
to help dad shaft up through the top hat
and<00:02:38.500> one<00:02:38.650> person<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.040> jack<00:02:40.079> on<00:02:41.079> floor<00:02:41.829> jack<00:02:42.040> go

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
and one person to jack on floor jack go

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:48.960 
and one person to jack on floor jack go
ahead<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.180> go<00:02:43.239> up<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:48.489> shaft<00:02:48.730> of<00:02:48.909> the

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
ahead and go up so the the shaft of the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.660 
ahead and go up so the the shaft of the
shock<00:02:49.590> has<00:02:50.590> passed<00:02:50.829> through<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.099> top<00:02:51.250> hat<00:02:51.459> and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
shock has passed through the top hat and

holding<00:03:01.329> it<00:03:01.390> with<00:03:01.480> two<00:03:01.629> wrenches<00:03:02.049> this<00:03:02.200> the

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
holding it with two wrenches this the

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.789 
holding it with two wrenches this the
top<00:03:03.159> of<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.370> shaft<00:03:03.579> will<00:03:03.849> actually<00:03:04.120> spin<00:03:04.799> so

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
top of the shaft will actually spin so

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.140 
top of the shaft will actually spin so
the<00:03:05.889> big<00:03:06.040> wrench<00:03:06.280> use<00:03:06.670> use<00:03:06.849> them<00:03:07.030> as<00:03:07.120> a

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
the big wrench use use them as a

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.449 
the big wrench use use them as a
nineteen<00:03:07.629> millimeter<00:03:08.019> and<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.920> small<00:03:09.220> one<00:03:09.310> is

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
nineteen millimeter and a small one is

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.520 
nineteen millimeter and a small one is
an<00:03:09.579> eight<00:03:09.730> millimeter<00:03:09.940> so<00:03:10.900> just<00:03:11.109> go<00:03:11.230> ahead<00:03:11.319> and

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
an eight millimeter so just go ahead and

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.860 
an eight millimeter so just go ahead and
snug<00:03:11.680> that<00:03:11.739> down<00:03:12.090> as<00:03:13.090> tight<00:03:13.329> as<00:03:13.450> it<00:03:13.569> needs<00:03:13.720> to

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
snug that down as tight as it needs to

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.240 
snug that down as tight as it needs to
be<00:03:14.159> and<00:03:15.159> then<00:03:15.310> we're<00:03:15.430> ready<00:03:15.519> to<00:03:15.870> start

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
be and then we're ready to start

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.099 
be and then we're ready to start
reassembling<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.609> ball<00:03:18.760> joint<00:03:19.030> so<00:03:19.900> we<00:03:19.989> get

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
reassembling the ball joint so we get

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.039 
reassembling the ball joint so we get
the<00:03:20.200> chuck<00:03:20.440> bolted<00:03:21.129> in<00:03:21.250> place<00:03:21.280> I<00:03:21.989> tightened<00:03:22.989> up

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
the chuck bolted in place I tightened up

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.690 
the chuck bolted in place I tightened up
at<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.290> top<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:24.400> now<00:03:24.489> we're<00:03:24.670> just

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
at the top and now we're just

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.720 
at the top and now we're just
reinstalling<00:03:25.299> these<00:03:25.540> two<00:03:26.459> bolts<00:03:27.459> here<00:03:27.549> at<00:03:27.670> the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
reinstalling these two bolts here at the

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.559 
reinstalling these two bolts here at the
bottom<00:03:28.409> that<00:03:29.409> connect<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.739> ball<00:03:29.889> joint<00:03:30.159> to

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
bottom that connect the ball joint to

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.309 
bottom that connect the ball joint to
the<00:03:31.569> knuckle<00:03:31.870> itself<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.870> we<00:03:34.989> finished

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
the knuckle itself so we finished

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.349 
the knuckle itself so we finished
torquing<00:03:35.650> those<00:03:35.769> two<00:03:35.980> bolts<00:03:36.370> under<00:03:37.269> the

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
torquing those two bolts under the

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.170 
torquing those two bolts under the
steering<00:03:37.660> knuckle<00:03:38.400> torque<00:03:39.400> them<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.639> spec<00:03:39.910> and

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
steering knuckle torque them to spec and

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.379 
steering knuckle torque them to spec and
now<00:03:41.079> we're<00:03:41.230> just<00:03:41.349> going<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:41.590> tighten<00:03:42.069> down

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
now we're just going to tighten down

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.059 
now we're just going to tighten down
this<00:03:43.389> lower<00:03:43.599> mounting<00:03:43.989> point<00:03:44.260> of<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.829> strut

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
this lower mounting point of the strut

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.030 
this lower mounting point of the strut
assembly<00:03:45.099> and<00:03:45.639> again<00:03:46.480> this<00:03:46.660> just<00:03:46.930> uses<00:03:47.260> a<00:03:47.290> 19

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
assembly and again this just uses a 19

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.699 
assembly and again this just uses a 19
millimeter<00:03:48.489> socket<00:03:49.239> and<00:03:50.169> a<00:03:50.319> 19<00:03:50.620> millimeter

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
millimeter socket and a 19 millimeter

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.830 
millimeter socket and a 19 millimeter
wrench<00:03:51.220> so<00:03:51.519> we<00:03:52.150> get<00:03:52.299> that<00:03:52.419> tightened<00:03:52.810> down

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
wrench so we get that tightened down

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.930 
wrench so we get that tightened down
then<00:03:53.139> we'll<00:03:53.230> come<00:03:53.410> in<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:53.769> we'll<00:03:53.940> retighten

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
then we'll come in and we'll retighten

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:02.990 
then we'll come in and we'll retighten
these<00:03:55.120> lower<00:03:55.750> control<00:03:56.109> arm<00:03:56.349> mounting<00:03:57.069> bolts

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.070
