00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.490
 church roof 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.980
 the hammer juritsch illuminated I have 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.210
 right now pronounced 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:50.590
 again right here again 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:02:00.320
 occurred 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:02:02.120
 as it is right here, the very hint 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.670
 dear ladies and gentlemen in ours 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.000
 instruction manual is located 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.979
 error 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.790
 the specified cable length of two meters 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.920
 is not the actual one 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.770
 Length is 1 meter 70 a lot 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:20.570
 understanding 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:22.430
 a problem here or to get started in 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.490
 yverdon waldmann too stupid button too 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.490
 to press 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:36.860
 and then we have the device first 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:41.000
 Separate ourselves so stifled we do that 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.380
 also so stupid the packed ideas so 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.480
 little such a small praise it works 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.830
 not because you are forced everyone 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.500
 First you have to hit the table 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.970
 and here to make that offers there 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.870
 was that they introduce for the first time 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.200
 I think that's really nice 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.200
 no matter 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.770
 came in a rush 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.540
 I came against the tripod my 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:16.030
 god the guy has the put the heroin 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:18.820
 in the chemical packs section here 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.890
 There we have a very long book 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.240
 which does not read any sow because actually 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:29.710
 Everybody knows how to make a mouse 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:32.050
 connect or usb mouse hope that 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:36.340
 this juice just because my pc 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.500
 makes virenscan and us alone 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:53.950
 Just go here on the side 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:55.330
 usb that's another moment where you are 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.570
 then better read the manual 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.570
 had 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.560
 2 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.560
 it 's not pretty green 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:12.710
 unfortunately makes horny interest 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.440
 oh so you can also feel unnecessary 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.140
 use the color to change what i have 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.709
 now cool, the laser suits me 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.390
 on 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.270
 at my old house heartwarming 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.990
 djuric that was believe i believe in 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.990
 my old new age 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.110
 there we have my old mouse that we 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.880
 the mausrad because I have it again 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.410
 delivered so expanded because that 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.420
 anyway , if it is broken and 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.830
 So the problem was here now 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.440
 also really cool eye lights up here 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.180
 the side only then stop the laser red 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.190
 and then really weird 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.420
 mixed and I did that too short 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.340
 luckily we have that out now 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.900
 we do not hope so now 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.660
 it stays there because it is 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.190
 annoying a bit that horny if 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.780
 the complete one is turned on however 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.950
 Okay, that would not be the case anymore 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.090
 the drama is there where in the 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.980
 hand so I now know, of course, 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.680
 do not do it because my pc ins 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.860
 just as I said total is so the 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.440
 is moving very heavy liquid now 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:13.550
 especially from pet who also gets one 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.060
 anyway, instructors do not necessarily because I 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.060
 not the focus 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.760
 Petko point is very nice I have to 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.010
 say a lot better than that 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.310
 predecessor of iris the mausrad now 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:30.700
 finally a bit more stable and 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:34.120
 the keys july everything flies right 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.710
 nice so first sit a bit 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.110
 fat but you have to say in the 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:41.410
 end, it is then quite good 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.820
 in the hand and that's it 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.380
 again that i have my new mouse 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.120
 Let's see how long this time lives 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.890
 if i liked this video then 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.030
 gives a thumbs up I pack in 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.560
 the video writes with link from this one 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.850
 so not now I have now in 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.830
 retail bought so I of course 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.660
 also net and then you can the 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.130
 also buy 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.990
 maybe I write to those like that 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.140
 find description offer now because I 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.980
 can not cut yet and now 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.050
 that's a bit silly, of course 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.950
 if I tested the first time then 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.050
 I'm still writing the tender 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.400

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.140
