would<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:32.940> be<00:02:33.150> able<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.420> see<00:02:33.570> directly<00:02:33.690> in<00:02:34.140> front

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
would I be able to see directly in front

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.440 
would I be able to see directly in front
of<00:02:34.530> me<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.920> obviously<00:02:35.460> I<00:02:35.550> can<00:02:35.940> because<00:02:36.270> it's

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
of me and obviously I can because it's

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.660 
of me and obviously I can because it's
not<00:02:36.600> too<00:02:36.720> clear<00:02:36.870> I'm<00:02:37.020> drilling<00:02:37.230> but<00:02:37.640> with<00:02:38.640> a

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
not too clear I'm drilling but with a

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.820 
not too clear I'm drilling but with a
quick<00:02:38.850> turn<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.360> rudder<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:39.720> can<00:02:40.080> easily

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
quick turn of the rudder I can easily

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.180 
quick turn of the rudder I can easily
move<00:02:41.790> side<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.150> side<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.860> get<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:43.890> view<00:02:44.130> of

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
move side to side and get a view of

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.700 
move side to side and get a view of
what's<00:02:44.520> directly<00:02:45.000> in<00:02:45.060> front<00:02:48.440> this<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.500> how

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
what's directly in front this is how

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.960 
what's directly in front this is how
easy<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.070> is<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.310> take<00:02:50.460> down<00:02:52.610> just<00:02:53.610> remove<00:02:53.820> the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
easy it is to take down just remove the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.280 
easy it is to take down just remove the
cotter<00:02:54.150> pin<00:02:54.420> from<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.780> shaft<00:02:55.050> of<00:02:55.260> the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
cotter pin from the shaft of the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.830 
cotter pin from the shaft of the
umbrella<00:02:55.710> slide<00:02:56.580> it<00:02:56.730> off<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:56.880> mast<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:57.510> then

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
umbrella slide it off the mast and then

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.150 
umbrella slide it off the mast and then
close<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.110> like<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.530> normally<00:02:58.710> would<00:02:58.950> a

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
close it like you normally would a

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.800 
close it like you normally would a
regular<00:02:59.400> umbrella

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.090 

so<00:03:03.810> we're<00:03:03.960> neatly<00:03:04.200> right<00:03:04.500> on<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.680> top<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:05.010> the

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
so we're neatly right on the top of the

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.720 
so we're neatly right on the top of the
hatch<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:05.280> I'm<00:03:06.180> ready<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.510> fishing<00:03:06.960> them<00:03:07.730> not

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
hatch so I'm ready to fishing them not

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.360 
hatch so I'm ready to fishing them not
very<00:03:08.760> hard<00:03:09.180> at<00:03:09.330> all

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.300 

here's<00:03:14.330> a<00:03:14.450> shot<00:03:14.629> of<00:03:15.349> me<00:03:15.530> getting<00:03:15.739> more<00:03:16.010> toward

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
here's a shot of me getting more toward

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.740 
here's a shot of me getting more toward
the<00:03:16.459> center<00:03:16.730> of<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.910> lake<00:03:17.150> where<00:03:17.390> it's<00:03:17.540> more

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
the center of the lake where it's more

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.509 
the center of the lake where it's more
windy<00:03:18.080> now<00:03:18.260> I'm<00:03:18.410> headed<00:03:18.709> directly<00:03:18.830> into<00:03:19.459> the

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
windy now I'm headed directly into the

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.449 
windy now I'm headed directly into the
wind<00:03:19.730> in<00:03:20.030> this<00:03:20.510> shot<00:03:20.860> so<00:03:21.860> I<00:03:21.920> wanted<00:03:22.129> to<00:03:22.190> see<00:03:22.310> how

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
wind in this shot so I wanted to see how

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.640 
wind in this shot so I wanted to see how
hard<00:03:22.670> it<00:03:22.760> would<00:03:22.879> be<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:23.090> set<00:03:23.720> up<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:24.080> umbrella

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
hard it would be to set up the umbrella

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.059 
hard it would be to set up the umbrella
directly<00:03:25.640> in<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.849> wind<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.709> wasn't<00:03:27.709> bad<00:03:27.950> at

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
directly in the wind and wasn't bad at

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.009 
directly in the wind and wasn't bad at
all<00:03:30.129> I'm<00:03:31.129> really<00:03:31.310> impressed<00:03:32.060> on<00:03:32.420> how<00:03:32.569> well<00:03:32.840> it

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
all I'm really impressed on how well it

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.270 
all I'm really impressed on how well it
worked<00:03:33.200> and<00:03:35.019> there<00:03:36.019> were<00:03:36.110> a<00:03:36.140> couple<00:03:36.349> couple<00:03:37.160> of

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
worked and there were a couple couple of

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.150 
worked and there were a couple couple of
people<00:03:37.459> outside<00:03:38.090> that<00:03:38.420> seen<00:03:38.720> my<00:03:38.930> setup<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:39.709> as

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
people outside that seen my setup and as

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.930 
people outside that seen my setup and as
I<00:03:40.340> was<00:03:40.489> passing<00:03:40.700> them<00:03:40.970> by<00:03:41.000> on<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:41.540> water<00:03:41.750> they

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
I was passing them by on the water they

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.630 
I was passing them by on the water they
they<00:03:43.940> really<00:03:44.120> liked<00:03:44.450> it<00:03:44.950> they<00:03:45.950> comment<00:03:46.430> on<00:03:46.549> it

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
they really liked it they comment on it

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.630 
they really liked it they comment on it
later<00:03:46.849> in<00:03:47.120> this<00:03:47.269> video<00:03:47.569> so<00:03:48.310> you'll<00:03:49.310> see<00:03:49.430> that

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
later in this video so you'll see that

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.270 
later in this video so you'll see that
part<00:03:50.440> there<00:03:51.440> you<00:03:51.560> go<00:03:51.680> just<00:03:51.890> slide<00:03:52.130> the

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
part there you go just slide the

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.650 
part there you go just slide the
umbrella<00:03:52.579> through<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.849> shaft<00:03:53.090> of<00:03:53.329> the<00:03:53.360> mast

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
umbrella through the shaft of the mast

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:00.309 
umbrella through the shaft of the mast
and<00:03:56.380> insert<00:03:57.380> the<00:03:57.590> cotter<00:03:57.769> pin<00:03:59.230> connect<00:04:00.230> the

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
and insert the cotter pin connect the

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.160 
and insert the cotter pin connect the
paracord<00:04:00.829> and<00:04:02.290> that's<00:04:03.290> it<00:04:03.500> we're<00:04:03.950> good<00:04:04.099> to<00:04:04.220> go

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
paracord and that's it we're good to go

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:14.790 
paracord and that's it we're good to go
sit<00:04:06.170> on<00:04:06.290> back<00:04:07.209> it<00:04:08.209> works<00:04:08.360> really<00:04:08.810> really<00:04:08.989> well

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.190 

now<00:04:15.310> I'm<00:04:15.460> selling<00:04:15.730> toward<00:04:16.150> a<00:04:16.239> Cove<00:04:16.480> the<00:04:16.989> wind

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
now I'm selling toward a Cove the wind

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.420 
now I'm selling toward a Cove the wind
is<00:04:17.470> coming<00:04:17.950> at<00:04:18.190> me<00:04:18.310> at<00:04:18.400> an<00:04:18.520> angle<00:04:19.709> so<00:04:20.709> I<00:04:20.980> wanted

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
is coming at me at an angle so I wanted

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.160 
is coming at me at an angle so I wanted
to<00:04:21.520> see<00:04:21.700> what<00:04:22.000> it<00:04:22.120> would<00:04:22.240> do<00:04:22.390> if<00:04:22.570> I<00:04:22.720> was<00:04:22.870> holding

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
to see what it would do if I was holding

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.440 
to see what it would do if I was holding
the<00:04:23.290> paracord<00:04:23.800> I<00:04:24.130> actually<00:04:24.610> see<00:04:24.970> if<00:04:25.120> I<00:04:25.270> could

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
the paracord I actually see if I could

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.810 
the paracord I actually see if I could
get<00:04:25.570> enough<00:04:25.870> of<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.740> umbrellas<00:04:27.370> that<00:04:27.550> catch

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
get enough of the umbrellas that catch

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.570 
get enough of the umbrellas that catch
the<00:04:27.850> wind<00:04:28.300> at<00:04:28.720> an<00:04:28.840> angle<00:04:29.230> and<00:04:29.680> since<00:04:30.370> it<00:04:30.490> is

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
the wind at an angle and since it is

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.840 
the wind at an angle and since it is
connected<00:04:31.180> to<00:04:31.360> the<00:04:32.160> to<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:33.280> courts<00:04:33.640> that

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
connected to the to the courts that

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.680 
connected to the to the courts that
holds<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.270> hatch<00:04:34.990> closed<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:37.000> movement<00:04:37.510> is

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
holds the hatch closed the movement is

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.010 
holds the hatch closed the movement is
limited<00:04:40.710> but<00:04:41.710> it<00:04:41.890> was<00:04:42.010> enough<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.340> get<00:04:42.610> me

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
limited but it was enough to get me

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.310 
limited but it was enough to get me
angled<00:04:44.020> down<00:04:44.170> this<00:04:44.440> Cove<00:04:44.680> and<00:04:45.930> since<00:04:46.930> I<00:04:47.050> was

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
angled down this Cove and since I was

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.980 
angled down this Cove and since I was
not<00:04:47.950> sailing<00:04:48.490> directly<00:04:48.790> downwind<00:04:49.390> I<00:04:49.660> did<00:04:49.810> have

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
not sailing directly downwind I did have

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.310 
not sailing directly downwind I did have
the<00:04:50.110> trolling<00:04:50.350> motor<00:04:50.500> on<00:04:50.890> on<00:04:51.220> speed<00:04:51.580> too<00:04:52.290> so<00:04:53.290> I

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
the trolling motor on on speed too so I

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.150
