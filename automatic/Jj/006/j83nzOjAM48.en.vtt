00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
Kesha well first of all like from a

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.690 
Kesha well first of all like from a
lady's<00:04:48.820> perspective<00:04:49.540> you<00:04:49.930> look<00:04:50.110> good

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.180 

and<00:04:54.850> I<00:04:55.480> do<00:04:55.660> i<00:04:55.930> do<00:04:56.200> agree<00:04:56.560> there<00:04:56.800> were<00:04:56.890> moments

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
and I do i do agree there were moments

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.730 
and I do i do agree there were moments
in<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.700> song<00:04:57.940> where<00:04:58.300> I<00:04:58.330> was<00:04:58.600> really<00:04:59.200> hoping<00:04:59.440> it

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
in the song where I was really hoping it

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.010 
in the song where I was really hoping it
would<00:04:59.770> pick<00:05:00.130> up<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.700> you<00:05:01.120> got<00:05:01.330> there<00:05:01.630> you<00:05:01.840> got

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
would pick up and you got there you got

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.080 
would pick up and you got there you got
there<00:05:02.230> at<00:05:02.320> the<00:05:02.470> end<00:05:02.590> but<00:05:02.980> I<00:05:03.250> feel<00:05:03.820> like<00:05:03.910> the

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
there at the end but I feel like the

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.910 
there at the end but I feel like the
momentum<00:05:04.600> wasn't<00:05:04.990> quite<00:05:05.170> there<00:05:05.380> and<00:05:05.590> I<00:05:05.650> think

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
momentum wasn't quite there and I think

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.950 
momentum wasn't quite there and I think
that's<00:05:06.100> why<00:05:06.340> even<00:05:07.000> do<00:05:07.120> that<00:05:07.150> we<00:05:07.480> was

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
that's why even do that we was

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.350 
that's why even do that we was
fifty-three<00:05:08.530> percent<00:05:08.790> but<00:05:09.790> it<00:05:10.000> doesn't<00:05:10.300> mean

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
fifty-three percent but it doesn't mean

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.820 
fifty-three percent but it doesn't mean
you<00:05:10.480> don't<00:05:10.630> have<00:05:10.750> a<00:05:10.840> beautiful<00:05:11.020> voice<00:05:11.440> and

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
you don't have a beautiful voice and

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.960 
you don't have a beautiful voice and
that<00:05:11.920> doesn't<00:05:12.400> mean<00:05:12.490> you<00:05:12.550> don't<00:05:12.700> have<00:05:12.820> a

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
that doesn't mean you don't have a

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.450 
that doesn't mean you don't have a
future<00:05:13.180> in<00:05:13.300> music<00:05:13.500> so<00:05:14.500> from<00:05:14.980> those<00:05:15.100> those<00:05:15.280> two

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
future in music so from those those two

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.190 
future in music so from those those two
it<00:05:15.550> was<00:05:15.640> a<00:05:15.670> momentum<00:05:16.060> thing<00:05:16.240> bride<00:05:16.420> yeah<00:05:17.170> I

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
it was a momentum thing bride yeah I

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.780 
it was a momentum thing bride yeah I
think<00:05:17.410> the<00:05:17.650> same<00:05:17.890> thing<00:05:18.100> I<00:05:18.220> was<00:05:18.370> worried<00:05:18.640> about

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
think the same thing I was worried about

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.370 
think the same thing I was worried about
this<00:05:19.000> from<00:05:19.150> the<00:05:19.270> from<00:05:19.570> the<00:05:19.660> time<00:05:19.870> we<00:05:19.990> mentor
