my boss who shot them a couple of days
ago<00:00:15.750> out<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:17.240> North<00:00:18.240> Alaska<00:00:19.220> somewhere<00:00:20.220> where

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
ago out in North Alaska somewhere where

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.660 
ago out in North Alaska somewhere where
it's<00:00:21.150> mostly<00:00:21.570> flat<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.109> boggy<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.340> he<00:00:23.490> just

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
it's mostly flat and boggy so he just

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.759 
it's mostly flat and boggy so he just
walks<00:00:23.910> around<00:00:24.090> with<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.539> shotgun<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.289> when

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
walks around with a shotgun and when

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.759 
walks around with a shotgun and when
they<00:00:25.890> fly<00:00:26.130> up<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.430> air<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.789> shoots<00:00:27.060> him<00:00:27.269> and

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
they fly up in the air is shoots him and

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.049 
they fly up in the air is shoots him and
and<00:00:28.769> it's<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.279> easy<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.789> guess<00:00:30.800> so<00:00:31.800> he<00:00:32.730> caught

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
and it's that easy I guess so he caught

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.080 
and it's that easy I guess so he caught
about<00:00:33.480> called<00:00:34.020> or<00:00:34.200> shot<00:00:34.469> about<00:00:34.920> 36<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.969> them

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
about called or shot about 36 of them

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.389 
about called or shot about 36 of them
and<00:00:36.600> he<00:00:36.690> had<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> couple<00:00:37.020> left<00:00:37.440> over<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.219> went

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399

so<00:01:10.950> he<00:01:11.220> had<00:01:11.460> them<00:01:11.670> hanging<00:01:12.090> up<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.479> shed<00:01:13.470> on

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
so he had them hanging up in shed on

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.060 
so he had them hanging up in shed on

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
apparently that's okay to do so one

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.469 
apparently that's okay to do so one
thing<00:01:19.770> i<00:01:19.890> was<00:01:20.009> thinking<00:01:20.119> that<00:01:21.119> might<00:01:21.330> be

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
thing i was thinking that might be

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.270 
thing i was thinking that might be
useful<00:01:21.689> if<00:01:22.200> i<00:01:22.320> were<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.530> get<00:01:22.680> lots<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.100> this

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
useful if i were to get lots of this

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.190 
useful if i were to get lots of this
look<00:01:23.549> at<00:01:23.640> all<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.880> down<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:24.659> get<00:01:24.900> from

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
look at all that down you can get from

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.410 
look at all that down you can get from
one<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.439> these<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.310> imagine<00:01:26.490> 30<00:01:26.939> some-odd

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
one of these can you imagine 30 some-odd

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.780 
one of these can you imagine 30 some-odd
of<00:01:27.869> these<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.439> would<00:01:28.619> be<00:01:28.740> some<00:01:29.369> really<00:01:29.640> nice

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
of these that would be some really nice

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.499 
of these that would be some really nice
pillows<00:01:31.070> so<00:01:32.070> what<00:01:32.460> he<00:01:32.610> does<00:01:32.820> or<00:01:33.180> what<00:01:33.450> he

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
pillows so what he does or what he

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.469 
pillows so what he does or what he
showed<00:01:33.840> me<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.920> take<00:01:35.150> around<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
showed me is that you take around the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.990 
showed me is that you take around the
breast<00:01:36.780> area<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:38.040> pinch<00:01:38.280> into<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.700> skin

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
breast area you just pinch into the skin

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.149 
breast area you just pinch into the skin
and<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.450> pull<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.810> apart<00:01:39.900> until<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.740> open

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
and you pull it apart until you open

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.910 
and you pull it apart until you open
where<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> skin<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.420> which<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.380> did<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
where the skin is which I just did and

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.800 
where the skin is which I just did and
you<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:44.460> see<00:01:44.640> through<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.060> feathers<00:01:45.450> into

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
you can see through the feathers into

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.670 
you can see through the feathers into
where<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.799> meat<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:48.590> essentially<00:01:49.590> what

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
where the meat is so essentially what

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.370 
where the meat is so essentially what
you<00:01:49.799> do<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.159> peel<00:01:50.610> back<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.880> skin

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
you do is you just peel back the skin

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.160 
you do is you just peel back the skin
around<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.649> meat

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
around the meat

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.080 
around the meat
and<00:01:54.799> right<00:01:55.130> there<00:01:55.340> you<00:01:55.430> can<00:01:55.580> see<00:01:55.610> where<00:01:55.939> it<00:01:56.000> was

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
and right there you can see where it was

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.170 
and right there you can see where it was
shot<00:01:56.330> right<00:01:56.950> here<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:58.490> it<00:01:58.729> looks<00:01:58.759> like<00:01:59.060> it

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
shot right here and it looks like it
