00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.830
 So for me the learning studio is the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.959
 perfect mix between the interest 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.420
 at the subject in my case french and 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.609
 history and dealing with people 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.890
 with two children and adolescents and 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.410
 I just want to see how that works 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.570
 Children develop talents 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.280
 simply promote and give them a space 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.250
 give oneself to unfold 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.860
 I had already during my school days 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.879
 did interest if I carryforwards 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.370
 I enjoyed that a lot 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.230
 both the preparation and when 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.239
 I then stood in front of the class and 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.609
 spoke and achieved something for him 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.780
 and after my high school graduation I have too 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.569
 not directly started studying 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.339
 but have tutoring in a language 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:50.010
 institute given in english 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.899
 So French already has one 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.909
 a little more experience collected too 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.659
 how can you learn good content 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.429
 convey 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.739
 Besides, my mom is too 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:00.120
 highschool teacher and there I was able to 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.579
 the high school also a bit 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.899
 help out more excursions and projects and 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.070
 that was a lot of fun for me too 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.680
 to join a group again 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.450
 work 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.909
 I think about an important requirement 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.229
 To study noise is that you really 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.759
 The interest in people has that one 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.530
 especially working in groups 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.240
 which come to one in both the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.820
 a fan in the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.950
 education science 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.509
 communication skills are needed 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.299
 to exchange with the others 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.829
 on the other hand, this pure interest 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.560
 so it's really important that 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.079
 you too full of tension to be on 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.210
 subject is also acted as self 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.119
 and even after that works and does research 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.700
 is very important what maybe 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.429
 a prerequisite would be that you have one 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.880
 certain degree of self-discipline hard and 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.850
 self-motivation to simply focus on the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.499
 well to prepare individual subjects and 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.100
 his schedules go well together 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:58.049
 put 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.609
 and as in every study subject 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.460
 probably also a degree 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:04.079
 perseverance because there are heights and everywhere 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.310
 Maybe they are too deep 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.450
 but beating it down a bit 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.090
 you should not rest 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.489
 let bring 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.340
 on the one hand the interest again 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.819
 People just because you are the whole 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.500
 Day with children together from early until 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.080
 usually at noon until the afternoon 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.910
 Man directs you to rate you one 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.860
 Sometimes it also criticizes them 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.900
 a lot of fortune is very important 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.750
 on the one hand , a degree 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.080
 self-organization and self-motivation 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.049
 because as a teacher, it is easy it is 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.150
 not only working from fries to noon 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.810
 then you have free you have to go before that 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.610
 and then still prepare for it 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.190
 and have to go there yourself too 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.410
 motivate and send that to an external one 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.209
 Do it a really sport now and that 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.640
 to do that to some extent 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.349
 I think that's important then too 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.030
 you have to be motivated 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.660
 Students can motivate you to do theirs 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.700
 fulfill tasks and guide them and 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.080
 that too with a certain measure 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.660
 creativity 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.250
 I do not have my studies 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.800
 Expects it to be such a high fan 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.180
 I had an intense history 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.320
 I've been asked that before because 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.510
 History is also in the school in 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.610
 they learn a lot and they do it a lot 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.230
 it's a bit like french 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.720
 Such a small stone first time so ins 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.370
 Before you look at it then you need to roll 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.600
 can really motivate and only 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.420
 times through the whole fabric and a 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.810
 bit but looks through enough 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.080
 You can do that with motivation 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.080
 overcome 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.920
 I especially like that 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.900
 combination of resp 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.110
 the combination of theory and practice 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.569
 especially by the tripartite division 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.340
 education science subjects and the 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.140
 subject didactics so where you special 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.420
 is prepared again for school 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.020
 you're on it from the beginning 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.569
 really targeted that you in front of the children 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.360
 occurs and that one directly in the school 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.340
 on the way you have a lot of practice 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.720
 Experiences during the study 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.750
 also collects when I am with others 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.000
 students and students of the 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.700
 other universities also noise 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.950
 I will speak again and again 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.109
 pointed out that it was at 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.530
 not so practical 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.630
 as we like in Leipzig leipzig 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.570
 I especially like the combination 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:29.020
 city ​​and nature with its lakes and 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.700
 parks and the magpie is for every type 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.440
 and every mood here is actually something 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.990
 and everyone finds his niche in it 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.930
 This city is also the link 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.280
 of tradition and modernity too 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.250
 at the university very very well reflected 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:47.669
 with the modern building at hub campus 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:49.360
 and the older albertina so the 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.100
 University Library very very nice 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.390
 and pleasant and you feel everywhere 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:58.200
 totally good my first school practical 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:01.810
 experience was a four-week internship 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.729
 while studying that actually has 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.360
 in principle, my studies only complete 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:09.400
 thus confirms man could only times 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.570
 take a look behind the scenes 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.140
 hold 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.970
 What happens in the teacher's room? 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.430
 what are the teachers talking about so we are very 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.260
 very exciting to that too 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.520
 keep your own lesson sequences 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.100
 was allowed or whole lessons 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.530
 even the preparation has a lot 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.300
 has also made a lot of fun 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.000
 creativity really involves the 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.500
 to inspire children for this topic and 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.100
 your enthusiasm a bit too 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.789
 to find it or here too easy 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.919
 promote 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:40.330
 to another is me too 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.479
 noticed that the classes are very 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.100
 heterogeneous are that there are many 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.400
 different spirits in one 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.650
 class and therefore the teacher 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.900
 really not only teaches but also 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.950
 a kind of consultant problem is and also 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:59.410
 Educator simply is a typical one 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.960
 this might be the wrong idea 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:05.430
 future highschool teachers also only with 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.970
 ambitious and hard-working students 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.550
 have contact 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.750
 that is in my opinion such a 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.120
 Bit wrong because you really have 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.380
 a very very broad spectrum of one 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.840
 age group sitting in front of you 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:20.200
 from the fifth to the twelfth grade 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.150
 It is not that easy on everyone 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.220
 different as you with each and 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.350
 Above all, the age bypasses the 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:30.190
 puberty which simply flows into it 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.930
 he also has his problems to a 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.610
 then kept saying as a teacher 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.730
 What you really get along with 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.530
 must be with you as a teacher and also as a teacher 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.360
 Noise is not just studying there 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.730
 busy with how I bring 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.890
 Something for somebody but also how to solve 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.020
 I am in conflict with children 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.670
 How do they really learn how? 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.050
 to get them to learn and to 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:53.370
 motivate and that's what I like 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:56.490
 exciting and very very colorful studying 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.750
 exactly one advice I each 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.920
 interested in studying and 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.960
 study would give novice with during 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.380
 the interested or first semester 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.180
 groups on facebook my case would be 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.570
 that are now interested in learning 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:13.120
 group and there are older students 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.810
 but also always warmly students 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.970
 welcome 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.110
 there will be about the study 

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.450
 exchanged it will ask 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.890
 answered and thus a super source 

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.270
 and we are always a helping hand 

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.270
 for everyone in there
