00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
may live inside the home but if you do

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
careful because if you feed a sugar ant

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.819 
careful because if you feed a sugar ant
a<00:00:37.730> bait<00:00:38.730> or<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.090> pesticide<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.500> a

what<00:00:43.320> you're<00:00:43.440> going<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.680> do<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.920> you're<00:00:44.040> going

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
what you're going to do is you're going

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.920 
what you're going to do is you're going
to<00:00:44.190> break<00:00:44.399> up<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> colony<00:00:45.090> inside<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.750> home

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
to break up the colony inside the home

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.660 
to break up the colony inside the home
and<00:00:46.170> that's<00:00:46.500> something<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:47.039> don't<00:00:47.160> want<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.520> do

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
and that's something we don't want to do

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.520 
and that's something we don't want to do
we<00:00:48.239> would<00:00:48.420> rather<00:00:48.570> use<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.989> what<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.320> call<00:00:49.350> a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
we would rather use a what we call a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.220 
we would rather use a what we call a
slow-acting<00:00:50.280> bait<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.449> will<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
slow-acting bait that will that the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.529 
slow-acting bait that will that the

around the outside of the cabinet and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.260 
around the outside of the cabinet and
when<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.750> ants<00:01:19.110> find<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.979> product<00:01:20.939> inside

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
when the ants find this product inside

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.420 
when the ants find this product inside
there<00:01:21.600> they<00:01:22.049> will<00:01:22.229> feed<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:22.860> then<00:01:23.189> take

there they will feed on it and then take

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.609 
there they will feed on it and then take
that<00:01:23.610> back<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> county<00:01:24.540> what's<00:01:25.170> important

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
that back to the county what's important

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.260 
that back to the county what's important
about<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.310> when<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.640> takes<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.970> back<00:01:27.090> to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
about that is when it takes it back to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.270 
about that is when it takes it back to
the<00:01:27.360> colony<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.170> other<00:01:28.350> ants<00:01:28.770> will<00:01:28.979> actually

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
the colony the other ants will actually

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.280 
the colony the other ants will actually
come<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.520> contact<00:01:29.549> with<00:01:30.450> different<00:01:30.689> ants<00:01:31.140> and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
come in contact with different ants and

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.319 
come in contact with different ants and
they<00:01:31.650> will<00:01:31.799> feed<00:01:31.979> each<00:01:32.130> other<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.520> product

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
they will feed each other this product

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.140 
they will feed each other this product
and<00:01:33.509> then<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.049> whole<00:01:34.229> colony<00:01:34.710> will<00:01:34.979> die<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.460> lot

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
and then the whole colony will die a lot

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.630 
and then the whole colony will die a lot
of<00:01:36.299> our<00:01:36.420> fast-acting<00:01:37.400> insecticides<00:01:38.400> that
