00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
good with a text speed as well so for

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.980 
good with a text speed as well so for
people<00:01:29.100> like<00:01:29.310> ooh<00:01:29.610> dear<00:01:29.880> Warwick<00:01:30.360> Master<00:01:30.840> Yi

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
people like ooh dear Warwick Master Yi

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.240 
people like ooh dear Warwick Master Yi
and<00:01:31.259> I'm<00:01:31.380> going<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.530> come<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.070> little

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
and I'm going to come on to that little

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.580 
and I'm going to come on to that little
bit<00:01:32.490> later<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.659> third<00:01:33.900> one<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.200> stalkers

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
bit later the third one is stalkers

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.109 
bit later the third one is stalkers
blade<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.430> other<00:01:35.579> one<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.090> you

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
blade and this is the other one that you

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.420 
blade and this is the other one that you
can<00:01:36.299> smite<00:01:36.600> champions<00:01:37.140> with<00:01:37.380> as<00:01:37.619> opposed<00:01:38.250> to

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
can smite champions with as opposed to

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.190 
can smite champions with as opposed to
the<00:01:38.549> saber<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.329> actually<00:01:39.509> deals<00:01:39.869> two<00:01:40.170> damage

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the saber this actually deals two damage

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.350 
the saber this actually deals two damage
as<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> nuke<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.280> then<00:01:41.520> reduces<00:01:41.970> movement

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
as a nuke and then reduces movement

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.300 
as a nuke and then reduces movement
speed<00:01:42.570> by<00:01:42.720> fifty<00:01:42.780> percent<00:01:43.259> for<00:01:43.619> two<00:01:43.799> seconds

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
speed by fifty percent for two seconds

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.100 
speed by fifty percent for two seconds
this<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.060> probably<00:01:45.329> better<00:01:45.540> for<00:01:45.689> heavy

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
this is probably better for heavy

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.990 
this is probably better for heavy
gankers<00:01:46.680> who<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:47.130> want<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.369> fight<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.640> lot<00:01:47.970> and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
gankers who just want to fight a lot and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.030 
gankers who just want to fight a lot and
have<00:01:48.270> burst<00:01:48.570> damage<00:01:48.840> or<00:01:49.259> just<00:01:49.710> don't<00:01:49.890> really

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
have burst damage or just don't really

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.770 
have burst damage or just don't really
have<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> gap<00:01:50.670> closed<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.149> naturally<00:01:51.570> so

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
have a gap closed and naturally so

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.050 
have a gap closed and naturally so
people<00:01:52.049> like<00:01:52.079> Kazakhs<00:01:52.829> lead<00:01:53.100> java<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.670> ringo

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
people like Kazakhs lead java and ringo

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.999 
people like Kazakhs lead java and ringo
that<00:01:54.329> can<00:01:54.509> welcome<00:01:54.689> them<00:01:54.990> as<00:01:55.140> well<00:01:55.320> now<00:01:55.950> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
that can welcome them as well now the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.770 
that can welcome them as well now the
final<00:01:56.460> one<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.969> reason<00:01:57.360> I've<00:01:57.450> left<00:01:57.630> this

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
final one and the reason I've left this

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.539 
final one and the reason I've left this
to<00:01:57.990> last<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.560> because<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.890> think<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.430> the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
to last is because I think this is the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.980 
to last is because I think this is the
best<00:01:59.850> one<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.270> I'll<00:02:00.390> come<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.689> sat<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
best one and I'll come on sat in a

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.590 
best one and I'll come on sat in a
second<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.619> Rangers<00:02:02.280> trailblazer<00:02:02.880> so

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
second is the Rangers trailblazer so

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.330 
second is the Rangers trailblazer so
reduces<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> cooldown<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.710> you're<00:02:04.920> smart

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
reduces the cooldown of you're smart

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.730 
reduces the cooldown of you're smart
you're<00:02:05.670> smart<00:02:06.119> becomes<00:02:06.420> AoE<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.140> stuns<00:02:07.469> for

you're smart becomes AoE and stuns for

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.889 
you're smart becomes AoE and stuns for
one<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.069> half<00:02:08.099> seconds<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.090> also<00:02:09.330> restores

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
one and a half seconds it also restores

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.600 
one and a half seconds it also restores
fifteen<00:02:10.319> percent<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.860> your<00:02:10.950> missing<00:02:11.370> health

this<00:02:12.780> helps<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.200> clear<00:02:13.560> faster<00:02:14.069> but<00:02:14.250> it's<00:02:14.370> a

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
this helps you clear faster but it's a

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.550 
this helps you clear faster but it's a
sustained<00:02:14.940> that's<00:02:15.210> really<00:02:15.690> big<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.170> it's<00:02:16.410> not

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
sustained that's really big and it's not

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.680 
sustained that's really big and it's not
just<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.980> sustained<00:02:17.459> it's<00:02:17.850> that<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.450> actually

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
just a sustained it's that you actually

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.360 
just a sustained it's that you actually
stunned<00:02:19.110> them<00:02:19.290> for<00:02:19.319> one<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.709> half<00:02:19.740> seconds

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
stunned them for one and a half seconds

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.460 
stunned them for one and a half seconds
right<00:02:20.520> so<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:21.000> is<00:02:21.209> kind<00:02:21.630> of<00:02:21.810> giving<00:02:21.990> you<00:02:22.260> more

let's<00:03:57.930> talk<00:03:58.019> about<00:03:58.079> juggernaut<00:03:58.650> very<00:03:58.829> quickly

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
let's talk about juggernaut very quickly

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.680 
let's talk about juggernaut very quickly
because<00:03:59.340> it's<00:03:59.610> not<00:03:59.760> really<00:04:00.000> used<00:04:00.269> right<00:04:00.510> now

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
because it's not really used right now

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.180 
because it's not really used right now
but<00:04:00.870> it's<00:04:01.019> actually<00:04:01.380> pretty<00:04:01.620> good<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.070> it's

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
but it's actually pretty good and it's

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.430 
but it's actually pretty good and it's
pretty<00:04:02.489> flexible<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.299> anyone<00:04:04.049> looking<00:04:04.200> at

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
pretty flexible to anyone looking at

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.750 
pretty flexible to anyone looking at
this<00:04:04.530> can<00:04:04.739> obviously<00:04:04.799> tell<00:04:05.250> it's<00:04:05.489> built<00:04:05.700> for

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
this can obviously tell it's built for

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.670 
this can obviously tell it's built for
tanks<00:04:06.209> but<00:04:06.390> what<00:04:06.600> happens<00:04:06.930> if<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.140> get<00:04:07.290> behind

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680
