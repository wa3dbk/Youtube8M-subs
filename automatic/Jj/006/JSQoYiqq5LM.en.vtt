00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.440 
we've got it in Canada and now I know
remember<00:00:34.140> ever<00:00:34.260> seen<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.559> as<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> kid<00:00:35.100> but<00:00:35.880> as

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
remember ever seen this as a kid but as

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.790 
remember ever seen this as a kid but as
not<00:00:36.840> all-time<00:00:37.110> seen<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.410> around<00:00:37.559> for

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
not all-time seen it around for

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.850 
not all-time seen it around for
certainly<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.579> few<00:00:38.820> years<00:00:39.440> Cadbury<00:00:40.440> flake<00:00:40.649> bar

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
certainly a few years Cadbury flake bar

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.940 
certainly a few years Cadbury flake bar
though<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.160> interesting<00:00:41.730> it's<00:00:42.120> um<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:43.469> milk

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
though is interesting it's um it's milk

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.819 
though is interesting it's um it's milk
chocolate<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:44.960> folded<00:00:45.960> milk<00:00:46.260> chocolate

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
chocolate but it's folded milk chocolate

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.619 
chocolate but it's folded milk chocolate
so<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.219> one<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.460> those<00:00:47.610> like<00:00:47.850> kind<00:00:48.570> of

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
so this is one of those like kind of

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.720 
so this is one of those like kind of
straight<00:00:48.930> Cadbury<00:00:49.379> milk<00:00:49.649> chocolate<00:00:50.039> bars<00:00:50.219> but

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
straight Cadbury milk chocolate bars but

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.850 
straight Cadbury milk chocolate bars but
then<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:51.899> about<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:52.559> about<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
then it's it's about it's about a

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.799 
then it's it's about it's about a
textured<00:00:53.520> sort<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.850> experience<00:00:54.300> kind<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.629> like

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
textured sort of experience kind of like

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.740 
textured sort of experience kind of like
with<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.199> Aero<00:00:55.379> bar<00:00:55.969> it's<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.420> know<00:00:57.449> it's

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
with the Aero bar it's a you know it's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.049 
with the Aero bar it's a you know it's
all<00:00:58.079> about<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.859> way<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.489> bar<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.850> put

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
all about the way the bar is put

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.330 
all about the way the bar is put
together<00:01:00.149> or<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.809> Cadbury<00:01:01.559> whispah<00:01:02.070> bar<00:01:02.309> I

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
together or the Cadbury whispah bar I

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.889 
together or the Cadbury whispah bar I
guess<00:01:02.670> would<00:01:02.850> be<00:01:02.969> another<00:01:03.149> good<00:01:03.420> example<00:01:03.449> of

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
guess would be another good example of

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:04.310 
guess would be another good example of
that

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
that

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.390 
that
so<00:01:06.140> it's<00:01:07.140> folded<00:01:07.710> chocolate<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.250> think

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
so it's folded chocolate and I think

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.190 
so it's folded chocolate and I think
once<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:08.640> get<00:01:08.729> into<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.119> we'll<00:01:09.330> we'll<00:01:09.930> see<00:01:09.960> what

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
once we get into it we'll we'll see what

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.609 
once we get into it we'll we'll see what
that's<00:01:10.290> about

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
that's about

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.550 
that's about
now<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.220> swear<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.210> did<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> review<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.020> some<00:01:13.260> other

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
like a dog shriek or something you can

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.110 
like a dog shriek or something you can
already<00:03:48.640> kind<00:03:48.940> of<00:03:49.090> see<00:03:50.610> there<00:03:51.610> you<00:03:51.700> go<00:03:51.820> you<00:03:51.910> can

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
already kind of see there you go you can

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.750 
already kind of see there you go you can
see<00:03:52.360> those<00:03:52.600> folds<00:03:53.110> though<00:03:53.320> you<00:03:54.310> see<00:03:54.459> how<00:03:54.580> that

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
see those folds though you see how that

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.420 
see those folds though you see how that
isn't<00:03:55.060> it<00:03:55.180> isn't<00:03:55.390> that<00:03:55.570> wild<00:03:55.840> man<00:03:56.320> like<00:03:57.250> look

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
isn't it isn't that wild man like look

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.360 
isn't it isn't that wild man like look
at<00:03:57.550> that<00:03:57.959> like<00:03:58.959> unlike<00:03:59.350> an<00:03:59.560> aero<00:03:59.830> bar<00:04:00.130> or<00:04:00.310> a

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
at that like unlike an aero bar or a

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.040 
at that like unlike an aero bar or a
whisper<00:04:00.610> bar<00:04:00.970> that<00:04:01.150> has<00:04:01.270> the<00:04:01.420> bubbles<00:04:01.660> in<00:04:02.020> it

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
whisper bar that has the bubbles in it

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.840 
whisper bar that has the bubbles in it
they're<00:04:02.350> aerated<00:04:02.890> bubbles<00:04:03.190> in<00:04:03.250> it<00:04:03.340> this<00:04:03.790> is

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
they're aerated bubbles in it this is

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.030 
they're aerated bubbles in it this is
just<00:04:04.239> folded<00:04:04.959> chocolate<00:04:05.380> so<00:04:05.709> I<00:04:05.739> think<00:04:05.830> it's

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
just folded chocolate so I think it's

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.020 
just folded chocolate so I think it's
gonna<00:04:06.160> give<00:04:06.370> me<00:04:06.520> that<00:04:06.670> same<00:04:06.880> sort<00:04:07.150> of<00:04:07.209> effect

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
gonna give me that same sort of effect

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.400 
gonna give me that same sort of effect
maybe<00:04:10.030> with<00:04:10.269> a<00:04:10.300> bit<00:04:10.510> more<00:04:10.540> crumble<00:04:11.170> which<00:04:11.290> I

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
maybe with a bit more crumble which I

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.750 
maybe with a bit more crumble which I
guess<00:04:11.560> is<00:04:11.709> sort<00:04:11.830> of<00:04:11.920> what<00:04:12.070> they<00:04:12.220> go<00:04:12.400> for<00:04:12.430> or

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
guess is sort of what they go for or

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.680 
guess is sort of what they go for or
flake<00:04:13.180> as<00:04:13.480> they<00:04:13.840> say<00:04:15.419> but<00:04:16.419> but<00:04:17.109> it's<00:04:17.260> about<00:04:18.690> you

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
flake as they say but but it's about you

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.240 
flake as they say but but it's about you
know<00:04:19.780> it's<00:04:19.959> about<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.230> sort<00:04:20.620> of<00:04:20.680> textured

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
know it's about the sort of textured

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.040 
know it's about the sort of textured
experience<00:04:21.850> let's<00:04:22.360> give<00:04:22.479> it<00:04:22.510> a<00:04:22.630> try<00:04:22.750> and<00:04:22.900> see

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
experience let's give it a try and see

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.369 
experience let's give it a try and see
what<00:04:23.140> we<00:04:23.260> think

00:04:26.369 --> 00:04:26.379 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:31.390 

hmm<00:04:27.379> oh<00:04:30.159> yeah

the best Cadbury chocolate because it's

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.360 
the best Cadbury chocolate because it's
clearly<00:04:43.009> not<00:04:43.180> it<00:04:44.180> actually<00:04:44.449> tastes<00:04:44.689> a<00:04:44.719> little

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
definitely is flaky but feels like this

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.499 
definitely is flaky but feels like this
bar<00:04:57.770> could<00:04:57.949> be<00:04:57.979> moister<00:04:58.490> or<00:04:59.180> maybe<00:04:59.330> I<00:04:59.389> should

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
bar could be moister or maybe I should

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.170 
bar could be moister or maybe I should
just<00:04:59.719> be<00:04:59.870> eating<00:05:00.439> it<00:05:00.710> with<00:05:00.830> like<00:05:01.090> having<00:05:02.090> a

it's one of those kind of those kind of
experiences<00:05:06.500> I<00:05:06.620> think<00:05:07.719> still<00:05:08.719> the<00:05:11.349> that<00:05:12.349> that

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
experiences I think still the that that

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.350 
experiences I think still the that that
texture<00:05:13.340> that<00:05:14.319> that<00:05:15.319> texture<00:05:15.770> of<00:05:15.889> your<00:05:15.949> bite

texture that that texture of your bite

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.719 
texture that that texture of your bite
you<00:05:17.360> definitely<00:05:17.930> get<00:05:18.110> the<00:05:18.800> the<00:05:19.219> lightness<00:05:19.699> to

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
you definitely get the the lightness to

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.839 
you definitely get the the lightness to
it<00:05:19.969> because<00:05:20.659> of<00:05:20.689> those<00:05:20.990> of<00:05:21.529> the<00:05:21.710> way<00:05:21.830> that<00:05:22.069> the

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
it because of those of the way that the

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:25.450 
it because of those of the way that the
chocolate<00:05:23.300> is<00:05:23.539> structured<00:05:24.020> that<00:05:24.460> certainly

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
chocolate is structured that certainly

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.200 
chocolate is structured that certainly
comes<00:05:25.639> through<00:05:27.009> if<00:05:28.009> you're<00:05:28.669> looking<00:05:29.029> for<00:05:29.150> that

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
comes through if you're looking for that

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.240 
comes through if you're looking for that
kind<00:05:29.270> of<00:05:29.449> experience<00:05:29.870> though<00:05:30.199> what's<00:05:31.039> better

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
kind of experience though what's better

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.339 
kind of experience though what's better
get<00:05:31.580> something<00:05:31.819> like<00:05:31.940> this<00:05:32.089> or<00:05:32.389> a<00:05:32.449> whisper<00:05:33.020> or

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:33.349 
get something like this or a whisper or

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:37.499 
get something like this or a whisper or
an<00:05:33.650> arrow<00:05:33.949> I<00:05:34.310> guess<00:05:34.759> we<00:05:34.909> want<00:05:35.089> to<00:05:35.150> go<00:05:35.210> Nestle<00:05:35.629> I

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:37.509 
an arrow I guess we want to go Nestle I

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:40.510 
an arrow I guess we want to go Nestle I
don't<00:05:38.509> know<00:05:38.569> I<00:05:38.750> think<00:05:38.870> that<00:05:39.560> I<00:05:39.589> probably<00:05:40.009> would

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
don't know I think that I probably would

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.510 
don't know I think that I probably would
still<00:05:40.819> go<00:05:41.629> with<00:05:41.659> an<00:05:41.930> arrow<00:05:42.169> bar<00:05:42.500> which<00:05:43.219> is<00:05:43.250> one

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
still go with an arrow bar which is one

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.700 
still go with an arrow bar which is one
of<00:05:43.669> you<00:05:44.210> know<00:05:44.300> Nestle's<00:05:44.659> best<00:05:44.900> bars<00:05:47.379> whispah<00:05:48.379> I

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.879 
am not as familiar with but I know you
know<00:05:50.870> it's<00:05:51.409> it's<00:05:51.919> alright<00:05:52.219> but<00:05:53.589> in<00:05:54.589> terms<00:05:54.800> of

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
know it's it's alright but in terms of

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.219 
know it's it's alright but in terms of
like<00:05:55.069> just<00:05:55.279> a<00:05:55.370> textured<00:05:55.879> experience<00:05:56.509> of<00:05:56.810> just

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
like just a textured experience of just

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:01.140 
like just a textured experience of just
straight<00:05:57.379> milk<00:05:57.620> chocolate<00:05:58.900> this<00:05:59.900> is<00:06:00.110> okay

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
straight milk chocolate this is okay

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.399 
straight milk chocolate this is okay
but<00:06:02.150> it<00:06:02.539> I<00:06:04.750> don't<00:06:05.750> think<00:06:05.870> it's<00:06:05.960> as<00:06:06.080> good<00:06:06.199> as<00:06:06.319> the

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.409 
but it I don't think it's as good as the

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:07.390 
but it I don't think it's as good as the
other<00:06:06.529> stuff<00:06:06.710> that's<00:06:06.919> out<00:06:07.039> there

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400

rather<00:06:54.020> I<00:06:54.290> Paul<00:06:54.560> I<00:06:54.650> probably<00:06:54.980> get<00:06:55.070> a<00:06:55.100> narrow
