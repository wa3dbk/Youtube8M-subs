00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
see my room is a disaster area that will

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.770 
see my room is a disaster area that will
be<00:00:43.110> my<00:00:43.290> bed<00:00:43.559> area<00:00:43.980> over<00:00:44.670> there<00:00:44.910> because<00:00:45.629> I

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
be my bed area over there because I

don't plan to have bed because well that
would<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:49.230> be<00:00:49.260> impractical<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.190> not<00:00:51.149> that

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
would just be impractical and not that

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.240
