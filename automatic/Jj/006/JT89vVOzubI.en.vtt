00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.240
 heyo k welcome 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.730
 we wanted to know a little something 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.560
 then watch over accessories there are 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.930
 namely different accessories his job 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.930
 Namely, we started from space 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.430
 shock places thin and predominantly 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.779
 but rubber can also be made of plastic 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.029
 then they are a bit harder 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.250
 backwards, the task has bumps 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.199
 intercept and in the share area the 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.789
 whole up to spare when you step 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.559
 jump or a little more force 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:39.280
 row house then breaks that covers too 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.159
 not so fast 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.229
 Do you already have a bit wider 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:45.819
 like here, for example, 38 inches 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:48.690
 Patient already speaks of traveler 

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:51.190
 petz traveler pads are so very thick and 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.530
 So the gap between roles is rising 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.030
 and a deck are a bit too 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.289
 higher and thus the danger of 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.059
 wilbers very low 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.339
 even with the little ones that is natural 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.199
 also given but what are we far is 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.540
 the contact between when a contact 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.340
 does not roll well with the way well 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.350
 you fall immediately and that too 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.870
 they are actually pretty good 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.180
 very high but you do not have to watch 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.890
 say too high and not high-rise 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.680
 me now because then it is one 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.450
 stand too much angled if you 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.520
 so do the two breasts with the 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.250
 Others you are still on the board and 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.020
 therefore been careful always has one 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.510
 offer shock pads or white petz 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.210
 angle drehna several you see rainer 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.410
 Angle also called none 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.600
 you can handle the steering very well 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.390
 affect once forward 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.050
 It is very long happy to the rear 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.000
 directed keiler pads are doing the 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.500
 left behave very sluggish that simple 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.180
 you have to try it yourself screwed 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.980
 just once and so once 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.990
 the other way and then you know exactly what 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.220
 I mean 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.170
 for me some always ask me something 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.720
 what are you using for shops so me 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.880
 uses no shops I go 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.350
 just my board as it is for the 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.050
 beginner and maybe good too 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.510
 mention at the shop petz all the higher 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.000
 Of course, the higher the board is 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.110
 of course an ollie theoretically 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.970
 because that's deck erected steep 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.230
 but only theoretically you would have to well 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.000
 but it's not just the shop page 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.050
 my friends have fun 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.050
 I hope I could help you
