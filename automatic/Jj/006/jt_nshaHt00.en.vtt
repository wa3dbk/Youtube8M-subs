00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 something came up a detail that in the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.629
 Newest review of the blood of the 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.760
 books and a little joke and from there 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.380
 people started to insist and insist 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.790
 that I ask you one thing in which 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.580
 I 'm kidding so I have to start with 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.190
 there how do you drink coffee as I drink 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.350
 the coffee for many years 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.050
 I'm decaffeinated hypertensive 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.730
 that it does not make much sense to take a 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.660
 medication to lower the tension by 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.660
 the morning and have a coffee 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.080
 but that bothered me quite a question 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:38.410
 with life you have to negotiate in the 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:41.890
 morning with milk the coffee and me 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.470
 he liked to take several coffees a good day 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.809
 yes from quite young if in the 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:51.000
 university and in the university always 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.000
 with a touch of rum 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.079
 and another one of the Irish 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.059
 university students that is revealed I have a 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.100
 friend that we take our good 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.300
 Irish cafes in a place that 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.170
 unfortunately I have locked in my 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.170
 city a shame 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.330
 for a vacation in venice 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.990
 whatsapp with photos of my novels italy 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.960
 always is 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.940
 exciting to be read 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.710
 the more people because man always 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.360
 topics excites you more gratifies you to 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.479
 substantiate how often you have to 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.550
 sign books at the university yes yes yes 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.729
 In fact, usually enough people come 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.619
 what is structured is that you usually 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.659
 ask to be left in the concierge and I 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.030
 as every Monday when I go before 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.500
 the classes I feel a moment of the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.860
 books that handle consequence the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.860
 I sign 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.040
 I have a big bombardment of information 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.619
 that is, he threatened to even make a 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.179
 third of this does not come forward I'm 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.429
 thinking that it is from forgotten writers 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.289
 of writers that I think are very 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.869
 good but that people 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.690
 they are unknown then over there 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.300
 swimming around thinking about how to work 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.760
 there I remember for example when I 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.470
 he explained romantic literature and a 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.860
 student told me but you do not know 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.760
 that there is a heavy metal version 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.500
 of this poem by coleridge and I do not 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.180
 I knew and I looked for it 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.730
 and I discovered that it is true that iron maiden 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.890
 had has a brutal version of 15 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.750
 minutes from radiations at sea in the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.150
 that is thunderous 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.250
 well I liked it so much now when 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.860
 begins literature of the 19th century 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.250
 English turned off the lights and I put 15 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.250
 minutes 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.350
 they stay pretty hallucinated yes clear 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.610
 but it's very good because they 've drugged it 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.650
 and it gives you to jump to talk about 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.880
 heavy metal and because the singers 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.390
 of heavy metal the heavy groups that 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.030
 they always look 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.010
 usually epic themes themes 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.459
 mysterious for their songs there are only 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.709
 that see also their covers 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.540
 in romantic poetry there's a lot of this 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.180
 then then you think about it coldly 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.190
 have it natural that the two have 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.660
 found in these two phenomena but 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.740
 if this came to me a method 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.320
 suggested a student then the 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.180
 I investigated and found more authors of 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.220
 'holy land' a Spanish group has 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.350
 a beautiful song a version of the 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.120
 espronceda pirate song with 100 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.370
 cannons by wind band in stern to all 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.110
 sail us south to the sea ​​but huayllani 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.760
 brigantine sailboat I do not know if it is a poem 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.660
 that here is very well known in Spain is a 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.280
 poem that is memorized in class 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.540
 the boys of penn from small the 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.910
 holy land that is a group of heavy 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.110
 Spanish metal has a heavy version 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.989
 of that song and also that it's very 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.430
 well this is what I understand that the 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.000
 teaching mostly at the level 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.850
 academic 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.760
 is in some way bidirectional is 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.590
 logical that the teacher though 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.300
 just for reasons of age because it has 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.040
 had more time to read more things and 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.710
 he has also had more experiences 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.200
 vital and it's normal to have more things 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.440
 to explain but it is no less true that 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.450
 young people from 18 to 22 years old very 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.209
 wake up that you are very much 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.590
 interested if you give them confidence you 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.120
 they make comments and they make you 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.950
 very relevant contributions of those 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.209
 you can learn constantly and those 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.650
 they are the classes that are most enjoyed 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.690
 when the teacher is willing to 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.910
 It goes on two sides and in those that 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.280
 you learn I think yes I think this 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.770
 it is fostered and a very 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.150
 nice in class and in general 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.070
 we had a good time at what time 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.840
 of the day you like to write more you know how 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.820
 same and not necessarily good I do not know if 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.770
 you're from the authors of crushed me here 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.990
 I wanted to go to work it crushed me that 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.540
 edit what I wrote last night I do that 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.750
 he ended up having to do that because 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.280
 final you have no choice but to 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.650
 life that accept how it comes not and 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.930
 so if I have less time there is 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.920
 use any time I write in 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.050
 the subway I write in 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.600
 in the commuter train that takes me from 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.730
 jobim or like 40 km from university and 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.520
 every day I take the train and write in 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.960
 the train I write on trains in Spain 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.420
 with many conferences I just move in 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.340
 train even on planes in the 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.320
 airports on all floors time
