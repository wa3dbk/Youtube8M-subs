00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:11.079
 the great demand of the herd earns it 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.880
 hello how about friends I bring you a new 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.550
 video in en 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.779
 well it's nothing, it 's just a 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:27.949
 bit of video a clip to get 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:31.730
 record the other day and it's to teach you 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:35.540
 in aerial superiority what 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.870
 an airplane goes into a lost auger 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.820
 and it stays static in the air, not what 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.350
 you see everything for lost because you can 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.110
 recover now in the video you are going to 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.550
 see are shooting or got 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.969
 Dodge the rockets 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.690
 They are giving me going and here looks like 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:59.600
 they have left me with half a life 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.540
 today upward 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.620
 today upward 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.210
 an airplane goes lost 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:12.450
 it is repairing little by little 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.500
 come on let's go come on come on come on 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.780
 we go 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.310
 come that you can with the engines 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.790
 butt thrusters 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.250
 Let's see if we can recover it 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:29.340
 watching the map little by little 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.260
 it seems that the plane is already recovering 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:37.550
 little mobility let's go let's go 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.550
 come on come on come strong give it strong 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.280
 you can you can recover 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.820
 we go and we have already recovered the 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.260
 controls of the day we are at a hundred 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.260
 one hundred recovered 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.970
 so let's go to the load let's see if 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.410
 we load in someone we go fixing 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:07.340
 fixing the two rockets and pumba a low 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.130
 well this is so you do not see because I've 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.240
 read when the plane goes into auger 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.240
 but that you liked a greeting
