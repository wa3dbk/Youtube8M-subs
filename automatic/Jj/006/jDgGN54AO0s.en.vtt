00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
of this machine and so we decided to

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.740 
of this machine and so we decided to
stay<00:01:46.250> with<00:01:46.369> that<00:01:46.430> so<00:01:46.820> we<00:01:46.939> traded<00:01:47.270> a<00:01:47.299> fairly<00:01:47.630> new

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
stay with that so we traded a fairly new

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:48.690 
stay with that so we traded a fairly new
machine<00:01:48.079> in

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
machine in

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.230 
machine in
but<00:01:49.060> we<00:01:49.659> just<00:01:49.810> updated<00:01:50.229> it<00:01:50.439> a<00:01:50.530> little<00:01:50.770> bit<00:01:50.920> and

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240

just<00:01:55.899> so<00:01:56.110> ecstatic<00:01:56.469> about<00:01:56.770> what's<00:01:57.369> happening

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
just so ecstatic about what's happening

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.160 
just so ecstatic about what's happening
now<00:01:57.969> with<00:01:58.000> this<00:01:58.240> new<00:01:58.420> machine<00:01:58.600> but<00:01:59.049> we're

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
now with this new machine but we're

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.810 
now with this new machine but we're
making<00:01:59.320> more<00:01:59.590> melt<00:01:59.829> because<00:02:00.039> of<00:02:00.340> it<00:02:00.460> it's<00:02:00.640> just

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
making more melt because of it it's just

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.020 
making more melt because of it it's just
a<00:02:00.939> good<00:02:01.149> deal<00:02:04.740> we<00:02:05.740> run<00:02:05.890> long<00:02:06.100> hours<00:02:06.490> here<00:02:06.789> and

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
a good deal we run long hours here and

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.120 
a good deal we run long hours here and
so<00:02:07.390> we<00:02:07.509> need<00:02:07.659> the<00:02:07.750> service<00:02:08.080> at<00:02:08.229> odd<00:02:08.349> times<00:02:08.380> and

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
so we need the service at odd times and

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.919 
so we need the service at odd times and
it<00:02:09.729> don't<00:02:09.940> seem<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.119> matter<00:02:10.330> when<00:02:10.539> we<00:02:10.690> call

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
it don't seem to matter when we call

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.690 
it don't seem to matter when we call

somebody's gonna be here to make sure

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.300 
somebody's gonna be here to make sure
that<00:02:20.560> we're<00:02:20.709> up<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:20.980> running

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
that we're up and running

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.070 
that we're up and running
he<00:02:21.640> works<00:02:21.819> with<00:02:21.940> our<00:02:22.120> service<00:02:22.480> staff<00:02:22.690> quite<00:02:23.019> a

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
he works with our service staff quite a

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.509 
he works with our service staff quite a
bit<00:02:23.319> as<00:02:23.470> far<00:02:23.650> as<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.950> maintenance<00:02:24.220> on<00:02:24.400> their

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
bit as far as the maintenance on their

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.180 
bit as far as the maintenance on their
equipment<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.120> minimize<00:02:25.930> our<00:02:26.080> downtime<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:27.160> I

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
equipment and minimize our downtime so I

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.410 
equipment and minimize our downtime so I
think<00:02:27.310> we<00:02:27.519> do<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.640> good<00:02:27.760> job<00:02:27.819> with<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.150> with

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
think we do a good job with that with

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.569 
think we do a good job with that with
Keith<00:02:28.599> when<00:02:29.110> we<00:02:29.170> started<00:02:29.470> out<00:02:29.560> my<00:02:29.709> father<00:02:29.980> was

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.160 
Keith when we started out my father was
running<00:02:30.819> a<00:02:30.880> dealership<00:02:31.299> and<00:02:31.420> he<00:02:31.510> was<00:02:31.630> selling

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
running a dealership and he was selling

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.350 
running a dealership and he was selling
equipment<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.530> Keith<00:02:32.739> when<00:02:33.459> my<00:02:33.549> father<00:02:33.819> exited

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
equipment to Keith when my father exited

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.080 
equipment to Keith when my father exited
and<00:02:34.510> then<00:02:35.380> Keith<00:02:35.709> kind<00:02:35.950> of<00:02:36.040> moved<00:02:36.190> in<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.940> my

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
and then Keith kind of moved in to my

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.210 
and then Keith kind of moved in to my
office<00:02:37.269> to<00:02:37.989> buy<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.170> equipment<00:02:38.709> we<00:02:39.040> worked

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
office to buy the equipment we worked

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.339 
office to buy the equipment we worked
pretty<00:02:39.280> closely<00:02:39.459> together<00:02:40.170> Keith's<00:02:41.170> father

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
pretty closely together Keith's father

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.539 
pretty closely together Keith's father
still<00:02:41.709> comes<00:02:41.920> in<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.099> gives<00:02:42.220> me<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.340> hard<00:02:42.489> time

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
still comes in and gives me a hard time

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:43.350 
still comes in and gives me a hard time
once<00:02:42.910> an<00:02:43.000> oil

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
once an oil

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.640 
once an oil
I<00:02:43.480> got<00:02:44.200> grandchildren<00:02:44.530> now<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:46.810> got<00:02:47.500> my

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
I got grandchildren now and and I got my

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.890 
I got grandchildren now and and I got my
little<00:02:47.769> grandson<00:02:48.340> Nicholas<00:02:48.849> there<00:02:49.269> I<00:02:49.540> think

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
little grandson Nicholas there I think

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.390 
little grandson Nicholas there I think
he<00:02:50.110> could<00:02:50.319> probably<00:02:50.410> run<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.860> operation

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
he could probably run the operation

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.490 
he could probably run the operation
right<00:02:51.549> now<00:02:51.610> he's<00:02:52.000> already<00:02:52.180> telling<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:53.319> guys

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
right now he's already telling the guys

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.900 
right now he's already telling the guys
what<00:02:53.709> to<00:02:53.859> do<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.160> why<00:02:54.280> are<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.489> doing<00:02:54.790> that

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
what to do and why are you doing that

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.699 
what to do and why are you doing that
and<00:02:55.209> everything<00:02:55.569> else<00:02:55.720> he<00:02:55.959> just<00:02:55.989> turned<00:02:56.410> four

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
and everything else he just turned four

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.860 
and everything else he just turned four
so<00:02:57.069> we've<00:02:57.910> got<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.090> lot<00:02:58.239> of<00:02:58.299> interest<00:02:58.600> in<00:02:58.780> the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
so we've got a lot of interest in the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.660 
so we've got a lot of interest in the
farm<00:02:59.109> and<00:02:59.350> so<00:02:59.500> you<00:02:59.980> know<00:03:00.190> we're<00:03:00.340> all<00:03:00.430> about
