00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.450 

then<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.299> tighten<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.840> at<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.049> back<00:01:37.259> my<00:01:38.100> mouse

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
then I tighten it at the back my mouse

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.260 
then I tighten it at the back my mouse
tail<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:40.590> then<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.100> go<00:01:41.280> again<00:01:41.430> now<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.090> wall

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
tail and then you go again now the wall

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.870 
tail and then you go again now the wall
I've<00:01:42.420> used<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.750> quite<00:01:42.899> thick<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.640> would<00:01:44.640> say

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
I've used is quite thick I would say

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.260 
I've used is quite thick I would say
it's<00:01:45.600> for<00:01:45.840> crochet<00:01:46.320> or<00:01:46.590> needle<00:01:47.579> hook<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.000> about

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
it's for crochet or needle hook of about

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.130 
it's for crochet or needle hook of about
six<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.520> thicker<00:01:50.850> your<00:01:51.210> wall<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.540> think<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
six so the thicker your wall I think the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.590 
six so the thicker your wall I think the
better<00:01:52.380> for<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.799> craft<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.390> find

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
better for this craft so if you can find

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.190 
better for this craft so if you can find
chunky<00:01:55.200> chunky<00:01:55.920> oopsie<00:01:56.659> chunky<00:01:57.659> wool<00:01:57.899> that's

chunky chunky oopsie chunky wool that's
great<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:58.890> I've<00:01:58.979> done<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.250> twice<00:01:59.520> now<00:01:59.880> my

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
great so I've done it twice now my

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.749 
great so I've done it twice now my
bottom<00:02:00.930> two<00:02:01.140> rows<00:02:01.340> I'm<00:02:02.340> going<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.549> do<00:02:02.610> about

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
just a little bit so it's not a really

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.870 
just a little bit so it's not a really
good<00:02:30.870> way<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.140> use<00:02:31.380> up<00:02:31.410> any<00:02:31.920> leftover<00:02:32.130> or<00:02:32.580> you

good way to use up any leftover or you

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.520 
good way to use up any leftover or you
might<00:02:33.060> have<00:02:33.360> in<00:02:33.540> your<00:02:33.630> house<00:02:34.880> there<00:02:35.880> we<00:02:36.150> go

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.030 

that's<00:02:40.530> for<00:02:41.480> he<00:02:42.480> doesn't<00:02:42.660> have<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.260> be<00:02:43.410> an

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
that's for he doesn't have to be an

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.890 
that's for he doesn't have to be an
exact<00:02:44.430> number<00:02:44.670> it's<00:02:45.209> just<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.480> kind<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.720> have

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
exact number it's just you kind of have

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.320 
exact number it's just you kind of have
a<00:02:45.930> look<00:02:46.220> see<00:02:47.220> what<00:02:47.250> youth<00:02:47.610> like<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.030> look<00:02:48.180> of

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
a look see what youth like the look of

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.300 
a look see what youth like the look of
in<00:02:48.540> terms<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.930> length<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.590> can<00:02:49.709> make<00:02:49.830> thin

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
in terms of length and you can make thin

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.620 
in terms of length and you can make thin
a<00:02:50.430> longer<00:02:50.940> one<00:02:51.120> shorter<00:02:51.690> ones<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.890> know<00:02:53.040> five

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
a longer one shorter ones you know five

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.910 
a longer one shorter ones you know five
you<00:02:54.630> know<00:02:54.780> that's<00:02:54.959> what<00:02:55.140> two<00:02:55.410> minutes<00:02:55.590> in

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
you know that's what two minutes in

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.039 
you know that's what two minutes in
already<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:56.489> just<00:02:57.360> sort<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.569> showing<00:02:57.900> how

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
already so just sort of showing how

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.559 
already so just sort of showing how
quickly<00:02:58.380> is<00:02:58.799> to<00:02:58.830> make<00:02:59.280> one<00:02:59.819> of<00:02:59.940> these<00:03:00.090> little

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
quickly is to make one of these little

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.850 
quickly is to make one of these little
nice<00:03:01.640> so<00:03:02.640> I<00:03:02.850> think<00:03:03.150> that's<00:03:03.420> six<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:04.200> think

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
nice so I think that's six I think

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.289 
nice so I think that's six I think
that's<00:03:05.130> going<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.310> be<00:03:05.370> enough<00:03:05.610> for<00:03:05.760> us<00:03:05.970> so

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
that's going to be enough for us so

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.660 
that's going to be enough for us so
that's<00:03:06.480> quite<00:03:06.690> long<00:03:06.930> isn't<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.260> so<00:03:07.650> you've<00:03:08.459> got

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
that's quite long isn't it so you've got

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.599 
that's quite long isn't it so you've got
your<00:03:08.790> six<00:03:09.030> stitches<00:03:09.330> so<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.780> speak<00:03:10.110> now<00:03:10.859> I'm

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
your six stitches so to speak now I'm

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.090 
your six stitches so to speak now I'm
going<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:11.970> cut<00:03:12.150> off<00:03:12.390> again<00:03:13.350> it<00:03:13.620> reasonably

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
going to cut off again it reasonably

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.650 
going to cut off again it reasonably
long<00:03:14.220> is<00:03:14.579> just<00:03:14.910> so<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.000> I'm<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.420> make<00:03:15.540> sure

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
long is just so that I'm to make sure

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.180 
long is just so that I'm to make sure
I've<00:03:15.750> got<00:03:15.810> enough<00:03:16.140> in<00:03:16.350> there<00:03:16.500> I'm<00:03:16.680> locking<00:03:16.950> my

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
piece and I'm going to weave it through

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.050 
piece and I'm going to weave it through
each<00:03:23.190> screw<00:03:23.459> so<00:03:23.760> here's<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.120> N<00:03:24.239> one<00:03:25.340> at<00:03:26.340> then

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
each screw so here's the N one at then

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.009 
each screw so here's the N one at then
the<00:03:27.269> next<00:03:27.570> one<00:03:28.070> like<00:03:29.070> that<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.420> next<00:03:30.780> one

the next one like that and the next one

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.580 
the next one like that and the next one
like<00:03:31.890> that<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.670> final<00:03:33.090> one<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.500> then<00:03:34.500> you

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
like that and the final one and then you

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.349 
like that and the final one and then you
pull<00:03:34.799> it<00:03:35.030> tight<00:03:36.650> here<00:03:37.650> we<00:03:37.799> go<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.549> you've<00:03:39.090> got

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
pull it tight here we go and you've got

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.920 
pull it tight here we go and you've got
your<00:03:40.019> basic<00:03:40.260> Mouse<00:03:40.980> body<00:03:41.370> now<00:03:42.299> all<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.480> do<00:03:42.720> now

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
your basic Mouse body now all I do now

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.949 
your basic Mouse body now all I do now
is<00:03:43.670> kind<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.819> decide<00:03:45.120> which<00:03:45.329> way<00:03:45.540> I<00:03:45.569> want<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:45.900> to

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
is kind of decide which way I want it to

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.280 
is kind of decide which way I want it to
be<00:03:46.140> up<00:03:46.970> take<00:03:47.970> this<00:03:48.150> wall<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:48.690> now<00:03:48.900> this<00:03:49.079> might

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
be up take this wall and now this might

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.660 
be up take this wall and now this might
look<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.530> bit<00:03:49.650> fiddly<00:03:49.980> but<00:03:50.130> it<00:03:50.250> but<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.519> isn't

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
look a bit fiddly but it but it isn't

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.490 
look a bit fiddly but it but it isn't
and<00:03:50.970> you'll<00:03:51.060> be<00:03:51.180> fine<00:03:51.420> once<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:51.989> sort<00:03:52.200> of<00:03:52.230> had

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
and you'll be fine once you sort of had

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.190 
and you'll be fine once you sort of had
a<00:03:52.530> go<00:03:52.769> at<00:03:52.799> it<00:03:53.069> now<00:03:53.549> I<00:03:53.609> take<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.959> I'm<00:03:55.049> going

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
a go at it now I take it and I'm going

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.650 
a go at it now I take it and I'm going
to<00:03:55.260> put<00:03:55.470> it<00:03:55.560> underneath<00:03:55.769> here<00:03:56.459> so<00:03:57.299> you<00:03:57.389> kind<00:03:57.540> of

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
to put it underneath here so you kind of

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.720 
to put it underneath here so you kind of
find<00:03:57.810> a<00:03:57.959> loop<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:58.799> I've<00:03:58.920> decided<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.370> go<00:03:59.519> for

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
find a loop and I've decided to go for

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.270 
find a loop and I've decided to go for
this<00:04:00.299> loop<00:04:00.630> here<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.590> I'm<00:04:01.889> going<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.100> do<00:04:02.220> is

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
this loop here and I'm going to do is

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.790 
this loop here and I'm going to do is
basically<00:04:02.519> just<00:04:03.030> tie<00:04:03.780> this<00:04:04.709> round

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
basically just tie this round

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.980 
basically just tie this round
can<00:04:06.490> you<00:04:06.580> see<00:04:06.820> it's<00:04:07.000> coming<00:04:07.240> in<00:04:07.510> through<00:04:07.570> there

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
can you see it's coming in through there

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.260 
can you see it's coming in through there
and<00:04:08.980> then<00:04:09.100> I'm<00:04:09.220> going<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.400> create<00:04:09.550> a<00:04:09.940> little

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
and then I'm going to create a little

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.880 
and then I'm going to create a little
icky<00:04:10.570> like<00:04:10.780> this<00:04:10.960> just<00:04:11.470> loop<00:04:11.620> it<00:04:11.770> round<00:04:13.890> here

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
icky like this just loop it round here

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:23.100 
icky like this just loop it round here
we<00:04:15.280> go<00:04:17.310> there<00:04:18.510> pull<00:04:19.510> it<00:04:19.540> through<00:04:20.020> so<00:04:21.990> I'll<00:04:22.990> a

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
we go there pull it through so I'll a

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.750 
we go there pull it through so I'll a
quick<00:04:23.470> little<00:04:23.740> here<00:04:23.920> and<00:04:24.220> now<00:04:24.460> you<00:04:24.550> need<00:04:24.670> to

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
quick little here and now you need to

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.360 
quick little here and now you need to
just<00:04:24.970> tie<00:04:25.180> it<00:04:25.240> in<00:04:25.510> place<00:04:25.950> I'll<00:04:26.950> just<00:04:27.130> do<00:04:27.340> that

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
just tie it in place I'll just do that

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.230 
just tie it in place I'll just do that
while<00:04:27.670> looping<00:04:28.150> around<00:04:28.240> again<00:04:28.980> I've<00:04:29.980> had<00:04:30.250> and

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
while looping around again I've had and

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.300 
while looping around again I've had and
just<00:04:31.480> putting<00:04:31.780> it<00:04:32.050> tight<00:04:33.900> yep<00:04:35.040> I'm<00:04:36.040> going<00:04:36.220> to

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
just putting it tight yep I'm going to

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.850 
just putting it tight yep I'm going to
do<00:04:36.370> it<00:04:36.460> again<00:04:36.550> if<00:04:36.850> you<00:04:36.970> need<00:04:37.120> to<00:04:37.620> it's<00:04:38.620> just<00:04:38.650> a

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
do it again if you need to it's just a

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.780 
do it again if you need to it's just a
little<00:04:39.010> knot<00:04:39.480> basically<00:04:41.010> you<00:04:42.010> can<00:04:42.220> place<00:04:44.790> and

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
little knot basically you can place and

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.350 
little knot basically you can place and
then<00:04:45.970> I<00:04:46.120> look<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:46.750> first<00:04:47.080> ear<00:04:47.410> done<00:04:48.300> now<00:04:49.300> you

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
then I look the first ear done now you

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.810 
then I look the first ear done now you
take<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:49.750> rest<00:04:49.900> of<00:04:50.050> that<00:04:50.200> and<00:04:50.800> you<00:04:51.340> push<00:04:51.610> it

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
take the rest of that and you push it

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.550 
take the rest of that and you push it
through<00:04:52.090> so<00:04:52.420> I've<00:04:52.480> got<00:04:52.660> them<00:04:52.840> the<00:04:52.870> matching

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
through so I've got them the matching

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.770 
through so I've got them the matching
side<00:04:53.860> of<00:04:54.190> the<00:04:54.340> loop<00:04:54.490> here<00:04:54.970> when<00:04:55.480> you<00:04:55.570> push<00:04:55.750> it

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
side of the loop here when you push it

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:02.220 
side of the loop here when you push it
through<00:04:56.110> their<00:05:00.030> hat<00:05:01.030> whoopsie

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
through their hat whoopsie

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.740 
through their hat whoopsie
okay<00:05:02.980> and<00:05:03.700> I'm<00:05:03.880> going<00:05:04.030> to<00:05:04.120> create<00:05:04.300> my<00:05:04.390> little

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
okay and I'm going to create my little

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.890 
okay and I'm going to create my little
loop<00:05:04.930> my<00:05:05.590> second<00:05:05.980> here

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.390 

here<00:05:12.590> we<00:05:12.770> go<00:05:13.630> that<00:05:14.630> got<00:05:15.110> you<00:05:15.260> here<00:05:15.290> and<00:05:16.040> then

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
here we go that got you here and then

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.840 
here we go that got you here and then
again<00:05:16.640> you<00:05:17.150> just<00:05:17.300> tie<00:05:17.630> a<00:05:18.020> little<00:05:18.380> knot<00:05:21.850> again

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
again you just tie a little knot again

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.640 
again you just tie a little knot again
you<00:05:22.970> have<00:05:23.180> to<00:05:23.270> do<00:05:23.390> two<00:05:23.720> -<00:05:24.020> my<00:05:24.170> ears<00:05:24.410> are<00:05:24.530> quite

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
you have to do two - my ears are quite

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.440 
you have to do two - my ears are quite
big<00:05:24.950> there<00:05:25.130> I<00:05:25.490> think<00:05:25.610> that's<00:05:25.760> okay

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
big there I think that's okay

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.240 
big there I think that's okay
that<00:05:26.840> also<00:05:26.990> gives<00:05:27.320> each<00:05:27.620> little<00:05:27.890> mouse<00:05:28.220> a

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
that also gives each little mouse a

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.310 
that also gives each little mouse a
different<00:05:28.910> character<00:05:29.390> okay<00:05:29.990> put<00:05:30.170> a<00:05:30.200> little

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
different character okay put a little

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.660 
different character okay put a little
bit<00:05:30.470> left<00:05:30.650> so<00:05:30.770> what<00:05:30.950> you<00:05:31.100> do<00:05:31.220> with<00:05:31.340> it

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
bit left so what you do with it

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.810 
bit left so what you do with it
-<00:05:31.970> analyst<00:05:32.240> I<00:05:32.390> just<00:05:32.570> weave<00:05:32.870> it<00:05:33.110> into<00:05:33.260> the<00:05:33.470> body

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
- analyst I just weave it into the body

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.360 
- analyst I just weave it into the body
push<00:05:34.820> it<00:05:35.000> through<00:05:35.210> a<00:05:35.330> little<00:05:35.690> bit<00:05:35.840> like<00:05:35.960> that

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
push it through a little bit like that

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.630 
push it through a little bit like that
that<00:05:37.370> and<00:05:37.580> then<00:05:38.120> you<00:05:39.080> know<00:05:39.250> maybe<00:05:40.250> put<00:05:40.490> it

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
that and then you know maybe put it

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.310 
that and then you know maybe put it
through<00:05:40.820> a<00:05:40.910> couple<00:05:41.120> of<00:05:41.240> knots<00:05:41.480> and<00:05:41.870> you<00:05:42.110> just

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
through a couple of knots and you just

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:48.490 
through a couple of knots and you just
sort<00:05:42.500> of<00:05:42.560> cut<00:05:42.890> it<00:05:43.070> just<00:05:43.280> to<00:05:43.910> this<00:05:47.260> so<00:05:48.260> here

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
sort of cut it just to this so here

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.400 
sort of cut it just to this so here
you've<00:05:48.710> got<00:05:48.890> your<00:05:48.920> basic<00:05:49.480> mouse<00:05:50.480> with<00:05:50.960> a<00:05:50.990> very

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
you've got your basic mouse with a very

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.610 
you've got your basic mouse with a very
very<00:05:51.890> long<00:05:52.280> tail<00:05:52.870> now<00:05:53.870> we<00:05:53.930> just<00:05:54.230> need<00:05:54.290> to<00:05:54.530> add

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
very long tail now we just need to add

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.380 
very long tail now we just need to add
had<00:05:57.620> some<00:05:57.980> whiskers<00:05:58.310> actually<00:05:58.970> you<00:05:59.030> see<00:05:59.240> my

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
had some whiskers actually you see my

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.540 
had some whiskers actually you see my
mouse<00:05:59.600> I<00:05:59.930> probably<00:06:00.800> could<00:06:01.130> have<00:06:01.190> done<00:06:01.250> the

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
mouse I probably could have done the

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.070 
mouse I probably could have done the
ears<00:06:01.700> a<00:06:01.790> little<00:06:01.850> bit<00:06:02.120> lower<00:06:02.270> down<00:06:02.480> but<00:06:02.810> to<00:06:02.990> be

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
ears a little bit lower down but to be

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.200 
ears a little bit lower down but to be
honest<00:06:03.320> like<00:06:03.470> I<00:06:03.710> said<00:06:03.980> it's<00:06:04.550> they<00:06:04.880> all<00:06:04.970> have<00:06:05.180> a

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
honest like I said it's they all have a

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.030 
honest like I said it's they all have a
different<00:06:05.300> character<00:06:05.750> so<00:06:06.410> now<00:06:06.560> I<00:06:06.590> get<00:06:06.830> a

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
different character so now I get a

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.490 
different character so now I get a
little<00:06:07.790> bit<00:06:08.000> of<00:06:08.120> the<00:06:08.270> gray<00:06:08.570> you<00:06:09.110> know<00:06:09.230> you<00:06:09.350> use

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
little bit of the gray you know you use

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.840 
little bit of the gray you know you use
black<00:06:09.740> or<00:06:10.040> any<00:06:10.070> other<00:06:10.220> color<00:06:10.370> this<00:06:10.730> is

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
black or any other color this is

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.480 
black or any other color this is
actually<00:06:11.120> slightly<00:06:11.300> thinner<00:06:11.630> war<00:06:12.280> I've<00:06:13.280> made

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
actually slightly thinner war I've made

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.550 
actually slightly thinner war I've made
one<00:06:13.610> with<00:06:13.730> the<00:06:13.850> same<00:06:14.060> thickness<00:06:14.360> and<00:06:15.080> then<00:06:15.530> I

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
one with the same thickness and then I

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.980 
one with the same thickness and then I
just<00:06:15.740> used<00:06:15.950> so<00:06:16.400> here<00:06:16.580> I've<00:06:16.640> got<00:06:16.820> one<00:06:17.510> two<00:06:17.960> three

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
just used so here I've got one two three

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.020 
just used so here I've got one two three
loops<00:06:18.680> you<00:06:19.040> can<00:06:19.160> just<00:06:19.310> do<00:06:19.400> two<00:06:19.640> loops<00:06:19.820> because

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
loops you can just do two loops because

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.210 
loops you can just do two loops because
it<00:06:20.120> just<00:06:20.210> gets<00:06:20.360> a<00:06:20.510> bit<00:06:20.540> thick<00:06:21.110> otherwise<00:06:21.500> so

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
it just gets a bit thick otherwise so

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.580 
it just gets a bit thick otherwise so
try<00:06:22.520> and<00:06:22.610> get<00:06:23.150> it<00:06:23.270> together<00:06:23.390> find<00:06:24.230> the<00:06:24.350> front

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
try and get it together find the front

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.810 
try and get it together find the front
of<00:06:24.830> the<00:06:24.920> nose<00:06:25.990> squeeze<00:06:26.990> it<00:06:27.350> in<00:06:27.560> and<00:06:28.370> that<00:06:28.550> I

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
of the nose squeeze it in and that I

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.550 
of the nose squeeze it in and that I
mean<00:06:29.360> you<00:06:29.480> could<00:06:29.660> use<00:06:29.810> a<00:06:29.840> needle<00:06:30.110> if<00:06:30.380> that's

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
mean you could use a needle if that's

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.410 
mean you could use a needle if that's
easier<00:06:30.770> for<00:06:30.980> you<00:06:31.280> but<00:06:31.610> I<00:06:31.640> quite<00:06:31.940> like<00:06:32.150> not

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:32.420 
easier for you but I quite like not

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.640 
easier for you but I quite like not
using<00:06:32.720> needles<00:06:32.990> locally<00:06:33.230> so<00:06:33.290> you've<00:06:33.410> got<00:06:33.530> it

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
using needles locally so you've got it

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.920 
using needles locally so you've got it
there<00:06:33.800> and<00:06:33.980> again<00:06:34.670> all<00:06:35.030> I'm<00:06:35.180> doing<00:06:35.420> now<00:06:35.570> is<00:06:35.870> a

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
there and again all I'm doing now is a

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:41.240 
there and again all I'm doing now is a
little<00:06:36.320> knot

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.900 

there<00:06:41.730> we<00:06:42.060> go<00:06:42.470> you<00:06:43.470> cannot<00:06:43.890> pull<00:06:44.610> it<00:06:44.700> really

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:44.910 
there we go you cannot pull it really

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.150 
there we go you cannot pull it really
tight<00:06:45.110> and<00:06:46.110> then<00:06:46.260> I<00:06:46.380> just<00:06:46.560> kind<00:06:46.770> of<00:06:46.860> kind<00:06:47.040> of

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 
tight and then I just kind of kind of

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.800 
tight and then I just kind of kind of
cut<00:06:47.730> in<00:06:48.000> to<00:06:48.750> make<00:06:48.900> them<00:06:49.020> all<00:06:49.170> the<00:06:49.290> same<00:06:49.470> length

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
cut in to make them all the same length

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.980 
cut in to make them all the same length
and<00:06:51.810> you've<00:06:51.960> got<00:06:52.260> yourself<00:06:52.410> a<00:06:53.310> little<00:06:54.060> cat<00:06:54.600> toy
