00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
it's not too big it's not too small and

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.180 
it's not too big it's not too small and

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
it's just i don't use it as often as i

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.020

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
use the rest of it but if i didn't have

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.420 
use the rest of it but if i didn't have
a<00:06:07.120> laptop<00:06:07.390> or<00:06:07.780> a<00:06:07.870> computer<00:06:07.900> to<00:06:08.380> go<00:06:08.500> to<00:06:08.560> the<00:06:09.100> ipad
