00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
we're going to take this by quarter

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.910 
we're going to take this by quarter
notes<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:14.910> each<00:00:15.690> group<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.200> sixteenth<00:00:16.650> notes

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
notes so each group of sixteenth notes

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.490 
notes so each group of sixteenth notes
is<00:00:17.130> going<00:00:17.610> to<00:00:17.670> move<00:00:17.910> by<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> quarter<00:00:18.869> note<00:00:19.020> so

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
is going to move by a quarter note so

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:37.850 
is going to move by a quarter note so
the<00:00:19.800> basic<00:00:20.369> groove<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.699> this<00:00:36.710> so<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.769> have

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
the basic groove is this so you have

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.750 
the basic groove is this so you have
open<00:00:38.220> hi-hat<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.790> beat<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:40.159> that<00:00:41.159> open<00:00:41.580> hi-hat

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
open hi-hat on beat for that open hi-hat

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.640 
open hi-hat on beat for that open hi-hat
that<00:00:42.269> quarter<00:00:42.659> note<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.960> complete<00:00:43.290> quarter

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
that quarter note that complete quarter

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.160 
that quarter note that complete quarter
note<00:00:43.799> we're<00:00:43.920> going<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.070> move<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.519> to<00:00:45.170> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
note we're going to move that to the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.259 
note we're going to move that to the
very<00:00:46.470> first<00:00:46.860> note<00:00:47.159> of<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.370> next<00:00:47.699> measure<00:00:47.940> and

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
very first note of the next measure and

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.100 
very first note of the next measure and
everything<00:00:49.110> slides<00:00:49.500> over<00:00:49.799> by<00:00:50.190> one<00:00:51.110> quarter

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
everything slides over by one quarter

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.950 
everything slides over by one quarter
note<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.890> sequence<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.670> notes<00:00:53.909> is<00:00:54.540> still

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
note so the sequence of notes is still

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.539 
note so the sequence of notes is still
the<00:00:55.140> same<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.409> writes<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.159> left<00:00:56.369> they

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:56.549 
the same the writes and the left they

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:58.759 
the same the writes and the left they
still<00:00:56.820> come<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.570> st.<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.110> same<00:00:58.320> order

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
still come to st. in the same order

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.369 
still come to st. in the same order
except<00:00:59.489> now<00:00:59.670> we've<00:01:00.000> just<00:01:00.330> we're<00:01:00.659> starting<00:01:01.260> on

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
except now we've just we're starting on

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.160 
except now we've just we're starting on
a<00:01:01.409> different<00:01:01.830> beat<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.820> counting<00:01:03.720> is<00:01:03.900> really

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
a different beat so counting is really

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.620 
a different beat so counting is really
helpful<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.240> what<00:01:06.360> I'm<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.570> to

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
helpful in this and so what I'm going to

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.770 
helpful in this and so what I'm going to
do<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.020> I'm<00:01:07.500> going<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.710> play<00:01:07.920> some<00:01:08.909> time<00:01:09.180> then

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
do is I'm going to play some time then

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.160 
do is I'm going to play some time then
the<00:01:09.930> first<00:01:10.200> exercise<00:01:10.939> more<00:01:11.939> time<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.600> then

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
the first exercise more time and then

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.749 
the first exercise more time and then
the<00:01:13.289> second<00:01:13.680> exercise<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.280> you'll<00:01:14.399> get<00:01:14.579> kind

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
the second exercise and you'll get kind

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.330 
the second exercise and you'll get kind
of<00:01:14.880> see<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.719> difference<00:01:16.200> between<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:17.130> two

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
of see the difference between the two

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.190 
of see the difference between the two
groves<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.909> kind<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.119> keep<00:01:18.390> counting<00:01:18.929> along

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
groves and kind of keep counting along

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.980 
groves and kind of keep counting along
and<00:01:19.560> feeling<00:01:20.250> where<00:01:20.399> one<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.090> you'll<00:01:21.450> hear

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and feeling where one is and you'll hear

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.959 
and feeling where one is and you'll hear
something<00:01:22.289> very<00:01:22.679> different<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.520> way<00:01:23.729> that

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
something very different the way that

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:26.990 
something very different the way that
the<00:01:24.119> time<00:01:24.390> feels<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:25.020> relation<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:26.729> groove

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the time feels in relation to the groove

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.130 
the time feels in relation to the groove
in<00:01:27.179> relation<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.929> downbeat<00:01:28.409> changes<00:01:29.250> so

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
in relation to the downbeat changes so

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.569 
in relation to the downbeat changes so
ear<00:01:31.140> training<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.950> know<00:01:32.070> kind<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.310> rhythmic

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
ear training you know kind of rhythmic

00:01:32.579 --> 00:02:10.600 
ear training you know kind of rhythmic
Solfeggio<00:01:33.359> system<00:01:33.840> alright<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.920> here<00:01:35.100> we<00:01:35.130> go

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.150 

okay<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.790> was<00:02:11.940> two<00:02:12.500> variations<00:02:13.500> or<00:02:13.980> one

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
okay that was two variations or one

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.310 
okay that was two variations or one
variation<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.820> original<00:02:14.910> groove<00:02:15.600> now<00:02:16.200> I'm

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
variation of the original groove now I'm

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.070 
variation of the original groove now I'm
going<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.530> do<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.310> same<00:02:17.520> thing<00:02:17.900> continuing<00:02:18.900> on

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
going to do the same thing continuing on

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.720 
going to do the same thing continuing on
and<00:02:19.260> I'm<00:02:19.380> going<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.530> add<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.950> third<00:02:20.130> variation

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
and I'm going to add the third variation

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.490 
and I'm going to add the third variation
in<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:20.970> fourth<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:22.080> if<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.290> count

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
in the fourth and so if you count

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.110 
in the fourth and so if you count
through<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:22.980> you'll<00:02:23.310> kind<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.610> hear<00:02:23.850> what's

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
through it you'll kind of hear what's

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.240 
through it you'll kind of hear what's
what's<00:02:24.720> going<00:02:25.080> on<00:02:25.260> how<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.770> changes<00:02:26.100> in

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
what's going on how it changes in

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.010 
what's going on how it changes in
relation<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.940> quarter<00:02:27.270> note<00:02:27.420> okay<00:02:27.690> so

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
relation to the quarter note okay so

00:02:28.020 --> 00:03:34.780 
relation to the quarter note okay so
here<00:02:28.380> we<00:02:28.470> go

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.420 

alright<00:03:35.790> so<00:03:35.910> there's<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.240> basic<00:03:36.390> idea<00:03:37.430> the

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
alright so there's the basic idea the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.340 
alright so there's the basic idea the
open<00:03:38.850> hi-hat<00:03:39.030> you<00:03:39.330> could<00:03:39.480> hear<00:03:39.630> it<00:03:39.720> /<00:03:39.870> mutating

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
open hi-hat you could hear it / mutating

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.580 
open hi-hat you could hear it / mutating
by<00:03:40.500> quarter<00:03:41.340> notes<00:03:41.840> so<00:03:42.840> there's<00:03:43.080> a<00:03:43.140> sort<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.500> a

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
by quarter notes so there's a sort of a

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.580 
by quarter notes so there's a sort of a
little<00:03:43.770> way<00:03:44.490> that<00:03:44.520> you<00:03:44.820> can<00:03:45.000> use<00:03:45.300> to<00:03:45.960> connect

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
little way that you can use to connect

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.180 
little way that you can use to connect
these<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:48.140> is<00:03:49.140> really<00:03:49.470> interesting<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.130> it

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
these that is really interesting and it

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.040 
these that is really interesting and it
sort<00:03:50.640> of<00:03:50.700> pre<00:03:50.910> mutates<00:03:51.240> it<00:03:51.420> for<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:51.870> without

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
sort of pre mutates it for you without

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.190 
sort of pre mutates it for you without
having<00:03:52.410> to<00:03:52.710> you<00:03:53.280> know<00:03:53.400> go<00:03:53.640> through<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.480> simple

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
having to you know go through a simple

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.410 
having to you know go through a simple
time<00:03:55.530> thing<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:55.980> then<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.180> next

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
time thing and then to the next

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.300 
time thing and then to the next
variation<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:58.140> basically<00:03:58.560> what<00:03:58.740> it<00:03:58.830> is<00:03:58.860> is<00:03:59.190> I'm

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
variation so basically what it is is I'm

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.090 
variation so basically what it is is I'm
going<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.520> add<00:03:59.820> an<00:04:00.180> open<00:04:01.110> hi-hat<00:04:01.320> and<00:04:01.800> it<00:04:01.950> will

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
going to add an open hi-hat and it will

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.250 
going to add an open hi-hat and it will
turn<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.520> thing<00:04:02.700> around<00:04:02.730> so<00:04:03.240> here's<00:04:04.080> what<00:04:04.230> it

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
turn the thing around so here's what it

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:53.840 
turn the thing around so here's what it
here's<00:04:04.680> what<00:04:04.800> it<00:04:04.890> sounds<00:04:05.220> like<00:04:52.550> so<00:04:53.550> if<00:04:53.669> you<00:04:53.760> are

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
here's what it sounds like so if you are

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.180 
here's what it sounds like so if you are
following<00:04:54.270> along<00:04:54.419> basically<00:04:55.200> I<00:04:55.680> went<00:04:56.040> through

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
following along basically I went through

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.700 
following along basically I went through
all<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.610> permutations<00:04:56.880> using<00:04:57.570> that<00:04:57.900> a<00:04:58.110> little

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
all the permutations using that a little

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.920 
all the permutations using that a little
extra<00:04:59.130> hi-hat<00:04:59.520> to<00:04:59.550> sort<00:04:59.940> of<00:05:00.000> turn<00:05:00.240> open<00:05:00.780> hi-hat

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
extra hi-hat to sort of turn open hi-hat

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.210 
extra hi-hat to sort of turn open hi-hat
to<00:05:01.080> turn<00:05:01.350> everything<00:05:01.590> around

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
to turn everything around

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.710 
to turn everything around
now<00:05:02.760> let's<00:05:02.940> play<00:05:03.090> a<00:05:03.120> little<00:05:03.270> bit<00:05:03.479> with<00:05:03.600> the

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
now let's play a little bit with the

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:11.540 
now let's play a little bit with the
glue

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.610
