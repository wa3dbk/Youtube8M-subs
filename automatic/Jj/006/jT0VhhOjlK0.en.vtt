about<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.780> game<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.550> like<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.090> lot<00:00:39.329> of

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
about this game I like it in a lot of

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.959 
about this game I like it in a lot of
ways<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.440> terms<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.950> game<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.700> can

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
ways but in terms of a game that I can

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.930 
ways but in terms of a game that I can
just<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.500> play<00:00:43.500> by<00:00:44.280> like<00:00:44.460> learning<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
just like play by like learning the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.700 
just like play by like learning the
systems<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.480> then<00:00:45.660> applying<00:00:46.079> them<00:00:46.320> as<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.559> go

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
systems and then applying them as I go

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.250 
systems and then applying them as I go
along<00:00:46.829> yeah<00:00:47.329> not<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.660> much<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:49.079> a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
along yeah not so much it's a

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.979 
along yeah not so much it's a
cooperative<00:00:50.070> heist<00:00:50.520> game<00:00:50.910> set<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
cooperative heist game set in the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.049 
cooperative heist game set in the
mystical<00:00:52.500> land<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:53.010> Monaco<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:53.670> obviously<00:00:53.969> a

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
mystical land of Monaco it's obviously a

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.369 
mystical land of Monaco it's obviously a
stealth<00:00:54.360> game<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.899> think<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> lot<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.289> people

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
stealth game and I think a lot of people

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.939 
stealth game and I think a lot of people
are<00:00:55.680> trained<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.280> play<00:00:57.000> these<00:00:57.210> stealth<00:00:57.600> games

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
are trained to play these stealth games

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.920 
are trained to play these stealth games
perfectly<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.370> game<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.789> not<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.719> game

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
perfectly this game is not that the game

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.110 
perfectly this game is not that the game
is<00:01:01.109> sort<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.469> has<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> lot<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.460> elements<00:01:02.699> that

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
is sort of has a lot of elements that

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.820 
is sort of has a lot of elements that
almost<00:01:03.449> require<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.199> get<00:01:04.320> spotted

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
almost require you to get spotted

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.649 
almost require you to get spotted
there's<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.129> lot<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.369> experimentation<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.450> lot

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
there's a lot of experimentation a lot

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.649 
there's a lot of experimentation a lot
of<00:01:06.810> game<00:01:06.930> mechanics<00:01:07.049> are<00:01:07.530> buried<00:01:08.659> beneath

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
of game mechanics are buried beneath

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.770 
of game mechanics are buried beneath
just<00:01:10.439> sort<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.740> experimentation<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:12.659> walk

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
just sort of experimentation I can walk

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.240 
just sort of experimentation I can walk
through<00:01:13.020> these<00:01:13.140> all<00:01:13.380> right<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.890> think<00:01:14.159> you

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
we're not quite playing right its

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.210 
we're not quite playing right its
systems<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> max<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.509> far<00:01:31.350> more<00:01:31.619> in

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
systems to the max like far more in

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.679 
systems to the max like far more in
depth<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.640> terms<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.939> systems<00:01:33.270> i<00:01:33.390> would<00:01:33.540> say

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
depth in terms of systems i would say

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.410 
depth in terms of systems i would say
then<00:01:33.930> like<00:01:34.140> dishonored<00:01:35.070> or<00:01:35.520> market<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.060> ninja

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
then like dishonored or market the ninja

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.969 
then like dishonored or market the ninja
it<00:01:36.659> seems<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.079> has<00:01:37.170> even<00:01:37.380> more<00:01:37.710> than

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
it seems like it has even more than

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.039 
it seems like it has even more than
those<00:01:38.159> games<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.180> like<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.600> versus

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
those games it's it's like a versus

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.450
