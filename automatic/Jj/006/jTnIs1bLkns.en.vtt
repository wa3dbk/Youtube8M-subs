hip-hop<00:00:43.829> since<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.309> was<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> kid<00:00:44.550> never<00:00:45.300> imagined

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
hip-hop since I was a kid never imagined

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.869 
hip-hop since I was a kid never imagined
that<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:45.989> would<00:00:46.110> be<00:00:46.230> rapping<00:00:46.739> but<00:00:46.950> when<00:00:47.789> I

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
that I would be rapping but when I

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.139 
that I would be rapping but when I
started<00:00:48.210> freestyling<00:00:49.520> just<00:00:50.520> for<00:00:50.730> fun

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
started freestyling just for fun

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.779 
started freestyling just for fun
basically<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.930> loved<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.219> was<00:00:53.370> sort<00:00:53.670> of

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
basically I loved that it was sort of

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.189 
basically I loved that it was sort of
like<00:00:53.969> doing<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.600> stream<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.960> consciousness

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
like doing a stream of consciousness

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.689 
like doing a stream of consciousness
writing<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.360> it<00:00:57.360> was<00:00:57.510> easier<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.989> do<00:00:58.460> you<00:00:59.460> get

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
writing and it was easier to do you get

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.760 
writing and it was easier to do you get
feedback<00:01:00.000> right<00:01:00.239> away<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:01.440> get<00:01:01.590> people

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.729 
hip-hop so basically from old-school to
whatever<00:02:33.970> is<00:02:34.239> popping<00:02:34.600> off<00:02:34.690> right<00:02:34.930> now<00:02:35.080> the

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
whatever is popping off right now the

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.280 
whatever is popping off right now the
people<00:02:35.920> who<00:02:36.160> have<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.610> love<00:02:37.330> for<00:02:37.600> all<00:02:37.660> of<00:02:38.080> that

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
people who have a love for all of that

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.350 
people who have a love for all of that
seem<00:02:39.130> to<00:02:39.459> me<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.510> be<00:02:40.660> better<00:02:41.320> than<00:02:42.150> better<00:02:43.150> at

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
seem to me to be better than better at

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.250 
seem to me to be better than better at
what<00:02:43.600> they<00:02:43.750> do<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:45.400> I<00:02:45.760> think<00:02:46.570> it's<00:02:46.810> it's<00:02:47.050> just

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
what they do so I think it's it's just

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.910 
what they do so I think it's it's just
it's<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.830> way<00:02:47.980> with<00:02:48.190> any<00:02:48.430> type<00:02:49.120> of<00:02:49.150> art

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
it's that way with any type of art

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.430 
it's that way with any type of art
you're<00:02:50.920> gonna<00:02:51.040> get<00:02:51.510> people<00:02:52.510> doing<00:02:52.720> very<00:02:52.900> new

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
you're gonna get people doing very new

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.580 
you're gonna get people doing very new
innovative<00:02:54.130> things<00:02:54.489> but<00:02:55.110> when<00:02:56.110> they<00:02:56.290> have

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
innovative things but when they have

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.130 
innovative things but when they have
something<00:02:57.160> grounded<00:02:57.790> in<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.330> past<00:02:58.600> something

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
something grounded in the past something

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.860 
something grounded in the past something
grounded<00:02:59.709> in<00:02:59.830> tradition<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:01.360> they<00:03:01.510> have<00:03:01.720> that

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
grounded in tradition and they have that

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.940 
grounded in tradition and they have that
knowledge<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.920> becomes<00:03:03.100> more<00:03:03.550> innovative

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
knowledge it becomes more innovative

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.900 
knowledge it becomes more innovative
that<00:03:05.950> said<00:03:06.370> because<00:03:07.120> hip-hop<00:03:08.050> is<00:03:08.230> such<00:03:08.470> a

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
example of that we've never been afraid

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.960 
example of that we've never been afraid
to<00:03:36.410> try<00:03:37.410> different<00:03:37.650> things<00:03:37.860> like<00:03:38.520> we<00:03:38.760> brought

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
to try different things like we brought

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.680 
to try different things like we brought
electronic<00:03:39.780> music<00:03:40.170> into<00:03:41.100> hip-hop<00:03:41.370> way<00:03:42.300> before

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
electronic music into hip-hop way before

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.740 
electronic music into hip-hop way before
it<00:03:42.780> became<00:03:43.050> a<00:03:43.110> thing<00:03:43.520> because<00:03:44.520> you<00:03:44.910> know<00:03:44.940> we

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
it became a thing because you know we

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.450 
it became a thing because you know we
like<00:03:45.990> the<00:03:46.170> ellipse<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.530> charting<00:03:47.070> music<00:03:47.370> at

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
like the ellipse and charting music at

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.360 
like the ellipse and charting music at
the<00:03:47.550> time<00:03:48.050> we<00:03:49.050> sometimes<00:03:49.410> bring<00:03:49.680> rock<00:03:49.890> into<00:03:50.250> it

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
the time we sometimes bring rock into it

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.580 
the time we sometimes bring rock into it
because<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:51.030> know<00:03:51.150> it's<00:03:51.390> fun<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:51.870> actually

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
because you know it's fun and actually

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.250 
because you know it's fun and actually
that<00:03:52.950> goes<00:03:53.130> back<00:03:53.520> into<00:03:54.150> hip-hop<00:03:54.750> history

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
that goes back into hip-hop history

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.370 
that goes back into hip-hop history
because<00:03:55.590> of<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:56.310> know<00:03:56.400> Aerosmith<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.380> Run
