00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.020 

because<00:01:15.070> I<00:01:15.160> think<00:01:15.430> that<00:01:15.550> what<00:01:15.700> we're<00:01:15.850> starting

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
because I think that what we're starting

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.060 
because I think that what we're starting
to<00:01:16.330> realize<00:01:16.479> is<00:01:16.840> that<00:01:16.869> we<00:01:17.500> thought<00:01:17.710> you<00:01:17.920> guys

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
to realize is that we thought you guys

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.770 
to realize is that we thought you guys
were<00:01:18.340> sort<00:01:18.580> of<00:01:18.610> what<00:01:18.820> kept<00:01:19.060> us<00:01:19.210> going<00:01:19.450> but

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
were sort of what kept us going but

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.050 
were sort of what kept us going but
maybe<00:01:19.990> there<00:01:20.530> is<00:01:20.710> a<00:01:20.740> bit<00:01:21.040> of<00:01:21.130> this<00:01:21.640> kind<00:01:21.910> of

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
maybe there is a bit of this kind of

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.910 
maybe there is a bit of this kind of
like<00:01:22.210> realization<00:01:22.869> that<00:01:23.080> I<00:01:23.320> know<00:01:23.410> have<00:01:23.740> you've

think that we had really taken into

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.600 
think that we had really taken into
consideration<00:01:37.750> like<00:01:38.320> how<00:01:38.979> important<00:01:39.490> like

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
and even if we were significant to you

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.490 
and even if we were significant to you
not<00:01:48.880> because<00:01:49.210> we<00:01:49.390> were<00:01:49.509> gay<00:01:49.659> or<00:01:49.840> whatever<00:01:50.109> but

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500
