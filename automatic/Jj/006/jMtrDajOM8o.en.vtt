00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.059
 it has been known that 89 with one more video 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.339
 and today I bring you this super 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.950
 which is one of the most complicated in 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:18.790
 get and that is called the last 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:21.040
 second for 25 is that it is deactivating a 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.580
 new pump in the last three seconds 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.460
 and the truth is that as I was saying 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.800
 Although it is for 25 g 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.600
 that I still believe that I am very little 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.450
 reward that we get to get 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.700
 this achievement is that this achievement is not 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.850
 just skill how are you going to 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.340
 to be able to get you also need to 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.829
 a lot of help within the game already 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.960
 as more players are within 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.630
 the game becomes a little more 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.489
 can not get it here if 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.190
 you noticed at the beginning we were 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.410
 only six players in the game 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.559
 you from my side and three from the team 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.050
 opposite so in this case it is one 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.479
 of the tips is one of the information 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.300
 useful that can help you to get 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.210
 this achievement when you start your game 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.210
 good check how many players 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.670
 you found to have for more or less 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.280
 give you an idea of ​​how you can go in the 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.590
 game in addition this is an achievement that 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.290
 you also have to say it you have to 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.470
 have some luck to be able to 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.810
 get I was dealing with more 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.030
 so many characters what I can do to them 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.490
 to say and what I can recommend 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.130
 it's those characters with whom I 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.400
 more was a little better and where my 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.140
 attempts were very very close to 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.050
 take me to achieve this achievement in 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.100
 previous games here this gameplay 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.690
 is where I got the achievement out there 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.710
 in the game I got it from the 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.200
 start but for practical purposes the 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.330
 video I put it to the end so that 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.300
 they saw how we got it and be 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.610
 explaining how the achievement was achieved 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.630
 then of all the characters with the 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:11.400
 that I was testing was the scientist 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.500
 the altar was also out there 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.150
 the engineer also tried it and the 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.580
 side of the plants only what 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.819
 try what the sunflower is because 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.150
 of good the scientist was I 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.650
 using because he has already see the station 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.170
 with special mobility have the 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.000
 curative season so good not what 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.250
 I can expose once you 're in 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.610
 that trying to deactivate the pump what 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.560
 you can put or graditos and I can be you 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.180
 regenerating life together with help 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.510
 that you could give all your companions 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.310
 of equipment not to be is also by the 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.530
 simple reason that by having two 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.660
 barriers that you can then put 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.640
 around you because they also protect you 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.040
 a little bit more in my case those two 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.660
 skills I have already unlocked 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.849
 an ability that is a little bit more 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.069
 powerful in the case of extraction 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.620
 curative and in the case of barriers 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.599
 that last a little longer and the other gives you 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.989
 a little more life and it's harder 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.700
 to destroy in the part of what is the 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.220
 plant is also a situation 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.430
 similar because you can put a good 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.099
 The little healing plant 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.310
 so that you are regenerating a little bit 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.349
 life another of the important things 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.810
 that you must keep in mind to be able to 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.450
 get this achievement is that once you 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.819
 the pump is planted because you must 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.310
 approach what is the new a plane 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.939
 bomb to the base where it is out there and 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.680
 give a scouteo to all your area of the 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:40.889
 bomb to see so many enemies 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.650
 you have fences and can disable it 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:45.750
 true there if they are fixed is disabled 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.780
 but well we could not get there and we 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.090
 they exploded out there stela we exploited them 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.909
 the little bomb and this game I think that 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.269
 there we won it here comes one 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:59.280
 failed attempts where is 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.980
 the second useful information so that 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.709
 you can get this achievement must be from 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.169
 zack start deactivating more or less 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:10.169
 when you have about six or 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:12.030
 seven seconds you have to play a 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:14.280
 with an offensive strategy for 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.620
 can try to get that achievement there 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.019
 we see that I approach there are not many 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.199
 enemies throw what they are 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.840
 the zombie cloud killed an enemy that 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:27.930
 is around nearby I avoid what is the 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.699
 rich tie and there our partner dies 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.259
 helped me there I start to deactivate the 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.659
 bomb but I realize I was very 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:35.460
 fast and I stop it off but 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:37.560
 well here is where it intervenes in the 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.720
 luck does not come the other enemies to 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.340
 kill me then the idea of kids is 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.349
 that at the time you have seven 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.930
 seconds and this is where they will see it 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:48.509
 already when I got it is that they start 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.250
 deactivate the pump remember that 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.889
 when you are deactivating you can 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.870
 you also help yourself so that 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.449
 are being shot by enemies 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.550
 opposites now well here is also 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.110
 they are going to give an account of what I was saying 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.990
 they needed a little bit of luck 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.699
 to deactivate it and now kids like that is 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.860
 how to get I leave you with the part 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.740
 end of the video hand above if it is 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.400
 you liked it at 1,080 euros it says goodbye 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.400
 the next
