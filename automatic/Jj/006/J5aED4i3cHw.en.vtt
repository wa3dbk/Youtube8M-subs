00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
but if you've got any other thoughts as

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.850 
but if you've got any other thoughts as
to<00:01:50.250> what<00:01:50.460> i<00:01:50.490> should<00:01:50.579> pick<00:01:50.939> up<00:01:51.200> don't<00:01:52.200> really

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860
