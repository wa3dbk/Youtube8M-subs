00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
really proud of our guys because I think

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.059 
really proud of our guys because I think
that<00:00:05.040> our<00:00:05.160> effort<00:00:05.510> was

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
that our effort was

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.509 
that our effort was
maybe<00:00:08.880> as<00:00:09.090> good<00:00:09.240> as<00:00:09.330> it's<00:00:09.540> been<00:00:10.040> all<00:00:11.040> year<00:00:11.340> as

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
maybe as good as it's been all year as

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.679 
maybe as good as it's been all year as
far<00:00:11.759> as<00:00:11.849> feeling<00:00:12.180> a<00:00:12.269> tip<00:00:12.539> to<00:00:13.699> to<00:00:14.699> the<00:00:14.820> end<00:00:17.689> we

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689 
far as feeling a tip to to the end we

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.960 
far as feeling a tip to to the end we
had<00:00:18.840> times<00:00:19.110> where<00:00:19.619> we<00:00:19.740> had<00:00:20.099> execution<00:00:20.640> issues

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
had times where we had execution issues

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.380 
had times where we had execution issues
but<00:00:21.180> we<00:00:21.509> never<00:00:21.660> had<00:00:21.779> any<00:00:22.020> effort<00:00:22.680> issues<00:00:23.390> as

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
but we never had any effort issues as

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.849 
but we never had any effort issues as
far<00:00:24.480> as<00:00:24.720> rebounding<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.170> ball<00:00:25.349> as<00:00:25.560> far<00:00:25.619> as

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
far as rebounding the ball as far as

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.269 
far as rebounding the ball as far as
5050<00:00:26.429> balls<00:00:26.580> we<00:00:27.090> had<00:00:27.240> guys<00:00:27.390> engaged<00:00:27.740> and<00:00:28.740> I

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
5050 balls we had guys engaged and I

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.279 
5050 balls we had guys engaged and I
think<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.720> eventually<00:00:30.720> won<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> game<00:00:31.259> for

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
think that eventually won the game for

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.320 
think that eventually won the game for
us<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.859> was<00:00:32.250> just<00:00:32.309> fun<00:00:32.580> it<00:00:32.790> was<00:00:32.879> really<00:00:33.120> fun<00:00:33.300> to

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.330 
us I was just fun it was really fun to

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.530 
us I was just fun it was really fun to
play<00:00:33.570> out<00:00:33.720> there<00:00:33.960> we<00:00:34.470> were<00:00:34.559> playing<00:00:34.830> loose<00:00:35.070> and

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
play out there we were playing loose and

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.850 
play out there we were playing loose and
doing<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.600> lot<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.750> good<00:00:36.870> things<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.739> was

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
doing a lot of good things and it was

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.710 
doing a lot of good things and it was
really<00:00:38.160> fun<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.610> think<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.030> altitude<00:00:39.449> really

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
really fun I think the altitude really

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.500 
really fun I think the altitude really
got<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.019> them<00:00:40.550> you<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.730> tell<00:00:41.910> with<00:00:42.120> some<00:00:42.270> teams

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
got to them you can tell with some teams

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.869 
got to them you can tell with some teams
when<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.809> gets<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.110> them<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.950> think<00:00:44.550> they

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
when it gets to them and I think they

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.229 
when it gets to them and I think they
hit<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> wall<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:46.320> just<00:00:46.530> kept<00:00:46.680> running<00:00:47.239> you

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
they were the team that we talked to our

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.900 
they were the team that we talked to our
team<00:02:20.810> about<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:22.990> they<00:02:23.990> execute<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:25.700> did

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
team about and they execute it and did

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.480 
team about and they execute it and did
what<00:02:26.060> they<00:02:26.150> needed<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.480> do<00:02:26.770> it's<00:02:27.770> four<00:02:28.100> seasons

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
what they needed to do it's four seasons

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.660 
what they needed to do it's four seasons
in<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.640> road<00:02:28.850> one<00:02:29.180> postseason<00:02:29.540> game<00:02:29.960> I<00:02:30.670> think

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
in the road one postseason game I think

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.830 
in the road one postseason game I think
that's<00:02:31.850> that<00:02:32.360> that's<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:34.280> real<00:02:34.820> positive<00:02:35.150> sign

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
that's that that's a real positive sign

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.830 
that's that that's a real positive sign
for<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:36.290> program<00:02:36.830> that<00:02:37.760> your<00:02:38.060> guys<00:02:38.210> can<00:02:38.540> get<00:02:38.690> the

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
for a program that your guys can get the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.270 
for a program that your guys can get the
postseason<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.710> then<00:02:39.800> they're<00:02:40.040> still

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
postseason and then they're still

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.970 
postseason and then they're still
together<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:41.930> they<00:02:42.050> comply<00:02:42.230> they<00:02:42.800> can

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
together and that they comply they can

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.500 
together and that they comply they can
execute<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.400> game<00:02:43.550> plan<00:02:43.820> they<00:02:44.030> can<00:02:44.180> play<00:02:44.330> with

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
execute a game plan they can play with

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.020 
execute a game plan they can play with
each<00:02:44.660> other<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.110> move<00:02:45.980> forward<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.640> you<00:02:46.790> can

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
each other and move forward and you can

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:54.830
