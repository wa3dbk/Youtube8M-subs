00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.950
 to London and that includes the two 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.170
 deiblers the brothers on the tracks 34 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.980

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.690
 ssv undine in mainz also a man of 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.730
 certainly great in the future 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.800
 Future hopes do not necessarily contribute 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.689
 about this 100 meter freistil first meter 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.130
 Specialist of the longer of the 200 meters

 train from potsdamer sv also in perspective 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.010
 swimmers so that the colleagues from potsdam

 Wolf from the Stadtwerke in Munich 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.140
 a familiar face in front of the Germans 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.519
 Then championships marco di carli from 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.010

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:56.379

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.230
 st pauli together with his friends 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.879
 but he also swims untiringly 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.619
 continue 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.869
 a track above the three years older 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.780
 steffen deibler from hamburger sport des 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.210
 swimming club the two but the big one 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.440
 bright spot with the job fears the 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.080
 swiss lays kevin leithold 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.850
 Surprisingly, the second in the 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.619
 February he also at a grand prix in 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.009
 All tracks are swimming in the USA 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.450
 and there we have dimitri colupaev 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.899
 is also studying in the us in 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.899
 southern california 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.380
 christoph fildebrandt the 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.150
 defending champion but last year was 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.740
 he is 17 seconds faster 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.480
 Tomorrow will be a bit 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.660
 must draufpacken to the forefront to 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.660
 come 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.410
 also from the start community 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.410
 bayer wuppertal uerdingen and dormagen 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.410
 maximum 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.490
 and at the top of the track 1 maximilian 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.650
 oswald city from the near of spiritual 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.930
 here to berlin to sg neukölln 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.270
 you change with healthy 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:03.690
 Self-confidence that said rio is 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.690
 a must be 100 meters freestyle 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.140
 on the yellow tracks the middle on 4 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.300
 steffen deibler a train about it 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.840
 leithold kevin lyde and thanks dimitri 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.349
 police becomes the younger markus deibler 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.049
 front on track 3 in these demands right 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.640
 skillfully like say band 3 the nice that he 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.450
 is the fourth to use 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.450
 a bit confusing 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.720
 is the start for kevin leithold he has 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.720
 totally 68 hundredths needed 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.090
 the man on track 5 on the upper 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.090
 yellow bank 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.920
 the passage time 23.26 seconds, the 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.879
 is in the range of his normal 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.209
 Performance has been twice 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.209
 more quickly 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.580
 Seipler the hamburger on the bottom 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.580
 yellow ground 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.930
 and the white line makes it clear 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.340
 required standard and he has apparently 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.200
 easy at this time 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.450
 maybe even two 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.540
 double victory for the deibler brothers and 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.720
 both with the required 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.580
 qualifications 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.950
 I call that a successful one 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.590
 steffen family business right 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.130
 deibler the older left markus deibler 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.950
 on the squares behind we have on 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.590
 place two as said markus then marco 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.450
 di carli still in the time of under 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.670
 50 seconds so all have to be faster 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.100
 than this morning but the outstanding 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.110
 the only two in 49 seconds of the 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.340
 steffen and markus deibler 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.530
 we do not have that far out of it 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.780
 window leaning christian cellar as us 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.510
 said at the beginning that is so 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.040
 small circular prospects for rio he 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.660
 at least also steffen deibler one sees 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.490
 just how powerful his start was 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.220
 and then the building phase where he got the 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.240
 first meter does not breathe and steffen 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.920
 is one of the surprise 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.660
 been finalists in london at munich 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.130
 before play very close to one 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.960
 Medal is scrapped and here 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.910
 Now with preserved body length 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.780
 his brother wins and yesterday yes 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.239
 even over the 50 meters 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.680
 butterfly 100 10 o'clock about his 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.000
 own personal german record 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.680
 swam design second German 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.210
 has won master title and the 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.680
 Brothers Müller also train 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.260
 together and are happy here rightly 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.720
 about this family double victory with a lot 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.370
 good times and every time under 49 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.620
 seconds already ne great 100 meter 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.300
 Freistil pays you not only happy 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.040
 right about this double success over 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.290
 other meter freestyle but you stand 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.190
 now quite rightly at alex 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.190
 the interview position 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.950
 brothers and both are in barrass or with 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.330
 while steffen deibler had it so 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:57.460
 easily introduced today so I nee 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:02.320
 am really surprised the time that 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:05.550
 really good times and wide turn around 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.480
 80 exhausting and that was fun 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.090
 with markus not tuned there still has me 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.760
 well , so well pushed the last 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.220
 meter was right came in is yes 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.930
 totally cool that we both place 1 and 2 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.210
 was made but it has a bit 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.320
 make an effort what are clearly markus 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:25.090
 They are about where they are 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:27.670
 wanted and I can so it's full 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.390
 satisfied is best just short of me 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.690
 I think I can do a little bit more 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.690
 spill 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.280
 that looks like over a meter 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.949
 freestyle you see two swimmers 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.210
 namely the brothers deibler the 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:43.830
 actually come from southern Germany 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.680
 then to hamburg three years ago 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.600
 gone under 49 seconds then 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.639
 marco di carli christoph fildebrandt the 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.570
 defending champions 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.610
 that is already a certain 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.960
 meaningfulness for a possible season 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.500
 that means they create and dimitri 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.810
 colupaev 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.810
 from undine mainz to fourth place
