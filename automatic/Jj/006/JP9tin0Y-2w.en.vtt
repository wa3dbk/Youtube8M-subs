my<00:01:57.060> bronze<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.540> /<00:01:57.659> almost<00:01:57.899> done<00:01:58.579> but<00:01:59.579> at<00:01:59.790> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
my bronze to / almost done but at the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.370 
my bronze to / almost done but at the
same<00:02:00.060> time<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.299> understand<00:02:00.719> that's<00:02:01.079> right

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
same time I understand that's right

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.139 
same time I understand that's right
along<00:02:01.710> right<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.399> never<00:02:02.610> would<00:02:02.729> have<00:02:02.850> made<00:02:02.969> that

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
along right I never would have made that

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.459 
along right I never would have made that
play<00:02:03.270> right<00:02:03.299> there<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.630> Fiddlesticks<00:02:04.049> or<00:02:04.229> that

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
play right there is Fiddlesticks or that

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.160 
play right there is Fiddlesticks or that
place<00:02:04.560> Caitlin<00:02:04.920> never<00:02:05.549> could<00:02:05.729> have<00:02:05.790> done<00:02:05.880> it

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
place Caitlin never could have done it

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.630 
place Caitlin never could have done it
so<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.200> gotta<00:02:07.680> think<00:02:07.950> there's<00:02:08.340> room<00:02:08.580> for

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
so I gotta think there's room for

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.160 
so I gotta think there's room for
improvement<00:02:08.849> here<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.450> need<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.660> stop<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.080> I

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
improvement here I need to stop and I

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.420 
improvement here I need to stop and I
need<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.379> look<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.709> say<00:02:10.890> what<00:02:11.099> could<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.340> have

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
need to look and say what could I have

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.640 
need to look and say what could I have
done

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
done

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.740 
done
better<00:02:11.849> because<00:02:12.849> right<00:02:13.060> now<00:02:13.090> I'm<00:02:13.390> in<00:02:13.420> bronze

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.140 
better because right now I'm in bronze

too I'm not winning every game which

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.600 
too I'm not winning every game which
means<00:02:16.390> i<00:02:16.510> should<00:02:16.540> not<00:02:16.780> be<00:02:16.930> in<00:02:17.019> platinum<00:02:17.610> great

one when he has no health or result like

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.569 
one when he has no health or result like
that<00:03:59.500> should<00:03:59.799> have<00:03:59.889> been<00:03:59.919> something<00:04:00.459> he

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
that should have been something he

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.580 
that should have been something he

have<00:04:04.359> apologized<00:04:04.810> right<00:04:04.989> there<00:04:05.199> and<00:04:05.440> he<00:04:05.560> would

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
have apologized right there and he would

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.080 
have apologized right there and he would
try<00:04:05.949> to<00:04:05.979> be<00:04:06.129> more<00:04:06.250> careful<00:04:06.310> not<00:04:06.699> doing<00:04:06.909> that<00:04:06.940> in

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090

now<00:04:26.270> are<00:04:26.449> these<00:04:26.569> players<00:04:26.870> raging<00:04:27.259> on<00:04:27.349> their

00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:27.439 
now are these players raging on their

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:29.200 
now are these players raging on their
team<00:04:27.650> or<00:04:27.889> are<00:04:28.370> they<00:04:28.460> saying<00:04:28.639> we<00:04:28.789> can<00:04:28.909> still<00:04:29.090> win

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.239 
team or are they saying we can still win
this<00:04:29.419> because<00:04:30.259> we<00:04:30.439> can<00:04:30.560> see<00:04:30.680> their<00:04:30.800> 10k<00:04:31.099> goal

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:31.249
