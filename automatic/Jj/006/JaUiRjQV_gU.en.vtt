cloudy<00:00:17.010> days<00:00:17.369> we're<00:00:17.940> running<00:00:18.029> through<00:00:18.180> with

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
cloudy days we're running through with

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.760 
cloudy days we're running through with
anger<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:18.779> as<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.080> see<00:00:19.230> them<00:00:19.320> jumping<00:00:19.500> on<00:00:19.680> the

anger and as you see them jumping on the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.500 
anger and as you see them jumping on the
clouds<00:00:19.980> here<00:00:20.189> each<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.789> our<00:00:20.910> different

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
clouds here each of our different

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.810 
clouds here each of our different
characters<00:00:21.930> have<00:00:22.140> various<00:00:22.650> abilities<00:00:22.859> angers

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
characters have various abilities angers

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.120

he<00:00:24.480> can<00:00:24.660> run<00:00:24.750> across<00:00:25.050> lava<00:00:25.289> but<00:00:25.590> he's<00:00:25.710> not<00:00:25.890> very

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
he can run across lava but he's not very

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.710 
he can run across lava but he's not very
good<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.550> clouds<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.510> clouds

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
good on clouds and so the clouds

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.599 
good on clouds and so the clouds
dissipate<00:00:28.170> really<00:00:28.470> fast<00:00:28.710> underneath<00:00:29.429> them

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
dissipate really fast underneath them

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.070 
dissipate really fast underneath them
it's<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.060> key<00:00:30.210> thing<00:00:30.449> we're<00:00:30.570> trying<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.840> do<00:00:30.960> is

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
it's a key thing we're trying to do is

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.450 
it's a key thing we're trying to do is
make<00:00:31.109> each<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.560> characters<00:00:31.710> unique<00:00:32.250> and

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
make each of the characters unique and

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.830 
make each of the characters unique and
you<00:00:32.669> actually<00:00:32.820> swapped<00:00:33.270> them<00:00:33.450> out<00:00:33.570> as<00:00:33.750> you

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
you actually swapped them out as you

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.870 
you actually swapped them out as you
play<00:00:34.020> through<00:00:34.190> figuring<00:00:35.190> out<00:00:35.280> what<00:00:35.460> character

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
play through figuring out what character

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.060 
play through figuring out what character
is<00:00:35.910> best<00:00:36.180> for<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.450> given<00:00:36.660> situation<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.380> saw<00:00:37.770> in

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
is best for the given situation I saw in

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.830 
is best for the given situation I saw in
the<00:00:38.280> demo<00:00:38.460> earlier<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.969> had<00:00:39.180> kind<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.570> some

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
the demo earlier you had kind of some

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.979 
the demo earlier you had kind of some
co-opting<00:00:40.530> we're<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:41.010> anger<00:00:41.399> could<00:00:41.610> carry

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
co-opting we're like anger could carry

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.720 
co-opting we're like anger could carry
fear<00:00:42.989> somebody<00:00:43.469> over<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> lava<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
fear somebody over the lava is that the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.920 
fear somebody over the lava is that the
the<00:00:44.969> way<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.120> go<00:00:45.300> with<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.539> inside<00:00:45.750> out

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the way to go with the inside out

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.020 
the way to go with the inside out
playset<00:00:46.410> yeah<00:00:46.890> we're<00:00:47.460> really<00:00:47.640> trying<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.940> get

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
playset yeah we're really trying to get

playset yeah we're really trying to get
a<00:00:48.059> lot<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.270> cooperative<00:00:48.870> play<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.140> there<00:00:49.289> so

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
a lot of cooperative play in there so

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.920 
a lot of cooperative play in there so

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
you can play their different strengths

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.750 
you can play their different strengths
off<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.410> another<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.160> they<00:00:53.309> kind<00:00:53.670> of

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
off of one another so they kind of

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.369 
off of one another so they kind of
complement<00:00:54.120> each<00:00:54.239> other<00:00:54.449> well<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:55.230> you

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
complement each other well so like you

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.990 
complement each other well so like you
said<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:55.590> anger<00:00:56.010> could<00:00:56.160> carry<00:00:56.370> say<00:00:56.579> sadness

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000

or fear or the others but then sadness

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.349 
or fear or the others but then sadness
she's<00:00:58.980> really<00:00:59.100> great<00:00:59.399> on<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.670> clouds<00:00:59.910> anger

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
she's really great on the clouds anger

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.970 
she's really great on the clouds anger
is<00:01:00.420> not<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:00.899> sadness<00:01:01.320> could<00:01:01.469> carry<00:01:01.680> anger

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
is not so sadness could carry anger

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.709 
is not so sadness could carry anger
across<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.370> clouds<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:03.090> other<00:01:03.510> nice<00:01:03.690> thing

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
across the clouds the other nice thing

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.210 
across the clouds the other nice thing
about<00:01:03.899> how<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.199> cooperative<00:01:04.680> play<00:01:04.769> works<00:01:05.040> is

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
about how the cooperative play works is

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.620 
about how the cooperative play works is
they<00:01:05.309> can<00:01:05.460> actually<00:01:05.670> placed<00:01:06.119> each<00:01:06.270> other<00:01:06.450> up

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
they can actually placed each other up

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.630 
they can actually placed each other up
to<00:01:06.810> high<00:01:07.170> locations<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.460> can

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
to high locations and so you can

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.520 
to high locations and so you can
sometimes<00:01:09.030> bypass<00:01:09.510> puzzles<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
sometimes bypass puzzles in a

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.050 
sometimes bypass puzzles in a
cooperative<00:01:10.860> fashion<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.760> single

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
cooperative fashion that in a single

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
cooperative fashion that in a single
player<00:01:12.210> way<00:01:12.420> you'd<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.900> play<00:01:13.049> a

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
player way you'd have to play a

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.170 
player way you'd have to play a
different<00:01:13.320> different<00:01:13.979> way<00:01:14.130> through<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:15.090> we

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
different different way through and we

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.940 
different different way through and we
just<00:01:15.360> switched<00:01:15.570> over<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.869> sadness<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.680> what<00:01:16.830> is

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
just switched over to sadness so what is

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.640 
just switched over to sadness so what is
a<00:01:16.979> sadness<00:01:17.970> she<00:01:18.720> gets<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.020> clouds<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.439> little
