in<00:00:00.269> today's<00:00:00.570> Racker<00:00:00.870> review<00:00:01.290> we're<00:00:01.650> looking

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
in today's Racker review we're looking

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.560 
in today's Racker review we're looking
at<00:00:01.979> two<00:00:02.190> sticks<00:00:02.490> sent<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.879> us<00:00:03.000> by<00:00:03.030> Tennis

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
at two sticks sent to us by Tennis

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.930 
at two sticks sent to us by Tennis
Express<00:00:03.929> calm<00:00:04.470> we've<00:00:05.130> got<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.430> Babolat<00:00:05.910> pure

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
Express calm we've got the Babolat pure

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.620 
Express calm we've got the Babolat pure
storm<00:00:06.660> Tour<00:00:07.080> GT<00:00:07.589> and<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:07.890> Babolat<00:00:08.880> pure<00:00:08.910> storm

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
storm Tour GT and the Babolat pure storm

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:17.660 
storm Tour GT and the Babolat pure storm
tour<00:00:10.230> plus<00:00:10.590> GT<00:00:15.920> these<00:00:16.920> records<00:00:17.310> used<00:00:17.460> several

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
tour plus GT these records used several

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.240 
tour plus GT these records used several
technologies<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:19.080> first<00:00:19.289> technology<00:00:19.920> is

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
technologies and the first technology is

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.029 
technologies and the first technology is
what<00:00:20.550> Babolat<00:00:21.029> calls<00:00:21.330> GT<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.769> stands

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
what Babolat calls GT and this stands

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.550 
what Babolat calls GT and this stands
for<00:00:23.189> graphite<00:00:23.789> tungsten<00:00:24.330> now<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.380> material

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
for graphite tungsten now this material

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.529 
for graphite tungsten now this material
is<00:00:26.130> placed<00:00:26.670> throughout<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.119> frame<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
is placed throughout the frame of the

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.929 
is placed throughout the frame of the
racket<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.830> makes<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.220> frame<00:00:29.460> very

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
racket and it makes the frame very

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.359 
racket and it makes the frame very
stable<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.109> other<00:00:31.260> words<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.710> frame<00:00:31.949> isn't

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
stable so in other words the frame isn't

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.130 
stable so in other words the frame isn't
going<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.610> warp<00:00:32.910> with<00:00:33.480> off<00:00:33.719> centre<00:00:34.110> hits

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
going to warp with off centre hits

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.530 
going to warp with off centre hits
because<00:00:34.710> when<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> frame<00:00:35.219> warps<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.820> ball<00:00:36.270> goes

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
because when a frame warps the ball goes

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.840 
because when a frame warps the ball goes
in<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.750> direction<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.320> might<00:00:37.530> not<00:00:37.710> expect<00:00:37.860> so

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
in a direction you might not expect so

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.700 
in a direction you might not expect so
by<00:00:39.030> having<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.390> strong<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:40.050> stable<00:00:40.440> frame

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
by having a strong and a stable frame

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.799 
by having a strong and a stable frame
the<00:00:41.280> ball<00:00:41.550> even<00:00:42.030> when<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.210> don't<00:00:42.329> catch<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.600> in

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
the ball even when you don't catch it in

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.840 
the ball even when you don't catch it in
the<00:00:42.870> middle<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.230> strings<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.800> going<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.670> go

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
the middle of the strings is going to go

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.040 
the middle of the strings is going to go
where<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.239> want<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.719> go

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
where you want it to go

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.990 
where you want it to go
now<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.410> second<00:00:46.860> technology<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.640> what

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
now the second technology is what

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.869 
now the second technology is what
Babolat<00:00:48.420> calls<00:00:48.719> woofer<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.579> woofer

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
Babolat calls woofer and the woofer

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.580 
Babolat calls woofer and the woofer
technology<00:00:51.449> makes<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.899> easier<00:00:52.289> for<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
technology makes it easier for the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.619 
technology makes it easier for the
strings<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.219> move<00:00:53.370> through<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.149> frame<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
strings to move through the frame of the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.959 
strings to move through the frame of the
racket<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.620> we've<00:00:55.770> got<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> racket<00:00:56.399> up<00:00:56.520> here<00:00:56.789> and

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
racket so we've got a racket up here and

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.029 
racket so we've got a racket up here and
every<00:00:57.510> time<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.809> hit<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> ball<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.710> strings

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
every time you hit the ball the strings

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.950 
every time you hit the ball the strings
move<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.460> little<00:00:59.579> bit<00:00:59.820> and<00:00:59.969> with<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> Wofford

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
move a little bit and with the Wofford

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.260 
move a little bit and with the Wofford
technology<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:02.160> easier<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.000> strings

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
technology it's easier for the strings

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.119 
technology it's easier for the strings
to<00:01:03.539> move<00:01:03.750> through<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> frame<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:04.979> it

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
to move through the frame so that it

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.070 
to move through the frame so that it
gets<00:01:05.339> more<00:01:05.640> strings<00:01:06.060> involved<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> hits

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
gets more strings involved in the hits

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.230 
gets more strings involved in the hits
that<00:01:07.369> increases<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.490> sweet<00:01:08.760> spot<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> little

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
that increases the sweet spot a little

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.530 
that increases the sweet spot a little
bit

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
bit

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.570 
bit
so<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> rackets<00:01:10.350> more<00:01:10.500> forgiving<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:11.369> off

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
so the rackets more forgiving with off

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.120 
so the rackets more forgiving with off
centre<00:01:11.880> hits<00:01:11.930> now<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.290> woofer<00:01:13.560> technology

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
centre hits now the woofer technology

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.399 
centre hits now the woofer technology
also<00:01:14.369> increases<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.270> overall<00:01:15.409> trampoline

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
also increases the overall trampoline

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.649 
also increases the overall trampoline
effect<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.310> string<00:01:17.580> bed<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.540> is

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
effect of the string bed and this is

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.789 
effect of the string bed and this is
going<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> give<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> little<00:01:19.439> bit<00:01:19.619> more

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
going to give you a little bit more

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.580 
going to give you a little bit more
power<00:01:20.070> than<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.729> otherwise<00:01:20.880> would<00:01:21.119> get<00:01:21.590> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
power than you otherwise would get the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.580 
power than you otherwise would get the
Babolat<00:01:23.070> pure<00:01:23.100> storm<00:01:23.729> towards<00:01:24.299> GT<00:01:24.689> has<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.290> head

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
Babolat pure storm towards GT has a head

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.550 
Babolat pure storm towards GT has a head
size<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:26.040> 98<00:01:26.460> square<00:01:26.610> inches<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.810> eleven

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
size of 98 square inches it is eleven

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.310 
size of 98 square inches it is eleven
point<00:01:28.860> three<00:01:28.950> ounces<00:01:29.610> unstrung<00:01:30.270> has<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> string

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
point three ounces unstrung has a string

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.740 
point three ounces unstrung has a string
pattern<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.009> sixteen<00:01:32.520> by<00:01:32.729> twenty<00:01:32.759> which

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
pattern that is sixteen by twenty which

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.539 
pattern that is sixteen by twenty which
is<00:01:33.900> basically<00:01:34.350> an<00:01:34.530> open<00:01:34.860> string<00:01:35.130> pattern

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
is basically an open string pattern

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.550 
is basically an open string pattern
typically<00:01:36.299> open<00:01:36.570> string<00:01:36.990> patterns<00:01:37.350> are

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
typically open string patterns are

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.219 
typically open string patterns are
thought<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.860> as<00:01:38.159> sixteen<00:01:39.000> by<00:01:39.150> 19<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.079> is

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
thought of as sixteen by 19 so this is

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.770 
thought of as sixteen by 19 so this is
very<00:01:40.439> similar<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.670> six<00:01:41.970> points<00:01:42.360> headlight

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
very similar it is six points headlight

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.200 
very similar it is six points headlight
and<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:43.979> 27<00:01:44.610> inches<00:01:44.909> long

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
and it is 27 inches long

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.940 
and it is 27 inches long
now<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.110> Babolat<00:01:46.740> pure<00:01:46.890> storm<00:01:47.460> tour<00:01:47.880> plus<00:01:48.390> GT

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
now the Babolat pure storm tour plus GT

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.130
