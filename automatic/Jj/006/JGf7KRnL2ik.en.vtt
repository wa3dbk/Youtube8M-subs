next<00:00:10.780> we're<00:00:11.440> going<00:00:11.740> to<00:00:11.799> show<00:00:11.889> you<00:00:12.040> how<00:00:12.219> to<00:00:12.280> do<00:00:12.490> a

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:12.760 
next we're going to show you how to do a

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.420 
next we're going to show you how to do a
c2<00:00:13.180> Drive<00:00:13.930> there<00:00:14.799> so<00:00:14.980> they're<00:00:15.190> a<00:00:15.219> lot

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.430 
c2 Drive there so they're a lot

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.490 
c2 Drive there so they're a lot
different<00:00:16.000> they're<00:00:16.270> a<00:00:16.299> lot<00:00:16.599> faster<00:00:17.230> than<00:00:17.260> what

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
different they're a lot faster than what

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.880 
different they're a lot faster than what
IDE<00:00:17.980> drives<00:00:18.520> are<00:00:18.849> they<00:00:19.750> can<00:00:19.930> transfer<00:00:20.380> a<00:00:20.410> whole

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
IDE drives are they can transfer a whole

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.400 
IDE drives are they can transfer a whole
lot<00:00:21.310> more<00:00:21.610> information<00:00:21.849> to<00:00:22.630> make<00:00:23.140> your

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
lot more information to make your

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.880 
lot more information to make your
computer<00:00:23.890> so<00:00:24.189> much<00:00:24.400> faster<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:26.500> can<00:00:26.619> identify

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
computer so much faster you can identify

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.359 
computer so much faster you can identify
these<00:00:28.200> because<00:00:29.200> they<00:00:29.380> have<00:00:29.559> a<00:00:29.590> small<00:00:30.040> red

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
these because they have a small red

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.150 
these because they have a small red
cable<00:00:30.910> this<00:00:31.840> is<00:00:32.050> what<00:00:32.259> the<00:00:32.410> inside<00:00:32.800> the<00:00:32.980> cable

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
cable this is what the inside the cable

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.030 
cable this is what the inside the cable
looks<00:00:33.520> like<00:00:33.930> they're<00:00:34.930> much<00:00:35.170> smaller<00:00:35.559> the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
looks like they're much smaller the

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.760 
looks like they're much smaller the
technology<00:00:36.730> is<00:00:36.790> much<00:00:37.000> different<00:00:37.690> and<00:00:37.930> allows

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
technology is much different and allows

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.600 
technology is much different and allows
a<00:00:38.800> whole<00:00:39.250> lot<00:00:39.489> higher<00:00:39.790> transfer<00:00:40.480> rates

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
a whole lot higher transfer rates

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.110 
a whole lot higher transfer rates
this<00:00:42.610> is<00:00:43.180> a<00:00:43.480> typical<00:00:43.890> Center<00:00:44.890> Drive<00:00:45.160> this

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
this is a typical Center Drive this

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.230 
this is a typical Center Drive this
drive<00:00:46.480> here<00:00:47.020> is<00:00:47.170> a<00:00:47.230> 500<00:00:48.190> gigabyte<00:00:49.680> Drive<00:00:51.240> the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
drive here is a 500 gigabyte Drive the

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.800 
drive here is a 500 gigabyte Drive the
difference<00:00:52.750> with<00:00:52.960> these<00:00:53.110> drives<00:00:53.530> is<00:00:54.810> they

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
difference with these drives is they

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.830 
difference with these drives is they
don't<00:00:55.989> have<00:00:56.200> jumpers<00:00:56.739> in<00:00:56.860> the<00:00:56.980> back<00:00:57.190> of<00:00:57.460> them

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
don't have jumpers in the back of them

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.750 
don't have jumpers in the back of them
these<00:00:58.840> are<00:00:58.900> not<00:00:59.230> required<00:00:59.530> to<00:00:59.980> have<00:01:00.130> slaves

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
these are not required to have slaves

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.350 
these are not required to have slaves
and<00:01:01.149> masters<00:01:01.210> set<00:01:01.930> preset<00:01:02.530> on<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:02.920> drives

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
and masters set preset on the drives

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.940 
and masters set preset on the drives
because<00:01:04.360> these<00:01:04.629> are<00:01:04.780> automatically<00:01:05.409> assigned

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
because these are automatically assigned

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.679 
because these are automatically assigned
a<00:01:06.280> number<00:01:06.520> we're<00:01:06.880> plugged<00:01:07.270> in<00:01:09.060> here<00:01:10.060> this<00:01:10.479> is<00:01:10.659> a

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
a number we're plugged in here this is a

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.749 
a number we're plugged in here this is a

even touch the contacts as this could
cause<00:01:35.950> problems<00:01:36.310> later<00:01:36.789> on<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:39.340> as<00:01:39.490> you<00:01:39.670> can

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
cause problems later on and as you can

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.090 
cause problems later on and as you can
see<00:01:39.850> from<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.359> old<00:01:40.569> one<00:01:40.929> that<00:01:41.409> I<00:01:41.499> installed<00:01:41.950> it

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
see from the old one that I installed it

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.789 
see from the old one that I installed it
with<00:01:42.249> an<00:01:42.340> IDE<00:01:42.700> this<00:01:43.509> in<00:01:43.719> here<00:01:43.990> is<00:01:44.020> much<00:01:44.409> thinner

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
with an IDE this in here is much thinner

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.819 
with an IDE this in here is much thinner
the<00:01:45.579> technology<00:01:46.389> are<00:01:46.600> far<00:01:46.899> more<00:01:46.929> advanced<00:01:47.529> in

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
the technology are far more advanced in

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.669 
the technology are far more advanced in
these<00:01:48.069> seated<00:01:48.369> drives<00:01:48.729> than<00:01:49.359> what<00:01:49.569> the<00:01:49.810> IDE<00:01:50.439> s

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
these seated drives than what the IDE s

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.510 
these seated drives than what the IDE s
had<00:01:51.719> this<00:01:52.719> case<00:01:53.139> is<00:01:53.499> a<00:01:53.709> lot<00:01:53.889> different<00:01:54.429> than

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
had this case is a lot different than

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.699 
had this case is a lot different than
what<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.849> other<00:01:54.969> one<00:01:55.270> was<00:01:55.299> the<00:01:56.079> other<00:01:56.229> one<00:01:56.469> had

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:56.709 
what the other one was the other one had

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:59.429 
what the other one was the other one had
screws<00:01:57.130> in<00:01:57.429> it<00:01:57.459> this<00:01:58.299> one<00:01:58.599> here<00:01:58.959> has<00:01:59.200> these

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
screws in it this one here has these

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.249 
screws in it this one here has these
latches<00:01:59.740> in<00:02:00.219> it<00:02:00.399> which<00:02:01.029> are<00:02:01.329> real<00:02:01.689> handy

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
latches in it which are real handy

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.800 
latches in it which are real handy
because<00:02:02.469> you<00:02:02.649> don't<00:02:03.009> have<00:02:03.219> to<00:02:03.399> screw<00:02:03.759> or<00:02:04.539> do

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
because you don't have to screw or do

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.370 
because you don't have to screw or do
anything<00:02:05.499> to<00:02:06.219> strip<00:02:06.459> heads<00:02:06.819> all<00:02:07.810> you<00:02:08.080> have<00:02:08.259> to

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
anything to strip heads all you have to

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.000 
anything to strip heads all you have to
do<00:02:08.530> is<00:02:08.950> slide<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.429> drive<00:02:09.640> in<00:02:10.620> put<00:02:11.620> these<00:02:11.830> in

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
do is slide the drive in put these in

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.410 
do is slide the drive in put these in
these<00:02:12.160> little<00:02:12.340> holes<00:02:12.459> in<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:12.970> side<00:02:13.240> of<00:02:13.270> the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
these little holes in the side of the

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.339 
these little holes in the side of the
drives<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:14.190> engage<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.430> they<00:02:16.270> kind<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.660> pretty

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
drives and engage it they kind of pretty

into the bay and as you can see here

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.790 
into the bay and as you can see here
I've<00:03:14.560> got<00:03:14.830> one<00:03:15.040> of<00:03:15.160> these<00:03:15.250> already<00:03:15.760> unhooked

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
I've got one of these already unhooked

I've got one of these already unhooked
all<00:03:17.800> I<00:03:17.860> have<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.400> do<00:03:18.520> now<00:03:19.350> is<00:03:20.460> laying<00:03:21.460> up<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:23.680> one

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
all I have to do now is laying up to one

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.990 
all I have to do now is laying up to one
of<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.070> holes<00:03:24.990> that's<00:03:25.990> in<00:03:26.290> place<00:03:26.850> once<00:03:27.850> it

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
of the holes that's in place once it

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.900 
of the holes that's in place once it
goes<00:03:28.180> in<00:03:28.740> you<00:03:29.740> can<00:03:29.920> feel<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.310> doesn't<00:03:30.520> drive

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
goes in you can feel it doesn't drive

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.800 
goes in you can feel it doesn't drive
won't<00:03:31.210> move<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:32.410> push<00:03:32.710> it<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.040> hole<00:03:33.340> in<00:03:33.810> slide

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
won't move you push it the hole in slide

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.710 
won't move you push it the hole in slide
it<00:03:35.020> and<00:03:35.200> it<00:03:35.590> locks<00:03:35.860> it<00:03:36.040> into<00:03:36.220> place<00:03:36.660> now<00:03:37.660> the

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
it and it locks it into place now the

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.480 
it and it locks it into place now the
drive<00:03:38.110> cannot<00:03:38.590> move<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:40.510> I<00:03:41.260> have<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.650> drum<00:03:41.980> room

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
drive cannot move and I have a drum room

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.520 
drive cannot move and I have a drum room
for<00:03:42.820> one<00:03:43.030> more<00:03:43.060> if<00:03:43.450> I<00:03:43.630> were<00:03:43.690> decided<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.350> a

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
for one more if I were decided and a

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.699 
for one more if I were decided and a
third<00:03:44.800> drive<00:03:46.350> next

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.280 

so<00:03:50.430> many<00:03:50.670> drives<00:03:51.030> will<00:03:51.390> also<00:03:51.780> come<00:03:51.989> with<00:03:52.019> an

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
so many drives will also come with an

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.809 
so many drives will also come with an
adapter<00:03:52.909> if<00:03:53.909> you<00:03:54.540> don't<00:03:54.750> have<00:03:55.019> it<00:03:55.170> a<00:03:55.319> spare

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
adapter if you don't have it a spare

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.030 
adapter if you don't have it a spare
adapter<00:03:56.819> that<00:03:57.780> looks<00:03:58.049> like<00:03:58.200> this<00:03:58.470> for<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.799> set

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
adapter that looks like this for the set

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.460 
adapter that looks like this for the set
of<00:03:59.159> drives<00:03:59.540> so<00:04:00.540> most<00:04:00.810> of<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.019> drives<00:04:01.260> are

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
of drives so most of the drives are

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.800 
of drives so most of the drives are
coming<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.830> doctor<00:04:02.159> like<00:04:02.340> this<00:04:02.700> this<00:04:03.540> will

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
coming the doctor like this this will

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.039 
coming the doctor like this this will
convert<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.470> regular<00:04:04.830> 12/5<00:04:05.629> like<00:04:06.629> you<00:04:06.780> see<00:04:06.959> in

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
convert the regular 12/5 like you see in

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:15.319 
convert the regular 12/5 like you see in
the<00:04:07.170> IDE<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:08.569> convert<00:04:09.569> it<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:13.610> a<00:04:14.610> SATA<00:04:15.000> power

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
the IDE and convert it to a SATA power

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.220 
the IDE and convert it to a SATA power
coupling

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.830
