00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
this closure I decided that I wanted to

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.220 
this closure I decided that I wanted to
try<00:02:46.320> color<00:02:46.620> because<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.100> have<00:02:47.340> never<00:02:47.990> had<00:02:48.990> my

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
try color because I have never had my

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.930 
try color because I have never had my
hair<00:02:49.260> any<00:02:49.650> other<00:02:49.830> color<00:02:50.040> besides<00:02:50.250> black<00:02:50.700> ever

in<00:02:51.060> my<00:02:51.150> life<00:02:51.360> so<00:02:51.960> I<00:02:51.990> went<00:02:52.260> out<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.740> I<00:02:52.800> think<00:02:52.980> it

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
in my life so I went out to I think it

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.770 
in my life so I went out to I think it
was<00:02:53.250> Walgreens<00:02:53.760> or<00:02:53.970> someone<00:02:54.240> like<00:02:54.300> that<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.720> I

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
got myself a box dye I think it was dark

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.570 
got myself a box dye I think it was dark
and<00:02:57.480> lovely<00:02:57.840> honey<00:02:58.110> blonde<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:58.860> left<00:02:59.100> it<00:02:59.370> on

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
and lovely honey blonde and I left it on

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.460 
and lovely honey blonde and I left it on
the<00:02:59.790> hair<00:03:00.000> for<00:03:00.030> probably<00:03:00.510> like<00:03:00.660> an<00:03:00.840> hour<00:03:01.050> and

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
the hair for probably like an hour and

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.130 
the hair for probably like an hour and
this<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.860> color<00:03:02.070> that<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.370> lifted<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:03.140> the

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
this is the color that it lifted to the

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.050 
this is the color that it lifted to the
closure<00:03:04.440> actually<00:03:04.800> ended<00:03:05.310> up<00:03:05.370> lifting<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.880> lot

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
closure actually ended up lifting a lot

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.520 
closure actually ended up lifting a lot
better<00:03:06.330> than<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.690> hair<00:03:06.840> in<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.020> bundles<00:03:07.320> did

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
better than the hair in the bundles did

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.980 
better than the hair in the bundles did
like<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.070> got<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.490> this<00:03:08.640> nice<00:03:08.910> brown<00:03:09.300> color<00:03:09.630> but

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
like it got to this nice brown color but

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.600 
like it got to this nice brown color but
the<00:03:10.620> hair<00:03:10.830> in<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:10.950> bundle

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
the hair in the bundle

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.990 
the hair in the bundle
stayed<00:03:11.970> pretty<00:03:12.600> dark<00:03:13.560> which<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.670> doesn't

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
stayed pretty dark which it doesn't

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.460 
stayed pretty dark which it doesn't
bother<00:03:15.120> me<00:03:15.300> that<00:03:15.420> much<00:03:15.780> because<00:03:15.960> it<00:03:16.140> kind<00:03:16.440> of

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
bother me that much because it kind of

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.620 
bother me that much because it kind of
just<00:03:16.650> looks<00:03:16.770> like<00:03:16.970> like<00:03:17.970> it's<00:03:18.150> light<00:03:18.360> on<00:03:18.540> the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
just looks like like it's light on the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.100 
just looks like like it's light on the
top<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:18.990> then<00:03:19.110> dark<00:03:19.320> on<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.560> bottom<00:03:19.590> but<00:03:21.110> mmm

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
top and then dark on the bottom but mmm

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.620 
top and then dark on the bottom but mmm
like<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:23.220> probably<00:03:23.670> may<00:03:23.790> have<00:03:23.820> lifted<00:03:24.360> better

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
like it probably may have lifted better

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.420 
like it probably may have lifted better
