first<00:00:16.800> power<00:00:17.090> lower<00:00:18.090> motor<00:00:18.590> good<00:00:19.590> engine<00:00:19.859> and

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
first power lower motor good engine and

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.120 
first power lower motor good engine and
this<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.689> basically<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.680> setup<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.630> just<00:00:25.130> I

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
this is basically the setup so just I

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.089 
this is basically the setup so just I
knew<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.640> could<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:27.029> just<00:00:27.359> put<00:00:27.599> some<00:00:27.750> slightly

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.920 

yeah<00:00:32.099> won't<00:00:32.279> stick<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.700> up<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.880> notch<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.809> we

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
yeah won't stick it up a notch so we

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.590 
yeah won't stick it up a notch so we
have<00:00:34.079> here's<00:00:34.469> one<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.770> us<00:00:35.000> regular<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.540> I

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
have here's one of us regular and I

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.190 
have here's one of us regular and I
water<00:00:36.780> fill<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.079> our<00:00:37.200> bearings<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:38.780> just<00:00:39.780> posted

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
water fill of our bearings I just posted

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.110 
water fill of our bearings I just posted
plywood<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.010> want<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.219> keep<00:00:41.399> them<00:00:41.550> stable<00:00:41.790> so

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
plywood and want to keep them stable so

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.979 
plywood and want to keep them stable so
I<00:00:42.210> made<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.600> little<00:00:42.750> casting<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.440> resin<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.989> an

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
I made a little casting of resin and an

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.860 
I made a little casting of resin and an
all<00:00:46.110> thread<00:00:46.500> put<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.399> through<00:00:47.520> here<00:00:47.870> welded

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
all thread put it through here welded

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.610 
all thread put it through here welded
this<00:00:49.110> nut<00:00:49.940> this<00:00:50.940> nut<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.960> all<00:00:52.140> 3/8<00:00:52.500> so

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
this nut this nut this is all 3/8 so

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.229 
this nut this nut this is all 3/8 so
when<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.770> turn<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.219> nut<00:00:54.379> there's<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.500> little

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
when I turn this nut there's this little

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.520 
when I turn this nut there's this little
slide<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.420> plate<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.989> know<00:00:58.170> back<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.469> forth

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
slide the plate you know back and forth

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.459 
slide the plate you know back and forth
on<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.399> back<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.879> can<00:01:00.000> see<00:01:00.289> competence<00:01:01.289> right

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
on the back you can see competence right

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.640 
on the back you can see competence right
here<00:01:01.739> that's<00:01:02.699> our<00:01:03.210> little<00:01:03.510> intake<00:01:04.260> housing

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
here that's our little intake housing

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.149 
here that's our little intake housing
right<00:01:04.769> here

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
right here

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.039 
right here
so<00:01:05.760> water<00:01:06.000> comes<00:01:06.299> from<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.689> bottom<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
so water comes from the bottom of the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.230 
so water comes from the bottom of the
boat<00:01:07.229> comes<00:01:07.560> up<00:01:07.799> feels<00:01:08.700> right<00:01:08.820> here<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.119> shoot

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
boat comes up feels right here to shoot

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.440 
boat comes up feels right here to shoot
out<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.780> nozzoli<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.470> back<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:11.180> in<00:01:12.180> as

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
out and nozzoli we have back here in as

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.870 
out and nozzoli we have back here in as
far<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:12.810> these<00:01:13.229> start<00:01:13.560> rope<00:01:13.920> there's<00:01:14.520> gonna<00:01:14.670> be

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
far as these start rope there's gonna be

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.289 
far as these start rope there's gonna be
another<00:01:15.570> layer<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:16.049> plywood<00:01:17.090> thin<00:01:18.090> layer

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
another layer of plywood thin layer

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.300 
another layer of plywood thin layer
apply<00:01:18.509> we're<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.020> top<00:01:19.229> right<00:01:19.380> here<00:01:19.590> this

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
apply we're going on top right here this

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.609 
apply we're going on top right here this
should<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:21.000> about<00:01:21.180> flush<00:01:21.960> with<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> head

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
should be just about flush with the head

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.109 
should be just about flush with the head
of<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.799> boats<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.310> our<00:01:23.400> water<00:01:23.729> from<00:01:23.909> then

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
of the boats and our water from then

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.300 
of the boats and our water from then
we'll<00:01:24.420> still<00:01:25.259> got<00:01:25.380> some<00:01:25.530> passion<00:01:25.740> some<00:01:26.100> pets

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
we'll still got some passion some pets

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.120 
we'll still got some passion some pets
at<00:01:26.490> work<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.759> do<00:01:27.350> on<00:01:28.350> our<00:01:28.380> pump<00:01:28.770> parking<00:01:29.040> like

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
at work to do on our pump parking like

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.749 
at work to do on our pump parking like
this<00:01:29.280> little<00:01:29.720> cavity<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.079> point<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.979> more<00:01:32.189> but

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
this little cavity and point to more but

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.340 
this little cavity and point to more but
that's<00:01:34.460> that's<00:01:35.460> not<00:01:35.579> important<00:01:36.090> but<00:01:36.570> but<00:01:37.320> a

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
that's that's not important but but a

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.130 
that's that's not important but but a
pound<00:01:37.650> or<00:01:37.860> now<00:01:38.040> which<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.460> doing<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.540> test<00:01:39.900> run

measurement IDO and here's a little

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.460 
measurement IDO and here's a little
rough<00:01:50.780> sample<00:01:51.530> of<00:01:51.650> how<00:01:51.770> this<00:01:52.010> tensioner<00:01:53.020> works

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
rough sample of how this tensioner works

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.700 
rough sample of how this tensioner works
take<00:01:55.040> me<00:01:55.930> please<00:01:56.930> sit<00:01:57.140> on<00:01:57.230> the<00:01:57.380> note<00:01:57.530> right
