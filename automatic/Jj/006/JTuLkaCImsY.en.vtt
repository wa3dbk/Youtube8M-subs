Matt Guf here for the House Board Shop. This
is the K2… Indy binding. This is a lightweight

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:18.470
workhorse freestyle binding that K2 has provided
for us. The Pro Fusion PC polycarbonate chassis

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:26.180
is going to stay lightweight. You cannot remove
or move the heel cup, but you can adjust everything

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:33.610
else on this. The adjustable toe ramps, or
power ramps, are tool-lessly adjustable. You

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.710
can take them off your board and adjust them
up or down, depending on if your foot decides

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.960
to grow and you need a new boot, you won’t
need new bindings. The EVA full-lined shock

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.110
absorbers will dampen the impact and absorb
a lot of negative energy that your board gets

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:58.200
from riding over choppy terrain. The asymmetrical
highback has a centered spine. It’s forgiving

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.399
on the lateral and the medial sides, so you’ll
be able to tweak your tricks out a little

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.890
bit. It does have a tool-less for lean adjustment
and it’s a gapless system, meaning that

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.270
you can take this highback and you can move
it back further into the heel cup if you need.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:23.049
The EVA calf pad is going to make you have
a smooth ride all day long. The caddy ankle-straps

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:32.330
are also EVA padding. Their nailwork and waist
offer great lateral and medial support. On

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:40.130
them, you also find the cam-lock system. This
is a tool-less system that adjusts your ankle-strap

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.189
to the center of your boot. The universal
toe-strap is a cored toe-strap. There’s

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.560
not much for tuning in here, meaning that
this binding is going to be even more lightweight

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:58.390
than you predicted. Again, it has the cam-lock
system as well. The aluminum ultra light speed

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:07.720
binding ratchets are going to be quick to
tighten and quick to loosen as well. The multi-compatible

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.060
discs that go on these also work well with
4- and 3-hole patterned bindings. Again, this

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.650
is a great Colorway. It’s K2 Indy binding,
lightweight, high performance-rock this thing

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.939
out.
