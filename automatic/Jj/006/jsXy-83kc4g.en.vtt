00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hey guys jumpin and today I am showing

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.519 
hey guys jumpin and today I am showing
you<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.820> jumper<00:00:03.270> tongue<00:00:03.510> don't<00:00:03.899> see<00:00:04.230> from<00:00:04.350> the

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
you the jumper tongue don't see from the

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.340 
you the jumper tongue don't see from the
coolant<00:00:04.859> exchange<00:00:05.250> mod<00:00:05.600> this<00:00:06.600> is<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.899> recipe

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
coolant exchange mod this is the recipe

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.680 
coolant exchange mod this is the recipe
it's<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.649> dark<00:00:07.919> matter<00:00:08.010> 5<00:00:08.490> diamonds<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:09.360> City

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
it's to dark matter 5 diamonds to City

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.209 
it's to dark matter 5 diamonds to City
and<00:00:09.870> this<00:00:09.990> makes<00:00:10.290> you<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.620> jumper<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.130> them

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
and this makes you the jumper to them

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.910 
and this makes you the jumper to them
density<00:00:11.700> if<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.509> just<00:00:12.690> get<00:00:12.840> out<00:00:13.080> here<00:00:13.349> you'll

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
density if I just get out here you'll

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.540 
density if I just get out here you'll
see<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.549> doesn't<00:00:15.509> do<00:00:16.020> much<00:00:16.289> talk<00:00:16.710> when

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
see that it doesn't do much talk when

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.580 
see that it doesn't do much talk when
just<00:00:18.000> sitting<00:00:18.330> there<00:00:18.510> if<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.840> grab<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> little

cobblestone up this chest you see it's

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.660 
cobblestone up this chest you see it's
not<00:00:21.600> doing<00:00:21.900> anything<00:00:22.289> at<00:00:22.439> all<00:00:22.650> if<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.490> press

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
not doing anything at all if I press

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.160 
not doing anything at all if I press

gene with this guy you'll see it'll

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.220 
gene with this guy you'll see it'll
start<00:00:25.260> sucking<00:00:26.039> up<00:00:26.130> all<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.310> cobblestone

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
start sucking up all the cobblestone

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.919 
start sucking up all the cobblestone
into<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.619> hidden<00:00:29.519> inventory<00:00:30.210> as<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.449> were<00:00:30.630> and

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
into a hidden inventory as it were and

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.510 
into a hidden inventory as it were and
then<00:00:31.529> as<00:00:31.679> soon<00:00:31.859> as<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.099> gets<00:00:32.219> enough

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
then as soon as it gets enough

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.959 
then as soon as it gets enough
cobblestone<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.270> convert<00:00:33.600> into<00:00:34.079> iron<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.340> will

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
cobblestone to convert into iron it will

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.020 
cobblestone to convert into iron it will
spew<00:00:36.300> out<00:00:36.390> an<00:00:36.600> iron<00:00:36.750> ingot<00:00:36.930> like<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.700> it's

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
spew out an iron ingot like that so it's

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.880 
spew out an iron ingot like that so it's
four<00:00:39.270> stacks<00:00:39.540> cobblestone<00:00:40.200> makes<00:00:40.440> nine<00:00:40.710> and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
four stacks cobblestone makes nine and

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.450 
four stacks cobblestone makes nine and
got<00:00:41.129> eight<00:00:41.370> ironing<00:00:41.940> dots<00:00:42.149> make<00:00:42.360> its<00:00:42.809> gold<00:00:43.460> for

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
got eight ironing dots make its gold for

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.660 
got eight ironing dots make its gold for
gold<00:00:44.730> ingots<00:00:45.180> make<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.780> diamond<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.950> it

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
gold ingots make a diamond so it is it

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.049 
gold ingots make a diamond so it is it
does<00:00:47.940> take<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.239> fair<00:00:48.660> amounts<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.820> stuff<00:00:50.820> to

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
does take a fair amounts of stuff to

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.660 
does take a fair amounts of stuff to
make<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.270> Ivan<00:00:51.690> out<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.980> big<00:00:53.340> change

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
make it Ivan out this and the big change

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.360 
make it Ivan out this and the big change
from<00:00:53.789> versions<00:00:54.239> four<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.600> five<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:56.280> a

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
from versions four and five is it's a

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.279 
from versions four and five is it's a
lot<00:00:56.520> slower<00:00:56.760> because<00:00:57.239> he<00:00:57.420> sees<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:58.170> know

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
lot slower because he sees you know

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.599 
lot slower because he sees you know
doing<00:00:58.559> each<00:00:58.680> stack<00:00:58.920> individual<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.460> this

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
doing each stack individual like this

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.459 
doing each stack individual like this
before<00:00:59.820> I'll<00:01:00.210> just<00:01:00.359> do<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.539> all<00:01:00.660> straight<00:01:01.199> away

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
before I'll just do it all straight away

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.000 
before I'll just do it all straight away
by<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.399> know<00:01:02.730> within<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.030> few<00:01:03.059> seconds<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.019> this

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
by you know within a few seconds so this

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.219 
by you know within a few seconds so this
is<00:01:05.189> particularly<00:01:05.820> useful<00:01:06.150> when<00:01:06.390> mining

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
is particularly useful when mining

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.810 
is particularly useful when mining
obviously<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.770> know<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.159> juices<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.640> bench

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
obviously you know the juices and bench

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.820 
obviously you know the juices and bench
problems<00:01:09.330> because<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.720> have<00:01:09.990> no<00:01:10.260> cobblestone

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
problems because you have no cobblestone

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.429 
problems because you have no cobblestone
in<00:01:11.070> your<00:01:11.189> inventory<00:01:12.020> but<00:01:13.020> what<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.320> also

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
in your inventory but what it's also

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.249 
in your inventory but what it's also
good<00:01:13.890> about<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.400> if<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.820> just<00:01:17.509> stop<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.750> now

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
good about is if I just stop this now

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.600 
good about is if I just stop this now
and<00:01:19.799> my<00:01:20.159> inventory<00:01:21.170> so<00:01:22.170> what<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.009> also<00:01:23.220> quite

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
and my inventory so what it's also quite

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.570 
and my inventory so what it's also quite
good<00:01:23.790> about<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.540> how<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.770> get<00:01:25.890> chests

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
good about it is how you get chests

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.410 
good about it is how you get chests
I'll<00:01:27.570> chemical<00:01:28.110> normal<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.610> activated

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
I'll chemical normal and it's activated

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.539 
I'll chemical normal and it's activated
you<00:01:31.229> put<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.860> will<00:01:31.920> suck<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.280> up<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.400> lot

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
you put it in it will suck it up a lot

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.200 
you put it in it will suck it up a lot
quicker<00:01:32.579> start<00:01:33.360> off<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:34.970> it<00:01:35.970> won't

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
quicker start off with and it won't

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.330 
quicker start off with and it won't
actually<00:01:36.420> spew<00:01:37.020> out<00:01:37.049> anything<00:01:37.409> until<00:01:37.920> it's

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
actually spew out anything until it's

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.910 
actually spew out anything until it's
got<00:01:38.520> all<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.509> coal<00:01:39.810> stone<00:01:40.110> there<00:01:40.380> or<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.799> can

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
got all the coal stone there or it can

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.130 
got all the coal stone there or it can
make<00:01:41.009> piece<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.400> gold<00:01:41.640> which<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.299> little<00:01:43.049> bit

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
make piece of gold which is a little bit

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.450 
make piece of gold which is a little bit
different<00:01:43.439> hard-working<00:01:43.950> your<00:01:44.070> inventory

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
different hard-working your inventory

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.139 
different hard-working your inventory
but<00:01:45.329> yeah<00:01:45.979> so<00:01:46.979> you'll<00:01:47.310> be<00:01:47.399> able<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.640> see<00:01:47.759> just

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
but yeah so you'll be able to see just

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.830 
but yeah so you'll be able to see just
how<00:01:48.360> much<00:01:48.540> you'll<00:01:48.780> make<00:01:49.140> from<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:50.540> whole<00:01:51.540> out

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
how much you'll make from a whole out

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.520 
how much you'll make from a whole out
chemical<00:01:52.320> chest<00:01:52.619> par<00:01:52.920> one<00:01:53.299> block<00:01:54.299> space<00:01:55.200> full

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
chemical chest par one block space full

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.730 
chemical chest par one block space full
of<00:01:55.560> cobblestone<00:01:56.630> so<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.439> also

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
of cobblestone so this is also

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.469 
of cobblestone so this is also
particularly<00:01:59.009> useful<00:01:59.219> if<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.850> have<00:01:59.909> an

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
particularly useful if you have an

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.560 
particularly useful if you have an
alchemical<00:02:00.990> bag<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:02.509> it<00:02:03.509> will<00:02:05.420> it<00:02:06.420> will

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
alchemical bag and it will it will

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.300 
alchemical bag and it will it will
obviously<00:02:06.869> condense<00:02:07.259> down<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.829> outcome<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.160> a

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
obviously condense down the outcome of a

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.309 
obviously condense down the outcome of a
bag<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.090> that's<00:02:09.239> also<00:02:09.450> useful<00:02:09.810> in<00:02:09.899> mining<00:02:10.229> it

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
bag so that's also useful in mining it

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.449 
bag so that's also useful in mining it
can<00:02:10.530> be<00:02:10.590> used<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:10.860> conjunction<00:02:10.950> with<00:02:11.370> the

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
can be used in conjunction with the

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.940 
can be used in conjunction with the
black<00:02:11.670> hole<00:02:11.940> bound<00:02:12.180> in<00:02:12.330> there<00:02:12.450> chemical

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
black hole bound in there chemical

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.979 
black hole bound in there chemical
bag<00:02:13.129> but<00:02:13.730> cold<00:02:13.970> bomb<00:02:14.090> will<00:02:14.239> suck<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.540> directly

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
bag but cold bomb will suck it directly

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.320 
bag but cold bomb will suck it directly
into<00:02:15.170> our<00:02:15.260> chemical<00:02:15.709> back<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.209> then<00:02:17.209> the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
into our chemical back and then the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.910 
into our chemical back and then the
German<00:02:17.629> term<00:02:17.780> density<00:02:18.319> will<00:02:18.440> just<00:02:18.590> condense

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
German term density will just condense

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.320 
German term density will just condense
it<00:02:19.069> down<00:02:19.099> so<00:02:19.489> you<00:02:19.550> basically<00:02:19.760> I<00:02:20.090> have<00:02:20.209> an

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
it down so you basically I have an

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.890 
it down so you basically I have an
Internet

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
Internet

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.990 
Internet
they<00:02:21.319> metric<00:02:21.769> she's<00:02:22.069> always<00:02:22.310> very<00:02:22.580> very

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
they metric she's always very very

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.970 
they metric she's always very very
useful<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:23.900> see<00:02:24.080> here<00:02:24.319> it<00:02:24.440> stopped<00:02:24.769> and

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
useful so you see here it stopped and

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.220 
useful so you see here it stopped and
let<00:02:25.069> these<00:02:25.280> threes<00:02:25.700> because<00:02:25.940> all<00:02:26.840> about

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
let these threes because all about

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.229 
let these threes because all about
cobblestone<00:02:27.860> was<00:02:28.340> enough<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.730> make<00:02:28.760> three

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
cobblestone was enough to make three

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.210 
cobblestone was enough to make three
Golding<00:02:29.690> dots<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.319> a<00:02:30.410> single<00:02:30.709> ironing<00:02:31.069> though

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
Golding dots and a single ironing though

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.860 
Golding dots and a single ironing though
however<00:02:31.760> doesn't<00:02:32.180> have<00:02:32.209> enough<00:02:32.599> to<00:02:32.750> make

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
however doesn't have enough to make

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.250 
however doesn't have enough to make
another<00:02:32.900> ironing<00:02:33.500> got<00:02:33.650> so<00:02:33.860> will<00:02:34.069> not<00:02:34.310> make<00:02:34.970> it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
another ironing got so will not make it

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.190 
another ironing got so will not make it
take<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:36.410> out<00:02:36.560> there<00:02:37.300> and<00:02:38.300> say<00:02:38.720> look<00:02:39.019> we've

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
take that out there and say look we've

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.809 
take that out there and say look we've
seen<00:02:39.380> nothing<00:02:39.769> else<00:02:39.950> came<00:02:40.190> out<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:40.489> it<00:02:40.640> so

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
seen nothing else came out of it so

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.039 
seen nothing else came out of it so
we'll<00:02:40.970> just<00:02:41.390> won't<00:02:41.959> take<00:02:42.410> it<00:02:42.470> at<00:02:42.709> all<00:02:42.910> so<00:02:44.049> the

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
we'll just won't take it at all so the

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.660 
we'll just won't take it at all so the
tables<00:02:45.620> have<00:02:45.739> changed<00:02:46.190> a<00:02:46.280> little<00:02:46.370> bit<00:02:46.610> since

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
tables have changed a little bit since

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.650 
tables have changed a little bit since
the<00:02:47.299> previous<00:02:47.510> version<00:02:48.200> of<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:49.370> mods<00:02:49.660> which

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
the previous version of the mods which

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.259 
the previous version of the mods which
means<00:02:51.410> it's<00:02:51.769> now<00:02:51.920> hard<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.340> share<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:52.670> diamond

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
means it's now hard a share a diamond

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.190 
means it's now hard a share a diamond
