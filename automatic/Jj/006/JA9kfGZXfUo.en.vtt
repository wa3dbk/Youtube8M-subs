00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
 hello today i want to do 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:08.820
 review on here are such soap nuts and 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:12.990
 bought from the site and only from the company data 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.849
 in from the level that's what I liked 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.789
 even in the package is the fact that even 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.800
 someone a little thing that stuck up the whole 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.039
 packing on paper ie minimum 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.439
 harm to the environment 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:30.689
 I was offered an average 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:33.600
 average sizes yes there for 160 times 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.420
 I started washing them only for 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.730
 washing now follows with them and 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.320
 many other things will show you so here 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.410
 here it was suggested that such 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.350
 small bag for washing machine 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.010
 which he is not yet wet not only 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.710
 that washed 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.300
 and here are the seeds here not after 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.399
 they don't wash soft they are empty inside 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.050
 because they have removed all the seeds 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.600
 so that they develop 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:06.270
 for different others how were calculated 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.000
 they must have if you buy seeds 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:15.090
 and also need to delete it will not throw 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:20.520
 shifts and that's such a big gift bag 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:25.320
 where are all the others started to tell 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.439
 about stratum washing is necessary 60 degrees 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.740
 of course you can and hi pirate urine and 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.960
 below, but first you need to lower them 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.590
 hot water with this bag of five 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.740
 minutes so they began to let out 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:53.340
 this mental different substance will 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:56.219
 Do you see that when they are soft balls 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.130
 It turns out not quite like 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.460
 soap substance 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:07.659
 they can i add 4 5 here such 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.300
 nuts this bag for 4 5 washes then 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.220

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:18.010

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.220
 Don must wash yana and mine

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.730
 I advise you to choose new yes nuts completely 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:39.660

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:43.560

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:48.780

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:54.480
 Of course there are some spots extra 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:59.109

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.599

 still wet but got it 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.170

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.569
 were such 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.690

 washing course you can do three at once 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.789
 a nutlet but I donâ€™t prefer after all 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:34.960
 do not every time but for a week 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:38.680
 I and my husband have a daughter will wash off completely 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:42.220
 hygiene and things so how would I keep 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:46.110

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.110

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.919
 leave it to cool and then I 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.100
 add essential oils by adding on 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:13.430
 pine 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:15.560
 and the thought is already winter and this oil is for me 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.430
 reminiscent of some Christmas stuff 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:23.030
 so I will delete add it 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:27.170
 whatever you want buttered but with 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:31.190
 condition that you wait for it to cool 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:34.910
 this substance and i prefer it all 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:37.760
 uses spray cans spray but when 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:40.040
