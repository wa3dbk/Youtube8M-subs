 little of what is in this case exo 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.350
 manowar before before starting yes 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.180
 I want to leave as well in clear Pablo in 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.970
 social networks have been doing a lot 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.370
 the comparison of exo manowar with a 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.070
 character there very very important of the 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.739
 marvel universe that is iron man like 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.140
 you see exo manowar is the character 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.079
 principal of a new universe that ends 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.850
 to be released recently with editorial 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.770
 bed and we're obviously talking about the 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.040
 valjean universe but exxon manowar has 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.960
 had the comparison with an ironman of 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.969
 marvel universe because it simply brings 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.260
 an armor and that is as cool as 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.020
 can see in 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.340
 on the covers of the exo manowar comic 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.590
 it's very very obviously very elaborate but 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.080
 you can see very clearly you can see very 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.780
 well then that this character has 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.280
 have a little bit of this roll of 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.409
 armor as we saw it at the time 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.649
 with iron man and that's the most father 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:28.670
 of examination place and now that I remember you 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:30.890
 you were present in the rather in 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.780
 is in this great press conference in 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.880
 this conference of the universe valjean 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.819
 to talk like that is the press conference is 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.420
 gave almost a year ago a year or so 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:43.729
 this change I present to you not only in your 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.159
 place but the entire universe Valiant 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.840
 which is let me tell you a universe very 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.509
 rich and does not ask anything what is desire 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.610
 marm and of course what would interest me 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.590
 horita would be after this year has 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.929
 gone the brave universe as exo 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.229
 manowar 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.670
 note that exo manowar is the esla is the 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.530
 main character as he was had 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.810
 commented and has had very good success 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.579
 even there has been rumored in networks 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.190
 social that soon they will be 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.230
 maybe an adaptation of all the 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.810
 characters from the universe go between 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.209
 them including shadow man archena 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.099
 teacher or how much buddy but good 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.170
 of that everything will talk to us a little more 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.049
 exo manowar and well good toño 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.500
 we explain why because it's not very 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:29.000
 similar to iron man good ironman and is a 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.849
 monotonous scientist and star that is a 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.239
 scientist himself this master plane of 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.549
 Tony Stark created his armor and ary 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.930
 Dacia is a Visigoth a warrior has 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.790
 warrior soul then when what 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.400
 kidnap he looks for the way to 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.560
 get away from the spaceship of the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.510
 vines which looks for a weapon 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.970
 find the armor that is called 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.549
 Jánjar to the toque and the armor he chooses 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.129
 to him as his owner then help 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.140
 of this armor escapes from the ship 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.629
 returns to earth but arrives from a 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.340
 wax past of like the year 500 in 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.960
 come back to our present 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.820
 now then when it arrives 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.170
 accuse of terrorists start it to 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.170
 attack and he just wants to defend 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.950
 that's cool because 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.870
 seem at the beginning of the history of 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.530
 done look if it helps me old in the in 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.200
 the cover on the first page well a 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.050
 timeline or a timeline that we 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.310
 shows how the origin of this 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:32.190
 character there are even some companions 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.290
 they commented that it looked like a class 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.480
 of history by the Visigoths and the 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.610
 Romans that in this case arich de dacia 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.170
 the main character is a Visigoth 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.630
 who is in this fight of the Romans 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.190
 who lost the battle and this armor 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.600
 that commented toño a while ago is of the 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.450
 extraterrestrials that come to earth and 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:55.110
 the same armor will ditch you choose it for 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.680
 be the bearer of this great power be it 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.780
 take to space return to earth and 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.970
 but he returns to the future that would be 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.550
 our present and where it is 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.230
 this great story ends what I 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.970
 I'm seeing right now is that contrary to 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.830
 the comics that we have already presented here 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.890
 seibert silent hill let's say that 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.090
 are a bit more negative atmosphere 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.139
 exxon manna juanes 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.930
 more action more let's say accessible to the 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.690
 people who are not so into this guy 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.850
 of media and you know what is the most father 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.940
 who are watching there on the cover 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.880
 there is the brand of a smartphone that 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.650
 if you can even distinguish arit 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.460
 dacia there begins to comment on the 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.460
 origin listen 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.300
 ah 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:57.460
 I do not know who I am 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.720
 there is more 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.720
 we go rudder 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:16.110
 lifetime 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.670
 that's cool because when haha 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.000
 when they showed us for the first time 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.650
 this cover variant in fact as 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.200
 can see here is here in the 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.670
 interiors comes another cover we know 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.100
 that the variants covers have a lot 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.780
 success in comics and when they chose 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.790
 the main cover this is another 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.650
 cover also when they chose this 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.480
 cover put out obviously all the 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.390
 world went by this one for the 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.190
 qr application that is cool and well 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.900
 value and remains being shows us a 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.850
 little of its origin even you 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.600
 you were present at that moment pablo 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:50.160
 presented for the first time but now 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.840
 already at this moment can not hear very 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.060
 well what I said clear that many people 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.530
 was very far from what coming back is 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.920
 that has a more or less speech 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.800
 similar to what it would be in exactly 300 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.380
 good human is a title that has to 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.810
 those visited in the Romans obviously 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:09.660
 there even there are many said that it was 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.610
 Leonidas of 300 but with the armor of 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.470
 iron man because as I said all the 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.030
 he is not a scientist 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.799
 did not create the armor in the armor what 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.119
 he chose him 

00:06:16.799 --> 00:06:21.159
 it must be mentioned that he is still a 

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:24.209
 warrior has the warrior soul then 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:27.279
 mixed with this technology of the future 

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:29.019
 alien then imagine in the story 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:30.789
 of the comic exoma place becomes of what 

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:33.369
 more father now yes that is the goal 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:35.379
 absolute and unattainable cosmic chida 

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:36.249
 that's father because it's not a comic 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:38.049
 anyone 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:39.699
 at the beginning maybe many will do 

00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:41.919
 these comparisons that already commented 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:44.709
 but all the brave universe I tell you 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:47.019
 he is fine father because if he has these 

00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:50.019
 nuances of mixing different universes 

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:52.119
 and later in the manowar nexus it 

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:54.669
 they start to start these crossover of 

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:57.129
 different characters and it becomes more 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:59.229
 well it becomes like a very very universe 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:01.629
 disímbolo and each character is having 

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:03.129
 his own stories is currently a 

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:04.989
 bad place here in mexico goes in the number 

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:06.369
 7 also published by editor since 

00:07:04.989 --> 00:07:08.559
 emits and it's a story that is 

00:07:06.369 --> 00:07:09.550
 leaving approximately every month and 

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:11.319
 half ok 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.839
 very good, I do not have more than 

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:15.399
 comment about your ward hand as already 

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:17.619
 I said at the beginning to me it seems like a 

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:19.479
 great story the chronicler mind I like 

00:07:17.619 --> 00:07:20.949
 I do not know if you have something else 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:22.770
 to add clear that if the networks 

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:25.160
 toño social 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:28.289
 facebook are not like me 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:31.860
 good on twitter is not found as a 

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:34.470
 I got 5 and 5 went down on youtube yours 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.090
 Youtube channel transmits TV there 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.490
 you can find find reviews and 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:41.550

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:43.289
 Finally, he also trains as 

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.909
 commented on the official youtube channel 

00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:47.699
 of camí because they are resonating there 

00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:50.340
 also the comics of the universe 

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:52.229
 valjean and soon there must be a 

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.789
 event that you are already involved in 

00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:55.250
 social networks there will be an event 

00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:57.659
 where editorial camí is going to be 

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:59.729
 present with more titles of the universe 

00:07:57.659 --> 00:08:03.240
 they are worth and above all with more stories of 

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:04.860
 exo manowar very well if they have some 

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.960

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.349
 part would be everything this time we
