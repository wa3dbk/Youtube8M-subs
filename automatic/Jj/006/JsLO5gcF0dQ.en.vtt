00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.200
 August 16, 2011 wargaming company 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.840
 announced a project of world of battleships 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.090
 similar to the world of tanks genre 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.759
 a little later, the game changed its name to 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.520
 world of warships but this is not the most 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.500
 requiring as it seems to me as then 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.560
 and now many are concerned about the degree of kinship 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.300
 new not yet released game with 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.510
 good old tanks 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.369
 My name is Mikhail Shvetsov and together we 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.070
 go through the main gameplay 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.250
 features of these two games and find out 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.430
 how similar and unlike ships are to 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.079
 world of tanks 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.629
 first of all I want to draw your attention 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.809
 on classes and so-called food 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.030
 chain in randomly speaking roughly in tanks 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.079
 there is a pattern confirmed by 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.920
 most fights 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.280
 light tanks nightmare tartu art does not give 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.890
 live quietly btbt in turn strongly 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.469
 straining heavy well and heavy duty waiting for the meeting 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.460
 with medium tanks to get 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.060
 light frag and medium tanks catch lt 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.610
 It seems no one has forgotten the food chain 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.189
 successfully completed in the same ships just 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.159
 4 classes of ships folding in 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.799
 food pyramid small and inconspicuous 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.960
 destroyers with serious torpedo 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.330
 weapons pose a danger to 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.390
 big and formidable but cumbersome 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.850
 battleships battleships same due to large 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.060
 caliber as well as serious combat capability 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.280
 can plunge the cruiser into the world of pain with 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.520
 being safe from yourself 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.250
 the distance of the cruiser is due to moderate 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.799
 maneuverability rate and accurate 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.950
 artillery main enemy of small destroyers 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.799
 and here thunderstorm aircraft of all kinds 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.500
 ships they have bombers for 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.049
 combat destroyers as well as torpedo bombers 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.969
 to fight the ships more but 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.219
 complete lack of artillery on 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.890
 aircraft carrier case is quiet with a fork on 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.950
 shot distances than all use 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.990
 the others besides are distinctive 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.090
 features of classes in ships not 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.510
 reduced only to the difference tth 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.670
 here each class has its own 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.620
 unique 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.020
 not which is key 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.360
 class feature 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.700
 destroyers release smoke and cruisers 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.950
 can provide covering fire for a 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.080
 battleships rebuild part 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.140
 combat effectiveness lost in case of fire or 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.330
 flooding as for the gameplay 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.880
 there is also a place for reflection 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.520
 total absence of bushes or others 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.600
 transparent obstacles at sea 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.880
 turns into a complete impossibility 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.180
 play hide and seek and sneak up 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.610
 damage from guns because the main rule 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.430
 sea ​​battles life in motion 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.040
 so for you harder to aim which means 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.489
 and you usually live longer in tanks 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.410
 on the contrary, successfully occupied position 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.709
 deprives us of the need to be movement 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.560
 Yes, and why when the enemies themselves come to 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.380
 us but not a single movement rich as 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.950
 says the difference of these games are hiding and 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.489
 deeper 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.400
 good example of the rule of battle where tank crews 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.730
 definition clinch is not an empty sound but for 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.920
 those who do not know explain the clinch fight 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.799
 two tanks on extremely small 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.109
 for a short time tank crews 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.989
 drive around making shots at vulnerable 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:29.200
 zones and then comes back closer 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.630
 waiting for reloading in the same key ships 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.670
 we will not allow not only armor-piercing 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.010
 shells at short distances have 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.410
 a big chance for a joint break through and without 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.019
 causing damage to explosive stuffing so 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.150
 more and vulnerable areas are large enough and 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.209
 at close range, aiming shooting 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.190
 according to them is a simple task because 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.140
 even after successful flooding 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.510
 enemy ship in the so-called 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.519
 clinch in our hands will be the ship 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.739
 disabled person deprived of the lion's share 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.680
 combat capability what would and 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:02.230
 the ability to be maybe you and I ask 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.140
 I will gladly answer you as this 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.079
 another difference ships and tanks for 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.389
 start worth mentioning that even the most 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:13.359
 large tank on the background of the battleship looks 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:16.000
 a little baby because this ship is not 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:18.459
 just war hands for thousands of sailors 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.430
 ships have been for a long time and the house 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.440
 There are kitchen bedrooms at home 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.880
 as well as many rooms which 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.880
 very indirectly reflected on 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.070
 combat effectiveness 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.250
 Rabble naturally after destruction 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.040
 the ship did not become a warehouse with mattresses 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.130
 less dangerous but there is also a reverse 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.260
 situation when after explosion only 1 art 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.930
 cellar ship completely lost 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.540
 the opportunity to enter a further battle is 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.790
 the specifics of the sea battle was implemented 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.090
 through the modular damage system in 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.770
 Each module has its own not related to 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.500
 the remaining number of lives and 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.990
 the amount of ship's combat capability is 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.960
 average damage at which 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.210
 the ship could still fight in the light of this 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.860
 features need to be taken as the fact that 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.410
 destruction of one module 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.200
 does damage to the ship however 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.760
 further shells hit 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.560
 destroyed module will no longer be 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.550
 do damage 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.010
 offensive information for lovers 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.920
 destroy enemy tanks only through 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.260
 one rink is also one of the gameplay 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.690
 features lies in the scale maps on 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.820
 which is a battle and maximum 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.310
 shooting distances given that 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.920
 speed of even the fastest ships 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.630
 relatively low movement 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.870
 the map takes a lot of time 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:38.270
 because during the same battle often change 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.400
 flank will not succeed physically from that 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.710
 tactical component of the ships 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.220
 much more than the tanks 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.990
 however, there is a downside 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.210
 combat action after the tank in the ships 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.430
 may not be enough especially if you 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.280
 decide to attack some 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:58.130
 especially safe way along the edge of the card 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.200
 other particularly striking differences between these two 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.870
 Games becomes mechanics perks crew 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.810
 and ship modifications unlike 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.760
 tanks with their linear pumping perks in 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.810
 ships implemented step by step training 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.630
 captain 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:14.210
 in total there are 5 steps filled 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.070
 different perks studying perks 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.470
 first step will require one point 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:22.040
 skill and here is learning perk second 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:24.380
 steps already two points and so on after 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.630
 studying berg immediately begins to act 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.440
 at full power they pumped 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.140
 gradually 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.900
 but accumulate five points and spend on 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.090
 the most expensive perks just won't work 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.490
 as each step after 1 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.650
 activated only after studying one 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.259
 skill previous 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:44.169
 steps all captain for his career 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:46.300
 can get 19 points perks what not 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:49.630
 enough to study all possible 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:52.120
 options we have to choose because in 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.250
 mechanics upgrades ship too 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.830
 major difference with tank upgrades 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.600
 slots for upgrades in ships 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.300
 is something like grouping 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.789
 modules in each group have 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.770
 several modules to choose from and modules 

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:07.500
 in gangs and are not repeated 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.270
 number of slots for upgrading 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.400
 grows with every level of the ship to 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.460
 The example above this level is just 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:18.850
 two slots for upgrades and on the ninth 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:21.699
 already 6 all told video is only 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:24.610
 tip of the iceberg of the differences of these two games 

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:27.669
 In fact, there are a lot of small nuances 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:30.490
 but don't take my word for it and play 

00:07:27.669 --> 00:07:33.160
 feel them yourself and I will 

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:35.710
 round out everyone thanks for watching 

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.930
 if you want to know more about 

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:40.419
 water warships subscribe to my 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.440
 channel link to it you can find in 

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:43.630
 video description 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.820
 and if you do not have a key to the game 

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:48.550
 try to win it in my group 

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:53.550
 or in my streams well, but for sure 

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.550
 all 7 feet under the keel and good luck to you
