00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.490 
since direction to see which is the the
closest<00:03:00.430> target<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.600> found<00:03:01.810> this<00:03:01.900> one<00:03:01.960> this

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
closest target and I found this one this

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.190 
closest target and I found this one this
guy<00:03:02.740> you<00:03:02.800> know<00:03:06.090> they<00:03:07.090> were<00:03:07.150> all<00:03:07.510> yours
