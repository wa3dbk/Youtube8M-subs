00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
might have seemed a little bit easier

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.630 
might have seemed a little bit easier
going<00:03:08.500> through<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.010> playoffs<00:03:09.220> than<00:03:09.519> it

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
going through the playoffs than it

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.160 
going through the playoffs than it
actually<00:03:09.760> became<00:03:10.299> once<00:03:10.569> you<00:03:10.660> guys<00:03:10.810> got<00:03:10.989> to<00:03:11.110> the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
actually became once you guys got to the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.050 
actually became once you guys got to the
finals<00:03:11.560> since<00:03:12.010> comparative<00:03:12.700> what<00:03:12.819> you<00:03:12.940> guys

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
finals since comparative what you guys

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.240 
finals since comparative what you guys
went<00:03:13.360> through<00:03:13.510> with<00:03:14.500> so<00:03:14.680> much<00:03:14.799> more<00:03:15.040> ease<00:03:15.220> than

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
went through with so much more ease than

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.610 
went through with so much more ease than
you<00:03:15.580> found<00:03:15.730> against<00:03:16.030> Boston<00:03:16.510> I<00:03:18.930> think<00:03:19.930> the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
you found against Boston I think the

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.160 
you found against Boston I think the
whole<00:03:20.799> experience<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:22.330> playoffs<00:03:22.720> was<00:03:22.900> a<00:03:22.930> good

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
whole experience the playoffs was a good

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.990 
whole experience the playoffs was a good
experience<00:03:23.470> for<00:03:23.709> everybody

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.060 
experience for everybody
some<00:03:25.600> of<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.810> guys<00:03:25.990> has<00:03:26.320> been<00:03:26.350> here<00:03:26.800> for<00:03:26.830> a

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
some of the guys has been here for a

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.270 
some of the guys has been here for a
long<00:03:27.220> time<00:03:27.490> they've<00:03:27.730> been<00:03:28.590> today<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:30.190> the

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
long time they've been today to the

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.340 
long time they've been today to the
finals<00:03:30.730> whatever<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.480> guys<00:03:31.660> that<00:03:31.990> hadn't

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
round of the playoffs and I don't think

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.840 
round of the playoffs and I don't think
ever<00:03:37.450> got<00:03:37.690> out<00:03:37.720> so<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:39.250> experience<00:03:39.760> for

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
ever got out so the experience for

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.940 
ever got out so the experience for
everybody<00:03:40.120> was<00:03:40.480> a<00:03:40.510> great<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:41.200> I<00:03:41.470> think<00:03:41.590> we<00:03:41.920> all

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
everybody was a great and I think we all

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.980 
everybody was a great and I think we all
learned<00:03:42.160> from<00:03:42.610> where<00:03:43.330> we<00:03:43.450> were<00:03:43.480> playing<00:03:43.810> at

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
learned from where we were playing at

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.490 
learned from where we were playing at
not<00:03:44.170> playing<00:03:44.470> I<00:03:44.590> think<00:03:44.800> we<00:03:44.920> all<00:03:44.950> know<00:03:46.500> watching

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
not playing I think we all know watching

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.830

the<00:06:04.419> ball<00:06:04.599> issue<00:06:05.530> the<00:06:05.860> ball<00:06:06.069> I<00:06:06.370> don't<00:06:07.240> think<00:06:07.509> I

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
the ball issue the ball I don't think I

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.730 
the ball issue the ball I don't think I
think<00:06:08.770> I<00:06:09.240> can<00:06:10.240> really<00:06:10.509> be<00:06:10.659> good<00:06:10.900> in<00:06:11.050> that<00:06:11.199> area

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
think I can really be good in that area

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.659 
think I can really be good in that area
especially<00:06:12.370> if<00:06:12.789> I<00:06:12.940> dedicate<00:06:13.830> all<00:06:14.830> my<00:06:14.889> time<00:06:15.400> to

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:15.669 
especially if I dedicate all my time to

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.779 
especially if I dedicate all my time to
it<00:06:15.819> and<00:06:16.080> I<00:06:17.080> think<00:06:17.680> that's<00:06:18.099> what<00:06:18.280> I'm<00:06:18.430> gonna

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:18.789 
it and I think that's what I'm gonna

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:21.480 
it and I think that's what I'm gonna
probably<00:06:19.479> do<00:06:19.690> the<00:06:19.810> most<00:06:20.020> and<00:06:20.620> get<00:06:21.190> a<00:06:21.219> little

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
probably do the most and get a little

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.950 
probably do the most and get a little
stronger<00:06:21.669> I<00:06:22.060> think<00:06:22.629> that'll<00:06:22.990> help<00:06:24.960> weary

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
stronger I think that'll help weary

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.450 
stronger I think that'll help weary
