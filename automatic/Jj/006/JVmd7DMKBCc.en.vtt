00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
in the field for five days because of

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.880 
in the field for five days because of
rain<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.570> get<00:01:15.689> back<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.530> want<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.799> go

Road<00:01:17.070> down<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> road<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.729> got<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> guys<00:01:18.119> half

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
Road down the road you got the guys half

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.080 
Road down the road you got the guys half
speed<00:01:18.750> for<00:01:19.170> maybe<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.920> half<00:01:20.189> hour<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.909> because

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
speed for maybe a half hour just because

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.270 
speed for maybe a half hour just because
you<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.659> stand<00:01:21.960> right<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> combine<00:01:23.159> it

you can stand right in the combine it

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.899 
you can stand right in the combine it
was<00:01:23.369> too<00:01:23.520> bouncy<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:25.290> they<00:01:26.220> decided<00:01:26.729> to

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
was too bouncy and so they decided to

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.600 
was too bouncy and so they decided to
put<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.360> bigger<00:01:27.600> wheel<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.259> left<00:01:29.040> side<00:01:29.280> wall

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
put a bigger wheel in it left side wall

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.800 
put a bigger wheel in it left side wall
and<00:01:30.259> more<00:01:31.259> carrying<00:01:31.619> capacity<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.570> we

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
and more carrying capacity and so we

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.420 
and more carrying capacity and so we
kind<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.079> come<00:01:34.229> up<00:01:34.259> with<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.680> tire<00:01:34.979> now<00:01:35.369> we

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
kind of come up with this tire now we

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.910 
kind of come up with this tire now we
rode<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> lot<00:01:36.090> maybe<00:01:36.540> not<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> lot<00:01:37.020> but<00:01:37.259> Oh<00:01:37.470> quite

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
rode a lot maybe not a lot but Oh quite

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.340 
rode a lot maybe not a lot but Oh quite
a<00:01:37.950> bit<00:01:38.220> I'd<00:01:39.150> say<00:01:39.329> if<00:01:39.420> we're<00:01:39.570> gonna<00:01:39.720> move<00:01:39.900> 50

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
a bit I'd say if we're gonna move 50

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.950 
a bit I'd say if we're gonna move 50
miles<00:01:40.560> 60<00:01:41.310> miles<00:01:41.520> we<00:01:42.150> just<00:01:42.360> rode<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.659> combo

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
miles 60 miles we just rode the combo

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.480 
miles 60 miles we just rode the combo
maybe<00:01:43.200> even<00:01:43.500> if<00:01:43.560> we're<00:01:43.710> gonna<00:01:43.860> go<00:01:44.009> 80<00:01:44.189> miles

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
maybe even if we're gonna go 80 miles

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.039 
maybe even if we're gonna go 80 miles
we'll<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:44.939> wrote<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.299> now<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.630> difference

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
we'll just wrote it now the difference

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.690 
we'll just wrote it now the difference
between<00:01:46.079> probably<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.189> duals<00:01:47.399> I

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
between probably this and the duals I

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.219 
between probably this and the duals I
would<00:01:47.850> say<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.570> can<00:01:48.689> lower<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.049> air<00:01:49.200> pressure

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
would say you can lower the air pressure

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.920 
would say you can lower the air pressure
on<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:49.979> still<00:01:50.399> run<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.149> it'll<00:01:51.720> give

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
on it and still run it and it'll give

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.139 
on it and still run it and it'll give
you<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> nice<00:01:52.380> soft<00:01:52.649> ride<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.399> any<00:01:53.909> other

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
you a nice soft ride just like any other

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.539 
you a nice soft ride just like any other
accountant<00:01:54.659> buying<00:01:54.869> well<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.350> would<00:01:55.680> say<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
accountant buying well I would say the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.899 
accountant buying well I would say the
tires<00:01:56.820> they<00:01:57.750> would<00:01:57.899> have<00:01:58.020> anywhere<00:01:58.530> from

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
tires they would have anywhere from

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.950 
tires they would have anywhere from

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.050 
1,000 to 1,200 hours on these tires and
they<00:02:03.960> look<00:02:04.649> totally<00:02:04.920> fine<00:02:05.310> sidewalls

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
they look totally fine sidewalls

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.540 
they look totally fine sidewalls
everything<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.689> good<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:07.079> it

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
everything is good on it

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.640 
everything is good on it
you<00:02:08.910> know<00:02:09.030> once<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.480> freezes<00:02:09.750> those<00:02:10.380> corn

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
you know once it freezes those corn

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.410 
you know once it freezes those corn
stalks<00:02:10.980> get<00:02:11.250> about<00:02:11.430> like<00:02:11.610> broom<00:02:11.940> handles

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
stalks get about like broom handles

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.750 
stalks get about like broom handles
they're<00:02:13.080> really<00:02:13.410> hard<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:14.070> that's<00:02:14.550> usually

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
they're really hard and that's usually

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.390 
they're really hard and that's usually
when<00:02:15.240> we<00:02:16.020> start<00:02:16.380> running<00:02:16.590> corn<00:02:17.070> stocks

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
when we start running corn stocks

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.450 
when we start running corn stocks
through<00:02:17.640> tires<00:02:18.000> if<00:02:18.870> it's<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.100> wintertime

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
through tires if it's in the wintertime

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.400 
through tires if it's in the wintertime
or<00:02:20.730> in<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.290> late<00:02:22.290> fall<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:23.630> we<00:02:24.630> had<00:02:24.870> four<00:02:25.230> of

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
or in the late fall and we had four of

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.920 
or in the late fall and we had four of
these<00:02:25.500> running<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.280> never<00:02:26.570> never<00:02:27.570> had<00:02:27.780> any

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
these running and never never had any

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.160 
these running and never never had any
issues<00:02:28.380> so<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.590> seemed<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.250> be<00:02:29.370> really<00:02:29.580> good

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
issues so that seemed to be really good

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.070 
issues so that seemed to be really good
if<00:02:31.170> in<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.560> past<00:02:31.800> they<00:02:32.310> had<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:33.180> combine<00:02:33.810> that

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
if in the past they had a combine that

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.810 
if in the past they had a combine that
they<00:02:34.380> thought<00:02:34.620> hopped<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.190> lot<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.640> thought

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
they thought hopped a lot and I thought

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.700 
they thought hopped a lot and I thought
it<00:02:35.970> was<00:02:36.120> because<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:37.020> tires<00:02:37.290> that

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
it was because of the tires that

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.060 
it was because of the tires that
probably<00:02:38.460> right<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:38.820> probably<00:02:38.850> was<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:40.070> if

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
probably right it probably was and if

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.170 
probably right it probably was and if
they<00:02:41.220> put<00:02:41.400> these<00:02:41.610> on

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
they put these on

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.930 
they put these on
it<00:02:42.870> won't<00:02:43.170> do<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.530> it'll<00:02:43.680> stop<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.310> we<00:02:44.580> have<00:02:44.790> it

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
it won't do it it'll stop it we have it

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.210 
it won't do it it'll stop it we have it
on<00:02:45.060> two<00:02:45.300> count<00:02:45.570> lines<00:02:45.840> we've<00:02:46.710> run<00:02:46.920> them<00:02:47.040> two
