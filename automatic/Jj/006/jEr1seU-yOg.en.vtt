00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.189 

gotta<00:00:29.550> ask<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.820> question<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.599> while<00:00:30.869> ago<00:00:30.960> too

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
gotta ask the question a while ago too

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.770 
gotta ask the question a while ago too
so<00:00:31.560> i<00:00:31.590> thought<00:00:31.830> i'd<00:00:31.980> answer<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.489> part<00:00:32.790> why

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
so i thought i'd answer it this part why

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.700 
so i thought i'd answer it this part why
do<00:00:33.840> i<00:00:34.050> put<00:00:34.440> three<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.070> front<00:00:35.430> instead<00:00:36.420> of

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
do i put three in front instead of

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.869 
do i put three in front instead of
instead<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.829> behind<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.579> front<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
instead of behind or in front the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.790 
instead of behind or in front the
reverse<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.989> because<00:00:40.260> if<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:40.620> that

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
reverse that is because if you do that

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.619 
reverse that is because if you do that
to<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> reverse<00:00:41.399> it'll<00:00:41.790> scratch<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.329> reverse

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
to the reverse it'll scratch the reverse

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.360 
to the reverse it'll scratch the reverse
it<00:00:43.140> doesn't<00:00:43.410> happen<00:00:43.500> all<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.710> time<00:00:43.829> but<00:00:44.010> if

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
it doesn't happen all the time but if

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.119 
it doesn't happen all the time but if
you're<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> mint<00:00:44.850> guy<00:00:45.090> like<00:00:45.329> me<00:00:45.559> you<00:00:46.559> want<00:00:46.860> your

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
you're a mint guy like me you want your

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.889 
you're a mint guy like me you want your
card<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.789> actively<00:00:48.210> mint<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.780> don't

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
card to be actively mint and you don't

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.600 
card to be actively mint and you don't
want<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.110> take<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> chance<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.800> scratching<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
want to take a chance of scratching the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.160 
want to take a chance of scratching the
reverse<00:00:50.940> because<00:00:51.719> when<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:51.989> do<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:54.020> you<00:00:55.020> can

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
reverse because when you do that you can

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.080 
reverse because when you do that you can
kind<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.440> hear<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.829> noise<00:00:56.010> these<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:57.030> have

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
kind of hear the noise these do have

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.330 
kind of hear the noise these do have
edges<00:00:57.660> they're<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.620> always<00:00:58.800> printed

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
edges they're not always printed

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.549 
edges they're not always printed
correctly<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.879> they<00:00:59.969> will<00:01:00.120> scratch

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
correctly and they will scratch

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.599 
correctly and they will scratch
especially<00:01:01.559> vs.<00:01:01.949> if<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.190> guys<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.520> ever
