00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:05.779
With Daredevil out now, let’s take a look
at 15 things you probably didn’t know about

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.269
Marvel’s TV series about a blind lawyer
who’s also a masked vigilante.

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.270
When Chief Creative Officer of Marvel Entertainment,
Joe Quesada saw Charlie Cox on crime drama

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.990
Boardwalk Empire, he knew he’d found the
perfect actor to play Matt Murdock, and he

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.800
rang Marvel’s Head of TV, Jeph Loeb, to
tell him just that.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.869
At that point, the on-screen rights to Daredevil
were still owned by Fox.

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.210
It was roughly two years later that those
rights reverted to Marvel Studios in late

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.760
2012!

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.079
When Charlie Cox first auditioned for Daredevil
in New York, the mock scenes he read weren’t

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.570
from the actual script, and his character’s
name was Alex Everett, not Matt Murdock.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.109
The name Alex Everett was perhaps a nod to
Daredevil co-creator Bill Everett, and to

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.640
one of Daredevil’s comic book artists, Alex
Maleev.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.390
Of course, Cox wasn’t the only actor up
for the role. In fact, later when he had a

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.220
Skype meeting with the show’s exec producer
Jeph Loeb, he could actually see photos on

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.100
the wall behind Loeb of other actors who were
up for consideration! However, according to

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.450
Cox, he couldn’t quite make out their faces!

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.860
The comic book version of Wilson Fisk, aka
Kingpin, is bald, 6 foot 7 inches tall, and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.240
weighs 450 pounds.
So, Vincent D’Onofrio, who’s 6 foot 3

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.259
inches tall, shaved his head and gained 30
pounds to play him, taking his total weight

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.140
to about 280 pounds.
Of course, this isn’t the first time D’Onofrio’s

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.070
gained considerable weight or shaved his head
for a role.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.299
To play Private Leonard Lawrence in Stanley
Kubrick’s war film Full Metal Jacket, D’Onofrio

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.520
shaved his head and gained nearly 70 pounds.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.450
In addition to the show’s scripts, D’Onofrio
found inspiration for his portrayal of Fisk

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.770
in the work of Daredevil comic book artists
and writers David Mack, Bill Sienkiewicz,

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.619
and Frank Miller.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:07.110
At the end of Charlie Cox’s first day on
the Daredevil set, Joe Quesada gave the actor

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.020
some of his artwork as a welcoming present.
The work was page 1 issue 1 of the mini-series

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.020
Daredevil: Father, which was both written
and illustrated by Quesada.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.240
And it was actually one of the few pages Quesada
had kept from that series.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.820
Elden Henson, who plays Matt Murdock’s best
friend Foggy Nelson, auditioned for Daredevil

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.990
via Skype while he was in Berlin filming The
Hunger Games: Mockingjay.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.190
According to Henson, the audition was a bit
of a nightmare as he couldn’t get Skype

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.070
to work on his laptop, and when he tried to
Skype on his phone, there were problems with

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.790
the sound and people kept calling him!
Straight after finishing Mockingjay in Germany,

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.150
Henson travelled back to LA where his son
was born the next day, and he arrived in New

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.010
York less than two weeks later to start work
on Daredevil.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.460
Deborah Ann Woll had less than 48 hours between
wrapping the last episode of vampire drama

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.300
True Blood and her first day filming Daredevil.
Woll, who plays client-turned-secretary Karen

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.780
Page in the Marvel series, says the short
turnaround helped take her mind off the sadness

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.710
of True Blood ending.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.490
Playing Karen Page in Daredevil had a special,
personal connection for Deborah Ann Woll,

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.470
as her real-life boyfriend EJ Scott suffers
from Choroideremia, a rare inherited degenerative

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.290
disease that leads to blindness.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.700
Writer Frank Miller and artist John Romita
Jr’s 1993 Daredevil comic book mini-series,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.680
The Man Without Fear, was a big influence
on Marvel’s Daredevil show.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.970
An example of that can be seen in the black
ninja costume Daredevil wears in the series.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.610
Costume designer Stephanie Maslansky wanted
the costume to be as grounded and authentic

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.980
as possible, and said, “It needed to be
made of things that anyone could buy on the

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.830
street, on the Internet or in an army-navy
store. We wanted something that looked militaristic

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.240
and functional, but also dramatic and […] bad-ass.”

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.370
Before he joined the show, Charlie Cox wasn’t
familiar with the Daredevil comics.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.470
In fact, the only comics he read when he was
growing up in the UK were The Beano and The

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.090
Dandy!
But once cast, he spent a lot of time reading

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.729
the Daredevil comics and, because of the tone
of Marvel’s TV series, he found the work

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.190
of writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist
Alex Maleev particularly useful.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.840
Cox has said that if he could choose any supervillains
to appear in future seasons of the show, he’d

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.280
love to see Stilt-Man and the Jester; and he’d
also like to see his character fight crime

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.510
alongside Black Widow.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.310
Although Daredevil is set in modern-day Hell’s
Kitchen, the show’s creative team wanted

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.750
their version of the New York neighbourhood
to be more like the grittier place seen in

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.850
the comic books, and less like the gentrified
location it is now in reality.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:53.060
So, executive producer Drew Goddard came up
with the idea that, in Daredevil, New York

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.910
City is still dealing with the aftermath of
the Battle of New York that took place in

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.530
the first Avengers movie.
And that’s why, in the show, Hell’s Kitchen

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.260
has been partly destroyed and is being rebuilt,
a plot point which brings Marvel’s big-screen

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.500
and small-screen worlds together.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.820
Charlie Cox had about a month to prepare before
shooting Daredevil.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.370
Part of his prep included hitting the gym
to bulk up and gain muscle so he could look

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.940
and act the part.
Cox also worked with his stunt double Chris

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.070
Brewster and the show’s stunt co-ordinator
Philip J Silvera on martial arts and boxing

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.430
techniques including kicks, punches, and poses.
According to Cox, filming the stunt scenes

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.700
was one of his favourite parts of the show,
and he was keen to do as much of it himself

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.860
as possible.
To help Cox master the routines he was allowed

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.250
to do, the fight sequences were broken down
into sets of 6 to 10 moves at a time, which

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.340
the actor usually learned on the day of filming.
Cox’s stunt double Chris Brewster has said

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.760
that the action in Daredevil surpasses any
TV show or film he’s worked on, which is

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.980
quite something because while big action movies
may shoot for many months, Daredevil filmed

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.330
each episode in nine days.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:07.280
To further prepare for the show, Cox also
worked with Joe Strechay, who’s blind and

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.110
works at the American Foundation for the Blind
where he helps prepare visually impaired people

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.320
for employment.
During his time with Strechay, Cox learned

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.600
how to use a white cane and navigate busy
sidewalks while wearing a blindfold.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:25.100
And he also learned how a blind person would
find objects on a table by feeling for them.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.639
In fact, locating an object without using
his eyesight was something Cox found quite

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.950
difficult during filming, which meant quite
a few retakes to get it right!

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:39.800
To find out how his eyes should appear when
he takes off his glasses or mask, Cox filmed

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.650
some of his conversations with Strechay.
By filming him, Cox noticed how Strechay’s

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.380
eyes were often directed towards the mouth
of whoever was speaking.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.020
So, Cox did the same with Matt Murdock in
Daredevil.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.490
The creative team behind Daredevil approached
the series as a crime drama first, and a superhero

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.180
show second.
With that in mind, they took inspiration from

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.460
HBO crime drama The Wire as well as 1970s
American movies including William Friedkin’s

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.950
The French Connection, Sidney Lumet’s Dog
Day Afternoon, Francis Ford Coppola’s The

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.919
Conversation, and Martin Scorsese’s Taxi
Driver.

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:19.669
Well there you have it, 15 things you probably
