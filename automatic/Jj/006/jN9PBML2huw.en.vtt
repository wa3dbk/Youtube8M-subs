was definitely and they definitely are
very<00:01:09.729> impressive<00:01:13.240> if<00:01:14.240> you<00:01:14.930> also<00:01:15.140> have<00:01:15.440> to<00:01:15.590> look

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
very impressive if you also have to look

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.510 
very impressive if you also have to look
on<00:01:16.070> this<00:01:16.840> for<00:01:17.840> certain<00:01:18.080> bedding<00:01:18.740> it<00:01:19.100> does<00:01:19.369> not

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
on this for certain bedding it does not

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.910 
on this for certain bedding it does not
work<00:01:21.009> like<00:01:22.009> if<00:01:22.310> you<00:01:23.090> have<00:01:23.240> newspaper<00:01:23.810> or<00:01:24.649> if

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
work like if you have newspaper or if

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.200 
work like if you have newspaper or if
you<00:01:25.040> just<00:01:25.100> have<00:01:25.310> nothing<00:01:25.610> on<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:25.910> bottom<00:01:26.149> of

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
you just have nothing on the bottom of

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.240 
you just have nothing on the bottom of
the<00:01:26.300> case<00:01:26.479> it's<00:01:26.720> not<00:01:26.960> really<00:01:27.259> good<00:01:27.470> you<00:01:28.070> might

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
the case it's not really good you might

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.240 
the case it's not really good you might
be<00:01:28.430> you<00:01:28.640> might<00:01:29.060> burn<00:01:29.390> a<00:01:29.780> lizard<00:01:30.200> or<00:01:30.410> if<00:01:31.100> you

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
be you might burn a lizard or if you

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.650 
be you might burn a lizard or if you
have<00:01:31.369> a<00:01:31.399> carpet<00:01:31.700> on<00:01:31.910> their<00:01:32.119> carpet<00:01:32.539> would

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
have a carpet on their carpet would

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.920 
have a carpet on their carpet would
would<00:01:32.960> work<00:01:33.200> because<00:01:34.750> essentially<00:01:35.750> just

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
would work because essentially just

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.270 
would work because essentially just
works<00:01:36.170> through<00:01:36.470> other<00:01:36.619> beddings<00:01:37.039> like

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
works through other beddings like

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.570 
works through other beddings like
different<00:01:38.270> wedding<00:01:38.600> weddings<00:01:38.990> or<00:01:39.289> jungle<00:01:39.830> any

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
different wedding weddings or jungle any

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.550 
different wedding weddings or jungle any
type<00:01:40.850> of<00:01:40.880> like<00:01:41.240> soil<00:01:41.780> mix<00:01:42.140> or<00:01:42.320> anything<00:01:44.170> it<00:01:45.170> may

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
type of like soil mix or anything it may

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.169 
type of like soil mix or anything it may
take<00:01:45.920> more<00:01:46.130> time<00:01:46.190> to<00:01:46.759> heat<00:01:47.060> it<00:01:47.600> still<00:01:47.990> works<00:01:48.259> so

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
take more time to heat it still works so

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.120 
take more time to heat it still works so
let's<00:01:50.179> just<00:01:50.450> take<00:01:50.569> a<00:01:50.630> look<00:01:50.899> a<00:01:51.080> kind<00:01:51.679> of<00:01:51.830> what<00:01:52.009> it

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
let's just take a look a kind of what it

deep especially with water it takes a

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.310 
deep especially with water it takes a
