how's going guys Lucy your wolf graphing

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.320 
how's going guys Lucy your wolf graphing
today<00:00:11.250> I'm<00:00:11.309> bringing<00:00:11.460> you<00:00:11.610> guys<00:00:11.730> another<00:00:12.030> mod

today I'm bringing you guys another mod

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.709 
today I'm bringing you guys another mod
showcase<00:00:12.780> this<00:00:12.960> one<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:14.150> plasma<00:00:15.150> mount

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
showcase this one is the plasma mount

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.220 
showcase this one is the plasma mount
with<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.929> Z<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.590> um<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:18.210> whole<00:00:18.449> mod<00:00:18.990> is

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
with the Z and um the whole mod is

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.990 
with the Z and um the whole mod is
pretty<00:00:19.410> much<00:00:19.500> based<00:00:19.770> off<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> new<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.760> get

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
pretty much based off a new and get

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.810 
pretty much based off a new and get
called<00:00:21.449> plasma<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.830> get<00:00:22.980> one<00:00:23.220> plasma<00:00:23.640> by

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
called plasma you get one plasma by

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.670 
called plasma you get one plasma by
smelting<00:00:24.300> one<00:00:24.449> end<00:00:24.600> stone<00:00:24.840> oh<00:00:25.140> not<00:00:25.590> really

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
smelting one end stone oh not really

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.370 
smelting one end stone oh not really
smelting<00:00:26.189> just<00:00:26.420> putting<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.990> crafting

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
smelting just putting it in a crafting

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.650 
smelting just putting it in a crafting
table<00:00:28.529> like<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.340> it's<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.330> doesn't<00:00:30.570> really

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
table like this it's it doesn't really

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.060 
table like this it's it doesn't really
matter<00:00:30.869> how<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.260> put<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.650> put<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.890> like<00:00:31.920> to

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
matter how you put it I put it like to

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.400 
matter how you put it I put it like to
put<00:00:32.219> here<00:00:32.540> plasma<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.750> then<00:00:34.079> you'll<00:00:34.230> get<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
put here plasma and then you'll get the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.250 
put here plasma and then you'll get the
bucket<00:00:34.649> back<00:00:34.770> as<00:00:34.890> well<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.870> yeah<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.110> got<00:00:37.230> one

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
bucket back as well so yeah you got one

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.830 
bucket back as well so yeah you got one
plasma<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.940> use<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> plasma<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.510> make<00:00:39.660> all

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
plasma and use the plasma to make all

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.080 
plasma and use the plasma to make all
this<00:00:40.020> just<00:00:40.860> like<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.160> normally<00:00:41.309> would<00:00:41.790> but

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
this just like you normally would but

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.360 
this just like you normally would but
with<00:00:42.600> all<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> tools<00:00:43.250> instead<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.340> using<00:00:44.579> um

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
with all the tools instead of using um

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.700 
with all the tools instead of using um
almost<00:00:47.370> like<00:00:47.789> sticks<00:00:48.360> you're<00:00:49.110> gonna<00:00:49.260> use<00:00:49.530> an

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
almost like sticks you're gonna use an

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.250 
almost like sticks you're gonna use an
iron<00:00:50.160> stick<00:00:50.820> what<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.120> get<00:00:51.270> from<00:00:51.390> putting

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
iron stick what you get from putting

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.889 
iron stick what you get from putting
this<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.620> crafting<00:00:53.070> bench<00:00:53.879> once<00:00:54.660> melted

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
this in the crafting bench once melted

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.170 
this in the crafting bench once melted
one<00:00:55.289> stick<00:00:55.590> another<00:00:55.739> smelt<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.460> just<00:00:57.120> like

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
one stick another smelt in just like

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.849 
one stick another smelt in just like
that<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.629> then<00:00:57.840> they'll<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.739> can

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
that and then they'll get that you can

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.319 
that and then they'll get that you can
make<00:00:58.949> plasma<00:00:59.280> blocks<00:00:59.520> by<00:00:59.760> putting<00:01:00.059> nine

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
make plasma blocks by putting nine

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.869 
make plasma blocks by putting nine
things<00:01:01.230> obviously<00:01:01.800> around<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:02.760> that's

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
things obviously around but that's

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.549 
things obviously around but that's
probably<00:01:02.969> easiest<00:01:03.420> thing<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.570> make<00:01:03.780> one

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
probably easiest thing to make one

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.990 
probably easiest thing to make one
plasma<00:01:04.890> arrow<00:01:05.070> I'm<00:01:05.339> not<00:01:05.489> sure<00:01:05.640> how<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.909> make

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
plasma arrow I'm not sure how to make

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.490 
plasma arrow I'm not sure how to make
that<00:01:06.360> because<00:01:06.600> there<00:01:06.720> was<00:01:06.780> no<00:01:06.869> prep<00:01:07.350> and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
that because there was no prep and

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.469 
that because there was no prep and
recipe<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.920> forum<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.430> I'll<00:01:09.240> show<00:01:09.420> you

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
recipe on the forum and I'll show you

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.620 
recipe on the forum and I'll show you
that<00:01:09.659> last<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.880> okay<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.210> first<00:01:12.420> we're<00:01:12.540> gonna

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
that last and okay so first we're gonna

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.240 
that last and okay so first we're gonna
happen<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.500> we're<00:01:13.710> gonna<00:01:13.799> get<00:01:13.950> all<00:01:14.100> this

happen to this we're gonna get all this
and<00:01:14.460> another<00:01:14.939> thing<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.270> bow<00:01:15.540> as<00:01:15.840> well

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
and another thing with the bow as well

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.960 
and another thing with the bow as well
is<00:01:17.659> with<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> bow<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.490> make<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.850> you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
is with the bow you can to make it you

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.700 
is with the bow you can to make it you
need<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.180> instead<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.930> having<00:01:24.619> sorry<00:01:25.619> I'm

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
need a instead of having sorry I'm

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.570 
need a instead of having sorry I'm
paying<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.159> anyway

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
paying for it anyway

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.010 
paying for it anyway
instead<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.060> having<00:01:27.150> sticks<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.659> use<00:01:27.810> plasma

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
instead of having sticks you use plasma

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.100 
instead of having sticks you use plasma
ingots<00:01:28.439> for<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:29.070> stick<00:01:29.310> substitution<00:01:29.850> and

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
ingots for the stick substitution and

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.850 
ingots for the stick substitution and
it's<00:01:31.110> pretty<00:01:31.290> much<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.500> one-shot<00:01:31.829> kill

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
it's pretty much a one-shot kill

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.280 
it's pretty much a one-shot kill
everything<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.490> goes<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.880> fast<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:34.170> can

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
everything it goes so fast you can

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.109 
everything it goes so fast you can
barely<00:01:34.320> see<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.829> sometimes<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.549> it'll<00:01:35.820> go

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
barely see it sometimes and it'll go

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.390 
barely see it sometimes and it'll go
straight<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.689> nearly<00:01:36.900> every<00:01:37.200> time<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:38.250> I'll

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
straight and nearly every time so I'll

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.310 
straight and nearly every time so I'll
shoot<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.820> all<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.360> way<00:01:39.450> at<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.869> treetop

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
shoot it all the way at that treetop

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.889 
shoot it all the way at that treetop
over<00:01:41.070> there<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.579> then<00:01:42.479> I'm<00:01:42.570> gonna<00:01:42.659> fly<00:01:42.869> over

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
over there and then I'm gonna fly over

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.999 
over there and then I'm gonna fly over
to<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.259> if<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.280> hit<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.579> like<00:01:45.479> exactly<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.350> should

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
to it if it hit it like exactly I should

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:55.450 
to it if it hit it like exactly I should
have<00:01:47.189> hit<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.549> pretty<00:01:48.470> straight<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.649> Oh

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.820 

because<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.670> way<00:01:56.820> then<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.210> goes<00:01:57.600> back

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
because that way then it goes back

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.700 
because that way then it goes back
anyway<00:01:58.830> so<00:01:59.040> um<00:01:59.790> let's<00:02:00.390> pretty<00:02:00.570> much<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:01.020> okay

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
anyway so um let's pretty much the okay

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.860 
anyway so um let's pretty much the okay
so<00:02:02.100> I'm<00:02:02.310> gonna<00:02:02.790> spawn<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.120> bunch<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.570> zombies

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
so I'm gonna spawn a bunch of zombies

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
door abilities crap though but a sword

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.890 
door abilities crap though but a sword
okay<00:03:19.739> they<00:03:19.920> do<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.730> swords<00:03:21.030> of<00:03:21.209> overpowered

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
okay they do the swords of overpowered

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.430 
okay they do the swords of overpowered
but<00:03:22.500> um<00:03:22.680> armor<00:03:23.220> not<00:03:24.150> so<00:03:24.450> much<00:03:24.660> on<00:03:25.049> what<00:03:25.230> kind<00:03:25.380> of

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
but um armor not so much on what kind of

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.250 
but um armor not so much on what kind of
sucks<00:03:25.830> but<00:03:26.459> it's<00:03:26.580> overpowered<00:03:27.209> though<00:03:27.390> cuz

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
sucks but it's overpowered though cuz

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.320 
sucks but it's overpowered though cuz
one<00:03:28.500> piece<00:03:28.709> will<00:03:28.950> give<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.220> um<00:03:29.430> form<00:03:30.030> of<00:03:30.150> ours

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
one piece will give you um form of ours

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.590 
one piece will give you um form of ours
so<00:03:31.019> I<00:03:31.290> guess<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:31.980> kind<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.310> balances<00:03:32.700> out<00:03:32.880> but

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
so I guess that kind of balances out but

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.039 
so I guess that kind of balances out but
the<00:03:33.720> sword<00:03:34.100> overpowered<00:03:35.100> bow<00:03:36.049> overpowered

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
with the durability is not too good but

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.350 
with the durability is not too good but
the<00:03:40.560> sword<00:03:40.830> is<00:03:40.920> amazing<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:41.880> there's<00:03:42.000> one<00:03:42.150> shot

get the tools scissor made exactly the
same<00:04:15.439> as<00:04:15.590> regular<00:04:15.739> with<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.160> plasma<00:04:16.340> ingots

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
same as regular with the plasma ingots

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.430 
same as regular with the plasma ingots
but<00:04:17.769> with<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:19.630> iron<00:04:20.630> sticks<00:04:20.930> as<00:04:21.079> well<00:04:21.109> and

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.770 
but with the iron sticks as well and
we'll<00:04:21.530> see<00:04:21.650> how<00:04:21.709> fast<00:04:21.979> this<00:04:22.220> cuts<00:04:22.570> pretty<00:04:23.570> much

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
we'll see how fast this cuts pretty much

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.920 
we'll see how fast this cuts pretty much
instantly<00:04:24.460> it'll<00:04:25.460> cut<00:04:25.729> off<00:04:25.940> cut<00:04:26.690> wood

thing wondering that che ders I'm using
I'm<00:06:57.480> using<00:06:57.660> the<00:06:59.570> shy<00:07:00.570> oh<00:07:00.600> pack<00:07:00.870> 13<00:07:01.260> shaders<00:07:01.590> I

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
I'm using the shy oh pack 13 shaders I

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.210 
I'm using the shy oh pack 13 shaders I
got<00:07:02.370> a<00:07:02.400> bunch<00:07:02.550> of<00:07:02.640> shaders<00:07:04.070> everyone<00:07:05.070> says

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 
got a bunch of shaders everyone says

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.760 
got a bunch of shaders everyone says
they<00:07:05.340> like<00:07:05.460> this<00:07:05.640> shader<00:07:06.200> but<00:07:07.200> I<00:07:07.410> don't<00:07:07.650> really

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770 
they like this shader but I don't really

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.350 
they like this shader but I don't really
like<00:07:07.980> this<00:07:08.100> one<00:07:08.160> because<00:07:08.490> when<00:07:08.940> you<00:07:09.030> when<00:07:09.210> it's

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 
like this one because when you when it's

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:16.580 
like this one because when you when it's
nighttime<00:07:10.130> time<00:07:14.390> 14000<00:07:15.390> it's<00:07:15.960> like<00:07:16.170> super

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:16.590 
nighttime time 14000 it's like super

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:17.960 
nighttime time 14000 it's like super
super<00:07:16.740> dark<00:07:16.980> and<00:07:17.220> you<00:07:17.340> really<00:07:17.640> can't<00:07:17.850> see

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:17.970 
super dark and you really can't see

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.700 
super dark and you really can't see
anything<00:07:18.350> so<00:07:19.350> I<00:07:19.380> mean<00:07:20.190> the<00:07:20.400> water<00:07:20.610> school<00:07:21.000> yeah
