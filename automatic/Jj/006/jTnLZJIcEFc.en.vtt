they're gonna fuzz this up just a little
bit<00:00:48.269> wind<00:00:49.269> it<00:00:49.480> on<00:00:49.600> and<00:00:50.140> since<00:00:50.469> this<00:00:50.649> is<00:00:50.829> a<00:00:50.859> flexi

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
bit wind it on and since this is a flexi

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.099 
bit wind it on and since this is a flexi
tube<00:00:51.609> I'm<00:00:51.850> gonna<00:00:52.000> put<00:00:52.239> that<00:00:52.420> right<00:00:52.660> over<00:00:52.690> the

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109 
tube I'm gonna put that right over the
