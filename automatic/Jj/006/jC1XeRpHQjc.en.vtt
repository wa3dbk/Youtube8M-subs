00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.120
 and answer this chalice of ours the frame 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.430
 to present cost more section 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.870
 we will arrive myths and legends and good 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.810
 we have a lot will be close because 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.930
 will try to shed light on 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.220
 many many said many theories that 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.050
 in the clubs he goes out to the 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.880
 gyms because people outside 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.550
 gym always says us 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.189
 we will try from entity and host the 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.780
 maximum possible light we will start them with 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.309
 one of the favorites that the boats of 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.590
 excrement for you 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.469
 for a reason, I'm surprised by people with similar 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.570
 at the gym being a protein pot very 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.460
 big a little slow we have 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.690
 bright colors the first thanks 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.250
 they are two things first 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.250
 so is 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.210
 and it is due to other bad ones for the value of 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.840
 work is shit and lies down the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.840
 boy is young 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:26.960
 at the end with many guys arguing 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:29.750
 the problem are young instance 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.640
 Casting a little seriousness the boats 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.580
 of protein and supplements for 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.950
 draw say are emergency aids 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.450
 for a person to cut and from 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.720
 then it is a hoop it is logical for the 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.100
 drunk liver is self maximally so 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.270
 that the first thing we say is that 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.400
 mountains planet 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.160
 nothing happens and something else that we have 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:02:00.250
 mentioned at the beginning not everyone 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:02:00.250
 he automatically starts talking 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:12.500
 the second one is the minor one that is to say no 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.319
 there is no problem 16 years 62 kilos and 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:20.019
 three of low with 23 informed boarding 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.019
 whole you have the whole world 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.060
 the problem even less 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.060
 I mean 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.990
 but no 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.640
 on the back taking supplements 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.640
 entering 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.690
 well that showed us ignorant not 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.530
 presuppose showing the work all the 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.530
 world gets no 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.010
 it's going to be a pleasure it costs a lot 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.950
 who has delivered money left over 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.370
 third for this is a physical law not 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.600
 he explained is for care with the command 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.290
 let it all looked it turned into gas 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.290
 we were 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.750
 for this 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:15.480
 but this does not exist 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.549
 He ordered him to make legs that is the shadow 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.530
 of xavi while the gym legs 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.530
 they seem to have never trained 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.270
 that has happened 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:41.890
 basically with 3 633 of 10 nobody 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:51.180
 will not be commenting on the game of the 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:51.180
 Sunday and then 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.980
 that we learned the windows 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.990
 Bank warnings and batteries are 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.220
 very typical of exercising because they are very 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.220
 stronger and more resistant 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.310
 that is, they are extensions 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:30.780
 so these that pretty much 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:30.780
 predisposition to results 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:49.410
 It is what it is 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.139
 3 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:06.539
 direct with colleagues at 6 o'clock in the 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.539
 afternoon on tuesday one by train 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.870
 what we say 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.930
 for the same reason 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:43.960
 then a species arrives and we will talk about 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.180
 unfortunately this was because it 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.310
 they call the fragments stations of 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.210
 Above the offices it seems that no 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.330
 they have found out 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:55.539
 at the end these two are two of the 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.860
 involved in the expansion of the 

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:59.719
 parameters of gyms 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.180
 so these are our five 

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:04.069
 first two we will see that you liked it 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.169
 let's hope you take note of what it is 

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:08.360
 true and do not expect a gym and good 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:10.759
 we will see each other in the next ones 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:18.819
 Myths and legends deliveries continues in 

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:18.819
 our channel questions about them
