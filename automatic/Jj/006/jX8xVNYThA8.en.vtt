00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
over some of the things that I think I

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.109 
over some of the things that I think I
did<00:01:48.960> right<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:49.979> mostly<00:01:50.610> it's<00:01:50.850> going<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.030> be

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
did right but mostly it's going to be

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.450 
did right but mostly it's going to be
what<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.299> did<00:01:51.509> wrong<00:01:51.630> because<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.439> don't<00:01:53.430> know

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460

what I did wrong because I don't know
most<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.729> time<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:53.970> was<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.180> um<00:01:54.299> plague

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:10.260 

I<00:02:02.610> should<00:02:03.610> don't<00:02:03.760> remember<00:02:03.970> all<00:02:04.060> this<00:02:04.270> so<00:02:09.270> Miss

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
though in this matchup let me say this

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.370 
though in this matchup let me say this
in<00:02:15.220> this<00:02:15.370> matchup<00:02:16.170> especially<00:02:17.170> against

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
in this matchup especially against

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.600 
in this matchup especially against
really<00:02:17.560> good<00:02:17.650> Abel's<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.190> understand

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
really good Abel's that understand

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.720 
really good Abel's that understand
spacing<00:02:19.090> it's<00:02:20.020> very<00:02:20.380> hard<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.830> attack<00:02:21.310> them<00:02:21.580> I

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
spacing it's very hard to attack them I

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.550 
spacing it's very hard to attack them I
noticed<00:02:22.150> it's<00:02:22.630> better<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.020> kind<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:23.230> keep<00:02:23.380> your

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
noticed it's better to kind of keep your

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.320 
noticed it's better to kind of keep your
space<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.220> make<00:02:24.310> them<00:02:24.520> come<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.820> you<00:02:24.970> type<00:02:25.210> of

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
space and make them come to you type of

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.390 
space and make them come to you type of
thing<00:02:25.480> because<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:25.930> can<00:02:26.110> actually<00:02:26.280> like<00:02:27.280> I

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
thing because you can actually like I

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.920 
thing because you can actually like I
know<00:02:27.460> I<00:02:27.550> don't<00:02:27.700> play<00:02:27.970> him<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.330> way<00:02:28.480> but<00:02:28.510> Roger

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
know I don't play him that way but Roger

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.330 
know I don't play him that way but Roger
was<00:02:29.080> actually<00:02:29.770> a<00:02:31.290> zoning<00:02:32.290> character<00:02:32.709> so<00:02:33.250> he

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
was actually a zoning character so he

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.310 
was actually a zoning character so he
doesn't<00:02:33.459> have<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.760> come<00:02:33.970> up<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.480> win<00:02:34.660> he

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
doesn't have to come up to you to win he

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.380 
doesn't have to come up to you to win he

what is out game i think i'm lacking in
so<00:02:47.680> something<00:02:48.070> I<00:02:48.100> definitely<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.550> work<00:02:48.670> on

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
so something I definitely the work on

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.910 
so something I definitely the work on
but<00:02:49.240> in<00:02:49.810> this<00:02:50.020> matchup<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:50.440> try<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.590> do<00:02:50.770> my<00:02:50.800> best

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
but in this matchup I try to do my best

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.290 
but in this matchup I try to do my best
because<00:02:51.250> there<00:02:51.520> was<00:02:51.610> no<00:02:51.730> way<00:02:51.880> I'd<00:02:52.030> really<00:02:52.270> be

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
because there was no way I'd really be

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.790 
because there was no way I'd really be
able<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.570> contend<00:02:52.930> with<00:02:53.020> his<00:02:53.260> type<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.620> foot

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
able to contend with his type of foot

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.410 
able to contend with his type of foot
seas<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.340> know<00:02:54.400> cuz<00:02:54.580> able<00:02:54.850> normals<00:02:55.180> are<00:02:55.209> just

there but don't do that ever in this
matchup<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:38.010> don't<00:03:39.010> think<00:03:39.070> focusing<00:03:39.400> as<00:03:39.760> much

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
matchup I don't think focusing as much

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.570 
matchup I don't think focusing as much
as<00:03:40.239> a<00:03:40.299> very<00:03:40.540> good<00:03:40.660> idea<00:03:40.780> either<00:03:41.340> just<00:03:42.340> because

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
as a very good idea either just because

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.970 
as a very good idea either just because
all<00:03:42.730> those<00:03:42.850> normals<00:03:43.239> are<00:03:43.330> in<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:44.590> you<00:03:44.769> don't

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
all those normals are in and you don't

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.289 
all those normals are in and you don't
have<00:03:45.100> a<00:03:45.160> lot<00:03:45.310> of<00:03:45.340> delay<00:03:45.549> so<00:03:45.610> all<00:03:45.850> these<00:03:45.970> lights

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
have a lot of delay so all these lights

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.600 
have a lot of delay so all these lights
and<00:03:46.570> stuff<00:03:46.780> have<00:03:47.290> really<00:03:47.590> good<00:03:47.709> recovery<00:03:48.190> so

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
and stuff have really good recovery so

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.250 
and stuff have really good recovery so
you're<00:03:48.730> not<00:03:48.820> gonna<00:03:48.940> like<00:03:49.150> catch<00:03:49.420> them<00:03:49.630> I<00:03:49.900> mean

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
you're not gonna like catch them I mean

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.289 
you're not gonna like catch them I mean
I<00:03:50.350> guess<00:03:50.380> you<00:03:50.590> could<00:03:50.620> but<00:03:51.160> it's<00:03:52.030> not<00:03:52.150> very

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
I guess you could but it's not very

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.729
