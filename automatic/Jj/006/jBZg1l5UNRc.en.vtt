00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.140 

I<00:07:02.440> mean<00:07:02.830> at<00:07:02.889> this<00:07:03.010> point<00:07:03.100> like<00:07:03.460> a<00:07:03.730> lot<00:07:04.030> of

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:04.150 
I mean at this point like a lot of

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.510 
I mean at this point like a lot of
tricks<00:07:04.330> are<00:07:04.480> getting<00:07:04.690> like<00:07:05.470> threatening<00:07:07.050> so

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 
tricks are getting like threatening so

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.070 
tricks are getting like threatening so
it<00:07:09.520> can<00:07:09.669> go<00:07:09.699> bigger<00:07:10.030> but<00:07:10.360> I<00:07:10.570> think<00:07:10.930> people

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 
it can go bigger but I think people

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:17.340 
it can go bigger but I think people
start<00:07:11.500> dying<00:07:12.210> if<00:07:13.210> they<00:07:13.419> go<00:07:13.600> too<00:07:13.870> much<00:07:14.050> bigger

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:17.350 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:25.010 

Oh
