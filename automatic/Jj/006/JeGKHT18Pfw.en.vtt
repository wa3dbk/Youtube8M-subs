Bannerman's<00:03:34.600> under<00:03:34.780> attack<00:03:35.080> again<00:03:35.230> so<00:03:36.160> there

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
Bannerman's under attack again so there

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.570 
Bannerman's under attack again so there
we're<00:03:37.270> not<00:03:37.420> attack<00:03:38.290> those<00:03:38.500> things<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:39.430> the

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
we're not attack those things and the

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.830 
we're not attack those things and the
entire<00:03:39.820> idea<00:03:40.150> is<00:03:40.300> that<00:03:40.390> you<00:03:40.480> don't<00:03:40.660> want

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
entire idea is that you don't want

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.930 
entire idea is that you don't want
people<00:03:41.470> to<00:03:41.739> get<00:03:41.860> in<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.160> destroy<00:03:42.520> the<00:03:42.640> crystal

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
people to get in and destroy the crystal

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.729 
people to get in and destroy the crystal
that<00:03:43.090> you've<00:03:43.180> got<00:03:43.330> at<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.540> back<00:03:43.690> of<00:03:43.720> it<00:03:43.989> at<00:03:44.620> the

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
that you've got at the back of it at the

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.590 
that you've got at the back of it at the
back<00:03:44.890> of<00:03:45.100> the<00:03:45.340> car<00:03:45.880> so<00:03:45.970> at<00:03:46.090> least<00:03:46.150> I<00:03:46.270> think<00:03:46.330> I

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
back of the car so at least I think I

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.520 
back of the car so at least I think I
think<00:03:46.810> that's<00:03:46.900> what<00:03:47.110> it<00:03:47.230> is

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
think that's what it is

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.930 
think that's what it is
I<00:03:47.560> can't<00:03:48.070> retail<00:03:48.430> oh<00:03:48.580> come<00:03:49.300> on<00:03:49.450> oh<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:51.010> every

you see now there's a bunch of fog so
we're<00:05:16.090> gonna<00:05:16.210> have<00:05:16.330> to<00:05:16.540> deal<00:05:16.990> with<00:05:17.050> this<00:05:18.150> get

we're gonna have to deal with this get
some<00:05:19.330> units<00:05:19.690> I<00:05:20.020> think<00:05:20.290> so<00:05:20.710> we<00:05:21.310> can't<00:05:21.520> bring

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
some units I think so we can't bring

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.280 
some units I think so we can't bring
more<00:05:21.910> footmen<00:05:22.270> with<00:05:22.420> me<00:05:22.540> so<00:05:22.720> I'm<00:05:22.780> gonna<00:05:22.930> grab

blunderbuss person and shield knight as

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.350 
blunderbuss person and shield knight as
well<00:05:32.560> so<00:05:33.220> they've<00:05:33.340> all<00:05:33.460> spawned<00:05:33.850> with<00:05:34.060> me<00:05:34.180> and

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
well so they've all spawned with me and

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.060 
well so they've all spawned with me and
like<00:05:34.570> I<00:05:34.600> say<00:05:34.780> it<00:05:35.020> looks<00:05:35.290> pretty<00:05:35.650> good<00:05:35.800> it's

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
like I say it looks pretty good it's

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.820 
like I say it looks pretty good it's
just<00:05:36.160> the<00:05:36.790> movement<00:05:37.510> is<00:05:37.840> really<00:05:38.200> awkward<00:05:38.500> I'm

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
just the movement is really awkward I'm

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.670 
just the movement is really awkward I'm
moving<00:05:39.640> with<00:05:39.790> my<00:05:39.940> left<00:05:40.210> thumb<00:05:40.660> sort<00:05:41.560> of<00:05:41.620> a

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
moving with my left thumb sort of a

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.290 
moving with my left thumb sort of a
virtual<00:05:41.890> stick<00:05:42.460> that<00:05:42.640> you<00:05:42.730> can't<00:05:42.880> really<00:05:43.030> see

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
virtual stick that you can't really see

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.470 
virtual stick that you can't really see
very<00:05:43.990> well<00:05:44.050> and<00:05:44.920> I'm<00:05:45.610> attacking<00:05:46.090> with<00:05:46.330> this

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
very well and I'm attacking with this

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.990 
very well and I'm attacking with this
half<00:05:46.750> echidna<00:05:47.650> say<00:05:47.890> I'm<00:05:48.340> attacking<00:05:48.760> with<00:05:48.880> this

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
half echidna say I'm attacking with this

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
half echidna say I'm attacking with this
little<00:05:49.300> sword<00:05:49.930> icon<00:05:51.120> but<00:05:52.120> there's<00:05:52.630> no<00:05:52.780> real

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
little sword icon but there's no real

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.140 
little sword icon but there's no real
sense<00:05:53.560> of<00:05:53.800> where<00:05:54.010> it<00:05:54.130> is<00:05:54.220> I'm<00:05:54.370> striking<00:05:54.790> I'm

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
sense of where it is I'm striking I'm

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.670 
sense of where it is I'm striking I'm
finding<00:05:55.600> it<00:05:55.660> really<00:05:55.780> difficult<00:05:56.020> to<00:05:56.230> figure

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
finding it really difficult to figure

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.710 
finding it really difficult to figure
out<00:05:56.890> where<00:05:57.730> it<00:05:57.850> is<00:05:57.910> I'm<00:05:58.060> hitting<00:05:58.390> I've<00:05:58.480> got<00:05:58.600> our

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
out where it is I'm hitting I've got our

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.170 
out where it is I'm hitting I've got our
hard<00:05:59.020> hit<00:05:59.260> as<00:05:59.440> well<00:05:59.940> there<00:06:00.940> we<00:06:01.000> are

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
hard hit as well there we are

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.930 
hard hit as well there we are
ah<00:06:01.330> which<00:06:01.990> is<00:06:02.620> the<00:06:02.860> icon<00:06:03.250> just<00:06:03.490> next<00:06:03.790> to<00:06:03.850> the

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
ah which is the icon just next to the

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.030 
ah which is the icon just next to the
sword<00:06:04.270> that<00:06:04.750> breaks<00:06:05.080> through<00:06:05.350> defenses<00:06:05.920> like

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
sword that breaks through defenses like

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.830 
sword that breaks through defenses like
that<00:06:06.250> but<00:06:06.640> it<00:06:06.730> uses<00:06:06.880> up<00:06:07.030> a<00:06:07.120> lot<00:06:07.240> of<00:06:07.270> the<00:06:07.390> stamina

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
that but it uses up a lot of the stamina

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.760 
that but it uses up a lot of the stamina
which<00:06:07.960> is<00:06:08.050> in<00:06:08.110> the<00:06:08.200> top<00:06:08.230> left<00:06:08.590> hand<00:06:08.680> corner

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
which is in the top left hand corner

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.959 
which is in the top left hand corner
there's<00:06:09.070> so<00:06:09.340> many<00:06:09.580> systems<00:06:10.060> in<00:06:10.270> play<00:06:10.510> here

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 
there's so many systems in play here

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:14.149 
there's so many systems in play here
and<00:06:12.059> it<00:06:12.149> all<00:06:12.269> moves<00:06:12.599> just<00:06:12.989> slightly<00:06:13.619> awkwardly

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159 
and it all moves just slightly awkwardly

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:18.679 
and it all moves just slightly awkwardly
just<00:06:14.459> slightly<00:06:15.769> slightly<00:06:16.769> to<00:06:17.159> our<00:06:17.610> goodness

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:18.689 
just slightly slightly to our goodness

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:21.679 
just slightly slightly to our goodness
so<00:06:19.549> uncomfortably<00:06:20.549> this<00:06:21.269> is<00:06:21.419> a<00:06:21.449> game<00:06:21.659> that

00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:21.689 
so uncomfortably this is a game that

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:25.069 
so uncomfortably this is a game that
feels<00:06:22.019> like<00:06:22.229> it<00:06:22.379> belongs<00:06:22.739> on<00:06:23.009> the<00:06:23.549> ps3<00:06:24.119> you

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:25.079 
feels like it belongs on the ps3 you

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:29.059 
feels like it belongs on the ps3 you
know<00:06:25.199> like<00:06:25.409> it<00:06:25.559> if<00:06:25.769> it<00:06:26.729> feels<00:06:27.419> like<00:06:27.659> an<00:06:28.019> XP<00:06:28.829> la

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:29.069 
know like it if it feels like an XP la

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:30.529 
know like it if it feels like an XP la
download<00:06:29.519> but<00:06:29.699> it<00:06:29.759> doesn't<00:06:29.969> really<00:06:30.119> feel<00:06:30.360> like

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
download but it doesn't really feel like

anything<00:06:33.959> like<00:06:34.199> that<00:06:34.259> and<00:06:34.589> I'm<00:06:34.679> using

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:34.829 
anything like that and I'm using

00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:37.549 
anything like that and I'm using
