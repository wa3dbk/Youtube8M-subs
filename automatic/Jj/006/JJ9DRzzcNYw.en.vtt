00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.760
 and the best game in the world for me with 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.920
 messi we are already talking about that 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.059
 Christian with against or can not give 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.410
 the same Christian treatment that has 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.240
 counted with all my respect for fabio 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.650
 it's true and that's what it has 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.090
 Christian right now has the same 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.420
 status that any player of the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.420
 first template 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:28.410
 you would say it is complicated in point 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:32.029
 dead started to start because I started 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.029
 the contacts to see availability 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:42.360
 it gets complicated if you say it does not renew as 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.420
 spend a little more time 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.950
 I say we bet and I believe that before 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:54.899
 start the league be not worth then 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:56.399
 yes but if we do not put Alberto you I think 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.760
 that is going to be longer than 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.160
 we think more 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.619
 and I would like it is because it will end up renewing 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.090
 but he will not finish his career in Madrid 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.380
 I have so much his first 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.060
 roncero you would say that in the next 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.660
 months does not have to be food 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.280
 I wish but I think that I think it's going to 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.410
 renew and will depend on the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.300
 conversation that I think is also a 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.979
 it is something very important and that has 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.360
 decided Florentine before you start 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.760
 negotiate with your representative and others 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.890
 money contract issues that 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.020
 this I put so much I'm going to depend 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.880
 the period in which Christian renewal 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.320
 face to face that will have this month 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.970
 August Florentine with him in the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.509
 Real Madrid concentration because yes 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.830
 because it is necessary where the angels go 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.000
 to depend because it is that after what 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.740
 that happened from the conversation that 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.690
 famous and others imposes that they look 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.770
 first face to face yesterday 2 and of that 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.600
 conversation I think it will depend 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:58.160
 the period in which in which yes what 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.160
 7 miami ago 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.770
 luck 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.040
 Christian still do not know what that 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.040
 matí wants to renew it since it 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.030
 is lengthening the theme to start from 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.240
 serious but if I tell you I do as 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.500
 françois wait to see if mind 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.910
 it's really not that I'm not 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.500
 I'm telling you about Christian glasses 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.630
 is thinking comes a moment that 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.550
 think that it is a vacilla all this of the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.610
 renewal because it can not be that 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.370
 take a year telling him that he does not arrive 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.520
 never that there is no movement 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.290
 say let's sit down 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.650
 the conversation is as it says the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.420
 angels why he says what Joseph says I 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.130
 I think that conversation if it's true 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.130
 what is going to happen because nothing 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:05.180
 I think it's going to be very tough 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.090
 It's going to be very hard and it's more I assure you 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.070
 that florentino pérez yes yes at the end 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.570
 carries on that conversation is going to have 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.570
 to hear things that you will not like anything 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.810
 hopefully 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.500
 not if Christian as has 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.720
 ported in madrid with what I would have 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.700
 offered wrong and if it were Christian the 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.940
 negotiations would now be very difficult 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:44.820
 Clear 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:46.590
 because the problem but how many types 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.510
 put to accompany you when you go to 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.650
 sink this is the key to the wine and 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.650
 the money 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.610
 35 popular 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.020
 they hurt you a bit of damage 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:16.460
 that begin to blunt should 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.460
 retire and leave 30 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:32.599
 wants to win everything 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.599
 he wants to earn a lot of money because not only 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.759
 but I 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:56.180
 now for a shaking 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.690
 another thing not sure but I can 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:02.009
 ensure that Christians and keep in mind 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.680
 in front he's going to say a couple of things 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:05.880
 they're going to tell you it's going to be hard going to be 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.259
 hard and will tell him what he feels 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.240
 because above all Christian has a 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.729
 thing is not hypocritical and the good the bad 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.419
 he says it to your face he says it all to you 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.419
 the face does not shut up anything
