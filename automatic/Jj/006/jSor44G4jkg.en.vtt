00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
when I was 15 years old and I think I

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.830 
when I was 15 years old and I think I
really<00:00:15.059> tried<00:00:15.570> all<00:00:15.990> sorts<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.830> styles<00:00:17.840> preppy

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
really tried all sorts of styles preppy

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.620 
really tried all sorts of styles preppy
and<00:00:19.230> he<00:00:19.619> sent<00:00:20.400> men<00:00:20.810> masculine<00:00:21.810> boyish<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.830> like

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
first it was a struggle at first because

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.529 
first it was a struggle at first because
I<00:00:26.160> really<00:00:26.430> didn't<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.820> personal<00:00:27.300> style

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
I really didn't have a personal style

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.230 
I really didn't have a personal style
but<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.349> course<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.710> call<00:00:28.920> people<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.400> know<00:00:30.119> you

little<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.450> few<00:00:36.630> years<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.500> guess<00:00:38.040> it's

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
little a few years so I guess it's

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.069 
little a few years so I guess it's
triggy<00:00:38.460> more<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.000> process<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.690> getting<00:00:39.899> to

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
triggy more the process of getting to

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.830 
triggy more the process of getting to
know<00:00:40.260> myself<00:00:40.590> more<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.820> then<00:00:41.969> now<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.809> I

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
know myself more and then now that I

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:55.959 
know myself more and then now that I
know<00:00:42.960> my<00:00:43.230> personal<00:00:44.040> style<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.579> personality

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.880 

so<00:00:56.969> then<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.180> saw<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.510> as<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.840> good<00:00:58.230> way<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.440> like

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
so then I saw this as a good way to like

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:28.830 
so then I saw this as a good way to like
catalog<00:00:59.340> my<00:00:59.489> style<00:00:59.760> how<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.180> Duvall

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.550 

I<00:01:28.869> think<00:01:29.380> it's<00:01:30.250> of<00:01:30.700> age<00:01:30.909> like<00:01:31.479> you<00:01:32.049> know<00:01:32.200> the

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
I think it's of age like you know the

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.609 
I think it's of age like you know the
older<00:01:32.830> you<00:01:32.860> get<00:01:33.100> in<00:01:33.250> trading<00:01:33.819> yo<00:01:34.229> cuz<00:01:35.229> I<00:01:35.380> used

older you get in trading yo cuz I used

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.850 
older you get in trading yo cuz I used
to<00:01:35.740> be<00:01:35.890> like<00:01:35.920> I<00:01:36.250> mean<00:01:36.690> millions<00:01:37.690> embrace<00:01:38.140> but<00:01:38.560> I

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
to be like I mean millions embrace but I

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.789 
to be like I mean millions embrace but I
don't<00:01:39.340> know<00:01:39.490> as<00:01:39.880> much<00:01:39.940> as<00:01:40.350> Superboy<00:01:41.350> and

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
don't know as much as Superboy and

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.440 
don't know as much as Superboy and
therefore<00:01:42.130> like<00:01:42.280> I<00:01:42.369> used<00:01:42.580> to<00:01:42.670> accessories<00:01:43.270> so
