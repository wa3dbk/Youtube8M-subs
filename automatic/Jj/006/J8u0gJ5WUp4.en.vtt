so<00:02:02.890> we'll<00:02:03.160> lift<00:02:03.430> this<00:02:03.730> off<00:02:03.970> of<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.840> assembly

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
so we'll lift this off of the assembly

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:15.390 
so we'll lift this off of the assembly
gently<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:11.310> let's<00:02:12.310> see<00:02:12.550> if<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:12.760> can<00:02:14.340> show<00:02:15.340> you

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
gently and let's see if I can show you

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.330 
gently and let's see if I can show you
this<00:02:16.020> so<00:02:17.020> back<00:02:17.290> here<00:02:17.320> is<00:02:17.770> your<00:02:17.980> igniter

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
this so back here is your igniter

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.180 
this so back here is your igniter
connection<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:22.200> let's<00:02:23.200> just<00:02:23.530> pull<00:02:23.770> this<00:02:23.920> off

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
connection and let's just pull this off

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.740 
connection and let's just pull this off
here<00:02:25.830> usually<00:02:26.830> there's<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.280> tap<00:02:27.580> somewhere<00:02:29.550> and

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
here usually there's a tap somewhere and

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.370 
here usually there's a tap somewhere and
there<00:02:31.750> you<00:02:31.810> go<00:02:31.959> there's<00:02:32.380> your<00:02:32.440> ballast<00:02:34.380> then

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
there you go there's your ballast then

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.199 
there you go there's your ballast then
we'll<00:02:35.530> take<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:36.010> igniter<00:02:36.340> wire<00:02:36.640> we'll<00:02:36.970> fish

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
we'll take the igniter wire we'll fish

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:53.520 
we'll take the igniter wire we'll fish
it<00:02:37.390> out<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:40.030> lens<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.840> igniter<00:02:53.140> wire

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
it out of the lens and the igniter wire

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.210 
it out of the lens and the igniter wire
just<00:02:53.830> clips<00:02:54.430> on<00:02:54.580> top<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:56.709> there<00:02:56.980> you<00:02:57.040> go

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
just clips on top and there you go

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.060 
just clips on top and there you go
there's<00:02:57.610> your<00:02:57.790> old<00:02:57.940> igniter<00:02:58.740> all<00:02:59.740> right<00:02:59.920> so

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
there's your old igniter all right so

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.729 
there's your old igniter all right so
let's<00:03:00.280> just<00:03:00.390> match<00:03:01.390> up<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.720> old<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.230> new

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
let's just match up the old and the new

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.800 
let's just match up the old and the new
igniter<00:03:03.010> unit<00:03:03.459> looks<00:03:03.910> okay<00:03:04.300> this<00:03:04.540> is<00:03:04.660> actually

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
igniter unit looks okay this is actually

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.100 
igniter unit looks okay this is actually
a<00:03:05.050> used<00:03:05.320> unit<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:07.090> don't<00:03:07.660> know<00:03:07.720> what<00:03:07.870> they<00:03:07.959> go

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
a used unit I don't know what they go

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.780 
a used unit I don't know what they go
for<00:03:08.320> new<00:03:08.410> to<00:03:08.530> be<00:03:08.650> honest<00:03:08.950> but<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.310> used<00:03:09.489> ones

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
for new to be honest but the used ones

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.850 
for new to be honest but the used ones
think<00:03:10.510> two<00:03:10.750> of<00:03:10.780> these<00:03:10.959> were<00:03:11.200> sixty<00:03:11.650> bucks

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
think two of these were sixty bucks

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.800 
think two of these were sixty bucks
because<00:03:12.100> we<00:03:12.610> need<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.880> replace<00:03:13.150> both<00:03:13.450> the

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
because we need to replace both the

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.949 
because we need to replace both the
passenger<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.370> driver<00:03:15.910> side<00:03:16.000> on<00:03:16.540> this

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
passenger and the driver side on this

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.590 
passenger and the driver side on this
vehicle<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:18.030> then<00:03:19.030> you're<00:03:19.150> just<00:03:19.360> going<00:03:19.570> to

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
vehicle and then you're just going to

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.979 
vehicle and then you're just going to
fish<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.709> wire<00:03:20.950> from<00:03:21.670> where<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.090> HID<00:03:22.420> bulb<00:03:22.780> is

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
fish the wire from where the HID bulb is

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:45.310 
fish the wire from where the HID bulb is
to<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.860> ballast<00:03:24.160> opening

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.340 

this<00:03:46.320> is<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.620> opening<00:03:47.040> for<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.340> HID<00:03:48.300> bulb<00:03:48.660> so

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
this is the opening for the HID bulb so

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.520 
this is the opening for the HID bulb so
we're<00:03:49.470> going<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.770> first<00:03:50.550> just<00:03:51.320> make<00:03:52.320> sure<00:03:52.470> you

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.490 
now the new bulb has certain
indentations<00:04:05.550> on<00:04:05.820> the<00:04:05.850> housing<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:07.020> match<00:04:07.200> up

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
indentations on the housing to match up

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.200 
indentations on the housing to match up
for<00:04:07.740> your<00:04:07.860> specific<00:04:08.400> vehicle<00:04:08.430> so<00:04:08.970> you<00:04:09.030> just

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
for your specific vehicle so you just

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.990 
for your specific vehicle so you just
match<00:04:09.420> up<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.800> indentations<00:04:10.820> don't<00:04:11.820> touch

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000

any dirt or grease on there but first
we'll<00:04:17.370> place<00:04:17.610> this<00:04:18.060> in<00:04:18.360> the<00:04:18.650> igniter<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:20.720> then

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
we'll place this in the igniter and then

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.800 
we'll place this in the igniter and then
you<00:04:21.810> twist<00:04:22.140> it<00:04:22.910> make<00:04:23.910> sure<00:04:23.940> everything<00:04:24.450> fits

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
you twist it make sure everything fits

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.170 
you twist it make sure everything fits
here<00:04:25.560> we<00:04:25.680> go

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
here we go

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.170 
here we go
okay<00:04:27.350> and<00:04:28.350> now<00:04:28.770> we<00:04:28.800> match<00:04:29.130> up<00:04:29.180> the

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
okay and now we match up the

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:48.860 
okay and now we match up the
indentations<00:04:30.870> with<00:04:31.350> the<00:04:31.500> housing<00:04:47.360> and<00:04:48.360> then

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
indentations with the housing and then

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.390 
indentations with the housing and then
we<00:04:48.990> have<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.170> reflector<00:04:49.680> wire<00:04:49.920> which<00:04:50.190> has<00:04:50.220> a

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
we have the reflector wire which has a

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:59.690 
we have the reflector wire which has a
clip<00:04:50.880> on<00:04:51.030> the<00:04:51.180> end<00:04:51.530> goes<00:04:52.530> down<00:04:52.800> here<00:04:58.700> we'll

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
clip on the end goes down here we'll

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:06.320 
clip on the end goes down here we'll
route<00:05:00.090> this<00:05:00.360> like<00:05:00.720> so<00:05:03.320> okay
