the hardware I have not switched it on

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.130 
the hardware I have not switched it on
yet<00:03:56.240> they<00:03:57.240> gave<00:03:57.480> me<00:03:57.540> a<00:03:57.720> open<00:03:59.390> slot<00:04:00.390> for<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.630> sim

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
yet they gave me a open slot for the sim

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.980 
yet they gave me a open slot for the sim
card<00:04:01.170> to<00:04:01.440> be<00:04:01.560> loaded<00:04:01.740> with<00:04:02.070> this<00:04:02.400> strain<00:04:02.990> which

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
card to be loaded with this strain which

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.600 
card to be loaded with this strain which
is<00:04:04.700> really<00:04:05.700> flimsy<00:04:06.090> a<00:04:06.480> very<00:04:07.050> flimsy<00:04:07.350> set<00:04:07.770> up<00:04:07.890> so

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
is really flimsy a very flimsy set up so

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.330 
is really flimsy a very flimsy set up so
you<00:04:08.640> load<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.240> sim<00:04:09.420> card<00:04:09.630> on<00:04:09.750> here<00:04:10.320> and<00:04:10.500> you

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
you load the sim card on here and you

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.810 
you load the sim card on here and you
just<00:04:11.520> have<00:04:11.790> to<00:04:11.910> push<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:12.120> here<00:04:13.040> see<00:04:14.040> how<00:04:14.310> tough

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
just have to push it here see how tough

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:21.270 
just have to push it here see how tough
it<00:04:15.090> is<00:04:16.130> sure<00:04:17.130> you

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.310 

it's<00:04:22.280> very<00:04:22.460> tough<00:04:22.730> reloaded<00:04:23.300> and<00:04:23.420> even<00:04:24.200> we

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
it's very tough reloaded and even we

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.370 
it's very tough reloaded and even we
take<00:04:24.500> it<00:04:24.650> out<00:04:24.770> we<00:04:24.830> have<00:04:25.670> to<00:04:25.730> push<00:04:26.090> it<00:04:26.120> here<00:04:26.570> see

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
take it out we have to push it here see

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.000 
take it out we have to push it here see
it<00:04:27.680> pops<00:04:27.950> out<00:04:28.130> and<00:04:28.430> we<00:04:29.150> have<00:04:29.240> to<00:04:29.330> take<00:04:29.480> it<00:04:29.570> out

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
it pops out and we have to take it out

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.070 
it pops out and we have to take it out
so<00:04:31.010> it<00:04:31.100> may<00:04:31.340> look<00:04:31.520> easy<00:04:31.760> but<00:04:32.030> it's<00:04:32.390> extremely

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
so it may look easy but it's extremely

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.320 
so it may look easy but it's extremely
difficult<00:04:33.470> for<00:04:33.800> first-timers<00:04:34.340> I've<00:04:34.970> gotten

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
difficult for first-timers I've gotten

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.510 
difficult for first-timers I've gotten
used<00:04:35.360> to<00:04:35.690> it<00:04:35.720> for<00:04:36.290> quite<00:04:36.620> a<00:04:36.680> few<00:04:36.830> times<00:04:37.190> and

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
used to it for quite a few times and

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.170 
used to it for quite a few times and
this<00:04:38.330> mechanism<00:04:38.870> is<00:04:39.110> same<00:04:39.710> for<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:40.180> memory

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
this mechanism is same for the memory

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.430 
this mechanism is same for the memory
card<00:04:41.390> slot<00:04:41.660> to<00:04:41.990> every<00:04:42.800> card<00:04:43.070> slot<00:04:44.080> it's<00:04:45.080> even

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
card slot to every card slot it's even

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:52.870 
card slot to every card slot it's even
tougher<00:04:45.770> you<00:04:46.460> know<00:04:50.680> know<00:04:51.680> why<00:04:51.860> I<00:04:51.890> I<00:04:52.280> can't

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
tougher you know know why I I can't

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.870 
tougher you know know why I I can't
figure<00:04:53.060> out<00:04:53.180> why<00:04:53.480> they<00:04:53.780> have<00:04:53.930> used<00:04:54.260> this

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
figure out why they have used this

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.340 
figure out why they have used this
stupid<00:04:55.880> mechanism<00:04:58.090> they<00:04:59.090> always<00:04:59.270> fear<00:04:59.750> I<00:04:59.810> may

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
stupid mechanism they always fear I may

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.400 
stupid mechanism they always fear I may
break<00:05:00.590> it<00:05:00.800> or<00:05:00.980> something<00:05:01.550> like<00:05:01.640> that<00:05:01.810> see<00:05:02.810> this

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
break it or something like that see this

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.710 
break it or something like that see this

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
is the memory card slot as you can see

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.680 
is the memory card slot as you can see

that the 8gb card is loaded inside you

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.360 
that the 8gb card is loaded inside you
don't<00:05:08.840> necessarily<00:05:09.050> need<00:05:09.560> to<00:05:09.890> take<00:05:10.070> it<00:05:10.220> out

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
don't necessarily need to take it out

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.760 
don't necessarily need to take it out

but if you want to use your own card or
update<00:05:13.220> the<00:05:13.400> memory<00:05:13.730> it<00:05:13.910> will<00:05:13.970> be<00:05:14.180> a<00:05:14.210> hassle

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
update the memory it will be a hassle

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:21.480 
update the memory it will be a hassle
sure<00:05:17.890> the<00:05:18.890> loading<00:05:19.250> is<00:05:19.280> good<00:05:19.850> easy<00:05:20.380> but

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
like that and there is no aluminum or

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.570 
like that and there is no aluminum or
any<00:05:39.380> any<00:05:39.830> other<00:05:40.130> basil<00:05:40.760> of<00:05:40.940> of<00:05:41.810> the<00:05:41.990> sort<00:05:42.580> it's

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
any any other basil of of the sort it's

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.420 
any any other basil of of the sort it's
fully<00:05:43.880> glass<00:05:44.150> and<00:05:44.450> from<00:05:45.200> the<00:05:45.380> side<00:05:45.620> starts<00:05:46.280> the

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
fully glass and from the side starts the

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.900 
fully glass and from the side starts the
unibody<00:05:46.850> aluminum<00:05:47.120> and<00:05:47.810> from<00:05:48.560> here<00:05:48.830> it<00:05:49.340> starts

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
unibody aluminum and from here it starts

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.020 
unibody aluminum and from here it starts
and<00:05:50.090> ends<00:05:50.510> here<00:05:50.930> so<00:05:51.650> this<00:05:52.220> is<00:05:52.400> a<00:05:52.430> single<00:05:52.820> piece

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
and ends here so this is a single piece

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.219 
and ends here so this is a single piece
and<00:05:53.570> of<00:05:53.930> course<00:05:53.960> this<00:05:54.320> is<00:05:54.530> a<00:05:54.860> plastic<00:05:56.229> this

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
and of course this is a plastic this

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:58.990 
and of course this is a plastic this
single<00:05:57.620> piece<00:05:57.800> is<00:05:58.040> brushed<00:05:58.460> aluminum

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
single piece is brushed aluminum

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.350 
single piece is brushed aluminum
anodized<00:05:59.780> aluminum<00:06:00.290> and<00:06:01.090> supposedly<00:06:02.090> it

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
anodized aluminum and supposedly it

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.600 
anodized aluminum and supposedly it
should<00:06:02.630> prevent<00:06:02.990> scratches<00:06:03.710> but<00:06:03.979> it<00:06:04.340> doesn't

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
should prevent scratches but it doesn't

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.969 
should prevent scratches but it doesn't
so<00:06:07.610> without<00:06:08.030> cover<00:06:08.930> if<00:06:09.320> you<00:06:09.530> lay<00:06:09.710> it<00:06:09.770> on<00:06:09.890> the

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:09.979 
so without cover if you lay it on the

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.760 
so without cover if you lay it on the
ground<00:06:10.010> like<00:06:10.820> that<00:06:10.900> you<00:06:11.900> will<00:06:12.050> easily<00:06:12.290> see

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
ground like that you will easily see

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.450 
ground like that you will easily see
scratches<00:06:13.400> like<00:06:13.790> here<00:06:14.300> and<00:06:14.530> here<00:06:15.530> because

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
scratches like here and here because

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.700 
scratches like here and here because
these<00:06:16.729> are<00:06:16.940> slightly<00:06:17.210> bulged<00:06:17.900> places<00:06:18.350> and<00:06:18.530> on

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
these are slightly bulged places and on

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.340 
these are slightly bulged places and on
the<00:06:18.860> X<00:06:19.010> 7<00:06:19.310> so<00:06:20.030> you'll<00:06:20.210> easily<00:06:20.450> get<00:06:20.810> scratches

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
the X 7 so you'll easily get scratches

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.010 
the X 7 so you'll easily get scratches
and<00:06:21.669> this<00:06:22.669> is<00:06:22.820> the<00:06:22.880> 8<00:06:23.030> megapixel<00:06:23.210> lead<00:06:23.870> off

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
and this is the 8 megapixel lead off

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.250 
and this is the 8 megapixel lead off
camera<00:06:24.290> with<00:06:24.620> dual-led<00:06:25.010> flash<00:06:25.870> on<00:06:26.870> the<00:06:27.110> right

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
camera with dual-led flash on the right

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.920 
camera with dual-led flash on the right
side<00:06:27.530> you<00:06:27.560> have<00:06:27.950> the<00:06:27.979> volume<00:06:28.700> rocker<00:06:28.849> which<00:06:29.780> is

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
side you have the volume rocker which is

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.870 
side you have the volume rocker which is
very<00:06:30.229> hard<00:06:30.500> to<00:06:30.620> press<00:06:30.919> since<00:06:31.310> it's<00:06:31.550> on<00:06:31.729> the

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
very hard to press since it's on the

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.500 
very hard to press since it's on the
curve

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.510 
curve

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.670 
curve
so<00:06:33.230> while<00:06:33.890> in<00:06:34.130> landscape<00:06:34.760> it's<00:06:35.000> pretty<00:06:35.300> easy

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
so while in landscape it's pretty easy

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.340 
so while in landscape it's pretty easy
but<00:06:36.680> while<00:06:36.980> on<00:06:37.220> a<00:06:37.490> portrait<00:06:38.240> more<00:06:38.570> it's<00:06:38.780> very

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
but while on a portrait more it's very

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.790 
but while on a portrait more it's very
hard<00:06:39.650> to<00:06:39.710> do<00:06:40.010> very<00:06:40.760> hard<00:06:41.060> see<00:06:41.900> when<00:06:42.350> you<00:06:42.380> hold<00:06:42.680> a

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
hard to do very hard see when you hold a

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.980 
hard to do very hard see when you hold a
phone<00:06:42.950> like<00:06:43.190> this<00:06:43.400> you<00:06:43.700> will<00:06:43.820> then<00:06:44.570> put<00:06:44.840> this

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
phone like this you will then put this

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.580 
phone like this you will then put this
pic<00:06:45.410> on<00:06:45.560> the<00:06:45.680> sides<00:06:45.890> but<00:06:46.640> it<00:06:46.910> is<00:06:47.060> on<00:06:47.180> the<00:06:47.300> curve

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
pic on the sides but it is on the curve

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.340 
pic on the sides but it is on the curve
so<00:06:48.590> you<00:06:48.680> need<00:06:48.980> to<00:06:49.100> get<00:06:49.250> practiced<00:06:49.900> to<00:06:50.900> use<00:06:51.110> it

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:51.350 
so you need to get practiced to use it

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.340 
so you need to get practiced to use it
and<00:06:51.560> also<00:06:52.520> the<00:06:52.730> camera<00:06:53.090> feeds<00:06:53.360> pretty<00:06:54.110> bad

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:54.350 
and also the camera feeds pretty bad

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.790 
and also the camera feeds pretty bad
it's<00:06:55.450> like<00:06:56.450> the<00:06:56.660> seven<00:06:57.080> it's<00:06:57.230> on<00:06:57.380> the<00:06:57.530> curve

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 
it's like the seven it's on the curve

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.310 
it's like the seven it's on the curve
and<00:06:58.010> it's<00:06:58.700> very<00:06:58.910> hard<00:06:59.120> to<00:06:59.180> press<00:06:59.450> you<00:07:00.020> have<00:07:00.140> to

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.320 
and it's very hard to press you have to

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.310 
and it's very hard to press you have to
hold<00:07:00.440> it<00:07:00.650> for<00:07:00.830> a<00:07:00.860> few<00:07:00.950> seconds<00:07:01.490> to<00:07:02.170> make<00:07:03.170> it

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:03.320 
hold it for a few seconds to make it

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.810 
hold it for a few seconds to make it
activate<00:07:03.680> the<00:07:03.800> camera<00:07:03.950> it's<00:07:04.280> not<00:07:04.460> a<00:07:04.490> single
