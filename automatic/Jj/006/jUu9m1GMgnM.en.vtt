00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.890
 Here is a vanilla extract 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.010
 egg 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:12.070
 Ice cream to put on the finished cake 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:17.740
 And the wrap and ball material is first put into the ball instead of the cup and mixed 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:20.380
 Is not dirty can also mugs that evenly divide the dough who so was is in two cups 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.530
 You can finish it so beautifully 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:27.159
 Let's get started The procedure is simple 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:32.490
 Put all ingredients in a bowl 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.490
 All quantities of material are on the rally 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.520
 Hmm 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.180
 Put some drops of Panerai extract book and paste the eggs at the end 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.740
 If all the ingredients are in the bowl, mix this well 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:12.080
 This is good I could make a rich article like other cakes 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.350
 I will put this article into two mugs 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.470
 It will be about 6 minutes high with this cup 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.730
 Everything so as not to leave the dough in the ball 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.410
 Please put in a mug 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:29.570
 Apply rack-off needle to this cup respectively 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.290
 If you do not put the wrap, the dough may swell and come out of the mug cut, so wrap it 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.280
 From 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.700
 Please stop at the exhibition 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:43.120
 Then put this mug into electromagnetic one by one and warm it 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:44.970
 It can be done in a minute by eating it after the battle map range code, but depending on the model it will take some more 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.580
 I think it takes 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:55.410
 Please try to put the family in the middle of the cake with your finger when you see it 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:59.330
 The cake is resilient and if one minute comes back it's done 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:04.100
 Please warm up for another 30 seconds if not finished 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:07.050

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.030
 This is a finished cake 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.100
 I warmed one piece for 1 minute 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:18.110
 Finally put ice cream 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.830
