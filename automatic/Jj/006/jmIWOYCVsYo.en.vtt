00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.519
 the garden of popular saying 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.740
 no accounting for taste but if you are more 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.230
 more heat then this is very 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.779
 Our staff is not really our subject. 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.939
 of today is the thermal sensation 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.890
 on a summer day you may find that 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.199
 is hot or you may find that the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.390
 heat is unbearable because it does 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.300
 often a feeling of warmth and 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.960
 cold is greater than the term 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.969
 let's go outside and do some measurements 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.460
 on a hot day a street thermometer 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.710
 under the strong sun you can dial 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.020
 example 32 degrees 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.239
 See what happens when we use 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.370
 other purpose thermometer or external thermometer 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.649
 leaning against the cement floor 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.440
 the heat of the fault interferes directly 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.600
 on the temperature and a thermometer fires 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.699
 It's easy to see that the heat is fine. 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.640
 higher than the difference between the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.710
 of the air and the floor temperature surprises 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.140
 and reaches 10 degrees 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.540
 now let's fall from the strong sun and stay in the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.159
 shadow under a tree and even a 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.880
 breeze and it is clear that the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.080
 begins to lower the thermometer marks 3 to 4 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.000
 degrees less 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.310
 already inside a car with the windows 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.009
 closed the temperature returns to rise 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.150
 quickly the heat is almost extreme 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.670
 unbearable 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.009
 watch the thermometer shoot again and 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.500
 passes 38 degrees 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.180
 this game was just an example for 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.400
 perceive with a temperature of one 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.259
 certain moment may suffer a 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.520
 variation depending on the factors 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.680
 external 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.810
 there are some specific factors that 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.540
 end up in the sensation that 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.229
 we feel in our body but how to measure 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.479
 that 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.100
 the weather calls this sensation of 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.680
 more heat of colder 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.540
 thermal sensation is in practice the 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.229
 number calculated by an equation 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.369
 Very calm math most importantly 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.649
 is to know what the factors are 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.170
 that are taken into account 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.630
 for the calculation of the thermal sensation 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.429
 are three main variables to 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.379
 actual air temperature 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.620
 wind speed and humidity 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.750
 relative air 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.209
 the actual air temperature is official 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.310
 measured in meteorological 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.959
 institutes and following a series of 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.269
 standards determined by the organization 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.340
 world weather 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.530
 the thermometer is inside a small house 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.810
 of white wood that does not suffer 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.849
 external influence of the wind and 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.190
 some meters above the sea and with grass 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.940
 avoiding the influence of the heat of the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.250
 Sun 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.349
 the humidity of the air also has influence 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.799
 in the thermal sensation when the 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.349
 temperature and high humidity are already 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.959
 this increases the thermal sensation of heat 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.299
 The discomfort you breathe one more 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.730
 has difficulty evaporating because the air 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.010
 is already full of steam given by only stays 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.540
 on the skin depending on the person can 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.540
 annoy enough 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.620
 for example a temperature of 31 degrees 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.230
 which is already high 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.599
 however it is much more bearable with time 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.329
 because high community that ends up 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.220
 much increasing the thermal sensation one 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.159
 temperature of 31 degrees with humidity 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.280
 relative in 79% 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:18.739
 the thermal sensation reaches 41 degrees 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.959
 wind speed is the third 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.090
 determining parameter when the gusts 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.590
 of winds are stronger the loss of 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.049
 heat is very fast 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.349
 with a real low temperature 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.450
 the thermal sensation of cold increases greatly 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.299
 are those freezing days when 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.879
 It's cold and windy here. 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.940
 example, an actual temperature of the 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.980
 air of 14 degrees but with winds of 24 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.609
 kilometers per hour the thermal sensation 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.370
 reaches 7 degrees and the temperature was 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:52.220
 zero degrees and the winds and 12 miles 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.519
 per hour the thermal sensation reaches eight 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.500
 minus usually calculates the 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.169
 feeling of cold when the 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.569
 thermometers are below 20 degrees and 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:04.819
 thermal sensation of heat is more common 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.049
 be calculated when the temperature is 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.150
 of 27 degrees 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.280
 Of course, this number will have a 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.060
 greater or lesser impact of 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.099
 person 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.799
 the region in which you live and 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:18.829
 accustomed to the cold or the heat and 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.229
 if you prefer cold or heat it's easy 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.390
 to understand comments and 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.219
 suggestions for upcoming programs 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.090
 there with us for explaining time 

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:28.460
 steal the weather 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.290
 the dot with br point or by the hashtag 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.290
 explaining until next time
