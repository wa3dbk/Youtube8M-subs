00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:08.220
 Hello my dears 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:10.740
 while I am now the two 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.269
 I want to give you toys as well 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.900
 bit about my rabbit poses 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.080
 tell 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.830
 here you can already see that cleo the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.050
 black and white my first girl 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.210
 much more trusting is essential 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.570
 a bit more dominant and affectionate 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.300
 definitely more curious than that 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.390
 Gray also as a stragglers now 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.460
 has arrived and she is just one 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.620
 a little more cautious in my opinion 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.410
 after also no left one 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.579
 wilder and, above all, more playful 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:48.450
 she makes the bigger leaps and bounds 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.739
 Run a lot more than cleo yeah 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.539
 want you while the two are now 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.489
 here her little toys in empty 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.920
 eat a little bit about it 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.140
 tell how I mean yes 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.230
 and I like the two 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.120
 Nourish and especially why I give them that 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.479
 a large area for your spout 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.560
 I tell you about it again 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.960
 after a bit more 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.909
 So now I'm starting only once with the 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.560
 two toys I just give 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.140
 then i have a short start 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.670
 shown and that this is once this 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.640
 she will now turn plastic toys 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.869
 hardly around 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.400
 now I'll only let it in for a moment 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.200
 they are done out again 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.380
 change it through the wooden toy 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.299
 where they can continue playing and that 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.070
 Plastic toys are easy too 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.110
 dangerous to let the long in it 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.610
 although now it can empty quickly and it 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.729
 is also very easy for the two 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.320
 but they just nibble on everything and 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.320
 That's why I take this plastic stuff 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.610
 got out quickly yes and that 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.259
 wooden toys are just a bit 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.149
 they can be more complicated as well 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.820
 Play a little bit more and play with it 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.189
 work around and I think he is 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.290
 They like it too 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:00.200
 to let off steam and let her power out 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.880
 so that to the bands toys and 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.170
 Now I would like to become a cage 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:10.440
 so comes a cage is always one 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.300
 bit in the background also has lucio 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.010
 very many hiding opportunities 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.170
 of course I have these too 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.819
 transport boxes installed because I 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.950
 Just want that in the times 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.319
 transport boxes have to be around somehow 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.349
 to come to the vet or so that she 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.980
 then just feel good 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.660
 feel at home and feel safe 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.230
 feel and that's why I have the stall 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.269
 posed 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.120
 Add this carpet to them 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.580
 run that is such a rest that have 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.120
 I really do one in any hardware store and 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.330
 this piece of field 140 wide and 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.920
 four meters long and there I have 25 euros 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.610
 So it does not really spend a lot 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.040
 total 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.420
 The two have super clean carpet 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.879
 I will stop before course 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.180
 and have cleaned and underneath 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:03.239
 also a nice foil so on 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.280
 the material underneath simply no 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.319
 liquid and can not bring anything like that 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.430
 that in this rental apartment easy too 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.810
 nothing can happen 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.550
 you can really you that is 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.470
 not expensive in the hardware store for two 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.120
 euro fifty or so a giant plane 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.849
 buy or two and you can do that 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.620
 make the area safe for the enclosure 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.510
 so that in the apartment just as well and 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.440
 no harm if someone 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.420
 then takes off you can still see one so 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.269
 the lattice bars are his 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.349
 The rabbits also have a free-range enclosure 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.180
 for outdoor use 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.560
 The two take out then with you 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.720
 but of course, these enclosures also 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.569
 outside our community garden 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.370
 For this, make sure that no 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.849
 dogs somehow of neighbors in the garden 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.200
 run around or any other animals 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:52.319
 a rabbit in any way 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.200
 can harm which also serious I have 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.580
 my neighbors have spoken and I have 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.709
 good luck that I'm in a big city 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.420
 front where linen is required and there 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.129
 this if a community garden is 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.959
 really simply, as long as my 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.549
 rabbits outside are either a dog 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.379
 do not leave in the garden or just enter 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.439
 Duty so that he has no possibility 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.610
 a spirit to vote and thus feel 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:12.540
 I'm also pretty sure if I am 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.280
 my little racker 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.160
 of course against anything 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.320
 cap and all sorts of stuff you 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.530
 can get vaccinated here before 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.199
 they come out 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:28.020
 yes that's very important to me that this 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.580
 kit ag now also in here function 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.259
 because I just do not have the 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.350
 possibility has a whole room for 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:36.060
 to finish the two and me 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.699
 think they definitely have more than here 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.229
 four square meters and ham stop in the evening 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.850
 still two three hours the 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.720
 possibility to be completely in the room 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.690
 fling 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.099
 I'll show you that again and again 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.710
 That's why I think I'm fine 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:51.660
 She managed to have two bowls for her 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.539
 So feed then where dried herbs 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.699
 in there are today where today to 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.110
 it is always available 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.949
 always there because the main food 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.419
 is and you have two toilets that 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.860
 they do not get annoyed either 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.210
 that one can take the other out of the 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.020
 Toilet throws if they ever 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.759
 are not so green and our old 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.110
 scratching post where they hide 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:17.940
 You must be able to hop around on it 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:22.220
 I just hope I have the so so 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:25.550
 a very good home 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:28.289
 I can say yes to the diet so 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.199
 I mainly feed dry 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.729
 herbs and of course as a food 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.949
 This year I had already said so 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.419
 that is always available and is 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:39.539
 always gets fresh twice a day 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:42.810
 exchanged and otherwise they get in 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:45.479

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.150
