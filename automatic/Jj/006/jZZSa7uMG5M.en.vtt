 just like that direction direction with space and 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.040
 capital letter and we will enter that of

 direction juan address is the same 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.970
 address and it's a 400 but it's good 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.800
 say it is very well known that they 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.170
 I bring today is great but not 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.030
 like that good we are right here 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.610
 we will mark the point d we are to see 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.990
 he told them there are eight diamonds under 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.050
 the space point then is very very 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.940
 great right here we will mark it and 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.560
 we will give a little tour to this incredible 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.550
 good seed here we have what it is 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.050
 lots of wood 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.910
 remember that I recommend you take 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.020
 a lot of way to make the peaks 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.369
 and be able to progress in the mine 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.039
 well here we have a great forest quoted 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.760
 a great forest cited a very cool forest 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:14.670
 they have been 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.800
 incredible and here we have this huge 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.740
 mountain together with these two cataracts 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.070
 very amazing mainer is very very cool 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.780
 over here we have nothing more more trees 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.940
 remember mainer is a lot of wood 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.890
 since it is very low and they are not going to 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.840
 find nothing but coal and ayron in 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.060
 the road then carry a lot of wood 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.660
 to make stone peaks here 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.500
 we have a desert area plus trees a 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.840
 hill to this more water and it would be all with 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.610
 the 7 reality is not to be said outside of 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.990
 normal but with milk but with the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.670
 made of containing diamonds under the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.100
 Spam point is more than perfect 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.840
 then let's look at this moment 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.870
 remember to take wood beyond 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.520
 damn wood and good here we go 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.650
 let's start this is the point of is 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.080
 pont I think that is to say and we will begin to 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.240
 undermine 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.370
 and here we will reserve with a not 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.680
 disillusion since almost all the ies 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.740
 that I have shown you there is more than something not 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.210
 I know carbon iron I do not know something while 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.980
 dominating but in this we do not 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.170
 we will find nothing but stone 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.730
 that's why I tell them that they live a lot 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.160
 to be able to be stone peak nothing more 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.290
 since that is what they will do but good 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.280
 we have to go down and here we will find 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:33.830
 coal that yes we will find number there is 2 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:37.970
 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.890
 19 and 20 wooden blocks of wood 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.370
 coal right here mainer can already do 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.130
 your torches here and you can now make 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.300
 this one I do not know also his oven to be able 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.490
 make us go down to joseba that we 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:58.700
 remember to go down and we 're going to already broke 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:03:00.770
 it's not going 12345678 beautiful blocks and 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.450
 you kill but this is not this so we continue 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.430
 going down here we will come across 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.379
 a little iron 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:12.080
 see one that we already found one two three 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:16.160
 four 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.630
 5 5 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.180
 we can already melt the iron to make 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:26.980
 what is a peak of good iron of 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:31.959
 curse iron 6 7 8 9 river today 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:34.239
 and it's 11 12 13 sleeves are many many 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.220
 iron blocks but you can already 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.980
 to be what is the koh diamond of 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.530
 peak of iron and the bad thing is that here not 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.569
 we have gold meiners but if we continue 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.940
 going down here we will find 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.700
 what it is I think there are six blocks of 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.440
 lapis lazuli we go down we go down and 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.870
 we go down and we find the 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.500
 lapis lazuli and we will also find what 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.090
 which is redstone right here see and I think 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.560
 that that would be all mainer only has them 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.060
 liked do not forget to give like and 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.280
 subscribe and share networks 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.840
 remember that the goal is a thousand 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.720
 sailors before the end of the month of 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.470
 June at this moment we are I think that 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.329
 we are 598 but how fast are we going together 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.890
 I want that if we are going to achieve it and 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.549
 remember that the next goal after 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.930
 of this that are thousand will be 1500 yes 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.210
 then it is this 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.760
 we are seeing 500 in 500 which 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.370
 it's fine I guess it's not that much pressure 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.060
 but it is something then that would be all 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.419
 magners we are 598 in fact and well this 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.419
 you liked it 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.310
 and see you in the next chau chau
