00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 well here we are green and 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.570
 we basically the good of the very 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.120
 5-3 Basic and good I will open the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.120
 32 bit since my computer has s 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.700
 this tutorial will deal with the movement 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.310
 of the camera 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.600
 good on the scale and all that the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.420
 rotation and perspective all that you 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.610
 I'm going to teach you how to do it and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.090
 good that 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.700
 with the mouse wheel you can zoom in and 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.340
 move away 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.860
 the screen or the size of the 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.960
 screen that's going to serve later for 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.440
 to place the figures or what 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.440
 they want to fly 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:59.270
 if we click on this from here this goes to 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:03.160
 be the same and then move on what 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.160
 same as would the wheel 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.500
 if they want to move on the left side 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.259
 right right left good up 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.360
 down from any movement they have to 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:19.330
 press this first 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:22.580
 love as the same as the scale 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.700
 but very well moving to where 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.920
 they want to go sometimes they just go for 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.920
 up and down from left to right 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.890
 and if we press with the right click on 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:43.010
 this you just told them 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.860
 is going to be like the one the scale is going to 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.040
 serve like this this if we press 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.410
 left click 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:55.770
 but now we always have click click 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.770
 right on the scale is not going to do this 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.500
 it's not going to give us a pretty perspective 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.780
 rare in some names performances 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.330
 is going to serve there is not many is not very 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.480
 false 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:14.290
 but well that's another perspective 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.880
 then to rotate the 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.800
 the camera as they want to rotate it 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.610
 simply with this third party can 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.420
 moving to any side of the one 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.180
 want they can turn it to the whole camera 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.299
 for where they want and good 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.569
 we can go down to the plane s that 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.569
 it is invisible 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.210
 and good is that but what if 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.820
 we press with right click on this 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.820
 Well, it's going to turn us around 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.210
 in logic as we want it if it's not going to 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.120
 turn completely to turn around 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.670
 For example, it 's like that, in fact I 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.940
 we want to turn there is 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.920
 well this is going to be pretty me 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.460
 I do not know much about him either but others 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.600
 but it's serving more pretty good and 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.350
 finally he 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.350
 the fourth 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:18.170
 it can be put now doing 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.280
 click on this they chose you appear 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.600
 this or 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:28.890
 putting squeezing on the little wheel has not 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:32.760
 turning squeezing good that is this 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:36.030
 as the name says is cinema 4 has 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:41.100
 Four screens the tray is indicated 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:43.410
 how it would look when viewed from above not 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.050
 I know what we want to do seen from 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:50.510
 up here we have the same options 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.510
 to move away 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.000
 and rotate 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.080
 and if we want to put in this big 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.860
 we just have to press again 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.990
 the wheel we can not here 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.260
 well this is what is the same but 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.610
 seen from the right and this I have 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.680
 seen from the left if I have not seen 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.819
 frontally 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:21.299
 good what is this 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.299
 that appears and xz 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.400
 and it would be the height 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.950
 at the height of the figure that we want 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.000
 do still there is no figure of 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.000
 just a little tutorial 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.810
 as you can see many tutorials are already 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.590
 that there are quite a few things and we are only 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.940
 explaining this 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:48.840
 the X that would be the red line 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.840
 I do not know what it is 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.160
 they were the X that would line the line 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:59.169
 red 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:02.169
 and the width or as you want to say 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.510
 for example if we look at them 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:07.800
 today 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:11.780
 it's a good perspective indeed 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.780
 if we put this more normal 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.160
 and this what is not like that 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:23.440
 well this would be the width as if 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:27.190
 this lengthen and masters in a figure would be 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:30.010
 wider and finally the zeta 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:33.310
 the appointment is the depth to make 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.920
 3d objects that is if I would not have the ce 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.790
 is following two flat objects and not 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:43.160
 it would notice the 3b mexico in the zeta if 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:45.890
 lengthen ivÃ¡n notice more the 3d 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.020
 and good is that today's tutorial I hope 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:51.590
 that you liked, do not forget 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:54.800
 subscribe and that this video seriously 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.510
 that helps me a lot and I'm going to 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.930
 try to keep doing many of these 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:03.320
 videos so they can learn from 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.860
 of this spectacular program that to me 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.860
 I liked it a lot
