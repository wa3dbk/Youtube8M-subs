00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.650
 that you say as you can see it's called 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.379
 baby boomer and this one after nothing 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.570
 I want to measure myself this way to bring this design 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.480
 I hope you like and have subscribe 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.059
 is to win give light and comment good 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.080
 we will be using what is being 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.080
 a form for sculpture 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.230
 a form for sculpture we are going to give 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.230
 shape 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.010
 we stick 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.060
 Of course it brings the form I always 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.640
 I recommend that you put it below to 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.540
 give a little more support after 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.540
 We're closing 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.570
 as even as possible and we are going to 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.570
 place the form 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.320
 well I close so that it is a bit 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.570
 less wide 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.580
 as you can see and then now yes 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.100
 let's start giving a little more 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.979
 camera to be able to be able to 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.979
 fully appreciate mine is natural 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.890
 we are going to put it 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.630
 we scatter to give the form and we give a 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:54.630
 variety towards the natural wii 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.220
 I'm going to make it a number four 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.950
 what is up to here 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.250
 Y 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.160
 let's see the desired length here goes 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.430
 again to do towards cuticle you could 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.840
 tell 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:40.450
 and I arrange my mixture to shape it and 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.459
 structure to the nail 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.700
 to plant well so that they are not 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.270
 are wide the sides will come 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.700
 to make the pearlite 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.700
 and we are going to place it in the cuticle area 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.850
 and as you can see 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.950
 pressing well to seal 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.950
 and sweeping to the point 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.730
 the excesses are removed and we go to the 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.130
 cuticle and avoid excesses so that 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.050
 there is no lifting, there is no way 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.600
 watch 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.180
 second pearl in the cuticle area 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.650
 to fill in the spaces that are 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.650
 have been 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.200
 and a life is targeted 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.470
 equally 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.970
 We moisten the brush and remove the 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.599
 acrylic that has already happened to the area 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.599
 cuticle 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.600
 so let's grab another pearl a 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.210
 little bit 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.200
 the pink acrylic and we will place it 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:04.030
 in the middle of the nail we are going to expand and 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.030
 let's see sweeping towards cuticle 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.900
 after that we are going to take a sweep 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.110
 towards point 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.940
 no matter 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.910
 that is being seen as well as what is left 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.810
 little bit more pink does not matter 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:23.070
 finally let's grab a pearl from 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.070
 natural acrylic 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.410
 we are going to put it in tip 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.750
 we are going to square nail and we are going to give a 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.580
 bitten do cuticles like that are going to 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.000
 combine the two colors and it will give this 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.000
 effect 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.830
 to encapsulate the same with you 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.530
 when this area has already been 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.570
 filed and polished and cleaned we are going to 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.610
 end with a capita of let's 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.610
 put some criticism first nails 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:32.880
 as you can see there something else this 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.580
 requirement do not buy it does not work for 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.770
