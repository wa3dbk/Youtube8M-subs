section on the brief there's gonna be
something<00:00:35.700> out<00:00:35.940> there<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.690> reach<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.960> knew

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
something out there in the reach I knew

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.510 
something out there in the reach I knew
they<00:00:37.350> didn't<00:00:37.590> just<00:00:37.620> built<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.010> for<00:00:38.309> no

they didn't just built that for no

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.889 
they didn't just built that for no
reason<00:00:38.940> there<00:00:39.090> was<00:00:39.180> gonna<00:00:39.450> be<00:00:39.540> something

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
reason there was gonna be something

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.020 
reason there was gonna be something
about<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> DLC<00:00:40.710> happening<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.219> read<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:41.820> if

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
about the DLC happening in read so if

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.250 
about the DLC happening in read so if
there<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.329> going<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.540> be<00:00:42.570> something<00:00:42.899> over

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
there is going to be something over

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.660 
there is going to be something over
there<00:00:43.379> it's<00:00:43.530> probably<00:00:43.649> going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.980> be<00:00:44.040> related

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
there it's probably going to be related

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.520 
there it's probably going to be related
to<00:00:44.700> these<00:00:45.059> social<00:00:45.600> space<00:00:45.899> although<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.410> is

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
to these social space although that is

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.479 
to these social space although that is
probably<00:00:46.860> only<00:00:46.950> gonna<00:00:47.100> be<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.370> different

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
probably only gonna be on a different

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.279 
probably only gonna be on a different
planet<00:00:47.879> on<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.570> next<00:00:48.719> picture<00:00:48.960> you're<00:00:49.200> gonna

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
planet on the next picture you're gonna

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.350 
planet on the next picture you're gonna
see<00:00:49.559> what<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:50.010> call<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.399> social<00:00:50.940> space<00:00:51.059> so

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
see what we call the social space so

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.880 
see what we call the social space so
it's<00:00:51.480> gonna<00:00:51.570> be<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> reef<00:00:52.079> social<00:00:52.500> space

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
it's gonna be the reef social space

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.529 
it's gonna be the reef social space
that's<00:00:53.100> probably<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.520> word<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.390> is

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
that's probably a word is but this is

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.639 
that's probably a word is but this is
kind<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.719> weird<00:00:54.870> considering<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.350> there's<00:00:55.559> a

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
kind of weird considering that there's a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.139 
kind of weird considering that there's a
planet<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.160> background<00:00:56.610> which<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.789> weird

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
planet in the background which is weird

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.369 
planet in the background which is weird
considering<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> reef<00:00:57.930> doesn't<00:00:58.260> really

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
considering that the reef doesn't really

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.229 
considering that the reef doesn't really
have<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.590> planet<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.489> I'm<00:00:59.609> not<00:00:59.789> too<00:00:59.940> sure<00:01:00.090> what

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
have a planet but I'm not too sure what

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.670 
have a planet but I'm not too sure what
it's<00:01:00.359> going<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.539> be<00:01:00.600> perhaps<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.469> going<00:01:01.620> to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
it's going to be perhaps it's going to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.410 
it's going to be perhaps it's going to
be<00:01:01.800> something<00:01:02.039> like<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.579> tower<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.149> get<00:01:03.300> to

be something like the tower you get to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.450 
be something like the tower you get to
socialize<00:01:03.809> with<00:01:03.960> other<00:01:04.049> people<00:01:04.350> hopefully<00:01:05.280> is

socialize with other people hopefully is

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.890 
socialize with other people hopefully is
gonna<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> place<00:01:06.299> where<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.630> actually

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
interesting and it's kind of weird the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.210

rum<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:32.640> one<00:01:32.759> thing<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.030> probably<00:01:33.210> did

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
rum but one thing you probably did

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.179 
rum but one thing you probably did
notice<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.170> previous<00:01:34.320> one<00:01:34.770> did<00:01:34.979> say

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
notice is that the previous one did say

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.649 
notice is that the previous one did say
at<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.579> dark<00:01:35.909> below<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.329> one<00:01:36.479> says

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
at the dark below and this one says

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.420 
at the dark below and this one says
house<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.110> wolves<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.770> still<00:01:38.040> has<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
house of wolves and it still has the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.859 
house of wolves and it still has the
picture<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.909> dark<00:01:39.180> below<00:01:39.329> which<00:01:39.570> kind<00:01:39.810> of

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
picture of the dark below which kind of

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:40.969 
picture of the dark below which kind of
makes<00:01:39.990> me<00:01:40.170> believe<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.500> lot<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.770> these<00:01:40.920> things

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
makes me believe a lot of these things

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.889 
makes me believe a lot of these things
maybe<00:01:41.340> fake<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.270> lot<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.720> things

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
maybe fake but it's a lot of things

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.630 
maybe fake but it's a lot of things
we're<00:01:43.079> really<00:01:43.290> well<00:01:43.530> done<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.369> such

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
we're really well done to have such

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.429 
we're really well done to have such
small<00:01:44.970> mistakes<00:01:45.570> would<00:01:45.840> be<00:01:45.990> kind<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.290> weird

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
small mistakes would be kind of weird

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.080 
small mistakes would be kind of weird
it's<00:01:46.710> probably<00:01:47.009> just<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.280> placeholder<00:01:47.610> for

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
it's probably just a placeholder for

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.880 
it's probably just a placeholder for
what<00:01:48.689> days<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.140> come<00:01:49.409> they're<00:01:49.590> probably<00:01:49.740> gonna

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
what days to come they're probably gonna

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.300 
what days to come they're probably gonna
have<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.250> little<00:01:50.399> picture<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.979> the<00:01:52.979> cal

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
have that little picture of the the cal

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.700 
have that little picture of the the cal
behind<00:01:53.820> him<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.329> course<00:01:54.570> we<00:01:54.689> got<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.020> belly<00:01:55.500> of

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
behind him of course we got the belly of

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.959 
behind him of course we got the belly of
the<00:01:55.770> beast<00:01:55.860> it's<00:01:56.340> obviously<00:01:56.610> supposed<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.909> be

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
the beast it's obviously supposed to be

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.760

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.200 
supposed to be a level 28 strike because
the<00:02:01.170> first<00:02:01.469> one<00:02:01.649> was<00:02:01.799> 24<00:02:02.219> then<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.460> went<00:02:02.610> 26<00:02:02.969> now

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
the first one was 24 then I went 26 now

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.789 
the first one was 24 then I went 26 now
it's<00:02:03.390> up<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.509> 28<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.290> probably<00:02:04.500> gonna<00:02:04.619> be<00:02:04.710> at

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
it's up to 28 is probably gonna be at

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.679 
it's up to 28 is probably gonna be at
level<00:02:04.979> 28<00:02:05.369> playlist<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.270> one<00:02:06.420> seems

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
level 28 playlist so this one seems

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.270 
level 28 playlist so this one seems
pretty<00:02:06.899> pretty<00:02:07.350> good<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:07.710> again<00:02:07.950> has<00:02:08.129> that

holder<00:02:35.359> kind<00:02:35.569> of<00:02:35.659> things<00:02:35.870> which<00:02:36.049> makes<00:02:36.260> these

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
holder kind of things which makes these

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.140 
holder kind of things which makes these
images<00:02:36.769> kind<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.129> questionable<00:02:37.549> and<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:37.969> did

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
images kind of questionable and I did

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.369 
images kind of questionable and I did
question<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.540> lot<00:02:38.659> of<00:02:38.780> these<00:02:38.870> things<00:02:39.139> in<00:02:39.290> my

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
question a lot of these things in my

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.979 
question a lot of these things in my
personal<00:02:39.650> opinion<00:02:39.889> I<00:02:40.310> do<00:02:40.909> kind<00:02:41.450> of<00:02:41.510> think<00:02:41.719> that

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
personal opinion I do kind of think that

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.720 
personal opinion I do kind of think that
these<00:02:42.169> things<00:02:42.379> may<00:02:42.650> be<00:02:42.680> fake<00:02:43.249> and<00:02:43.280> these<00:02:43.579> are

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
these things may be fake and these are

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.030 
these things may be fake and these are
not<00:02:43.999> the<00:02:44.389> final<00:02:44.780> decisions<00:02:45.230> although<00:02:45.889> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
not the final decisions although the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.979 
not the final decisions although the
social<00:02:46.430> space<00:02:46.519> is<00:02:46.790> an<00:02:46.909> interesting<00:02:47.239> idea<00:02:47.599> and

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
social space is an interesting idea and

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.360 
social space is an interesting idea and
I<00:02:48.169> don't<00:02:48.349> know<00:02:48.409> what<00:02:48.709> they<00:02:48.859> would<00:02:48.980> be<00:02:49.040> saying

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
I don't know what they would be saying

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.459 
I don't know what they would be saying
about<00:02:49.639> the<00:02:50.359> way<00:02:50.569> that<00:02:50.750> they<00:02:50.870> would<00:02:51.019> fake<00:02:51.260> that

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:51.469 
about the way that they would fake that

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:52.539 
about the way that they would fake that
all<00:02:51.650> that<00:02:51.769> stuff<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.040> why<00:02:52.189> they<00:02:52.310> would<00:02:52.430> make

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
all that stuff and why they would make

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.399 
all that stuff and why they would make
that<00:02:52.699> up<00:02:52.849> so<00:02:53.000> maybe<00:02:53.209> social<00:02:53.540> space<00:02:53.719> is<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.930> real

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:54.409 
that up so maybe social space is a real

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.409 
that up so maybe social space is a real
thing<00:02:54.680> just<00:02:54.889> because<00:02:55.099> it<00:02:55.189> seems<00:02:55.370> kind<00:02:55.579> of<00:02:55.609> out

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:56.419 
thing just because it seems kind of out

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:57.759 
thing just because it seems kind of out
of<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.659> ballpark<00:02:56.900> but<00:02:57.260> everything<00:02:57.560> else<00:02:57.680> just

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
of the ballpark but everything else just

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.979 
of the ballpark but everything else just
seems<00:02:58.099> kind<00:02:58.400> of<00:02:58.489> a<00:02:58.609> normal<00:02:59.480> thing<00:02:59.659> than<00:02:59.900> it

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
seems kind of a normal thing than it

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.500 
seems kind of a normal thing than it
seems<00:03:00.590> kind<00:03:00.829> of<00:03:00.919> possible<00:03:01.400> but<00:03:01.939> again<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.419> was

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
seems kind of possible but again it was

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.490 
seems kind of possible but again it was
just<00:03:02.659> kind<00:03:02.840> of<00:03:02.870> weird<00:03:03.019> having<00:03:03.230> all<00:03:03.409> these

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
just kind of weird having all these

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.990 
just kind of weird having all these
placeholders<00:03:03.799> and<00:03:04.159> it's<00:03:04.400> like<00:03:04.549> dude<00:03:04.849> you

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
placeholders and it's like dude you

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.399 
placeholders and it's like dude you
could<00:03:05.150> have<00:03:05.239> easily<00:03:05.480> changed<00:03:06.139> all<00:03:06.230> these

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
could have easily changed all these

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.349 
could have easily changed all these
numbers<00:03:06.590> around<00:03:06.919> put<00:03:07.549> a<00:03:07.579> different<00:03:07.760> image<00:03:08.090> in

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
numbers around put a different image in

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.179 
numbers around put a different image in
there<00:03:08.540> but<00:03:08.750> again<00:03:08.989> that's<00:03:09.859> all<00:03:10.040> the

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.189 
there but again that's all the

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:11.770 
there but again that's all the
information<00:03:10.400> we<00:03:10.669> have<00:03:10.909> right<00:03:11.120> now<00:03:11.150> again<00:03:11.689> if
