 good to join, go knee to see 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.269
 The handset looks beautiful from any 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.210
 angle is where history art and fashion become 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.430

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.370

 always the history of art 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.880
 and can not talk about impressionism 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.250
 not to mention hand matri one of the regions 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.619
 most charming in the city 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.600
 this super bohemian neighborhood was a 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.600
 a team of artists 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.869

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.930
 in this wall it is written I love you and more 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:49.650
 of 300 and dilma if love really never 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:55.590
 going out of fashion is not software under the 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:57.810

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.910
 magical as this could not fail to 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.440
 eternalize this unique moment after all 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.540
 were the great artists 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.550
 Impressionists who have broken 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.130
 barriers of art and inspired me 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.900
