three guys have stepped up I think

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.060

Austin<00:01:02.489> Carter<00:01:03.210> Sanders<00:01:03.660> has<00:01:03.899> had<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.920> know<00:01:05.010> I

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
Austin Carter Sanders has had you know I

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.289 
Austin Carter Sanders has had you know I
thought<00:01:05.309> he'd<00:01:05.489> have<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> good<00:01:05.850> camp<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.150> think

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
thought he'd have a good camp I think

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.370 
thought he'd have a good camp I think
he's<00:01:06.390> having<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.630> better<00:01:06.810> camp<00:01:07.110> than<00:01:07.290> I

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
he's having a better camp than I

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.219 
he's having a better camp than I
anticipated<00:01:08.299> really<00:01:09.299> from<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.780> scrimmage

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
anticipated really from the scrimmage

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.660 
anticipated really from the scrimmage
last<00:01:10.439> Saturday<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.950> think<00:01:11.100> Dolph<00:01:11.250> fence<00:01:11.490> is

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
last Saturday I think Dolph fence is

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.740 
last Saturday I think Dolph fence is
really<00:01:11.880> starting<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> build<00:01:12.390> some<00:01:12.479> confidence

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
really starting to build some confidence

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.109 
really starting to build some confidence
as<00:01:13.140> good<00:01:13.770> as<00:01:13.890> Jordan<00:01:14.310> ones<00:01:14.460> last<00:01:14.790> year<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.090> think

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
as good as Jordan ones last year I think

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.030 
as good as Jordan ones last year I think
he's<00:01:15.390> had<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> better<00:01:15.840> camp<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.350> really<00:01:16.650> do<00:01:16.830> I

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
he's had a better camp I really do I

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.789 
he's had a better camp I really do I
think<00:01:17.580> Kraus<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.330> Kraus<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.869> coming<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.320> and

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
think Kraus the Kraus is coming on and

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.310 
think Kraus the Kraus is coming on and
becoming<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.850> real<00:01:21.119> factor<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.810> what's<00:01:22.049> going

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
becoming a real factor in what's going

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.870 
becoming a real factor in what's going
on<00:01:22.470> right<00:01:22.710> now<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.009> then<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> old<00:01:23.400> line<00:01:23.610> as<00:01:23.850> a

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
on right now and then the old line as a

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.539 
on right now and then the old line as a
whole<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:25.080> o-line<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.530> whole<00:01:25.680> defense<00:01:26.310> I

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
whole the o-line is a whole defense I

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.810 
whole the o-line is a whole defense I
think<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> defensive<00:01:27.780> line<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.080> what<00:01:28.229> stood<00:01:28.500> out

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
think a defensive line is what stood out

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.310 
think a defensive line is what stood out
you<00:01:29.820> know<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.180> think<00:01:30.240> Stephen<00:01:30.689> weatherly<00:01:31.110> like

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
you know I think Stephen weatherly like

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.960 
great things Caleb's doing about what we
thought<00:01:36.689> which<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.110> really<00:01:37.380> good<00:01:37.729> Vince<00:01:38.729> has

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
thought which is really good Vince has

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.850 
thought which is really good Vince has
probably<00:01:39.240> been<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.479> surprise<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.409> watch<00:01:40.590> him

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
probably been the surprise you watch him

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.830 
probably been the surprise you watch him
condition<00:01:41.400> at<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> end<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.299> was<00:01:42.450> always<00:01:42.630> an

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
condition at the end that was always an

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.749 
condition at the end that was always an
issue<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.110> him<00:01:43.380> he<00:01:43.530> could<00:01:43.710> go<00:01:43.860> hard<00:01:44.159> for<00:01:44.490> three

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
issue for him he could go hard for three

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.399 
issue for him he could go hard for three
plays<00:01:45.060> pretty<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> hard<00:01:46.020> time<00:01:46.140> sustaining

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
plays pretty and a hard time sustaining

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.039 
plays pretty and a hard time sustaining
it<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.430> past<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.850> right<00:01:48.030> now<00:01:48.240> during

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
it in the past and right now during

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.690 
it in the past and right now during
practice<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.710> conditioning<00:01:50.280> afterwards

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
practice and conditioning afterwards

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.399 
practice and conditioning afterwards
he's<00:01:50.820> doing<00:01:51.090> really<00:01:51.270> well<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.720> then<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.350> a

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
he's doing really well and then in a

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.920 
he's doing really well and then in a
secondary<00:01:52.950> all<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.090> guys<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.509> expect

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
secondary all the guys that you expect

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.469 
secondary all the guys that you expect
to<00:01:55.020> do<00:01:55.170> well<00:01:55.200> have<00:01:56.009> done<00:01:56.310> well<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:57.270> think

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
to do well have done well I think

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.060 
to do well have done well I think
probably<00:01:57.960> Andrew<00:01:58.290> Williamson<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.950> guy

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
probably Andrew Williamson is the guy

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.260 
probably Andrew Williamson is the guy
that's<00:01:59.219> had<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.430> really<00:01:59.640> good<00:01:59.850> camp<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:00.180> you

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
that's had a really good camp if you

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.760 
that's had a really good camp if you
came<00:02:00.479> out<00:02:00.659> didn't<00:02:00.990> know<00:02:01.049> anything<00:02:01.290> about<00:02:01.469> our

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
came out didn't know anything about our

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.170 
came out didn't know anything about our
starting<00:02:02.100> lineup<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.520> past<00:02:02.729> you'd

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
starting lineup in the past you'd

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.490 
starting lineup in the past you'd
probably<00:02:03.360> think<00:02:03.509> angie<00:02:03.810> williams<00:02:03.930> was<00:02:04.290> one<00:02:04.409> of

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
probably think angie williams was one of

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.730 
probably think angie williams was one of
our<00:02:04.560> starters<00:02:05.600> what

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
our starters what

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.710 
our starters what
things<00:02:07.040> you<00:02:07.310> places<00:02:08.060> maybe<00:02:08.239> you<00:02:08.390> want<00:02:08.539> to<00:02:08.599> see

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
things you places maybe you want to see

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.130 
things you places maybe you want to see
things<00:02:08.869> better<00:02:09.289> between<00:02:09.500> now<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.870> one<00:02:11.870> real

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
things better between now and one real

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.420 
things better between now and one real
one<00:02:12.440> more<00:02:12.590> thing<00:02:12.770> that<00:02:12.800> I<00:02:12.980> probably<00:02:13.160> didn't

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
one more thing that I probably didn't

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.800 
one more thing that I probably didn't
mention<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:13.730> how<00:02:13.880> should<00:02:14.090> another<00:02:14.330> guys<00:02:14.569> Hudson

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
mention I how should another guys Hudson

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.960 
mention I how should another guys Hudson
the<00:02:15.319> punter<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.800> think<00:02:16.190> he's<00:02:16.310> been<00:02:16.550> he's<00:02:16.790> been

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
the punter I think he's been he's been

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.120 
the punter I think he's been he's been
killing<00:02:17.239> it<00:02:17.450> really<00:02:17.840> has<00:02:17.959> i<00:02:17.989> think<00:02:18.170> like<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:18.860> lot

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
killing it really has i think like a lot

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.680 
killing it really has i think like a lot
of<00:02:19.160> guys<00:02:19.370> are<00:02:19.580> still<00:02:19.760> some<00:02:19.940> consistency

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
of guys are still some consistency

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.940 
of guys are still some consistency
issues<00:02:20.810> that<00:02:21.200> we'd<00:02:21.319> like<00:02:21.470> at<00:02:21.650> that<00:02:21.739> position

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
issues that we'd like at that position

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.820 
issues that we'd like at that position
but<00:02:22.760> but<00:02:23.420> i<00:02:23.480> think<00:02:23.720> he's<00:02:24.230> done<00:02:24.440> really<00:02:24.620> well

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
but but i think he's done really well

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.800 
but but i think he's done really well
probably<00:02:25.099> maybe<00:02:25.670> probably<00:02:26.300> one<00:02:26.660> of<00:02:26.690> the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
probably maybe probably one of the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.110 
probably maybe probably one of the
strongest<00:02:26.930> camps<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:27.739> know<00:02:27.890> in<00:02:28.670> terms<00:02:28.880> of

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
strongest camps you know in terms of

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.390 
strongest camps you know in terms of
maybe<00:02:29.810> not<00:02:30.050> anticipating<00:02:30.830> that<00:02:30.860> happening

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
maybe not anticipating that happening

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.910 
maybe not anticipating that happening
I'm<00:02:31.670> sorry<00:02:31.940> things<00:02:32.930> that<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.319> really<00:02:33.349> want<00:02:33.860> to

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
I'm sorry things that you really want to

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.290 
I'm sorry things that you really want to
see<00:02:33.980> improvement<00:02:34.550> on<00:02:34.610> between<00:02:34.880> now<00:02:35.120> and

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
see improvement on between now and

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.240 
see improvement on between now and
opening<00:02:35.630> day<00:02:35.750> well<00:02:36.140> today<00:02:36.349> I<00:02:36.560> thought<00:02:36.980> you

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
opening day well today I thought you

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.850 
opening day well today I thought you
know<00:02:37.400> we<00:02:38.390> talked<00:02:38.630> all<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.870> time<00:02:38.989> about<00:02:39.350> ninety

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
know we talked all the time about ninety

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.320 
know we talked all the time about ninety
percent<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.220> college<00:02:40.519> teams<00:02:40.790> beat<00:02:41.060> themselves

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
percent of college teams beat themselves

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.850 
percent of college teams beat themselves
and<00:02:41.959> we're<00:02:42.080> not<00:02:42.230> going<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.440> be<00:02:42.530> one<00:02:42.680> of<00:02:42.709> those

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
and we're not going to be one of those

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.900 
and we're not going to be one of those
teams<00:02:43.100> would<00:02:43.310> be<00:02:43.430> one<00:02:43.580> of<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.730> most

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
teams would be one of the most

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.300 
teams would be one of the most
disciplined<00:02:44.510> teams<00:02:44.720> in<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:44.959> country

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
disciplined teams in the country

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.710 
disciplined teams in the country
physically<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.459> mentally<00:02:46.549> tough<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.209> right

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
physically and mentally tough and right

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.880 
physically and mentally tough and right
today<00:02:47.989> I<00:02:48.140> thought<00:02:48.380> we<00:02:48.470> were<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:48.590> little<00:02:48.709> bit

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
today I thought we were a little bit

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.170 
today I thought we were a little bit
sloppy<00:02:49.160> with<00:02:49.400> some<00:02:49.610> of<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.760> things<00:02:49.940> they'll

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
sloppy with some of the things they'll

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.430 
sloppy with some of the things they'll
jump<00:02:50.360> on<00:02:50.480> all<00:02:50.569> sides<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.110> stuff<00:02:51.260> like<00:02:51.380> that

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
jump on all sides and stuff like that

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.340 
jump on all sides and stuff like that
that<00:02:51.590> we<00:02:51.709> got<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:51.980> clean<00:02:52.220> up<00:02:52.450> so<00:02:53.450> that's<00:02:54.140> the

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
that we got to clean up so that's the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.930 
that we got to clean up so that's the
most<00:02:54.500> important<00:02:54.950> thing<00:02:54.980> you<00:02:55.549> don't<00:02:55.670> want<00:02:55.880> to

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
most important thing you don't want to

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.509 
most important thing you don't want to
go<00:02:56.060> out<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.480> play<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:56.900> first<00:02:57.319> game<00:02:57.650> like<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.280> lot

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
go out and play a first game like a lot

00:02:58.519 --> 00:02:59.940 
go out and play a first game like a lot
of<00:02:58.549> people<00:02:58.790> do<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.239> you're<00:02:59.360> just<00:02:59.450> sloppy

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
of people do and you're just sloppy

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.380 
of people do and you're just sloppy
after<00:03:00.950> not<00:03:01.100> playing<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.549> live<00:03:01.730> action<00:03:02.030> for<00:03:02.360> a

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
after not playing a live action for a

after not playing a live action for a
long<00:03:02.569> time<00:03:02.810> so<00:03:03.049> you<00:03:03.440> know<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:03.560> just<00:03:03.620> want<00:03:03.920> us<00:03:03.980> to

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
long time so you know I just want us to

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
between now and the game it seems crazy

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.729 
between now and the game it seems crazy
but<00:03:08.239> you<00:03:08.690> may<00:03:08.840> see<00:03:08.900> more<00:03:09.260> heat<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:09.650> humidity

but you may see more heat and humidity

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.580 
but you may see more heat and humidity
in<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.489> season<00:03:11.269> that<00:03:11.420> you're<00:03:11.540> seeing<00:03:11.810> now<00:03:11.870> do

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.490 
you do anything as the staff to push
your<00:03:14.239> guys<00:03:14.390> a<00:03:14.420> little<00:03:14.720> harder<00:03:15.109> since<00:03:15.260> it's

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
your guys a little harder since it's

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.729 
your guys a little harder since it's
been<00:03:15.680> really<00:03:16.310> mild<00:03:16.579> for<00:03:16.940> August<00:03:17.269> yeah<00:03:17.900> you

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
been really mild for August yeah you

been really mild for August yeah you
know<00:03:18.829> the<00:03:19.040> most<00:03:19.250> important<00:03:19.820> thing<00:03:20.000> is<00:03:20.269> is<00:03:20.540> the

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
know the most important thing is is the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.660 
know the most important thing is is the
conditioning<00:03:21.290> aspect<00:03:21.739> and<00:03:21.829> I<00:03:21.890> think<00:03:22.130> we<00:03:22.459> do<00:03:22.579> as

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
conditioning aspect and I think we do as

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.810 
conditioning aspect and I think we do as
good<00:03:22.790> a<00:03:22.850> job<00:03:22.910> of<00:03:23.150> that<00:03:23.359> all<00:03:23.540> summer<00:03:23.900> as<00:03:24.320> anybody

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
good a job of that all summer as anybody

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.430 
good a job of that all summer as anybody
it'll<00:03:25.820> we<00:03:25.970> run<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.180> math<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.660> practice<00:03:27.140> and<00:03:27.290> do

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
it'll we run a math to practice and do

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.720 
it'll we run a math to practice and do
those<00:03:27.590> types<00:03:27.890> of<00:03:28.040> things<00:03:28.100> but<00:03:28.340> there's<00:03:28.489> a<00:03:28.519> fine

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
those types of things but there's a fine

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.610 
those types of things but there's a fine
line<00:03:28.760> to<00:03:29.150> it<00:03:29.239> too<00:03:29.390> because<00:03:29.570> you<00:03:29.959> know<00:03:30.320> you<00:03:30.440> want

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
now it's a fine line but that's where

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.780

in hand and we kind of go from there
other<00:03:40.579> side<00:03:40.940> other<00:03:41.299> signs<00:03:41.750> you<00:03:41.959> look<00:03:42.170> for<00:03:42.410> when

you say hey maybe we push them a little

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.569 
you say hey maybe we push them a little
bit<00:03:44.180> too<00:03:44.359> hard<00:03:44.569> no<00:03:45.410> I<00:03:45.440> think<00:03:46.069> to<00:03:46.130> be<00:03:46.250> honest

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
bit too hard no I think to be honest

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.340 
bit too hard no I think to be honest
with<00:03:46.700> you<00:03:46.819> that's<00:03:47.090> where<00:03:47.450> it<00:03:47.569> becomes<00:03:47.720> an<00:03:48.170> art

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
with you that's where it becomes an art

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.440 
with you that's where it becomes an art
not<00:03:48.530> a<00:03:48.590> science<00:03:48.680> i<00:03:49.190> think<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.760> plays<00:03:50.060> and<00:03:50.090> the

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
not a science i think the plays and the

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.420 
not a science i think the plays and the
schemes<00:03:50.810> that's<00:03:51.109> more<00:03:51.380> of<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:52.010> science

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
schemes that's more of a the science

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.819 
schemes that's more of a the science
aspect<00:03:52.609> but<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:53.569> art<00:03:53.780> is<00:03:53.989> how<00:03:54.319> do<00:03:54.380> you<00:03:54.470> push

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
aspect but the art is how do you push

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.309 
aspect but the art is how do you push
them<00:03:55.100> as<00:03:55.609> far<00:03:55.910> as<00:03:56.000> you<00:03:56.120> possibly<00:03:56.569> can<00:03:56.810> to<00:03:57.139> build

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
them as far as you possibly can to build

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.170 
them as far as you possibly can to build
that<00:03:57.500> mental<00:03:57.889> and<00:03:58.010> physical<00:03:58.130> toughness<00:03:58.430> but

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
that mental and physical toughness but

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.300 
that mental and physical toughness but
not<00:03:59.389> too<00:03:59.690> much<00:03:59.720> that<00:04:00.470> they're<00:04:00.680> fatigued<00:04:01.130> and

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
not too much that they're fatigued and

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.530 
not too much that they're fatigued and
they<00:04:01.400> don't<00:04:01.489> have<00:04:01.609> their<00:04:01.819> legs<00:04:02.000> back<00:04:02.269> so<00:04:02.420> we

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
they don't have their legs back so we

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.870 
they don't have their legs back so we
can<00:04:02.630> play<00:04:02.810> fast<00:04:03.049> opening<00:04:03.500> week<00:04:03.700> kind<00:04:04.700> of<00:04:04.760> reach

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
can play fast opening week kind of reach

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.370 
can play fast opening week kind of reach
the<00:04:05.000> point<00:04:05.120> you<00:04:05.269> can't<00:04:05.480> really<00:04:05.569> look<00:04:06.019> starting

week have you seen more cohesion on the
offensive<00:05:33.530> line<00:05:33.650> I<00:05:34.100> don't<00:05:35.030> know<00:05:35.120> if<00:05:35.210> that's

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
offensive line I don't know if that's

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.510 
offensive line I don't know if that's
necessarily<00:05:35.570> right<00:05:36.110> I<00:05:36.140> would<00:05:36.530> say<00:05:36.740> that<00:05:36.770> it's

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
necessarily right I would say that it's

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.190 
necessarily right I would say that it's
been<00:05:37.790> competitive<00:05:38.330> now<00:05:38.540> I<00:05:38.570> think<00:05:38.720> early<00:05:38.960> in

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
been competitive now I think early in

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.390 
been competitive now I think early in
camp<00:05:39.410> the<00:05:39.590> defense<00:05:39.950> was<00:05:40.070> getting<00:05:40.310> after

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
camp the defense was getting after

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.310 
camp the defense was getting after
dolphins<00:05:40.880> pretty<00:05:41.120> good<00:05:41.360> and<00:05:41.630> you<00:05:41.930> guys<00:05:42.110> at

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
dolphins pretty good and you guys at

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.390 
dolphins pretty good and you guys at
that<00:05:42.470> point<00:05:42.740> we're<00:05:42.860> asking<00:05:43.160> me<00:05:43.250> are<00:05:43.370> you

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
that point we're asking me are you

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.310 
that point we're asking me are you
concerned<00:05:43.910> or<00:05:44.210> you<00:05:44.270> and<00:05:44.450> I<00:05:44.510> said<00:05:44.720> no<00:05:44.870> this<00:05:45.080> is

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
concerned or you and I said no this is

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.230 
concerned or you and I said no this is
this<00:05:45.620> is<00:05:45.830> just<00:05:46.040> typically<00:05:46.370> how<00:05:46.550> it<00:05:46.610> goes<00:05:46.940> and

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
this is just typically how it goes and

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.360 
this is just typically how it goes and
then<00:05:47.390> you<00:05:48.080> know<00:05:48.170> now<00:05:48.410> the<00:05:48.470> offense<00:05:48.890> is<00:05:49.100> called

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
then you know now the offense is called

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.180 
then you know now the offense is called
up<00:05:49.640> and<00:05:49.760> you're<00:05:49.850> seeing<00:05:50.090> more<00:05:50.390> plays<00:05:50.950> but<00:05:51.950> you

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
up and you're seeing more plays but you

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.080 
up and you're seeing more plays but you
know<00:05:52.280> I<00:05:52.310> think<00:05:52.490> I<00:05:52.670> think<00:05:52.880> it's<00:05:52.970> pretty

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
know I think I think it's pretty

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.810 
know I think I think it's pretty
competitive<00:05:53.600> right<00:05:53.690> now
