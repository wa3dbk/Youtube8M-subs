00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:07.899
 notice to fans of luis mariano this game is 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.220
 passes to mexico old carne erwan a 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.690
 man with prognathic jaw like a 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.490
 dress style quite close to 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.990
 that of the wolves chador remains he had 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.180
 another particular style is that it 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.010
 works in the incredible singing 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.480
 of agave that he will fight against a 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.820
 naughty escalettes to whoever is called g 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.440
 kalaka gran to the case is a type he 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.880
 tried to steal the president's daughter 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.220
 tea in order to make the terrible pass 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.960
 service of Mayan sacrificial rituals and 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.640
 you know it in the barrio we decided 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.379
 to completely rethink the scenario of 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.540
 super Mario but why did we do it 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.579
 to offer you a nice 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.019
 little game of metroidvania that was 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.850
 pampered by all the press 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:41.890
 international video game I do not 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.120
 do not understand exactly why we 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.890
 let's fight against a 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.269
 nasty villainous sneakers in this 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.620
 episode of a critics show 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.510
 video game from belgium 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.489
 certainly as you know from a 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.539
 her name is called but how 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.949
 it's still called this show 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.879
 I like an art yes yes she is called 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.879
 cruel criticism 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.720
 hi I decided to criticize this game 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.300
 with the level of gravitas which 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.980
 requires I have here a package of 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.500
 marshmallows I have marshmallows a 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.670
 last I can not close in doing I know 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.470
 not if it sounds at the microphone but I 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.050
 marshmallows in the hands the m 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.180
 hedges of which but ben plays to start 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.920
 to criticize this ridiculous game play does 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.850
 by people from toronto this 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.740
 will be a one shot 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.600
 if in some video game reviews 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.310
 what was called mas co us 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.700
 left for this dropbox game that 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.590
 is a studio created in toronto the canadian 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.729
 then the Canadians and the Mexicans they 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.780
 can not care one another's mouths 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.220
 others because it's not really 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.810
 racist in fact of one it is because they 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.340
 are on the same continent is good yes 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.340
 it's a little racist and it's ridiculous 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.660
 but let's admit there's nothing really 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.410
 particularly noteworthy or canada 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.880
 by the by the indians maybe a nose 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.410
 still it's not really their indians 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.490
 them inciting the indians who survive 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.740
 because they were on the continent 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.630
 North American so that's how 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.209
 we are so a company that is made by 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.950
 chris harvey moving averages and juan 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.570
 smith is nothing serious it looks like 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.970
 names of little apples but it's like 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.470
 that it works and they made some 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.030
 games before being at dreamworks 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.140
 studios these people because these old 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.970
 Pseudo Interactive 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.440
 born to company who was pseudo 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.940
 interactive who themselves made 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.260
 pseudo video game that was pseudo 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.000
 interesting but was not really 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.820
 good no more handsomely it's walking 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.600
 but we know the people they have 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:53.480
 worked on saddles the full damage 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.400
 self not a good game in the water 1 but 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.720
 let's admit it here and so it's one of 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.340
 these games that has been praised by the 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.049
 Parisian playful video critic because 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.010
 that he was there the fun lol and that the 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.450
 Criticism 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.030
 Parisian videogame they are fans of 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.239
 luciano because you know people 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.580
 who have never known how to lay eggs 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.290
 their lives are usually fans of wrestling 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.060
 I do not know why I'm coming to 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.860
 explain it but that's how it is 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.810
 so a game was totally foolish about 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.489
 his side there but making a 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.350
 newspaper does not make a good game 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.580
 unfortunately no we have here a 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.519
 game with a fighting system 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.810
 relatively flat and tasteless that beats 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.630
 all are guy mix on the fact that his 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.430
 identity this fashion in mexico she and that 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.810
 it's a metroidvania not a 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.850
 insipid remark from me did 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.250
 notice that the genre level of play 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.690
 metroidvania coming out is really more 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.640
 high than what is like style like 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.140
 what chameleon comes from really better 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.270
 Thu 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.590
 that i'm going to say spelling which is 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.760
 stuff like that it's really better 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.440
 it's a lot harder besides 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.840
 though but amelie a little the 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.610
 weak cousin of the family he is hard 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.590
 but not too hard it's ridiculous by 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.410
 traoré and fun graphic culés rating 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.030
 but not really fun there a lol scenario 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.160
 but not really very lol because 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.900
 Super Mario is the dance scenario 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.370
 or in the bars eyes we like that he 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.450
 is super mario that it's normally a 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.810
 game that is done in the barrios is a 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.360
 game that's good the marshmallows who 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.560
 is done bah in toronto ctt so you 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.819
 have some stuff you have some stuff 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.320
 you break things you break some 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.970
 stuff wants to move between the world of 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.380
 dead but passed between the world of 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.850
 dead and the eastern world live and 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.799
 obviously that's stuff you can 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.630
 do different merchants your good 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.120
 meaning like that it works them 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.590
 different thing or good bah here you 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.300
 play it I'm going to play because 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.800
 it was free on pbuh insinuating 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.450
 it's free on playstation instead but 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.620
 good as it was on playstation place 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.820
 I certainly pay to be able to 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.230
 play so I thought I was going 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.270
 make it profitable with a small 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.980
 criticism is not really a good game 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.600
 finally it's an average game 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.550
 it's a game a bit higher than the 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.290
 mean I did not play a metroidvania 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.770
 for a long time and that you love him 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.570
 Mexican wrestling will play that or at least 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.979
 if you think but the 4th may cyclops the 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.810
 most people who think 2004 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.220
 mexicans have never seen a single match 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.900
 Mexican wrestling live in their lives 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.729
 oh I saw a wrestling match 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.229
 mexican when you mean by that everything 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.180
 must go to Brussels it was a 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.340
 event event it was enough 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.370
 incredible makes me all the inverted 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.979
 albeit amelie which is just a game 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.720
 nice but we took it in 6 hours 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.979
 and after we say bah it's okay 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.710
 because I would never want to 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.510
 replay of my life so that's what it is 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.820
 not exactly bad but from there to 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.250
 pay to play there I have small 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.840
 doubts anyway note that the animation 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.310
 is charming the graphic style is 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.600
 really cute and that's the 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.820
 great success of the title it's a game 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.289
 which is really pretty name do a lot 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.550
 game are really pretty that anything 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.350
 great thing to offer you in terms 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.669
 of gameplay unfortunately this is the 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.070
 game is part of it 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:39.310
 yes so here I give him two 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.789
 marshmallow on up to more than 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.789
 marshmallows
