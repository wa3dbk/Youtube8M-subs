00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:13.639
 now lie down or trained exactly 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.289
 so we get your device we take 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.539
 preferably a horn 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.210
 we made sure to put the pocket 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:24.169
 on the left hand he is right handed and we 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.220
 will scrape the device on the index because 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.349
 we did not rope it is this 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.210
 plastic utensil and allows 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.890
 pick up the ingredients at the founders and 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.989
 six plants take advantage of the rope 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.890
 it's rigid and it allows 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.110
 to have a better take of 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.870
 especially ingredients and it avoids in 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.470
 put everywhere on the fingers so there in 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:52.280
 rack the device on the edge of the index 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:57.250
 and ebit to dirty the bosses in your pocket 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.250
 once we 've done that we'll be able to 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:06.309
 go up the edges delicately 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.309
 so he is well hunt but 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.640
 an important thing before obviously the 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.220
 doll for effect that it flows 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.970
 everywhere we will keep the pocket closed 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.460
 in the hand always make sure 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.260
 take the example of the mittle when 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.300
 you put on a mittens you have 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.200
 always your mac is like that so there 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.170
 we will tight the pocket in the between 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.710
 thumb and forefinger 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:40.030
 So here we go in the direction we 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.520
 can possibly use a small 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.850
 few devices 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.470
 Here you'll be like that bother you in 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.450
 the purpose of announcing the leaf in our footsteps 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.710
 it's time for Easter it flies away 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.780
 during cooking on uses a 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.390
 tote exactly we put ourselves 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.610
 always in the direction of work 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.130
 hold with your left hand the pocket 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.600
 press lightly with your right hand 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.310
 but it's not the fingers that support 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.960
 see it's the palm of your hand 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.510
 and here we go we go while pulling in 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.930
 couple and what will allow us a 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:18.100
 little focus to have something of 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.440
 well regular then we go live and 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.480
 slightly the pocket always maintained 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.950
 between the thumb and index a soul whew 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.140
 and we support what allows us to have 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.140
 something well pointed
