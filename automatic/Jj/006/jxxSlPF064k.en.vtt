00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:14.100
 hello to all so today I have 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:15.990
 tested for you father the role tyler 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.460
 so what's the use of pearl crauste iders 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.630
 to a device milk milk hair 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.210
 I showed immediately what he 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.820
 looks so that's the beast then you 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.050
 can see that unlike doing a 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.590
 curly hair there are two parts 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.940
 heating 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.320
 you will see, moreover, that 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.850
 use is completely different 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.160
 of a curling iron the results too 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.840
 is completely different so that's 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.500
 heating party are of course in 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.140
 ceramic 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.819
 so there we have more or less buttons 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.649
 the button to start there is also 

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:42.960
 a part so numerically so power 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.699
 the temperature also see when the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.899
 temperature is reached but about 30 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.149
 seconds to reach the temperature 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.909
 we have asked for it also 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.370
 a cord so rotating of 3 m then 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.659
 frankly if all devices 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.769
 could be equipped with a cord of 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.299
 three meters it would really be 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.859
 formidable also add some 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:01.469
 super useful thing yielded 1 go in 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.729
 plastic they replaced here is 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.470
 just here that's what will allow us 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.390
 in fact calais the device on a 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.470
 step without necessarily shelter provide 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.149
 also a cover so much 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.189
 resistant and a camp that is going to be 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.509
 essential to use the skin 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.070
 here we have seen everything that is technical 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.600
 now to be able to pass the tests 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.210
 so we will come to press the button 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.450
 all the way down about 3.4 seconds up 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.530
 what the digital screen is showing so 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.600
 here is left on 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.570
 so I 've already positioned them on 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.310
 200 degrees we taste just below 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.450
 which flashes once it is 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.009
 stopped flashing we'll be able to 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.140
 start no to the ripples 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.969
 so here is the logo all the way down from 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.500
 blinking we will be able to start 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:39.479
 our waves he was also part have 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.310
 started in duration so I of course 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.140
 put my glove to protect and avoid 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.399
 burn me then what we come to do 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.429
 it's taking a lock then 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.630
 it's really how you prefer 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.670
 can take lessons from matches 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.890
 more or less drug yeah I'm going in 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.200
 take an average so I 'm coming 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.439
 position the device like these and 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.439
 we will do a year 8 so hop 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:17.480
 here and we wait here and send loose 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.580
 so that's the result so what that 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.860
 give on a wick the gesture can you 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.360
 may seem complicated on camera 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.250
 but I assure you it's really great 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.780
 easy just just wrap the 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.780
 really eight- shaped wick around 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.800
 of the device is just then wait 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.060
 to have this result 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.620
 so there I now I will continue 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.080
 all the head and I find you a 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.850
 so guy ends up so here's the 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.470
 final result me ​​personally it's 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.060
 a real blow to this device 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.000
 it really makes beautiful waves 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.290
 natural that remains flexible 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.970
 it's really the device that I keep 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.680
 in my bathroom to use it 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.989
 really easily in the week 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.670
 it's not the device consorts one to two 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.230
 times a year for a few years 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.770
 about twenty minutes to do any 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.690
 the head 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.489
 for sure it takes a little while 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.320
 but then the standards I want to say 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.270
 really the norms over this device 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.130
 is it going to be ripples that 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.720
 hard I assure you that the next day 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.700
 you will always have to play let's say a 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.800
 nation they may be slightly 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.390
 looser but your ripples will be 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.010
 always ready here is me it will be 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.290
 really a huge favorite for the 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.730
 park crous tyler I hope the test 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.959
 you will be pleased and I tell you see you soon 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.959
 in a future video
