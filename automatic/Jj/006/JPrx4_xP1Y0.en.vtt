00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.800
 My photography skills are done by washing photos in the darkroom. 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.800
 I’m facing a 4x6 photo from an early age 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.480
 Parents used to buy 20 volumes in the Cosco supermarket. 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.120
 The family is full of rewards 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.280
 Both parents are photographers 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.800
 Grandma will take pictures every birthday 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.280
 Do you understand what I mean? 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.440
 Everyone has 4x6 photos that can be exchanged 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.440
 I will also send the photos out. 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.240
 For pen pals, do you know? 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.640
 Send photos 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.520
 Later I realized that I could photocopy all the photos. 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.000
 Then you can send it to everyone. 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.560
 Then I started sending magazines to everyone. 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.240
 I have been working as a magazine since then. 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.040
 (HAMBURGER EYES Photography Gallery) 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.040
 I remember the first time I saw the Hamburger Eyes photography gallery. 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.040
 A copy of a friend’s family at home 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.880
 I felt great after reading it. 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.440
 It’s really hard to describe 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.880
 Only a few friends at the time had 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.040
 We are deeply addicted to it. 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.200
 We copied many copies 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.280
 Send around, send it again immediately after sending it out 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.440
 Later, more photographers joined us. 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.400
 The things in our hands are getting better and better. 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.000
 Like a snowball effect 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.200
 A few years later, probably in 2007 or 2008 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.840
 We set up this studio 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.240
 (HAMBURGER EYES Photography Center) 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.160
 (Contact the proofer) 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.400
 Here we receive all the photos 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.720
 Edit it and show it 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.080
 Printing, cutting, pasting, mounting 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.120
 Most of the time I find it very interesting. 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.840
 Yes, it will be very busy, sometimes 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.360
 I will be too busy to go to photography. 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.440
 Or can't enter the darkroom 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.760
 This makes me very depressed 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.360
 But most of the time it is still very interesting. 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.480
 It’s fun to watch him work. 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.280
 He usually publishes a lot of works 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.080
 Considering that he is doing it himself from start to finish, this is an amazing achievement. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.480
 We have been operating the Hamburger Eyes photography gallery for more than ten years. 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.200
 See a lot 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.480
 Different styles of photographers from all over the world 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.920
 People all over the world 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.440
 Are deeply fascinated by our work 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.800
 Want to join us 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.760
 For me, this is great, I am proud of it. 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.520
 What is special about the Hamburger Eyes photography gallery is that 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.680
 (Senior Councillor of the Oakland Museum, California) 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.760
 On the one hand, it is completely rooted in 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.920
 Some special things 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.320
 Like a dirty corner somewhere outside your house. 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.600
 But at the same time it is also full of metropolitan atmosphere 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.800
 The world it shows seems to 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.400
 Only 2 inches away from you 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.280
 This is where the Hamburger Eyes photography gallery is. 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.560
 My photography style is 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.640
 Where did you go? 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.560
 I always carry the camera with me. 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.000
 Sometimes I will set a task for myself. 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.160
 For example, if the Giants won the World Professional Baseball Competition 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.440
 I will know right away that the street will definitely start a crazy party. 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.760
 After you know this, 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.880
 This becomes a task in some sense 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.400
 It can be said that the more you shoot, the better. 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.880
 These works will be combined into a magazine, do you know? 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.760
 (World Professional Baseball Championship) 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.720
 I think people need to know 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.920
 Which aspect of photography do you like best? 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.480
 And how to use these aspects to make money 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.080
 I don't necessarily like a dead task or a customer based job. 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.560
 I just did it and some works are very good. 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.320
 But I still prefer to shoot what I want to shoot. 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.000
 Then by selling these works for a living 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.000
 Whether in the form of prints, magazines or books 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.680
 If you see my bank statement 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.120
 You will think: 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.080
 "You really can afford the money." 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.840
 However, most of the time I live the life I have thought of. 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.400
 I can take photos and make books and magazines. 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.240
 And enjoy it 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.640
 - It feels great, understand? - Either you can, or you can't. 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.200
 Maybe you have already taken the photo you want, Matt 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.240
 Improvisation and live 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.480
 May be completely waste
