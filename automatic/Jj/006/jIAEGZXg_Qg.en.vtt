00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.440
 Eight of the world today I came here to bring 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.050
 A trip to the tutorial night is remarkable. 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.210
 more dramatic than itself I do 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.740
 how do you record the video? 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.220
 they are asking for a tutorial 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.740
 but I'm not ashamed or even guess 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.590
 inferior by my thousand admits 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.390
 difficulties and so I was going to 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.650
 tell you that it is not exactly a 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.019
 strong point 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.550
 I do not feel Mexico would return to do the 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.140
 history of itself because it is one thing 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.660
 that I have facility there is nothing that 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.480
 the dhomini and that I know I do not 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.489
 flawless is not perfect but I think 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.129
 I'm at a point that already gives a signal 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.360
 good for you, how do I do it? 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.280
 Trying hard to improve. 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.020
 I took too long to make this trip. 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.030
 I stayed in the hour and a half in front of 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.760
 Mirror to do something beautiful to 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.559
 You're still difficult for me, but I 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.899
 I think if I can you can 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.120
 also that in a patient we will 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.590
 I do not think youtube is 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.899
 Only you can do something for yourself. 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.489
 come here and say so I can 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.350
 do it in 10 minutes 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.700
 I would also have trouble not because 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.860
 I have a youtube channel that I know 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.840
 everything very unlike here for 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.790
 to learn I learn a lot every 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.710
 days with you with me with my 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.689
 attempts and recipes 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.580
 so I think that at this point I wanted 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.860
 talk to you a little about this 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.200
 speak here in the middle also my point 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.939
 strong but I'm struggling because 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.030
 I know you expect that you 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.060
 They like it and something harder than you 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.400
 Do you want to see how you can do it then? 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.049
 I think it's cool too because maybe 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.700
 difficulties you have are the 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.259
 The same ones I have 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.150
 sometimes when a person who knows 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.070
 Too much is going to make it seem like it's too much. 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.680
 I hope so very well that you 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.090
 like of you and sorry to learn 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.250
 It was not perfect, but I'm 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.250
 everything is then tutorial 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.020
 I'll start by putting a tape, I'll go. 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.780
 to nail it diagonally because the 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.310
 finish looks much more beautiful and I 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.990
 I'm going to pass a concealer all over my 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.119
 eyelid because I'm going to make the skin 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.929
 after the other then to standardize the 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.580
 eyelid 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.580
 I spend the corrective spread well 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.260
 after that I'll pass my brush 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.660
 a lot of this can show up 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.280
 and I'm going to follow up with my first 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.110
 oil that will make the makeup 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.260
 lasts much longer than the body is 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.940
 more intense with a little brown shadow 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.739
 darker than the skin tone 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.230
 I'll start by drawing a picture of my 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.209
 I'll mark my coconut and vanish. 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.549
 well with a cute brush 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.500
 The more you smoke the prettier you go. 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.500
 Get the result then foam sauce 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.260
 I'll use an opaque beige shadow below. 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.150
 eyebrows and I'm applying 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.640
 and mixing super good with this brown 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.360
 I was once again is very 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.480
 important this ill with the brown shadow 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.490
 darker I'll go again in the 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.440
 my body this time with the brush 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.570
 I just need to think a little more 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.650
 firm and then I'll really giving 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.650
 shape of my eye 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.480
 now finally like the black shadow and 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.340
 a firmer smoking brush I also 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.260
 I'll go over that brown 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.180
 it seems a lot but these three 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.220
 shadows leaves the final result very 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.220
 most beautiful and then I smoke tube 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.690
 now silver shadow that is the highlight 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.880
 this makeup I apply it with a 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.500
 Brush to apply the shade so I go 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.370
 tapping and spreading with 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.370
 very careful 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.960
 after applied I come with a sky 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.370
 clean and I'm foaming all this can 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.370
 smoke a lot of time 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.480
 now just to finish and come back 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.090
 with that brush it comes out brown and I'm going 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.220
 exposing a little 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.830
 I'll wear a black eyeliner. 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.950
 I follow a line from my eye 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.450
 even has no secret it as the 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.700
 people are wearing ribbon will stay 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.889
 then you just stand tight on the ribbon 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.000
 not to go and do the work he 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:28.540
 prim will be outlined finished 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:32.020
 you can take the tape to put the children 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:35.340
 I'll wear an eyelash and I'll get it too. 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.340
 my silas mask 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.340
 I apply a black pencil on my line 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.680
 the water above and below gives a bit of 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.570
 anguish but it makes a lot of difference and 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.830
 then with a precision brush and 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.830
 has been forming this lapse 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.590
 to seal this lapse I came with a 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.610
 black opaque shade and I'm applying for 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.650
 over him 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.720
 the result is much more beautiful and 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.880
 It lasts also for much longer 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.950
 then I came with a brown shadow 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.950
 and I'll fade that black shadow 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.870
 now coming back again with the shadow 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.640
 Silver I will pass in the inner corner of 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.640
 eyes to end the shadow part 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.100
 Just end with the eyelash mask 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.600
 I know it seems like many more steps. 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.700
 they are important to let the 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.530
 makeup with much more finish 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.570
 beautiful with more makeup face 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.980
 Even Professional Makeup Even 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.980
 the final result was thus 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.650
 I really hope you liked it. 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.900
 please leave her son of yours 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.270

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.520
 that I can improve what's good 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.129

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.310

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:24.949

 now come here but it was ready and 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:29.060
 did not like the idea and not chemistry here 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.500
