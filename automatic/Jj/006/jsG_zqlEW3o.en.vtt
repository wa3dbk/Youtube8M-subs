00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
have you could have heart rate as well

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.520 
have you could have heart rate as well
as<00:01:58.290> your<00:01:59.220> pace<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.300> can<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.600> your<00:02:00.810> time<00:02:01.260> that

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
as your pace you can have your time that

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.490 
as your pace you can have your time that
you've<00:02:01.680> been<00:02:01.890> exercising<00:02:02.190> as<00:02:02.940> well<00:02:03.150> as

the<00:03:03.510> battery<00:03:03.810> life<00:03:04.020> yep<00:03:04.260> but<00:03:04.410> they've<00:03:04.530> said

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
the battery life yep but they've said

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.860 
the battery life yep but they've said
that<00:03:04.890> it's<00:03:05.040> double<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:06.239> four<00:03:06.450> out<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.570> ten
