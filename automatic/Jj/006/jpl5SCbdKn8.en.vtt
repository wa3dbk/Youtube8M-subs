00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
strip the flowers off the stems if you

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:22.510 
strip the flowers off the stems if you
don't<00:04:14.959> want<00:04:15.140> it<00:04:15.290> to<00:04:15.380> taste<00:04:15.590> too<00:04:15.830> medicinal

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.950 

when<00:04:23.520> you're<00:04:23.669> picking<00:04:23.909> meadow<00:04:24.270> sweets<00:04:24.720> you

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
when you're picking meadow sweets you

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.950 
when you're picking meadow sweets you
want<00:04:25.169> to<00:04:25.319> remember<00:04:25.620> that<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:27.419> flowers<00:04:27.810> that

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
want to remember that the flowers that

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.510 
want to remember that the flowers that
are<00:04:28.080> open<00:04:28.409> and<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.620> ones<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:29.039> have<00:04:29.219> the<00:04:29.370> most

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
are open and the ones that have the most

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.879 
are open and the ones that have the most
smell<00:04:29.879> so<00:04:30.449> avoid<00:04:30.719> picking<00:04:31.050> ones<00:04:31.469> that<00:04:31.740> have

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
smell so avoid picking ones that have

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.339 
smell so avoid picking ones that have
got<00:04:32.069> the<00:04:32.759> bud<00:04:32.969> still<00:04:33.300> closed<00:04:33.569> up<00:04:33.810> like<00:04:34.050> this

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
got the bud still closed up like this

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.830 
got the bud still closed up like this
the<00:04:35.310> other<00:04:35.340> important<00:04:35.969> reason<00:04:36.150> for<00:04:36.389> that<00:04:36.629> is

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
the other important reason for that is

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.649 
the other important reason for that is
not<00:04:36.990> just<00:04:37.050> flavor<00:04:37.530> but<00:04:38.189> also<00:04:38.400> because<00:04:39.090> these

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:39.659 
not just flavor but also because these

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:42.020 
not just flavor but also because these
flowers<00:04:40.229> are<00:04:40.469> a<00:04:40.500> great<00:04:40.919> source<00:04:41.250> of<00:04:41.430> nectar<00:04:41.879> for

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
you need that's probably about 30 to 40

you need that's probably about 30 to 40
blossoms<00:05:09.780> and<00:05:10.020> there<00:05:10.199> you<00:05:10.949> really<00:05:11.250> want<00:05:11.430> to

strip the flowers off the stems just
like<00:05:15.150> this<00:05:15.330> some<00:05:15.629> people<00:05:15.930> use<00:05:16.080> a<00:05:16.110> fork<00:05:16.560> to<00:05:16.919> help

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
like this some people use a fork to help

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.279 
like this some people use a fork to help
to<00:05:17.250> separate<00:05:17.669> them<00:05:17.879> so<00:05:18.060> that<00:05:18.689> you've<00:05:18.810> just<00:05:19.080> got

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
to separate them so that you've just got

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.309 
to separate them so that you've just got
the<00:05:19.409> flowers<00:05:20.479> this<00:05:21.479> is<00:05:21.539> because<00:05:22.080> the

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
the flowers this is because the

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.019 
the flowers this is because the
salicylic<00:05:22.710> acid<00:05:23.340> is<00:05:23.460> particularly

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:24.029 
salicylic acid is particularly

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:26.209 
salicylic acid is particularly
concentrated<00:05:24.300> in<00:05:25.110> the<00:05:25.229> leaves<00:05:25.469> and<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:25.889> stems

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:26.219 
concentrated in the leaves and the stems

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:28.519 
concentrated in the leaves and the stems
and<00:05:26.639> it<00:05:27.300> can<00:05:27.479> make<00:05:27.629> the<00:05:27.779> drink<00:05:28.050> a<00:05:28.169> little<00:05:28.259> bit

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:28.529 
and it can make the drink a little bit

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:30.830 
and it can make the drink a little bit
bitter<00:05:28.770> if<00:05:28.979> you<00:05:29.129> do<00:05:29.310> that<00:05:29.539> whereas<00:05:30.539> in<00:05:30.719> the

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
bitter if you do that whereas in the

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.899 
bitter if you do that whereas in the
flowers<00:05:31.289> not<00:05:31.919> only<00:05:32.250> do<00:05:32.370> you<00:05:32.490> have<00:05:32.729> the

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:32.909 
flowers not only do you have the

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
salicylic acid but you have this lovely

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.459 
salicylic acid but you have this lovely
honey<00:05:35.190> taste<00:05:35.729> which<00:05:36.479> makes<00:05:36.750> it<00:05:36.930> a<00:05:37.050> really

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469 
honey taste which makes it a really

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:40.610 
honey taste which makes it a really
palatable<00:05:38.069> really<00:05:38.339> delicious<00:05:38.729> drink<00:05:39.500> to<00:05:40.500> make

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
palatable really delicious drink to make

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.350 
palatable really delicious drink to make
meadowsweet<00:05:41.009> cordial<00:05:41.789> you<00:05:41.849> bring<00:05:42.120> about<00:05:42.210> a

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
meadowsweet cordial you bring about a

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.019 
meadowsweet cordial you bring about a
liter<00:05:42.690> of<00:05:42.810> water<00:05:43.110> to<00:05:43.409> the<00:05:43.500> boil<00:05:43.740> and<00:05:44.069> then<00:05:44.879> add

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:45.029 
liter of water to the boil and then add

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:49.430 
liter of water to the boil and then add
about<00:05:45.800> 250<00:05:46.800> grams<00:05:47.099> of<00:05:47.460> sugar<00:05:47.849> and<00:05:48.199> then<00:05:49.199> take

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
about 250 grams of sugar and then take

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.990 
about 250 grams of sugar and then take
it<00:05:49.589> off<00:05:49.800> the<00:05:50.009> boil<00:05:50.219> while<00:05:50.490> you<00:05:50.669> add<00:05:50.789> your

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
it off the boil while you add your

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.360 
it off the boil while you add your
flowers<00:05:51.479> and<00:05:51.690> the<00:05:52.080> reason<00:05:52.440> for<00:05:52.620> doing<00:05:52.770> this<00:05:52.949> is

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
flowers and the reason for doing this is

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.570 
flowers and the reason for doing this is
because<00:05:54.360> when<00:05:54.569> the<00:05:54.690> flowers<00:05:55.080> infuse<00:05:55.680> you<00:05:56.400> get

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
because when the flowers infuse you get

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.519 
because when the flowers infuse you get
a<00:05:56.610> much<00:05:56.909> better<00:05:57.120> flavor<00:05:57.479> if<00:05:57.750> you<00:05:57.779> boil<00:05:58.139> it<00:05:58.289> up

00:05:58.519 --> 00:05:58.529 
a much better flavor if you boil it up

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:00.170 
a much better flavor if you boil it up
particularly<00:05:59.190> when<00:05:59.460> you've<00:05:59.580> got<00:05:59.759> some<00:06:00.000> of<00:06:00.089> the

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
particularly when you've got some of the

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.480 
particularly when you've got some of the
stem<00:06:00.449> left<00:06:00.719> in<00:06:00.900> it<00:06:01.080> it<00:06:01.620> can<00:06:01.800> actually<00:06:02.099> start<00:06:02.370> to

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
stem left in it it can actually start to

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.959 
stem left in it it can actually start to
taste<00:06:02.789> a<00:06:03.029> little<00:06:03.300> bit<00:06:03.419> medicinal<00:06:04.520> so<00:06:05.520> all<00:06:05.819> the

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:05.969 
taste a little bit medicinal so all the

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:08.540 
taste a little bit medicinal so all the
flowers<00:06:06.389> go<00:06:07.080> in<00:06:07.289> and<00:06:07.560> you're<00:06:08.039> putting<00:06:08.279> in

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
flowers go in and you're putting in

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.059 
flowers go in and you're putting in

of course if you're diabetic you

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.170 
of course if you're diabetic you
probably<00:06:19.530> won't<00:06:19.770> want<00:06:19.920> to<00:06:20.160> use<00:06:20.340> any<00:06:20.550> sugar<00:06:20.850> and

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
probably won't want to use any sugar and

probably won't want to use any sugar and
in<00:06:21.840> that<00:06:21.990> case<00:06:22.170> you<00:06:22.380> could<00:06:22.500> either<00:06:22.650> use

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
in that case you could either use

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.220 
in that case you could either use
another<00:06:23.220> herb<00:06:23.490> like<00:06:23.790> stevia<00:06:24.360> or<00:06:24.510> sweet<00:06:24.780> Sicily

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.230 
another herb like stevia or sweet Sicily

another herb like stevia or sweet Sicily
if<00:06:25.470> you<00:06:25.680> also<00:06:25.830> like<00:06:26.100> that<00:06:26.340> Arnie's<00:06:26.700> taste

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
if you also like that Arnie's taste

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.990 
if you also like that Arnie's taste
they're<00:06:27.240> both<00:06:27.390> naturally<00:06:27.900> sweet<00:06:28.760> or<00:06:29.760> you

they're both naturally sweet or you

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.640 
they're both naturally sweet or you
could<00:06:30.180> just<00:06:30.210> make<00:06:30.510> a<00:06:30.540> tea<00:06:30.870> as<00:06:31.050> well<00:06:31.290> and<00:06:31.500> not

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
could just make a tea as well and not

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.320 
could just make a tea as well and not
have<00:06:31.920> a<00:06:31.950> cordial<00:06:34.520> once<00:06:35.520> they're<00:06:35.730> all<00:06:35.880> in<00:06:36.060> what

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330

I<00:06:36.360> just<00:06:36.720> do<00:06:36.840> is<00:06:36.960> make<00:06:37.140> sure<00:06:37.170> that<00:06:37.380> they're<00:06:37.680> very

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
I just do is make sure that they're very

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.430 
I just do is make sure that they're very
very<00:06:38.490> firmly<00:06:38.790> wetted<00:06:39.240> down<00:06:39.450> the<00:06:40.080> water<00:06:40.260> is

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
very firmly wetted down the water is

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.400 
very firmly wetted down the water is
still<00:06:40.680> very<00:06:40.980> hot<00:06:41.310> and<00:06:41.750> then<00:06:42.750> put<00:06:42.990> a<00:06:43.020> lid<00:06:43.260> on

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410 
still very hot and then put a lid on

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.500 
still very hot and then put a lid on
them<00:06:43.620> and<00:06:43.800> let<00:06:44.310> them<00:06:44.490> infuse<00:06:44.940> for<00:06:45.150> several

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.510 
them and let them infuse for several

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.050 
them and let them infuse for several
hours<00:06:45.810> or<00:06:46.190> if<00:06:47.190> it's<00:06:47.340> in<00:06:47.460> the<00:06:47.580> evening<00:06:47.700> you

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
hours or if it's in the evening you

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.540 
hours or if it's in the evening you
could<00:06:48.180> let<00:06:48.360> them<00:06:48.450> infuse<00:06:48.870> overnight<00:06:49.350> and<00:06:49.800> that

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
could let them infuse overnight and that

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.550 
could let them infuse overnight and that
way<00:06:50.730> all<00:06:50.760> the<00:06:51.150> flavor<00:06:51.420> will<00:06:51.750> pass<00:06:51.960> from<00:06:52.350> the

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
way all the flavor will pass from the

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.870 
way all the flavor will pass from the
flowers<00:06:52.980> into<00:06:53.760> the<00:06:54.060> liquid

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:55.880 
flowers into the liquid

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.700 
flowers into the liquid
now<00:06:56.880> it's<00:06:57.060> infused<00:06:57.480> we're<00:06:58.110> just<00:06:58.320> going<00:06:58.560> to

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
now it's infused we're just going to

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.140 
now it's infused we're just going to
strain<00:06:59.040> it<00:06:59.070> off<00:06:59.400> and<00:07:01.460> you<00:07:02.460> can<00:07:02.610> see<00:07:02.640> that<00:07:03.060> the

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150 
strain it off and you can see that the

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.210 
strain it off and you can see that the
liquids<00:07:03.540> change<00:07:03.900> color<00:07:04.320> from<00:07:04.650> being<00:07:04.920> clear

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 
liquids change color from being clear

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.090 
liquids change color from being clear
water<00:07:05.490> to<00:07:05.970> quite<00:07:06.960> a<00:07:06.990> yellow<00:07:07.380> color<00:07:07.650> there<00:07:07.950> so

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.100 
water to quite a yellow color there so

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.170 
water to quite a yellow color there so
we're<00:07:11.100> going<00:07:11.280> to<00:07:12.230> pour<00:07:13.230> some<00:07:13.260> out<00:07:13.650> and<00:07:14.180> dilute

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180 
we're going to pour some out and dilute

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:34.930 
we're going to pour some out and dilute
it<00:07:15.420> with<00:07:15.450> some<00:07:15.840> water

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:34.940 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.050 

as<00:07:35.510> good<00:07:35.750> as<00:07:35.870> now
