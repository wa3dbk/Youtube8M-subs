and<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.900> play<00:02:22.290> candy<00:02:22.710> crush<00:02:22.740> so<00:02:25.220> definitely

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
and I play candy crush so definitely

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.840 
and I play candy crush so definitely
kind<00:02:27.240> of<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.390> big<00:02:27.570> snag<00:02:27.960> as<00:02:28.230> far<00:02:28.860> as<00:02:28.890> drop<00:02:29.310> X<00:02:29.580> is

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
kind of a big snag as far as drop X is

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.350 
kind of a big snag as far as drop X is
that<00:02:30.510> it's<00:02:30.840> very<00:02:31.400> very<00:02:32.400> difficult<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:33.120> just

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
that it's very very difficult to just

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.840 
that it's very very difficult to just
seems<00:02:33.540> like<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:34.020> have<00:02:34.230> too<00:02:35.100> many<00:02:35.220> factors

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
seems like you have too many factors

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.070 
seems like you have too many factors
working<00:02:36.210> against<00:02:36.990> you<00:02:38.660> one<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.870> things

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
working against you one of the things

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.330 
working against you one of the things
that<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.320> actually<00:02:40.820> recommend<00:02:41.820> as<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:43.280> kind<00:02:44.280> of

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
that I actually recommend as a kind of

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.500 
that I actually recommend as a kind of
like<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.460> feature<00:02:44.840> sort<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.930> tweak<00:02:46.230> is<00:02:47.510> more

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
like a feature sort of tweak is more

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.300 
like a feature sort of tweak is more
bouncing<00:02:50.270> instead<00:02:51.270> of<00:02:51.300> just<00:02:52.050> when<00:02:52.709> he<00:02:52.800> hits<00:02:53.070> a

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
bouncing instead of just when he hits a

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.640 
bouncing instead of just when he hits a
cloud<00:02:53.730> platform<00:02:54.360> just<00:02:54.900> kind<00:02:55.080> of<00:02:55.170> sits<00:02:55.410> there

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
cloud platform just kind of sits there

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.240 
cloud platform just kind of sits there
if<00:02:55.830> he<00:02:56.790> actually<00:02:57.740> bounced<00:02:58.740> off<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.890> cloud

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
if he actually bounced off the cloud

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.160 
if he actually bounced off the cloud
platform<00:02:59.850> it<00:03:00.060> would<00:03:00.240> help<00:03:00.450> progress<00:03:00.780> him

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
platform it would help progress him

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.710 
platform it would help progress him
through<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.590> level<00:03:01.950> faster<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.670> you'd<00:03:03.570> have

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
through the level faster and you'd have

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.699 
through the level faster and you'd have
to<00:03:03.840> use<00:03:03.990> less<00:03:04.770> of<00:03:05.070> your<00:03:05.910> cloud<00:03:06.600> amount<00:03:07.020> to

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
to use less of your cloud amount to

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.480 
to use less of your cloud amount to
guide<00:03:08.010> him<00:03:08.280> through<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:09.290> also<00:03:10.290> he<00:03:11.100> does<00:03:11.310> get

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
guide him through and also he does get

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.150 
guide him through and also he does get
stuck<00:03:11.820> on<00:03:11.970> obstacles<00:03:12.360> fairly<00:03:12.959> easily<00:03:13.200> so

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
stuck on obstacles fairly easily so

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.650 
stuck on obstacles fairly easily so
that's<00:03:14.400> something<00:03:14.670> that's<00:03:14.940> definitely<00:03:15.450> going

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
that's something that's definitely going

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.590 
that's something that's definitely going
to<00:03:15.720> be<00:03:15.780> adjusted<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:17.000> another<00:03:18.000> feature<00:03:18.300> i'd

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
to be adjusted and another feature i'd

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.910 
to be adjusted and another feature i'd
love<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.260> see<00:03:19.440> included<00:03:19.980> in<00:03:20.070> drop<00:03:20.310> x<00:03:20.630> our<00:03:21.920> hash

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
love to see included in drop x our hash

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.130 
love to see included in drop x our hash
lines<00:03:23.250> little<00:03:23.910> hash<00:03:24.150> marks<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.690> would<00:03:24.840> show

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
lines little hash marks that would show

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.500 
lines little hash marks that would show
his<00:03:25.410> path<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:26.090> essentially<00:03:27.090> this<00:03:27.209> would<00:03:27.420> mean

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
his path and essentially this would mean

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.150 
his path and essentially this would mean
you'd<00:03:27.690> have<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.989> get<00:03:28.200> rid<00:03:28.410> of<00:03:29.300> the<00:03:31.160> kicking

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
you'd have to get rid of the kicking

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.370 
you'd have to get rid of the kicking
back<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.910> level<00:03:33.060> select<00:03:33.540> screen<00:03:33.750> after

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
each try on the level but this would

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.710 
each try on the level but this would
help<00:03:40.590> people<00:03:41.010> kind<00:03:41.760> of<00:03:41.790> get<00:03:41.910> a<00:03:41.970> feel<00:03:42.300> for<00:03:42.600> where

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
help people kind of get a feel for where

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.900 
help people kind of get a feel for where
he<00:03:42.930> bounces<00:03:43.440> where<00:03:43.709> he's<00:03:43.890> going<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.430> how<00:03:44.670> they

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
he bounces where he's going and how they

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.840 
he bounces where he's going and how they
can<00:03:44.940> strategically<00:03:45.570> guide<00:03:46.350> him<00:03:46.650> all<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.760> way

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
can strategically guide him all the way

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.320 
can strategically guide him all the way
through<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.180> level<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:49.410> portal<00:03:50.330> another

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
through the level to the portal another

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.050 
through the level to the portal another
thing<00:03:51.570> I<00:03:51.690> want<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:51.900> mention<00:03:51.959> is<00:03:52.790> like<00:03:53.790> i<00:03:53.880> said

thing I want to mention is like i said

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.199 
thing I want to mention is like i said
before<00:03:54.150> drop<00:03:54.720> x<00:03:54.989> is<00:03:55.489> available<00:03:56.489> to<00:03:57.090> download

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
before drop x is available to download

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.650 
before drop x is available to download
for<00:03:57.660> 99<00:03:58.050> cents<00:03:58.410> but<00:03:59.220> there's<00:03:59.640> one<00:04:00.060> thing<00:04:00.120> i<00:04:00.600> do

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
for 99 cents but there's one thing i do

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.620 
for 99 cents but there's one thing i do
want<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:01.200> show<00:04:01.380> you<00:04:01.440> real<00:04:01.739> quick<00:04:01.769> and<00:04:02.630> every

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
want to show you real quick and every

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.890 
want to show you real quick and every
time<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.840> go<00:04:04.080> back<00:04:04.650> into<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.610> game<00:04:05.850> you<00:04:06.810> know

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
time you go back into the game you know

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.620 
time you go back into the game you know
like<00:04:07.050> if<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.290> multitask<00:04:07.830> or<00:04:08.040> something<00:04:08.400> ads

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
like if you multitask or something ads

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.470 
like if you multitask or something ads
show<00:04:09.630> up<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:10.549> there's<00:04:11.549> no<00:04:11.910> way<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.090> get<00:04:12.299> rid<00:04:12.450> of

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
show up and there's no way to get rid of

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.720 
show up and there's no way to get rid of
them<00:04:12.660> there's<00:04:13.380> no<00:04:13.560> in-app<00:04:13.860> purchase<00:04:14.400> to

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
them there's no in-app purchase to

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.300 
them there's no in-app purchase to
delete<00:04:15.330> them<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.830> frankly<00:04:16.830> there<00:04:17.010> shouldn't

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
delete them and frankly there shouldn't

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.000 
delete them and frankly there shouldn't
be<00:04:17.340> because<00:04:18.979> they<00:04:20.000> it's<00:04:21.000> a<00:04:21.180> paid<00:04:21.419> game<00:04:21.720> ads<00:04:22.049> are

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
be because they it's a paid game ads are

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.210 
be because they it's a paid game ads are
usually<00:04:23.340> something<00:04:23.580> you<00:04:23.789> see<00:04:23.940> on<00:04:23.970> a<00:04:24.090> free<00:04:24.330> game

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
usually something you see on a free game

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.140 
usually something you see on a free game
so<00:04:26.220> it's

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
so it's

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.260 
so it's
definitely<00:04:27.570> a<00:04:27.600> turn<00:04:27.870> off<00:04:28.020> for<00:04:28.050> me<00:04:28.410> is

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
definitely a turn off for me is

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.570 
definitely a turn off for me is
especially<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:30.300> new<00:04:30.570> game<00:04:30.780> like<00:04:30.990> drop<00:04:31.229> X<00:04:31.580> new

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
especially a new game like drop X new

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.600 
especially a new game like drop X new
game<00:04:32.759> that<00:04:32.810> needs<00:04:33.810> a<00:04:33.930> little<00:04:34.080> bit<00:04:34.259> of<00:04:34.290> work

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
game that needs a little bit of work

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.939 
game that needs a little bit of work
definitely<00:04:35.610> shouldn't<00:04:36.060> be<00:04:36.860> you<00:04:37.860> know

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
definitely shouldn't be you know

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.210 
definitely shouldn't be you know
including<00:04:38.639> ads<00:04:38.930> especially<00:04:39.930> when<00:04:40.190> users<00:04:41.190> are

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
including ads especially when users are

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180
