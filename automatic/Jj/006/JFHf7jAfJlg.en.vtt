did not look like this but luckily we

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.590 
did not look like this but luckily we
had<00:01:04.019> critique<00:01:04.379> protocols<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.210> sat<00:01:06.570> down

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
had critique protocols so I sat down

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.390

and<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.060> had<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.420> be<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.590> specific<00:01:10.590> advice<00:01:10.920> about

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
and it had to be a specific advice about

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.420 
and it had to be a specific advice about
how<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.549> change<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.270> shape<00:01:12.659> his<00:01:13.170> wings<00:01:13.740> to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
how to change the shape his wings to

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.520 
how to change the shape his wings to
look<00:01:14.640> more<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.540> shape<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.140> he<00:01:16.290> needed

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
look more like the shape that he needed

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.649 
look more like the shape that he needed
to<00:01:16.680> draw<00:01:17.009> once<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.970> got<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> shape<00:01:18.420> right

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
to draw once you got the shape right

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.090 
to draw once you got the shape right
then<00:01:19.290> they<00:01:19.470> were<00:01:19.560> going<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.740> look<00:01:19.860> at<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
then they were going to look at the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.340 
then they were going to look at the
pattern<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:21.330> if<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:21.990> give<00:01:22.140> Austin

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
pattern so if you can give Austin

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.760 
pattern so if you can give Austin
specific<00:01:23.130> ratite<00:01:23.460> what<00:01:23.670> would<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.909> say<00:01:24.119> about

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
specific ratite what would you say about

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.280 
specific ratite what would you say about
the<00:01:25.770> shape<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.460> wings<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.119> what<00:01:28.020> he

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
the shape of the wings and what he

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.670 
the shape of the wings and what he
should<00:01:28.350> change<00:01:30.079> more<00:01:31.079> like<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.320> triangle

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
should change more like a triangle

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.359 
should change more like a triangle
that's<00:01:32.579> exactly<00:01:33.540> what<00:01:33.689> they<00:01:33.869> told<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.470> he

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
that's exactly what they told and he

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.969 
that's exactly what they told and he
said<00:01:35.689> okay<00:01:36.689> because<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.500> was<00:01:37.619> kind<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.860> neat

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
said okay because it was kind of neat

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.200 
said okay because it was kind of neat
enough<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.250> he<00:01:38.310> knew<00:01:38.400> exactly<00:01:38.520> what<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.060> do

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
enough that he knew exactly what to do

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.100 
enough that he knew exactly what to do
so<00:01:40.340> Austin<00:01:41.340> ran<00:01:41.790> back<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.150> his<00:01:42.270> seat<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.750> did

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
so Austin ran back to his seat and did

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.060 
so Austin ran back to his seat and did
this<00:01:45.770> more<00:01:46.770> like<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.979> triangle<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:48.890> then<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
this more like a triangle and then the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.830 
this more like a triangle and then the
kids<00:01:50.280> said<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.759> him<00:01:50.939> Austin<00:01:51.540> do<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.659> remember

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
kids said to him Austin do you remember

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.600 
kids said to him Austin do you remember

and<00:01:53.940> a<00:01:54.000> lower<00:01:54.210> link<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.320> did<00:01:55.500> here<00:01:55.830> and

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
and a lower link like you did here and

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.250 
and a lower link like you did here and
this<00:01:56.760> one<00:01:56.970> you<00:01:57.090> forgot<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.570> do<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.840> upper<00:01:58.140> and

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
this one you forgot to do the upper and

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.920 
this one you forgot to do the upper and
lower<00:01:58.410> wing<00:01:58.790> so<00:01:59.790> he<00:01:59.910> ran<00:02:00.180> back<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.420> his<00:02:00.600> seat

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
lower wing so he ran back to his seat

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:10.520
