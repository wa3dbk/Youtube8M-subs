00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.349 
bands first I'll show you the proper
technique<00:01:00.079> zoom<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.199> privily<00:01:01.850> they're<00:01:02.850> shaped

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
technique zoom in privily they're shaped

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.250 
technique zoom in privily they're shaped
like<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.899> there's<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.159> little<00:01:05.460> group<00:01:05.729> going

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
like this there's a little group going

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.960 
like this there's a little group going
horizontally<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.470> vertically<00:01:08.130> there's<00:01:08.729> an

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
horizontally and vertically there's an

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.210 
horizontally and vertically there's an
even<00:01:09.510> larger<00:01:09.689> gonna<00:01:10.140> they're<00:01:10.860> gonna<00:01:10.950> actually

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
even larger gonna they're gonna actually

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.980 
even larger gonna they're gonna actually
want<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.670> grab<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.930> horizontally<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:14.990> so

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
want to grab it horizontally like so so

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.160 
want to grab it horizontally like so so
that<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.710> bridge<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.070> top<00:01:17.909> part<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.420> then

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
that you bridge the top part and then

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.310 
that you bridge the top part and then
squeeze<00:01:20.030> what<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.119> does<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.689> deforms<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
squeeze what it does is it deforms the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.990 
squeeze what it does is it deforms the
base<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.860> no<00:01:22.950> longer<00:01:22.979> fits<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.670> your<00:01:23.820> teeth

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
base so it no longer fits on your teeth

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.160 
base so it no longer fits on your teeth
and<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.299> just<00:01:24.479> pops<00:01:24.720> right<00:01:24.840> off

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and it just pops right off

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.719 
and it just pops right off
they<00:01:25.619> even<00:01:26.009> might<00:01:26.189> make<00:01:26.400> like<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> little

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
they even might make like a little

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.539 
they even might make like a little
popping<00:01:27.330> sound<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.810> you're<00:01:28.049> good<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.549> found

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
popping sound and you're good I found

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.100 
popping sound and you're good I found
that<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:30.090> may<00:01:30.270> need<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.509> squeeze<00:01:30.900> it

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
that you may need to squeeze it

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.319 
that you may need to squeeze it
vertically<00:01:31.470> or<00:01:32.040> horizontally<00:01:32.329> sometimes

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
vertically or horizontally sometimes

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.030 
vertically or horizontally sometimes
what<00:01:33.570> works<00:01:33.780> better<00:01:33.990> than<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.259> other<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.770> don't

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
what works better than the other I don't

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.289 
what works better than the other I don't
know<00:01:35.130> which<00:01:35.250> ones<00:01:35.460> are<00:01:35.549> properly<00:01:35.939> but<00:01:36.270> uh

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
know which ones are properly but uh

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:48.969 
know which ones are properly but uh
let's<00:01:37.290> try<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:37.799> out

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.830 

and<00:01:49.490> there<00:01:49.729> you<00:01:49.789> go

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.590 

popped<00:01:54.440> right<00:01:54.680> out<00:01:54.710> just<00:01:55.070> like<00:01:55.190> magic<00:01:55.600> and

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
popped right out just like magic and

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:21.910 
popped right out just like magic and
again
