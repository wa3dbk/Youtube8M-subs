00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello today we are doing a review on 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.470
 evening macadamia series acting 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.030
 only three products so today I wanted 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.000
 like to leave your review 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.940
 I like these products and in general 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.220
 empty buyers there is no first thing 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.020
 I liked crazy that is it 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.570
 such thing which for me is now the most 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.010
 of mask we years it has not ended 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.380
 for the first time a jar like a thick one 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.060
 I show everything because they are usually 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.070
 throws out and i left because i 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.620
 I will do it all sorts of masks there yet 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.969
 nails will be steaming not shorter than a jar 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.340
 I like it so for the needs 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.309
 I will need a mask crazy 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.129
 I liked her minimum consumption 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.850
 Generally you need quite a bit here. 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.160
 250 milliliters before I tell 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.989
 About this mask in principle very very 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.410
 good childhood that i series myself it 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.390
 very expensive but still if your 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.780
 hair is in very bad condition 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.229
 better not to cut them try to treat 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.880
 their this mask is one of those who 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.460
 Generally I will help you soonest 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.090
 she decided to buy does not wash with 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:21.150
 indelible such balsam here 60 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:23.299
 milliliters the smell is about the same 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.479
 if such cutting is not so deep 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:29.970
 fruit like masks themselves which 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.369
 washable itself such a little white you need 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.100
 quite a bit but I didn't like him 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.409
 because with a foreign eye on the other 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.680
 the parties are not very his impossible 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.079
 leave on the hair and 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.520
 go somewhere because very much 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.470
 makes hair heavier 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.040
 at all honestly feeling like that 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.829
 what is this mask what is this what is this one and 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.130
 the same just i don't know just in 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.840
 small format in no sense 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.520
 what is this some kind of lite version what 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.610
 it is specifically to keep 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.979
 on the hair and do not wash off no use 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.710
 exclusively just for the night I leave and 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.299
 in the morning when 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.560
 what will one hundred percent swim 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:13.060
 then I stand when I wash it off 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.400
 the decision that the discoteque is soft 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.850
 pretty but nonetheless it's not 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.120
 quite what I wanted from this balm 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.590
 it was not the last one to wash off 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.660
 product is a balm here in this form it 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.489
 is here written that color saif 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.069
 i.e. keeps hair color 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.989
 sulphate flip or lunch free ie no 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.260
 sulphate and paraben probably this 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.260
 OK 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.400
 Argan nourishing conditioner 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.060
 we for years in general the whole series there we 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.470
 over the years bodies of argan oil 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.230
 I must say that here a little more 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.019
 milliliters than a mask here 300 in 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.989
 Moscow 250 and balm no less 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.850
 liked then design agree 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.730
 very beautiful such a drawing 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.230
 cool than it helped me go 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.480
 get up that very very small hole 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.830
 very badly squeezed out with one 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.120
 hand it is not comfortable on the other hand 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.799
 certainly economical enough but if 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.299
 you got the idea to go 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.720
 buy something from this series i would 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.320
 still put the mask on 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.140
 I hope this review was not very long 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.540
 until today you planned to get around to take off 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.610
 outfit or something else and give it 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.920
 say that it seems to me no shadow at all 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.170
 don't go how many times i tried 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.450
 something to make up or something else 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.430
 there is no feathering arrows 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.720
 total then nothing goes lipstick this here 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:44.920
 maximum and bronze blush write in 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:48.310
 comments as it seems to you yes like this 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.370
 here was the video see you literally 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.519
 still very soon all a good day and all 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.519
 until
