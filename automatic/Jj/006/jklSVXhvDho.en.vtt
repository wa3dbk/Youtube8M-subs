00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
get older your skin gets drier so if you

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.150 
get older your skin gets drier so if you

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
all are the things so I have applied

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
everywhere and then starting at the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.929 
everywhere and then starting at the
throat<00:01:49.799> we're<00:01:50.070> going<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.250> go<00:01:50.399> up<00:01:50.610> because

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
throat we're going to go up because

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.679 
throat we're going to go up because
gravity<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.869> always<00:01:52.079> taking<00:01:53.040> your<00:01:53.790> whole

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
gravity is always taking your whole

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.289 
gravity is always taking your whole
body's<00:01:55.140> pulling<00:01:55.590> everything<00:01:55.920> down<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.640> we

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
body's pulling everything down so we

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.660 
body's pulling everything down so we
want<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.630> pull<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.020> back<00:01:58.320> up<00:01:58.619> whenever<00:01:59.280> we're

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
want to pull it back up whenever we're

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.959 
want to pull it back up whenever we're
washing<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.810> against<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.729> force

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
washing so going against the the force

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.649 
washing so going against the the force
of<00:02:03.149> gravity<00:02:03.180> everything<00:02:04.049> up<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:05.270> up<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.509> the

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
of gravity everything up so up on the

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.449 
of gravity everything up so up on the
throat<00:02:07.190> up<00:02:08.190> underneath<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.030> jaw<00:02:10.280> on<00:02:11.280> each

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
throat up underneath the jaw on each

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.330 
throat up underneath the jaw on each
side<00:02:12.140> okay<00:02:13.140> then<00:02:13.380> when<00:02:13.560> we<00:02:13.680> get<00:02:13.799> to<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.040> part

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
side okay then when we get to this part

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.920 
side okay then when we get to this part
of<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.489> face<00:02:14.670> we're<00:02:14.970> going<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.150> start<00:02:15.450> little

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
of the face we're going to start little

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.530 
of the face we're going to start little
circular<00:02:16.350> motions<00:02:17.160> along<00:02:17.579> the<00:02:17.730> jawline<00:02:17.970> and

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
circular motions along the jawline and

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:32.670 
circular motions along the jawline and
going<00:02:19.049> up<00:02:23.329> always<00:02:24.329> circle<00:02:24.870> always<00:02:25.440> up

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.330
