00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.460
Hey Cookaholics, Today we’re making Shrimp
with Scallions.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.260
Super easy to make and it’s delicious.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.470
So let’s do what we do, let’s head to
the kitchen and make it happen.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.570
OK, guys let’s grab our stuff.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.180
We’ve got some cleaned shrimp, we’re getting
our pasta into some boiling water and we are

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.749
cutting some green onions also known as scallions
into big pieces.

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:30.999
There’s not much to this dish so it’s
extra easy.

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.170
We’re going to get our butter into our pan
just like so.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.680
Our pan is over medium heat.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.580
Now we’re adding a little oil to our pan
to help prevent the butter from burning.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.340
We’re going to mix this around for a bit
and then we’ll add our scallions.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.680
You know we’re about to stir this around
likes a boss.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.370
Scallions have a milder flavor than regular
onions and sometimes that’s just what we’re

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.280
looking for, so keep that in mind guys.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.730
In next is some salt and pepper.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.920
What we want to do is stir this around some
and develop a little color on our scallions.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.400
Also we want to soften.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.430
Now we’re tossing in our wonderful shrimp,
we’re going to get all the shrimp in and

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.700
stir it up.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.880
Now we’re going to add the cream to our
pot.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.600
This is real cream, not half and half guys.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.060
You can use half and half.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.740
I mean it’s your kitchen do what you want.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.390

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.690
We added our frozen, thawed and squeezed spinach
to our pan and we’re going to stir that

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.690
around.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.960
Then we’re going to add it to our strained
pasta and give it a final mix, we’re also

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.220
going to taste for seasoning to see if it
needs a bit more salt and pepper.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.920
We might even gild the lily by adding a little
parmesan cheese on top.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:02:09.009
That’s all it is to it!
