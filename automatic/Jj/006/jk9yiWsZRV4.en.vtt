00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
actually in switching out the same time

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.670 
actually in switching out the same time
I<00:03:35.890> do<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:36.370> I<00:03:37.060> just<00:03:37.420> honestly<00:03:37.900> if<00:03:38.290> it's<00:03:38.410> fine

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
I do and I just honestly if it's fine

mom<00:03:39.010> I<00:03:39.370> guess<00:03:40.050> Rotom<00:03:41.050> is<00:03:41.140> going<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:41.350> do<00:03:41.770> better

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
mom I guess Rotom is going to do better

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.590 
mom I guess Rotom is going to do better
for<00:03:42.130> him<00:03:42.220> anyway<00:03:42.580> I<00:03:42.760> guess<00:03:43.060> I<00:03:43.270> should<00:03:43.540> have

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
for him anyway I guess I should have

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.690 
for him anyway I guess I should have
predicted<00:03:44.020> that<00:03:44.050> a<00:03:44.170> little<00:03:44.470> bit<00:03:44.590> um<00:03:44.770> but<00:03:45.640> I

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
predicted that a little bit um but I

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.270 
predicted that a little bit um but I
just<00:03:45.850> didn't<00:03:46.060> really<00:03:46.240> make<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.480> effort<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.810> so

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
just didn't really make the effort to so

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.710 
just didn't really make the effort to so
unfortunately<00:03:48.280> I<00:03:48.550> don't<00:03:49.330> know<00:03:49.420> where<00:03:49.600> you're

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
able to go for a volt switch you know do

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.600 
able to go for a volt switch you know do
a<00:03:53.320> decent<00:03:53.500> amount<00:03:53.710> of<00:03:53.890> damage<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:54.280> then<00:03:54.430> what

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
this thing is going to be a problem I

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.610 
this thing is going to be a problem I

and then I could go for my own sludge
bomb<00:05:43.030> and<00:05:43.330> I<00:05:43.660> believe<00:05:43.720> a<00:05:43.960> sludge<00:05:44.410> bomb<00:05:44.650> plus

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
bomb and I believe a sludge bomb plus

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.390 
bomb and I believe a sludge bomb plus
like<00:05:45.790> mock<00:05:46.630> punch<00:05:46.960> combo<00:05:47.440> from<00:05:47.710> breloom<00:05:48.190> would

like mock punch combo from breloom would

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.500
