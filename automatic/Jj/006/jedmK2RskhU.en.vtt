it's a it's a neat Reposado I think it's

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.560 
it's a it's a neat Reposado I think it's
like<00:00:45.750> around<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.170> $25.00<00:00:47.010> don't<00:00:47.250> I'll<00:00:48.030> put<00:00:48.510> it

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
like around the $25.00 don't I'll put it

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.479 
like around the $25.00 don't I'll put it
in<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> lower<00:00:48.930> half<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:49.950> think<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.370> um

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
in the lower half but I think it's um

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.420 
in the lower half but I think it's um
under<00:00:50.879> $25<00:00:51.660> for<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.980> could<00:00:53.100> find<00:00:53.129> it

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
under $25 for that if you could find it

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.310 
under $25 for that if you could find it
it's<00:00:53.879> kind<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.059> expanding<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.079> I

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
it's kind of expanding this is and I

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.479 
it's kind of expanding this is and I
didn't<00:00:55.530> know<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.739> Senor<00:00:56.070> frog's<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.460> a

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489

Amazon or at the store so you could

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.580 
Amazon or at the store so you could
quite<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> big<00:02:12.629> difference<00:02:12.959> this<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.140> really

quite a big difference this is really

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.990 
quite a big difference this is really
just<00:02:13.709> flimsy<00:02:14.069> metal<00:02:14.370> probably<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.730> looks<00:02:14.760> like

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
just flimsy metal probably it looks like

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.570 
just flimsy metal probably it looks like
something<00:02:15.209> you'd<00:02:15.300> get<00:02:15.450> on<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.599> PC<00:02:16.170> case<00:02:17.099> almost

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
something you'd get on a PC case almost

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.220 
something you'd get on a PC case almost
like<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.910> metal<00:02:18.239> that<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.599> almost<00:02:18.750> cut<00:02:19.019> you

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
like that metal that you almost cut you

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.770 
like that metal that you almost cut you
so<00:02:20.099> you<00:02:20.160> get<00:02:20.610> what<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.849> pay<00:02:21.030> for<00:02:21.060> if<00:02:21.540> you're
