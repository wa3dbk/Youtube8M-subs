up there will be a tanking class which
will<00:02:27.640> most<00:02:27.790> likely<00:02:28.060> refer<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.960> Dragon

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
will most likely refer to the Dragon

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.750 
will most likely refer to the Dragon
Knight<00:02:29.350> being<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.770> main<00:02:29.920> tank<00:02:30.190> in<00:02:30.310> class<00:02:30.490> and

class<00:02:34.990> will<00:02:35.320> most<00:02:35.530> likely<00:02:35.709> be<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.920> Templar
