thank<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:50.960> believe<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:51.989> having<00:00:52.440> more

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
thank you I believe that having more

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.920 
thank you I believe that having more
business<00:00:53.160> content<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.180> curriculum<00:00:54.449> for

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
business content in the curriculum for

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.709 
business content in the curriculum for
engineers<00:00:55.530> especially<00:00:56.489> those<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.149> want<00:00:57.629> to

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
engineers especially those that want to

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.349 
engineers especially those that want to
become<00:00:57.840> innovators<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:59.430> really<00:00:59.820> important

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
become innovators is really important

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.720 
become innovators is really important
well<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.840> think<00:01:00.930> engineering<00:01:01.500> students<00:01:02.100> you

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
well I think engineering students you

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.880 
well I think engineering students you
know<00:01:02.850> they're<00:01:03.149> great<00:01:03.510> when<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.500> comes<00:01:04.680> to

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
know they're great when it comes to

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.399 
know they're great when it comes to
technical<00:01:05.339> skills<00:01:05.610> but<00:01:06.540> there's<00:01:07.350> a

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
technical skills but there's a

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.530 
technical skills but there's a
limitation<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:08.340> been<00:01:08.520> noted<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.450> know

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
limitation and it's been noted you know

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.469 
limitation and it's been noted you know
of<00:01:09.689> all<00:01:09.869> engineers<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:12.060> softer

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
of all engineers in that the softer

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.120 
of all engineers in that the softer
skills<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.229> management<00:01:13.740> skills<00:01:13.799> are

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
skills and the management skills are

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.219 
skills and the management skills are
things<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:15.240> don't<00:01:15.390> necessarily<00:01:15.509> pick<00:01:16.020> up

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
things that we don't necessarily pick up

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.070 
things that we don't necessarily pick up
in<00:01:16.770> our<00:01:16.860> education<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.509> gift<00:01:18.810> by

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
in our education so this gift by

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.100 
in our education so this gift by
establishing<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.720> engineering<00:01:21.720> leadership

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
establishing the engineering leadership

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.140 
establishing the engineering leadership
and<00:01:22.229> innovation<00:01:22.320> certificate<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.580> by

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
and innovation certificate and by

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.910 
and innovation certificate and by
changing<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.750> way<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.140> we<00:01:25.229> think<00:01:25.439> about<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
changing the way that we think about the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.190 
changing the way that we think about the
integrated<00:01:26.400> engineering<00:01:26.850> program<00:01:27.299> will

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
integrated engineering program will

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.410 
integrated engineering program will
allow<00:01:28.350> for<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> wider<00:01:29.280> array<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.820> visitor<00:01:30.210> of

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
allow for a wider array of visitor of

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.179 
allow for a wider array of visitor of
engineering<00:01:30.990> students<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:32.270> get<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:34.189> meaningful

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
engineering students to get a meaningful

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.300 
engineering students to get a meaningful
exposure<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.810> business<00:01:37.140> courses<00:01:37.409> one<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
exposure to business courses one of the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.420 
exposure to business courses one of the
things<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.729> Canada<00:01:39.180> has<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.600> become<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.140> more

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
things that Canada has to become is more

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.700 
things that Canada has to become is more
globally<00:01:41.430> competitive<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.299> innovation<00:01:42.869> and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
globally competitive and innovation and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.460 
globally competitive and innovation and
so<00:01:44.369> with<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> combination<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
so with the combination of the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.350 
so with the combination of the
management<00:01:47.040> skills<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.759> engineering

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
management skills the engineering

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.719 
management skills the engineering
technology<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.500> broader<00:01:49.860> awareness<00:01:50.130> of

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
technology and a broader awareness of

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.290 
technology and a broader awareness of
what's<00:01:50.909> going<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.360> internet

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
what's going on internet

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.150 
what's going on internet
I<00:01:52.330> think<00:01:52.780> we'll<00:01:52.960> set<00:01:53.200> western<00:01:53.650> engineering

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
I think we'll set western engineering

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.030 
I think we'll set western engineering
graduates<00:01:54.610> apart
