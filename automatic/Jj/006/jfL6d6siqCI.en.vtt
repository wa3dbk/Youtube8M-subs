00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello here fabian speaks of 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.290
 china gadgets yes and i have you today 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.790
 A tablet pc is brought exactly 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.460
 a tablet pc is running on the windows 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.620
 windows has yes before I believe in october 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.570
 was the company policy to that effect 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.199
 changed that there is a free 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.080
 windows 8.1 version gives - 8.1 with bing 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.369
 as a result, more and more 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.609
 cheap windows tablets on the market 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.400
 pour and we have the pico like 4 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.759
 bought that is one with the cheapest 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.170
 and it costs 81 euros yes and 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.600
 how to get here right at the beginning 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.370
 looks it is really well processed right now 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.370
 for the small price none 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.530
 protruding plastic knew nothing 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.390
 Nothing nice feels good on the back 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.530
 Although plastic is in metal look too 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.140
 pine not really succeeded 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.059
 yes, standard connections are like you 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.140
 it knows of the tablets available and 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.340
 looks from left to right and here 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.449
 Connection for a micro SD card 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.140
 next to normal headphone jack 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.290
 there is a micro hdmi next to it 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.390
 hdmi connection and a micro usb 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.119
 connection to the store or to 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.390
 There usb device to connect 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.740
 otg cable so a micro USB usb cable 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.560
 is on the whole as well as that 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.970
 Charging cables make what you still need 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.409
 Do not change it a little bit longer 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.409
 maybe that works too 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:34.380
 Here you can already see pippo as I said 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:37.440
 the company and it drives up the display 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.240
 a hd display is not necessarily now 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.070
 the best thing in the market is me 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.610
 think that a majority is really enough 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.650
 sharply dissolving, the contrasts are good 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.750
 there is also light enough so just at 1 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.490
 8 inches actually more is needed 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.550
 in my opinion not now I have to 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.130
 Just enter my password and 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.870
 then we are already in the windows 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.360
 Everyone knows typical tile design 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.369
 I think everyone has seen before 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.580
 or even has a device windows 8 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.190
 and 13 on yes runs to the other data 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.070
 It is an Intel Atom processor installed 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.410
 the tactics with i believe 1.8 ghz 1 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.320
 gigabytes of RAM as well 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.970
 so well above all else in 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.860
 order because windows is synonymous really 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.170
 good performance is absolutely conclusive 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.360
 how can always be here on the desktop 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.610
 go here also quite normal 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.410
 instead of moderately and sometimes go in chrome 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.170
 if that teaches us, let's have a look 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.900
 youtube video on i would say you 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.660
 tube by the way, that too very nice and 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.220
 Although the touchpad itself is that 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.959
 really very precise can be very 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.570
 good service and it makes me happy 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.519
 because I've been around for three years already 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.160
 time trial started me then 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.730
 Also a cheap tablet from China 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.530
 had come and that was easy 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.030
 Really not to use was the touchpad 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.600
 that was how badly processed it was 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.400
 different now 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.340
 it is really quite fluid I again 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.470
 the first video on 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.730
 what's up is stress on youtube that way 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:11.690
 nice but now comes advertising first 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.690
 check24 we go into the full screen 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.640
 jump this one can see a man in there 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.190
 funny camera in full screen mode 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.200
 that also resolves well on clay there is 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.010
 actually I can give them at once 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.709
 but make it so they show the 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.900
 loudest 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.250
 That's the maximum volume youtube 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.569
 works now we are back 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.430
 back menu that by the way completely 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.380
 practically comes with the windows button 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.680
 You always go back to the menu no matter where you are 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.500
 is and can be another time now 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.530
 open app 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.830
 I have it when he opens now 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.810
 would 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.239
 I have the sports show earlier 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:57.660
 Installed as an app everyone thinks you 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:04:01.019
 By the way, please open the here by the way 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.300
 I ignore all fingerprints 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.780
 somehow that's magic 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.489
 do 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.930
 Of course I have it fully cleaned 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.640
 app also opens relatively quickly 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.010
 can select the articles here 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:16.440
 everything runs smoothly and normally 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:18.720
 together yes you have still left 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.700
 say that I like the four 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.740
 personally really good so just for 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.979
 the price of 89 euros 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:30.540
 a nice thing yes small criticism 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:33.540
 is that only 16 gb memory on it are 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.460
 and everything is full to 5 gb 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.830
 that means I could just that 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.419
 Officer us as always one year free 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.340
 we do not just install it 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.220
 But there is no more space left 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.330
 solve this by a memory card here 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.850
 inserts up to 64 gigabytes 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.919
 but otherwise really supports one 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.419
 nice device 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.780
 I can only recommend it if it has 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:57.590
 he wanted to get it in the article 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.590
 have lots of fun with it
