00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.330
 hello good to all yes yes as before 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.880
 good today we are going to go trying 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.160
 decipher again a little more what 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.890
 tell us the voices of TV in die 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.960
 rice you already know that the voices of the TV 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.750
 they are always important and we always 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.430
 they are saying something when in transit 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.800
 before we did not know what they meant 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.850
 certain things here we have already given 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.640
 sense then seeing what they say 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.100
 here little by little we will be deciphering 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.140
 things in the following d lc as has 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.930
 happened with the theme of the Illuminati and 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.559
 other voices that have come out who you give 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.730
 reid but this one we still had not 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.760
 deciphered a bit or tried 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.100
 understand a little more in which the 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.620
 that comes out now that is a kind of 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.510
 military that is flying over the area 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.010
 ok I want you to listen to it and now 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.379
 then we will take everything out 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.690
 let's have the thoughts we have 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.810
 about this let's hear it and now what 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.810
 we see 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.420
 d 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.960
 this is not so I'm going to prepare the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.960
 new passion 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.930
 they seem to have been destroying 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.930
 of the facilities 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.400
 it has been seen though insecure 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.130
 Well now we are going to go shelling 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.160
 little by little what he has been saying 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.220
 at first it says network with 5 passable 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.450
 10 it's not like they're talking between 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.150
 one between them and they are like codes 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.760
 so codes to talk to each other, not good 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.730
 I was looking and I could not find anything 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.160
 Red 5 and leaves 10 us 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:06.420
 They found it important to be able to 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:09.210
 say but then says broken arrows 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.130
 indicating the place where he is looking 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.520
 where are you looking 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.790
 Well, arrow always broken you 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.890
 you know in the maps always be if we 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.070
 we can put to look has referred to 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.670
 disasters that are passed on 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.370
 history but if it came if we look at arrow 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.250
 He also is not broken meaning 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.610
 things like that because for example they leave 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.670
 two important things worth mentioning and 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.540
 always related to the fixed flight 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.850
 what I am always saying 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.730
 related to the flight and the one that 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.590
 He says 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.360
 you know it 's like flying over 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.459
 zone is good because it is one of those 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.440
 things operation arrow broken the disaster 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.290
 of lofts that could unleash a 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.659
 nuclear hecatomb I'm not going to put here 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.220
 to explain all this but it's one thing 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.580
 interesting how good you can 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.910
 look for it and it's there in the google and 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.810
 it's interesting, and then another one comes out 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.819
 thing here that says 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.520
 when the second world war in 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.739
 Europe was coming to an end 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.380
 waffen preparing entry into service 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.200
 of a powerful thing to do double hunt 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.750
 engine is saying that it is a hunting voucher 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.040
 the second world war is worth now 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.890
 we are not the second world war 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.830
 but everything is related to the flight 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.120
 with fighters, it's worth the shots 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.640
 good 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.750
 Now I want you to see when in the end 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:41.650
 of the video says confirmed decline between 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.290
 -5 withdrawal safe distance 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.569
 well then confirmed decline 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.750
 descent will go down 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:53.590
 Balestra is landing is going to land 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.540
 He says somewhere and drop between -5 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.780
 well then if we put in google you less 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.560
 5 I have put t least 5 and look at what 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.060
 comes out 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:08.060
 fighters worth putting on minus 50 t minus 50 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.370
 ok but when he had in this minus 5 what 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.280
 first you get the first thing that you 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.269
 it comes out in the photos of these cafes all 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.919
 full of good coffee that I come to that 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.750
 you are thinking right now 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.500
 yes as before and he told what to say 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.990
 this shit good then if you come here 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.750
 to the photo here where is the 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.330
 markers then the markers if you 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.980
 you look well up here on the right 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.770
 it looks 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.460
 I at least see the drawing of a 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.590
 fighter flying and I have not seen it now what 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.450
 I saw from the time the one that came out 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.850
 first time in the markers the 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.560
 images of the ice rice that is in one of 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.550
 my videos those first ones that what 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.710
 you can search if you want 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.620
 that is, they will mean all this 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.540
 between me I do not know I see a coffee and 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.160
 flying because that can not be a 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.480
 meteorite that falls on a ball of 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.030
 fire of those that fall because if you 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.460
 you set fireballs well 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.740
 the meteorites those that always fall 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.770
 they have a tail they always have a tail 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.710
 so long fire and that does not have it 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.320
 pay attention to the drawing above 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.320
 on top of the little ball that fire looks 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.860
 like a triangle the shape of a fighter 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.140
 I do not know what they will refer to that and already 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.080
 you know how the voices of 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.420
 televisions right now they do not take it out 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.430
 meaning as they enter yes but after 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.710
 if you can get it out like I said to the 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.870
 Principle remember all things 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.450
 that we have been deciphering with time 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.030
 and that at the beginning when we listened 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.910
 the voices in transit we were not able 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:50.600
 to make good sense for seeing 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:53.330
 all this I ask two questions that the 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.340
 I see that the most important are who 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.990
 will have caused a fire for 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.660
 destroy the evidence that involved them 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.870
 in the epidemic 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.780
 because they are saying that there are several 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.790
 people and who are involved in the 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.830
 epidemic 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.710
 and to each one we can make our 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.090
 few other properties conclusions 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.420
 but with time we will discover 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.600
 more things about them 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:22.400
 and the second one asks who that will be 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:24.500
 mysterious pilot and where will he go 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.229
 all this and more questions that we 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:31.070
 we are doing all the same as the 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:33.169
 we decipher in the trÃ nsit voices 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:37.130
 we will be deciphering and tying ends with the 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:41.830
 time on the following maps that does not 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.830
 I doubt until the next video
