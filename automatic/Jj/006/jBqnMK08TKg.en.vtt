when I stopped my computer this morning

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.200 
when I stopped my computer this morning
I've<00:00:07.109> heard<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.799> sound<00:00:08.660> and<00:00:10.429> it<00:00:11.429> seems<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.090> be

I've heard a sound and it seems to be

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.000 
I've heard a sound and it seems to be
coming<00:00:12.360> from<00:00:12.740> this<00:00:13.740> fan<00:00:14.250> over<00:00:14.759> here<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:16.010> as

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
coming from this fan over here and as

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.640 
coming from this fan over here and as
you<00:00:17.130> can<00:00:17.250> see<00:00:17.310> after<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> while<00:00:18.109> it<00:00:19.109> stops

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
you can see after a while it stops

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.730 
you can see after a while it stops
spinning<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.580> on<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.090> spins<00:00:21.330> are<00:00:21.510> very<00:00:22.500> late<00:00:22.710> a

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
spinning it on the spins are very late a

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.759 
spinning it on the spins are very late a
little<00:00:22.890> bit<00:00:23.039> now<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:24.619> something<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.740> wrong

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
little bit now and something is wrong

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:26.480 
little bit now and something is wrong
with<00:00:26.099> it

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
with it

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.419 
with it
and<00:00:27.080> as<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.170> can<00:00:28.320> hear<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.980> does<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> really

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
and as you can hear it it does a really

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.750 
and as you can hear it it does a really
loud<00:00:30.359> noise<00:00:30.390> some<00:00:31.199> reason

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:44.020 

I<00:00:37.339> don't<00:00:38.339> know<00:00:38.429> why

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.220 

and<00:00:44.180> if<00:00:45.140> I<00:00:45.410> were<00:00:45.710> to<00:00:45.769> unplug<00:00:47.019> it's<00:00:48.019> not

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
and if I were to unplug it's not

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.680 
and if I were to unplug it's not
spinning<00:00:48.410> at<00:00:48.649> all<00:00:48.829> right<00:00:49.219> now<00:00:51.129> almost<00:00:52.570> and<00:00:53.570> the

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
spinning at all right now almost and the

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.720 
spinning at all right now almost and the
thing<00:00:53.899> is<00:00:54.019> if<00:00:54.199> if<00:00:54.469> I<00:00:54.589> press<00:00:54.890> on<00:00:55.039> it<00:00:55.219> a<00:00:55.370> little

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
thing is if if I press on it a little

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.610 
thing is if if I press on it a little
bit<00:00:56.469> even<00:00:57.469> pressing<00:00:57.980> it<00:00:58.809> you<00:00:59.809> see<00:00:59.960> it<00:01:00.199> stops<00:01:00.500> to

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
bit even pressing it you see it stops to

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.579 
bit even pressing it you see it stops to
spin<00:01:00.860> at<00:01:01.100> full<00:01:01.729> capacity<00:01:02.149> again<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.199> it<00:01:03.320> it

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
spin at full capacity again and it it

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.940 
spin at full capacity again and it it
doesn't<00:01:04.040> sound<00:01:04.369> anymore<00:01:04.790> but<00:01:05.750> if<00:01:05.869> I<00:01:05.960> just<00:01:05.990> let

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
doesn't sound anymore but if I just let

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:15.240 
doesn't sound anymore but if I just let
it<00:01:07.070> go<00:01:07.280> it<00:01:07.549> will<00:01:07.759> soon<00:01:08.830> soon<00:01:09.830> be<00:01:10.039> paired<00:01:10.250> again

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:29.300

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
motherboard but somewhere here at least

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:17.010 
motherboard but somewhere here at least
you<00:02:11.129> cannot<00:02:11.790> surround<00:02:12.120> you

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.750

yeah I don't know if it's from the
family<00:02:19.120> if<00:02:19.240> it's<00:02:19.420> from<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.720> motherboard<00:02:20.200> the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
family if it's from the motherboard the

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.480 
family if it's from the motherboard the
noise<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.670> coming<00:02:23.100> but<00:02:24.100> yeah<00:02:24.250> it's<00:02:24.430> not

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
spinning at all almost now and then I

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.200 
spinning at all almost now and then I
press<00:02:28.090> on<00:02:28.270> it<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.510> bit<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:30.280> starts<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.970> spin

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
press on it a bit and it starts to spin

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:40.119 
press on it a bit and it starts to spin
as<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.810> should<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:33.420> sound<00:02:34.420> go<00:02:34.600> away

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.209 

and<00:02:40.219> it<00:02:41.150> seems<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.659> be<00:02:41.749> good<00:02:42.079> now<00:02:42.349> before<00:02:43.010> when

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:43.219 
and it seems to be good now before when

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:45.789 
and it seems to be good now before when
I<00:02:43.249> pressed<00:02:43.579> on<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.959> started<00:02:45.319> to<00:02:45.439> be<00:02:45.620> bad

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
I pressed on it it started to be bad

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.069 
I pressed on it it started to be bad
again<00:02:46.010> after<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.459> while<00:02:49.120> yeah<00:02:50.150> regardless<00:02:50.629> what

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
again after a while yeah regardless what

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.500 
again after a while yeah regardless what
do<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.290> think<00:02:51.499> is<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:52.129> problem<00:02:52.249> if<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:52.969> were<00:02:53.209> to

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
do you think is the problem if I were to

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.589 
do you think is the problem if I were to
remove<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.739> fan<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.489> then<00:02:56.239> start<00:02:56.540> the

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
remove the fan and then start the

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.429 
remove the fan and then start the
computer<00:02:57.760> there<00:02:58.760> would<00:02:58.909> be<00:02:58.939> no<00:02:59.209> noise<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.840> the

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:00.439 
computer there would be no noise and the

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.289 
computer there would be no noise and the
fan<00:03:00.620> would<00:03:01.510> obviously<00:03:02.510> not<00:03:02.689> working<00:03:02.900> that's

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
fan would obviously not working that's

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.149 
fan would obviously not working that's
is<00:03:05.299> it<00:03:05.599> the<00:03:05.870> fan<00:03:06.109> that's<00:03:06.349> the<00:03:06.500> problem<00:03:06.739> or<00:03:07.069> is

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
is it the fan that's the problem or is

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:11.349 
is it the fan that's the problem or is
it<00:03:07.310> somewhere<00:03:07.849> I<00:03:07.879> was<00:03:08.090> like<00:03:10.060> maybe<00:03:11.060> it's<00:03:11.239> not

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
it somewhere I was like maybe it's not

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:18.599 
it somewhere I was like maybe it's not
enough<00:03:11.629> power<00:03:11.900> from<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.439> CPU<00:03:12.950> or<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.969> why<00:03:14.419> but

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.609 

yeah
