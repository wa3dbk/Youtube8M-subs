00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
lot to most people I'm no different I've

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.080 
lot to most people I'm no different I've
done<00:00:34.559> okay<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:34.890> poker<00:00:35.250> over<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.640> years<00:00:35.760> but

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
there five bets everyone really came to

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.660 
there five bets everyone really came to
play<00:01:40.190> Jake<00:01:40.580> Paulsen<00:01:40.940> was<00:01:41.390> playing<00:01:41.630> great<00:01:42.670> any

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
play Jake Paulsen was playing great any

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.070 
play Jake Paulsen was playing great any
time<00:01:43.730> he<00:01:44.000> gets<00:01:44.030> three<00:01:44.390> best<00:01:44.600> seems<00:01:44.840> like<00:01:44.960> he's

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
time he gets three best seems like he's

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.070 
time he gets three best seems like he's
for<00:01:45.350> betting<00:01:45.710> he's<00:01:46.400> just<00:01:46.690> doing<00:01:47.690> good<00:01:47.720> things

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
for betting he's just doing good things

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.860 
for betting he's just doing good things
so<00:01:48.440> I<00:01:48.680> think<00:01:49.490> it<00:01:49.550> was<00:01:49.610> a<00:01:49.700> tough<00:01:49.880> table<00:01:50.240> I<00:01:50.420> was

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
so I think it was a tough table I was

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.110 
so I think it was a tough table I was

was able to successfully do that in when

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.479 
was able to successfully do that in when
the<00:02:50.030> huge<00:02:50.269> hands<00:02:50.540> but<00:02:50.810> I<00:02:50.840> just<00:02:51.080> slowly<00:02:51.890> chipped

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
the huge hands but I just slowly chipped

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.210 
the huge hands but I just slowly chipped
up<00:02:53.049> and<00:02:54.049> then<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.230> was<00:02:54.320> getting<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.560> little<00:02:54.709> Logan

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
up and then I was getting a little Logan

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.490 
up and then I was getting a little Logan
25<00:02:55.700> big<00:02:55.880> blinds<00:02:56.150> right<00:02:56.450> then

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
25 big blinds right then

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.800 
25 big blinds right then
I<00:02:57.640> think<00:02:58.640> my<00:02:58.760> image<00:02:59.060> had<00:02:59.210> been<00:02:59.240> especially

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
I think my image had been especially

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.010 
I think my image had been especially
post-flop<00:03:00.440> kind<00:03:00.770> of<00:03:00.860> tight<00:03:01.070> I<00:03:02.000> thought<00:03:02.810> that

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
post-flop kind of tight I thought that

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.160 
post-flop kind of tight I thought that
was<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.140> good<00:03:03.500> spot<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.220> I<00:03:04.610> mean<00:03:05.060> Jesse<00:03:05.600> never<00:03:05.630> has

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
was a good spot I I mean Jesse never has

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.740 
was a good spot I I mean Jesse never has
he<00:03:06.550> could<00:03:07.550> have<00:03:07.640> plied<00:03:07.820> a<00:03:07.850> big<00:03:08.120> hand<00:03:08.300> pick<00:03:08.540> up

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
he could have plied a big hand pick up

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.980 
he could have plied a big hand pick up
but<00:03:09.250> he's<00:03:10.250> rear<00:03:10.670> AZ<00:03:10.850> me<00:03:11.060> at<00:03:11.150> nine<00:03:11.330> days<00:03:11.630> for

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
but he's rear AZ me at nine days for

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.720 
but he's rear AZ me at nine days for
sure<00:03:12.140> he<00:03:12.380> could<00:03:12.500> up<00:03:12.650> clogs<00:03:12.980> he<00:03:13.220> could<00:03:13.400> have<00:03:13.520> ace

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.350 
really draw heavy I could definitely see
him<00:03:21.709> when<00:03:22.040> i<00:03:22.130> checked<00:03:22.370> back<00:03:22.520> the<00:03:22.670> flop<00:03:22.910> in<00:03:23.180> the

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
him when i checked back the flop in the

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.330 
him when i checked back the flop in the
turn<00:03:23.600> i'm<00:03:23.870> gonna<00:03:24.200> have<00:03:24.380> like<00:03:24.530> secondaries

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
turn i'm gonna have like secondaries

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.860 
turn i'm gonna have like secondaries
high<00:03:25.520> a<00:03:25.550> lot<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:25.850> when<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.180> bet<00:03:26.390> it's<00:03:26.660> a<00:03:26.720> good

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
high a lot and when I bet it's a good

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.870 
high a lot and when I bet it's a good
spot<00:03:27.110> for<00:03:27.170> him<00:03:27.380> to<00:03:27.500> put<00:03:27.680> pressure<00:03:27.860> on<00:03:28.130> me<00:03:28.310> what

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
spot for him to put pressure on me what

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.970 
spot for him to put pressure on me what
she<00:03:29.030> did<00:03:29.209> and<00:03:29.450> with<00:03:29.930> drugs<00:03:30.290> I<00:03:30.590> think<00:03:30.860> you'll

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
she did and with drugs I think you'll

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.150 
she did and with drugs I think you'll
have<00:03:31.070> a<00:03:31.130> lot<00:03:31.310> so<00:03:32.320> my<00:03:33.320> drawers<00:03:33.620> like<00:03:33.860> the<00:03:33.980> worst

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
have a lot so my drawers like the worst

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.949 
have a lot so my drawers like the worst
are<00:03:34.370> out<00:03:34.520> there<00:03:34.700> but<00:03:34.940> all<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.090> drawers<00:03:35.480> should

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
are out there but all the drawers should

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.550 
are out there but all the drawers should
be<00:03:36.080> folding<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:37.250> and<00:03:37.690> that<00:03:38.690> couple<00:03:39.320> of<00:03:39.440> the
