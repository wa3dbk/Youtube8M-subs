affect<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.869> gun<00:01:31.020> hardly<00:01:31.439> at<00:01:31.530> all<00:01:31.650> because<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
affect the gun hardly at all because the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.800 
affect the gun hardly at all because the
guns<00:01:32.640> always<00:01:33.000> going<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.180> be<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.299> four-hit<00:01:33.659> kill

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
guns always going to be a four-hit kill

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.420 
guns always going to be a four-hit kill
now<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.140> used<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.409> be<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> five<00:01:34.799> hit<00:01:35.009> kill<00:01:35.220> at<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
now it used to be a five hit kill at the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.310 
now it used to be a five hit kill at the
longer<00:01:35.729> ranges<00:01:36.060> they<00:01:36.540> buff<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.960> up<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.170> little

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
longer ranges they buff that up a little

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.480 
longer ranges they buff that up a little
bit<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.619> make<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:37.829> got<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> very<00:01:38.250> viable

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
bit to make this got a very viable

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.399 
bit to make this got a very viable
option<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.420> only<00:01:39.570> problem<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.320> never

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
option the only problem is you never

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.899 
option the only problem is you never
have<00:01:40.650> those<00:01:40.829> three<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.250> kills<00:01:41.460> like<00:01:41.670> all<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
have those three that kills like all the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.550 
have those three that kills like all the
other<00:01:42.060> assault<00:01:42.420> rifles<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.869> all<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.470> other

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
other assault rifles do all the other

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.840 
other assault rifles do all the other
assault<00:01:43.829> rifles<00:01:43.860> are<00:01:44.189> three<00:01:44.430> hit<00:01:44.549> kill<00:01:44.729> at

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
assault rifles are three hit kill at

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.670 
assault rifles are three hit kill at
closer<00:01:45.090> ranges<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.750> then<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> forehead<00:01:46.470> at<00:01:46.590> the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
closer ranges and then a forehead at the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.190 
closer ranges and then a forehead at the
longer<00:01:47.009> range<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.729> f<00:01:47.850> ad<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.270> now<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> solid<00:01:49.020> for

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
longer range the f ad is now a solid for

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.289 
longer range the f ad is now a solid for
it<00:01:49.320> kill<00:01:49.530> but<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.340> never<00:01:50.520> drops<00:01:50.790> off<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.090> five

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
it kill but it never drops off to a five

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.149 
it kill but it never drops off to a five
bullet<00:01:51.600> kill<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.079> very<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.590> mediocre

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
bullet kill so it's very a mediocre

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.740 
bullet kill so it's very a mediocre
assault<00:01:53.640> rifle<00:01:53.850> but<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.090> definitely<00:01:54.450> going

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
assault rifle but it's definitely going

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.270 
assault rifle but it's definitely going
because<00:01:54.899> they've<00:01:55.020> got<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> 40<00:01:55.500> round<00:01:55.740> magazine

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
because they've got a 40 round magazine

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.219 
because they've got a 40 round magazine
which<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> largest<00:01:57.360> magazine<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.960> all<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
which is the largest magazine of all the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.450 
which is the largest magazine of all the
assault<00:01:58.469> rifle<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:59.009> got<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.189> little<00:01:59.340> bit

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
assault rifle so it's got a little bit

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.310 
assault rifle so it's got a little bit
of<00:01:59.610> trade-off<00:01:59.939> there<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.420> it's<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.869> very<00:02:00.899> good

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
of trade-off there and it's a very good

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.230 
of trade-off there and it's a very good
mediocre<00:02:01.740> gun<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.759> also<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:02.969> really<00:02:03.090> nice

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
mediocre gun but it also is really nice

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.660 
mediocre gun but it also is really nice
iron<00:02:03.570> sights<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.930> my<00:02:04.049> opinion<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.590> next<00:02:05.520> gun

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
iron sights in my opinion the next gun

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.839 
iron sights in my opinion the next gun
to<00:02:05.790> get<00:02:05.909> buffed<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.659> m16a4<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:08.369> lot<00:02:08.700> of

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
to get buffed is the m16a4 a lot of

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.400 
to get buffed is the m16a4 a lot of
people<00:02:09.000> were<00:02:09.330> complaining<00:02:09.660> about<00:02:10.020> this<00:02:10.200> gun

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
people were complaining about this gun

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.140 
people were complaining about this gun
because<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.920> was

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
because it was

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.110 
because it was
called<00:02:11.329> 34<00:02:11.780> favorite<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.459> even<00:02:13.459> in<00:02:13.579> black<00:02:13.879> ops

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
called 34 favorite and even in black ops

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.970 
called 34 favorite and even in black ops
it<00:02:14.299> was<00:02:14.390> still<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.540> very<00:02:14.720> viable<00:02:14.989> option<00:02:15.470> but

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
it was still a very viable option but

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.710 
it was still a very viable option but
when<00:02:16.099> it<00:02:16.220> came<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:16.549> modern<00:02:16.849> warfare<00:02:16.970> 3<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.420> gun

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
when it came to modern warfare 3 the gun

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.050 
when it came to modern warfare 3 the gun
was<00:02:17.900> just<00:02:18.110> pathetic<00:02:18.379> shot<00:02:19.069> to<00:02:19.280> slow<00:02:19.610> it<00:02:19.819> didn't

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
was just pathetic shot to slow it didn't

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.670 
was just pathetic shot to slow it didn't
really<00:02:20.239> do<00:02:20.299> much<00:02:20.420> damage<00:02:20.629> and<00:02:21.019> it's<00:02:21.500> a

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
really do much damage and it's a

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.069 
really do much damage and it's a
counterpart<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.579> type<00:02:22.790> 95<00:02:23.120> was<00:02:23.629> so<00:02:23.900> much

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
counterpart the type 95 was so much

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.569 
counterpart the type 95 was so much
better<00:02:24.230> as<00:02:24.500> far<00:02:24.680> as<00:02:24.799> three<00:02:24.980> round<00:02:25.129> burst<00:02:25.310> guns

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
better as far as three round burst guns

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.910 
better as far as three round burst guns
go<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:25.970> wasn't<00:02:26.209> even<00:02:26.269> funny<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.680> what<00:02:27.829> they

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
go it wasn't even funny so the what they

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.550 
go it wasn't even funny so the what they
did<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.129> buff<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.459> m16<00:02:29.060> is<00:02:29.269> they<00:02:30.170> made<00:02:30.319> it<00:02:30.439> so

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
did to buff the m16 is they made it so

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.890 
did to buff the m16 is they made it so
now<00:02:30.680> it's<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.040> two<00:02:31.159> hit<00:02:31.310> kill<00:02:31.549> up<00:02:31.640> close<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.239> the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
now it's a two hit kill up close and the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.440 
now it's a two hit kill up close and the
four<00:02:33.739> hit<00:02:33.890> killed<00:02:34.129> the<00:02:34.250> longer<00:02:34.549> ranges<00:02:34.879> so

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
four hit killed the longer ranges so

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.270 
four hit killed the longer ranges so
they<00:02:35.599> buffed<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:36.049> some<00:02:36.379> they<00:02:36.799> also<00:02:36.920> left<00:02:37.129> its

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
they buffed it some they also left its

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.860 
they buffed it some they also left its
rate<00:02:37.430> of<00:02:37.459> fire<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:38.090> it's<00:02:38.269> now<00:02:38.390> shoots<00:02:38.659> a<00:02:38.689> little

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
rate of fire so it's now shoots a little

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.140 
rate of fire so it's now shoots a little
bit<00:02:38.959> faster<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:39.769> time<00:02:40.069> between<00:02:40.250> bursts<00:02:40.700> isn't

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
bit faster the time between bursts isn't

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.780 
bit faster the time between bursts isn't
nearly<00:02:41.329> as<00:02:41.450> much<00:02:41.689> and<00:02:42.049> in<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.129> burst<00:02:43.340> itself

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
nearly as much and in the burst itself

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.940 
nearly as much and in the burst itself
shoots<00:02:44.030> a<00:02:44.120> little<00:02:44.269> bit<00:02:44.359> faster<00:02:44.530> also<00:02:45.530> it's<00:02:45.739> too

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
shoots a little bit faster also it's too

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.530 
shoots a little bit faster also it's too
it<00:02:46.069> kills<00:02:46.310> now<00:02:46.459> up<00:02:46.609> close<00:02:46.849> if<00:02:47.060> you<00:02:47.150> get<00:02:47.329> caught

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
it kills now up close if you get caught

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.819 
it kills now up close if you get caught
in<00:02:47.690> close<00:02:47.900> quarters<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.379> don't<00:02:48.560> get<00:02:48.680> caught

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
in close quarters you don't get caught

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.740 
in close quarters you don't get caught
with<00:02:48.950> your<00:02:49.040> pants<00:02:49.250> down<00:02:49.340> anymore<00:02:49.639> you<00:02:50.599> only

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
with your pants down anymore you only

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.000 
with your pants down anymore you only
have<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:50.959> get<00:02:51.109> two<00:02:51.290> of<00:02:51.319> those<00:02:51.470> three<00:02:51.530> bullets

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
have to get two of those three bullets

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.259 
have to get two of those three bullets

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
and it's so not a very good gun but it's

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
and it's so not a very good gun but it's
a<00:02:57.260> little<00:02:57.409> bit<00:02:57.500> better<00:02:57.590> so<00:02:57.889> if<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.040> want<00:02:58.189> to
