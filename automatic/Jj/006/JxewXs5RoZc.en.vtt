00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
feet long by three feet wide and I've

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.650 
feet long by three feet wide and I've
got<00:02:17.260> three<00:02:18.190> metal<00:02:18.580> halide<00:02:18.880> bulbs<00:02:19.210> over<00:02:19.360> it

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
got three metal halide bulbs over it

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.680 
got three metal halide bulbs over it
there's<00:02:19.990> 2<00:02:20.230> 250<00:02:21.100> watt<00:02:21.250> bulbs<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:21.880> 1<00:02:22.030> 400<00:02:22.540> watt

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
there's 2 250 watt bulbs and 1 400 watt

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.810 
there's 2 250 watt bulbs and 1 400 watt
bulb<00:02:22.930> in<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.170> middle<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.740> that<00:02:24.400> goes<00:02:24.580> back<00:02:24.760> to

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
bulb in the middle and that goes back to

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.210 
bulb in the middle and that goes back to
the<00:02:24.970> days<00:02:25.090> where<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.540> used<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.900> have<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.350> 10k<00:02:26.920> a

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
the days where I used to have a 10k a

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.820 
the days where I used to have a 10k a
20k<00:02:27.850> and<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.240> 10k<00:02:28.690> bulb<00:02:28.990> over<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.350> tank<00:02:29.590> and

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
20k and a 10k bulb over the tank and

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.460 
20k and a 10k bulb over the tank and
having<00:02:30.640> that<00:02:30.670> hotter<00:02:31.090> stronger<00:02:31.810> wattage<00:02:32.200> bulb

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
having that hotter stronger wattage bulb

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.290 
having that hotter stronger wattage bulb
in<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.680> center<00:02:33.040> evened<00:02:33.460> out<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.700> par<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.210> you

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
in the center evened out the par so you

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.370 
in the center evened out the par so you
wouldn't<00:02:34.510> have<00:02:34.600> a<00:02:34.630> dark<00:02:34.840> spot<00:02:35.080> in<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.260> middle

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
wouldn't have a dark spot in the middle

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.070 
wouldn't have a dark spot in the middle
where<00:02:35.980> all<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.190> blue<00:02:36.370> light<00:02:36.550> was<00:02:36.730> located<00:02:37.180> but

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
where all the blue light was located but

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.540 
where all the blue light was located but
now<00:02:38.350> I've<00:02:38.560> switched<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:39.100> a<00:02:39.130> different<00:02:39.160> type<00:02:39.520> of

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
now I've switched to a different type of

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.150 
now I've switched to a different type of
bulb<00:02:39.790> called<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.270> twin<00:02:40.510> arc<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:40.930> it<00:02:41.590> runs<00:02:41.800> my

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
bulb called a twin arc and it runs my

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.100 
bulb called a twin arc and it runs my
all<00:02:42.430> three<00:02:42.700> lights<00:02:42.910> are<00:02:43.180> in<00:02:43.270> 10k<00:02:43.690> for<00:02:43.900> a<00:02:43.960> few

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
all three lights are in 10k for a few

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.930 
all three lights are in 10k for a few
hours<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.530> then<00:02:44.620> all<00:02:44.830> three<00:02:44.980> lights<00:02:45.220> or<00:02:45.430> 20k

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
hours and then all three lights or 20k

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.360 
hours and then all three lights or 20k
for<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.180> few<00:02:46.330> hours<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.930> so<00:02:47.860> now<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:48.040> have<00:02:48.250> to

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
for a few hours and so now I have to

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.280 
for a few hours and so now I have to
decide<00:02:48.460> if<00:02:48.820> I<00:02:48.910> want<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.090> go<00:02:49.180> all<00:02:49.360> 400<00:02:49.930> or<00:02:50.110> if<00:02:50.200> I'm

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
decide if I want to go all 400 or if I'm

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.410 
decide if I want to go all 400 or if I'm
going<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.530> go<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:50.890> all<00:02:51.070> 250<00:02:51.910> s<00:02:51.970> I<00:02:52.120> haven't<00:02:52.360> made

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
going to go to all 250 s I haven't made

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.310 
going to go to all 250 s I haven't made
up<00:02:52.480> my<00:02:52.570> mind<00:02:53.640> now<00:02:54.640> you<00:02:55.570> know<00:02:55.690> I<00:02:55.720> see<00:02:56.140> that

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
up my mind now you know I see that

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.230 
up my mind now you know I see that
you're<00:02:56.470> still<00:02:56.500> doing<00:02:56.890> metal<00:02:57.250> halide<00:02:57.580> is<00:02:57.820> that

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
you're still doing metal halide is that

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.240 
you're still doing metal halide is that
is<00:02:58.390> that<00:02:58.420> I<00:02:58.720> mean<00:02:58.959> honestly<00:02:59.650> how<00:02:59.860> much<00:02:59.980> does<00:03:00.160> it

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
is that I mean honestly how much does it

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.250 
is that I mean honestly how much does it
cost<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.610> run<00:03:00.820> something<00:03:01.120> like<00:03:01.270> that<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:02.230> know

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
cost to run something like that you know

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.199 
cost to run something like that you know
a<00:03:02.590> set<00:03:02.920> aside<00:03:03.010> everything<00:03:03.430> else<00:03:03.790> but<00:03:04.000> just

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
a set aside everything else but just

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.940 
a set aside everything else but just
lights<00:03:04.480> like<00:03:04.810> that<00:03:05.110> how<00:03:05.620> much<00:03:05.739> would<00:03:05.890> that

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
lights like that how much would that

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.560 
lights like that how much would that
cost<00:03:06.040> to<00:03:06.459> be<00:03:06.550> running<00:03:06.850> that<00:03:07.000> on<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.209> monthly

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
cost to be running that on a monthly

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.020 
cost to be running that on a monthly
basis<00:03:08.140> well<00:03:08.890> I<00:03:08.920> did<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.250> math<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.489> while<00:03:09.760> back

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
basis well I did the math a while back

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.449 
basis well I did the math a while back
here<00:03:10.660> in<00:03:10.780> Texas<00:03:11.200> we<00:03:11.320> have<00:03:11.440> deregulation<00:03:12.220> and

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
here in Texas we have deregulation and

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.699 
here in Texas we have deregulation and
so<00:03:12.850> our<00:03:13.000> electricity<00:03:13.540> rates<00:03:13.959> are<00:03:14.170> actually

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
so our electricity rates are actually

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.280 
so our electricity rates are actually
quite<00:03:14.950> affordable<00:03:15.400> I<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:16.510> believe<00:03:16.959> where<00:03:17.170> I<00:03:17.200> am

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
quite affordable I I believe where I am

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.890 
quite affordable I I believe where I am
I'm<00:03:17.709> like<00:03:17.920> eight<00:03:18.130> point<00:03:18.459> four<00:03:18.730> cents<00:03:19.690> per

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
I'm like eight point four cents per

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.250 
I'm like eight point four cents per
kilowatt<00:03:20.290> hour<00:03:20.340> so<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.459> run<00:03:21.610> my<00:03:21.790> lights<00:03:22.260> the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
kilowatt hour so to run my lights the

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.680 
kilowatt hour so to run my lights the
total<00:03:23.680> of<00:03:23.800> six<00:03:24.040> hours<00:03:24.160> per<00:03:24.550> bulb<00:03:24.820> which<00:03:25.239> is<00:03:25.390> 18

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
total of six hours per bulb which is 18

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.780 
total of six hours per bulb which is 18
hours<00:03:25.959> of<00:03:26.140> metal<00:03:26.410> halides<00:03:26.739> you<00:03:27.160> know<00:03:27.280> spread

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
hours of metal halides you know spread

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.270 
hours of metal halides you know spread
across<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.270> tank<00:03:28.780> that<00:03:29.709> comes<00:03:29.890> out<00:03:30.070> to<00:03:30.130> about

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
across the tank that comes out to about

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.780 
across the tank that comes out to about
thirty-five<00:03:30.790> dollars<00:03:30.940> a<00:03:31.120> month<00:03:32.730> sounds<00:03:33.730> like

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
thirty-five dollars a month sounds like

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.270 
thirty-five dollars a month sounds like
the<00:03:33.940> chief<00:03:34.150> page<00:03:34.390> will<00:03:34.540> build<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:34.840> me<00:03:35.130> it's<00:03:36.130> not

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
the chief page will build to me it's not

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.920 
the chief page will build to me it's not
bad<00:03:36.459> if<00:03:36.640> I<00:03:36.700> was<00:03:36.790> in<00:03:36.880> California<00:03:37.090> is<00:03:37.570> the<00:03:37.630> rates

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
bad if I was in California is the rates

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.330 
bad if I was in California is the rates
you<00:03:38.110> know<00:03:38.200> being<00:03:38.410> a<00:03:38.440> thirty-five<00:03:38.890> cents<00:03:39.190> per

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
you know being a thirty-five cents per

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.949 
you know being a thirty-five cents per
kilowatt<00:03:39.700> hour<00:03:39.730> it<00:03:40.360> would<00:03:40.510> probably<00:03:40.690> much

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
kilowatt hour it would probably much

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.960 
kilowatt hour it would probably much
more<00:03:40.989> painful<00:03:41.380> but<00:03:42.130> I<00:03:42.160> know<00:03:42.250> some<00:03:42.519> California

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
more painful but I know some California

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.880 
more painful but I know some California
residents<00:03:43.480> that<00:03:43.600> start<00:03:44.050> their<00:03:44.260> tank<00:03:44.620> lights

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
residents that start their tank lights

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.740 
residents that start their tank lights
at<00:03:45.070> six<00:03:45.370> at<00:03:45.550> night<00:03:45.580> and<00:03:46.060> end<00:03:46.330> at<00:03:46.450> one<00:03:46.600> in<00:03:46.720> the

at six at night and end at one in the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.840 
at six at night and end at one in the
morning<00:03:46.810> because<00:03:47.709> they<00:03:48.100> want<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.400> enjoy<00:03:48.519> it<00:03:48.700> in

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
morning because they want to enjoy it in

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.350 
morning because they want to enjoy it in
the<00:03:48.940> evenings<00:03:49.360> when<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.630> rates<00:03:49.810> are<00:03:49.989> cheaper

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
the evenings when the rates are cheaper

the evenings when the rates are cheaper
exactly<00:03:52.360> I<00:03:52.570> got<00:03:52.959> a<00:03:52.989> friend<00:03:53.260> of<00:03:53.440> mine<00:03:53.590> who<00:03:53.860> does

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
exactly I got a friend of mine who does

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.280 
exactly I got a friend of mine who does
that<00:03:54.280> organ<00:03:54.790> but<00:03:54.910> he<00:03:55.030> does<00:03:55.239> it<00:03:55.269> for<00:03:55.570> commercial

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
that organ but he does it for commercial

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.920 
that organ but he does it for commercial
reasons<00:03:56.650> he<00:03:57.400> runs<00:03:57.670> his<00:03:57.850> tanks<00:03:58.269> at<00:03:58.390> night<00:03:58.570> to

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
reasons he runs his tanks at night to

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.340 
reasons he runs his tanks at night to
save<00:03:59.140> on<00:03:59.290> money<00:03:59.470> but<00:04:00.190> i<00:04:00.250> think<00:04:00.610> i<00:04:00.730> paid<00:04:00.940> about

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
save on money but i think i paid about

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.920 
save on money but i think i paid about
7.7<00:04:02.350> cents<00:04:03.010> per<00:04:03.340> kilowatt<00:04:03.850> which<00:04:04.480> is<00:04:04.630> it<00:04:04.750> too

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
7.7 cents per kilowatt which is it too

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.370 
7.7 cents per kilowatt which is it too
bad<00:04:05.079> but<00:04:05.950> uh

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
bad but uh

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.930 
bad but uh
alright<00:04:08.380> guys<00:04:08.590> so<00:04:08.920> we're<00:04:09.190> going<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:09.370> basically

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
alright guys so we're going to basically

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.050 
alright guys so we're going to basically
get<00:04:10.330> into<00:04:10.660> talking<00:04:10.870> about<00:04:11.200> sums<00:04:11.620> you<00:04:12.040> know<00:04:12.160> I'm

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
get into talking about sums you know I'm

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.810 
get into talking about sums you know I'm
a<00:04:13.150> big<00:04:13.450> advocate<00:04:13.660> on<00:04:14.110> it<00:04:14.320> I<00:04:14.500> think<00:04:15.160> if<00:04:15.460> pretty

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
a big advocate on it I think if pretty

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.750 
a big advocate on it I think if pretty
much<00:04:16.060> is<00:04:16.450> an<00:04:16.930> insurance<00:04:17.410> policy<00:04:17.650> let's<00:04:18.519> say

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
much is an insurance policy let's say

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.390 
much is an insurance policy let's say
you<00:04:19.090> know<00:04:19.120> basically<00:04:19.680> giving<00:04:20.680> you<00:04:20.799> more<00:04:21.100> time

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
you know basically giving you more time

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.630 
you know basically giving you more time
to<00:04:22.410> deal<00:04:23.410> with<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:23.740> problems<00:04:24.130> in<00:04:24.280> your<00:04:24.430> tank

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
to deal with the problems in your tank

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.050 
to deal with the problems in your tank
that<00:04:24.880> happen<00:04:25.150> on<00:04:25.240> a<00:04:25.270> daily<00:04:25.480> basis<00:04:26.790> do<00:04:27.790> you<00:04:27.880> want

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
that happen on a daily basis do you want

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.320 
that happen on a daily basis do you want
to<00:04:28.150> go<00:04:28.270> ahead<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.600> jump<00:04:28.810> into<00:04:29.050> what<00:04:29.740> kind<00:04:30.100> of

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
to go ahead and jump into what kind of

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.900 
to go ahead and jump into what kind of
filtration<00:04:31.330> some<00:04:32.320> system<00:04:32.860> you<00:04:33.160> are<00:04:33.610> familiar

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
filtration some system you are familiar

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.830 
filtration some system you are familiar
with<00:04:34.180> that<00:04:34.600> you<00:04:34.900> you<00:04:35.860> know<00:04:35.980> game<00:04:36.850> safe<00:04:37.300> for<00:04:37.660> you

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
with that you you know game safe for you

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.840 
with that you you know game safe for you
to<00:04:38.080> use<00:04:38.850> mark<00:04:40.020> well<00:04:41.020> you<00:04:41.200> know<00:04:41.290> over<00:04:41.590> the<00:04:41.680> years

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
to use mark well you know over the years

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.880 
to use mark well you know over the years
when<00:04:42.850> I<00:04:42.880> first<00:04:43.240> got<00:04:43.480> into<00:04:43.900> looking<00:04:44.560> at<00:04:44.680> getting

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
when I first got into looking at getting

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.040 
when I first got into looking at getting
a<00:04:45.100> sub<00:04:45.370> set<00:04:45.640> up<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:46.060> big<00:04:46.330> system<00:04:46.810> that<00:04:46.930> was

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
a sub set up the big system that was

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.230 
a sub set up the big system that was
recommended<00:04:47.230> was<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.919> Berlin<00:04:48.340> system<00:04:48.880> and

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
recommended was the Berlin system and

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.600 
recommended was the Berlin system and
that<00:04:49.780> basically<00:04:50.020> was<00:04:50.410> a<00:04:50.470> skimmer<00:04:50.919> zone<00:04:51.220> with<00:04:51.580> a

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
that basically was a skimmer zone with a

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.460 
that basically was a skimmer zone with a
few<00:04:51.940> other<00:04:52.090> reactors<00:04:52.750> and<00:04:53.020> then<00:04:53.260> a<00:04:53.290> return

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
few other reactors and then a return

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.830 
few other reactors and then a return
zone<00:04:53.980> but<00:04:54.220> there<00:04:54.310> was<00:04:54.400> no<00:04:54.490> refugium<00:04:55.090> tied<00:04:55.630> in

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
zone but there was no refugium tied in

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.420 
zone but there was no refugium tied in
and<00:04:56.169> this<00:04:57.160> was<00:04:57.310> back<00:04:57.490> in<00:04:57.520> I'd<00:04:57.940> say<00:04:58.350> 2001<00:04:59.430> 2002

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
and this was back in I'd say 2001 2002

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.580 
and this was back in I'd say 2001 2002
and<00:05:00.790> refugium<00:05:01.750> were<00:05:01.960> beginning<00:05:02.260> to<00:05:02.380> become

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
and refugium were beginning to become

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.440 
and refugium were beginning to become
popular<00:05:03.040> where<00:05:03.640> you<00:05:03.760> could<00:05:03.910> hang<00:05:04.090> it<00:05:04.210> on<00:05:04.330> the

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
popular where you could hang it on the

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.030 
popular where you could hang it on the
side<00:05:04.600> of<00:05:04.630> your<00:05:04.810> tank<00:05:05.110> and<00:05:05.290> grow<00:05:05.500> some<00:05:05.710> plants

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
side of your tank and grow some plants

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.280 
side of your tank and grow some plants
in<00:05:06.130> there<00:05:06.280> and<00:05:06.520> i<00:05:07.180> had<00:05:07.360> made<00:05:07.540> my<00:05:07.750> own<00:05:07.780> some

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
in there and i had made my own some

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.740 
in there and i had made my own some
myself<00:05:08.680> out<00:05:09.070> of<00:05:09.190> acrylic<00:05:09.400> after<00:05:10.270> doing<00:05:10.510> some

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
myself out of acrylic after doing some

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.290 
myself out of acrylic after doing some
reading<00:05:10.990> online<00:05:11.200> and<00:05:11.740> put<00:05:12.729> all<00:05:12.760> my<00:05:12.880> macro

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
reading online and put all my macro

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.300 
reading online and put all my macro
algae<00:05:13.479> in<00:05:13.840> a<00:05:13.960> zone<00:05:14.260> specifically<00:05:15.040> for<00:05:15.100> that

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
algae in a zone specifically for that

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.840 
algae in a zone specifically for that
and<00:05:15.729> it<00:05:16.690> was<00:05:17.010> people<00:05:18.010> were<00:05:18.070> so<00:05:18.280> impressed<00:05:18.700> with

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
and it was people were so impressed with

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.520 
and it was people were so impressed with
how<00:05:18.970> it<00:05:19.090> came<00:05:19.120> out<00:05:19.450> where<00:05:19.840> you<00:05:20.140> know<00:05:20.229> it<00:05:20.380> was

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
how it came out where you know it was

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.230 
how it came out where you know it was
fine<00:05:20.770> it<00:05:20.979> wasn't<00:05:21.100> anything<00:05:21.430> incredible<00:05:22.060> but

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
fine it wasn't anything incredible but

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.750 
fine it wasn't anything incredible but
they<00:05:22.330> liked<00:05:22.570> it
