you in that process but after you pry
that<00:01:04.500> up<00:01:04.559> gently<00:01:05.430> because<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.360> can<00:01:06.540> bend<00:01:06.869> it

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
that up gently because you can bend it

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.460 
that up gently because you can bend it
permanently<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.040> leave<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> mark<00:01:09.659> which<00:01:09.990> you

you<00:01:24.090> have<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.720> take<00:01:24.960> out<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:26.909> also<00:01:27.090> pry

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
you have to take out so you can also pry

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.170 
you have to take out so you can also pry
that<00:01:27.720> up<00:01:27.810> with<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> flathead<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:29.000> forgot<00:01:30.000> which

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
that up with a flathead I forgot which

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.120 
that up with a flathead I forgot which
side<00:01:30.450> was<00:01:30.689> on<00:01:30.869> but<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:31.619> actually<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
side was on but it's actually on the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.840 
side was on but it's actually on the
right<00:01:32.369> side<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:32.970> as<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:33.930> pry<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.409> up<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:35.549> a

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
right side so as we pry that up it's a

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.250 
right side so as we pry that up it's a
bit<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.570> challenge

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
bit of a challenge

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.850 
bit of a challenge
but<00:01:38.890> not<00:01:39.400> too<00:01:39.700> much<00:01:39.910> of<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.120> challenge<00:01:40.860> you'll

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
but not too much of a challenge you'll

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.110 
but not too much of a challenge you'll
see<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.190> screw<00:01:42.430> there<00:01:42.610> now

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
see the screw there now

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:51.450 
see the screw there now
and<00:01:43.210> you'll<00:01:43.900> be<00:01:44.020> able<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:50.250> inscrutable<00:01:51.250> to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
and you'll be able to inscrutable to

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.450 
and you'll be able to inscrutable to
remove<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:52.150> cover<00:01:52.750> of<00:01:53.050> the<00:01:53.530> keyboard<00:01:54.040> which

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
remove the cover of the keyboard which

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.190 
remove the cover of the keyboard which
is<00:01:54.640> all<00:01:54.760> you'll<00:01:54.940> really<00:01:55.180> have<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.480> remove<00:01:55.960> to

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
is all you'll really have to remove to

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.950 
is all you'll really have to remove to
get<00:01:56.350> to<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.620> circuit<00:01:57.070> board<00:01:57.340> in<00:01:58.180> which<00:01:58.510> there

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
get to the circuit board in which there

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.670 
get to the circuit board in which there
may<00:01:59.290> be<00:01:59.320> crust<00:01:59.890> of<00:02:00.510> the<00:02:01.510> liquid<00:02:01.930> which<00:02:02.230> had

difficult is finding out where those two

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.020 
difficult is finding out where those two
hidden<00:02:42.940> screws<00:02:43.420> were<00:02:43.600> but<00:02:43.810> after<00:02:44.170> that<00:02:44.410> any

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
might like to do this but I didn't have

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.060
