00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:38.190 

there<00:04:32.170> is<00:04:33.360> young<00:04:34.360> red<00:04:35.230> pupils<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:37.840> can<00:04:37.990> use

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
I think dinosaur would have probably had

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.560 
I think dinosaur would have probably had
red<00:04:46.870> eyes<00:04:46.900> who<00:04:47.710> knows<00:04:47.920> i<00:04:48.240> don't<00:04:49.240> think<00:04:49.480> they

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
red eyes who knows i don't think they

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:58.279 
red eyes who knows i don't think they
know<00:04:49.750> themselves<00:04:49.990> yet

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.540 

and<00:04:58.889> take<00:04:59.159> some<00:04:59.460> more<00:04:59.669> white<00:05:00.059> just<00:05:00.539> tiny

and take some more white just tiny

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.829 
and take some more white just tiny
they're<00:05:02.550> just<00:05:03.139> sort<00:05:04.139> of<00:05:04.399> shake<00:05:05.399> that<00:05:05.809> into<00:05:06.809> a

00:05:06.829 --> 00:05:06.839 
they're just sort of shake that into a

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:11.149 
they're just sort of shake that into a
teef<00:05:08.089> and<00:05:09.089> we'll<00:05:09.659> stick<00:05:10.289> it<00:05:10.319> last<00:05:10.649> side<00:05:10.919> eyes

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
teef and we'll stick it last side eyes

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:20.749 
teef and we'll stick it last side eyes
mouth<00:05:12.499> so<00:05:13.499> like<00:05:14.039> that<00:05:17.539> and<00:05:18.539> we'll<00:05:18.899> go<00:05:19.199> again<00:05:19.759> on
