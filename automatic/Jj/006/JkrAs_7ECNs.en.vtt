so<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.530> base<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.190> actually<00:00:38.370> a

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
so with this base is it's actually a

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.220 
so with this base is it's actually a
farming<00:00:38.969> base<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.390> if<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.840> guys<00:00:39.930> don't<00:00:40.170> know

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
farming base and if you guys don't know

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.660 
farming base and if you guys don't know
what<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.379> farming<00:00:40.680> base<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.980> pretty<00:00:41.250> much<00:00:41.399> what

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
what a farming base is pretty much what

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.520 
what a farming base is pretty much what
we<00:00:41.700> are<00:00:41.879> doing<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.360> our<00:00:42.570> number<00:00:42.960> one<00:00:43.140> goal<00:00:43.320> is

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
we are doing is our number one goal is

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.380 
we are doing is our number one goal is
to<00:00:43.559> protect<00:00:43.890> resources<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:45.059> don't<00:00:45.239> care

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
to protect resources and we don't care

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.270 
to protect resources and we don't care
about<00:00:45.450> trophies<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.770> means<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.100> Town

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
about trophies so that means the Town

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.830 
about trophies so that means the Town
Hall<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.640> going<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.850> be<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> outside<00:00:48.510> and

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
Hall is going to be on the outside and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.380 
Hall is going to be on the outside and
yeah<00:00:49.710> all<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.280> resources<00:00:50.879> we're<00:00:51.059> gonna<00:00:51.149> try

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
yeah all the resources we're gonna try

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.389 
yeah all the resources we're gonna try
to<00:00:51.449> do<00:00:51.750> our<00:00:51.780> best<00:00:52.230> job<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.500> protect<00:00:52.890> them<00:00:53.219> so

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
to do our best job to protect them so

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.340 
to do our best job to protect them so
pretty<00:00:53.969> much<00:00:54.090> what<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.449> strategy<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:55.079> is

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
pretty much what this strategy is is

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.540 
pretty much what this strategy is is
we're<00:00:55.559> gonna<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.890> four<00:00:56.219> separate

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
we're gonna have four separate

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.340 
we're gonna have four separate
compartments<00:00:57.180> where<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.690> see<00:00:57.899> two<00:00:58.170> of

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
compartments where you can see two of

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.500 
compartments where you can see two of
one<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.890> each<00:00:59.010> storages<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.210> there<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.480> a

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
one of each storages so there is a

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.090 
one of each storages so there is a
golden<00:01:00.960> elixir<00:01:01.140> storage<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.710> one<00:01:01.829> compartment

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
golden elixir storage in one compartment

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.920 
golden elixir storage in one compartment
and<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.520> wizard<00:01:02.640> tower<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.210> then<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.629> go<00:01:03.780> over

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
and a wizard tower and then you go over

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.780 
and a wizard tower and then you go over
it's<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.229> same<00:01:04.439> thing<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.309> each<00:01:05.489> side<00:01:05.760> of

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
it's the same thing it's on each side of

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.760 
it's the same thing it's on each side of
the<00:01:05.970> base<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:06.990> way<00:01:07.110> if<00:01:07.229> someone<00:01:07.409> attacks

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
the base so this way if someone attacks

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.039 
the base so this way if someone attacks
your<00:01:07.950> base<00:01:08.100> if<00:01:08.549> they<00:01:09.000> are<00:01:09.119> successful<00:01:09.750> and

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
your base if they are successful and

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.450 
your base if they are successful and
they<00:01:10.110> managed<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.560> get<00:01:10.680> through<00:01:10.950> when<00:01:11.159> which

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
they managed to get through when which

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.250 
they managed to get through when which
no<00:01:11.729> one<00:01:11.880> has<00:01:12.060> yet<00:01:12.330> when<00:01:12.540> they<00:01:12.630> attack<00:01:12.869> my<00:01:13.049> face

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
no one has yet when they attack my face

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.050 
no one has yet when they attack my face
no<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:13.619> has<00:01:13.770> broken<00:01:13.920> through<00:01:14.220> yet<00:01:14.430> they're

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
no one has broken through yet they're

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.820 
no one has broken through yet they're
probably<00:01:15.420> only<00:01:15.689> gonna<00:01:15.900> take<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:16.409> gold

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
probably only gonna take one gold

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.620 
probably only gonna take one gold
storage<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.340> one<00:01:17.460> elixir<00:01:17.790> storage<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.570> that

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
storage and one elixir storage so that

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.999 
storage and one elixir storage so that
means<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.020> max<00:01:19.290> they're<00:01:19.560> gonna<00:01:19.680> get<00:01:19.830> like

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
means that max they're gonna get like

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.830 
means that max they're gonna get like
40,000<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.850> resources<00:01:21.299> from<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.720> it's

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
40,000 and resources from you so it's

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.660 
40,000 and resources from you so it's
not<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> big<00:01:22.229> deal<00:01:22.409> there's<00:01:22.979> there's<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.490> wizard

towers there to protect the gold storage

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.710 
towers there to protect the gold storage
and<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.159> elixir<00:01:26.369> storages<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.330> take<00:01:27.509> out<00:01:27.600> the

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
to seven trophies but that's no big deal

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.780 
to seven trophies but that's no big deal
because<00:02:18.980> what<00:02:19.160> we're<00:02:19.310> doing<00:02:19.550> when<00:02:19.700> I'm

right so this guy is dropping archers
all<00:02:33.710> around<00:02:33.950> my<00:02:34.040> base<00:02:34.190> I<00:02:34.430> guess<00:02:35.180> he's<00:02:35.330> trying

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
all around my base I guess he's trying

all around my base I guess he's trying
to<00:02:35.600> get<00:02:35.660> 50%<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:36.500> what's<00:02:36.710> great<00:02:36.920> about<00:02:36.950> this

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
to get 50% and what's great about this

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.860 
to get 50% and what's great about this
base<00:02:37.460> is<00:02:37.700> there<00:02:37.850> isn't<00:02:38.180> enough<00:02:38.390> stuff<00:02:38.630> outside

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
base is there isn't enough stuff outside

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.410 
base is there isn't enough stuff outside
for<00:02:39.410> him<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.650> get<00:02:39.710> 50%<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:40.850> it's<00:02:40.970> not<00:02:41.120> really<00:02:41.390> a

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
for him to get 50% so it's not really a

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.640 
for him to get 50% so it's not really a
big<00:02:41.630> deal<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:41.840> he's<00:02:42.110> trying<00:02:42.320> to<00:02:42.380> do<00:02:42.530> this

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
big deal that he's trying to do this

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.980 
big deal that he's trying to do this
right<00:02:42.740> now<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.400> as<00:02:44.330> he<00:02:44.450> drops<00:02:44.660> his<00:02:44.780> clan

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
right now and as he drops his clan

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.390 
right now and as he drops his clan
castle<00:02:45.350> he's<00:02:45.470> gonna<00:02:45.590> try<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:45.830> drop<00:02:46.070> some<00:02:46.250> more

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
castle he's gonna try to drop some more

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.980 
castle he's gonna try to drop some more
things<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:46.760> he's<00:02:46.880> actually<00:02:47.090> wasting<00:02:47.810> his

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
things and he's actually wasting his

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.720 
things and he's actually wasting his
money<00:02:48.050> now<00:02:48.530> cuz<00:02:48.740> he's<00:02:48.890> spending<00:02:49.190> way<00:02:49.460> more

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
money now cuz he's spending way more

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.490 
money now cuz he's spending way more
than<00:02:49.910> what<00:02:50.090> he's<00:02:50.240> getting<00:02:50.390> from<00:02:50.660> my<00:02:50.780> base<00:02:50.960> as

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
than what he's getting from my base as

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.750 
than what he's getting from my base as
well<00:02:51.709> as<00:02:51.800> dropping<00:02:52.100> those<00:02:52.190> lightning<00:02:52.520> spells

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
well as dropping those lightning spells

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.640 
well as dropping those lightning spells
it's<00:02:53.060> not<00:02:53.270> going<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.660> be<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.810> very<00:02:54.170> good<00:02:54.350> rate<00:02:54.500> at

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
it's not going to be a very good rate at

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.410 
it's not going to be a very good rate at
all<00:02:54.740> for<00:02:54.950> him<00:02:55.070> so<00:02:55.850> even<00:02:56.030> though<00:02:56.090> he<00:02:56.209> dropped

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
all for him so even though he dropped

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.449 
all for him so even though he dropped
his<00:02:56.540> army<00:02:56.750> he<00:02:56.840> only<00:02:56.990> got<00:02:57.080> 35%<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.040> he<00:02:58.190> didn't

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
his army he only got 35% and he didn't

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.070 
his army he only got 35% and he didn't
even<00:02:58.550> touch<00:02:58.790> my<00:02:59.000> storages<00:02:59.510> besides<00:02:59.870> the

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
even touch my storages besides the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.870 
even touch my storages besides the
spells<00:03:00.320> that<00:03:00.410> hit<00:03:00.650> him<00:03:00.740> so<00:03:01.190> overall<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:01.700> was<00:03:01.790> an

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
spells that hit him so overall it was an

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.390 
spells that hit him so overall it was an
awesome<00:03:02.180> job<00:03:02.330> by<00:03:02.480> this<00:03:02.540> defense<00:03:03.250> let's<00:03:04.250> go

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
awesome job by this defense let's go

awesome job by this defense let's go
ahead<00:03:04.459> and<00:03:04.640> talk<00:03:04.760> about<00:03:04.790> some<00:03:05.000> other<00:03:05.150> parts<00:03:05.480> of

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
ahead and talk about some other parts of

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.520 
ahead and talk about some other parts of
this<00:03:05.600> defense<00:03:05.990> and<00:03:06.170> why<00:03:06.260> it's<00:03:06.380> a<00:03:06.440> great

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
this defense and why it's a great

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.340 
this defense and why it's a great
defense<00:03:06.770> so<00:03:07.459> in<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.700> center<00:03:07.970> we<00:03:08.660> have<00:03:08.810> one<00:03:09.140> big

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
defense so in the center we have one big

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.600 
defense so in the center we have one big
compartment<00:03:09.890> in<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.070> center<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.490> this<00:03:10.550> is

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
compartment in the center and this is

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.100 
compartment in the center and this is
where<00:03:10.820> our<00:03:10.910> heavy<00:03:11.150> hitters<00:03:11.480> are<00:03:11.630> so<00:03:11.930> for

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
where our heavy hitters are so for

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.390 
where our heavy hitters are so for
things<00:03:12.260> like<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.530> mortars<00:03:12.860> which<00:03:13.040> are<00:03:13.190> in<00:03:13.280> an

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
things like the mortars which are in an

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.160 
things like the mortars which are in an
equal<00:03:13.640> triangle<00:03:14.060> we<00:03:14.570> also<00:03:14.690> have<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.020> to

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
equal triangle we also have the to

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.570 
equal triangle we also have the to
expose<00:03:15.560> which<00:03:15.770> are<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.010> new<00:03:16.160> addition<00:03:16.520> at

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
expose which are the new addition at

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.520 
expose which are the new addition at
townhall<00:03:16.970> 9<00:03:17.000> putting<00:03:17.900> those<00:03:18.050> in<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.320> center

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
townhall 9 putting those in the center

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.020 
townhall 9 putting those in the center
is<00:03:18.739> gonna<00:03:18.920> give<00:03:19.040> us<00:03:19.130> a<00:03:19.220> big<00:03:19.400> advantage<00:03:19.430> that

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
is gonna give us a big advantage that

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.400 
is gonna give us a big advantage that
way<00:03:20.150> they<00:03:20.300> can<00:03:20.420> keep<00:03:20.450> doing<00:03:20.750> damage<00:03:21.230> and

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
way they can keep doing damage and

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.259 
way they can keep doing damage and
they're<00:03:21.560> shielded<00:03:21.830> by<00:03:22.010> everything<00:03:22.370> else<00:03:22.610> so

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
they're shielded by everything else so

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.910 
they're shielded by everything else so
it's<00:03:23.420> really<00:03:23.720> really<00:03:24.200> unlikely<00:03:24.769> that

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
it's really really unlikely that

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.110 
it's really really unlikely that
someone's<00:03:25.250> gonna<00:03:25.340> make<00:03:25.550> it<00:03:25.670> to<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.820> center<00:03:26.090> of

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
someone's gonna make it to the center of

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.180 
someone's gonna make it to the center of
my<00:03:26.209> base<00:03:26.390> also<00:03:27.350> we<00:03:27.530> have<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.739> clan<00:03:27.950> castle

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
my base also we have the clan castle

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.190 
my base also we have the clan castle
which<00:03:28.489> is<00:03:28.519> centralized<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:29.330> in<00:03:29.750> every<00:03:30.019> base

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
which is centralized and in every base

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.360 
which is centralized and in every base
you're<00:03:30.380> gonna<00:03:30.470> want<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:30.769> have<00:03:30.860> a<00:03:30.890> centralized

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
you're gonna want to have a centralized

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.890 
you're gonna want to have a centralized
clan<00:03:31.580> castle<00:03:32.000> that<00:03:32.120> way<00:03:32.269> they<00:03:32.420> can't<00:03:32.660> lure

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
clan castle that way they can't lure

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.170 
clan castle that way they can't lure
them<00:03:33.080> out<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:34.010> destroy<00:03:34.310> your<00:03:34.610> troops<00:03:34.910> away

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
them out and destroy your troops away

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.490 
them out and destroy your troops away
from<00:03:35.360> your<00:03:35.480> base<00:03:35.630> so<00:03:35.840> this<00:03:35.989> works<00:03:36.170> out<00:03:36.290> really

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
from your base so this works out really

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.590 
from your base so this works out really
well<00:03:36.620> as<00:03:37.489> far<00:03:37.730> as<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:37.880> archer<00:03:38.120> king<00:03:38.360> and

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
well as far as the archer king and

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.300 
well as far as the archer king and
Archer<00:03:39.260> Queen<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:39.680> barbarian<00:03:40.100> king

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
Archer Queen and barbarian king

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.220 
Archer Queen and barbarian king
placement<00:03:40.730> you<00:03:41.239> could<00:03:41.540> have<00:03:41.660> placed<00:03:41.959> him<00:03:42.140> a

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
placement you could have placed him a

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.630 
placement you could have placed him a
little<00:03:42.500> bit<00:03:42.590> inside<00:03:42.920> but<00:03:43.130> it<00:03:43.220> doesn't<00:03:43.459> matter

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
little bit inside but it doesn't matter

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.940 
little bit inside but it doesn't matter
too<00:03:43.940> much<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.450> looking<00:03:45.320> at<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.500> seeking<00:03:45.800> air

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
too much and looking at the seeking air

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.470 
too much and looking at the seeking air
mines<00:03:46.130> if<00:03:46.280> you<00:03:46.370> guys<00:03:46.459> want<00:03:46.670> to<00:03:46.730> add<00:03:46.850> these<00:03:47.120> all

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
mines if you guys want to add these all

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.790 
mines if you guys want to add these all
you're<00:03:47.900> gonna<00:03:47.989> have<00:03:48.080> to<00:03:48.230> do<00:03:48.320> is<00:03:48.440> you<00:03:48.530> put<00:03:48.709> him

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
you're gonna have to do is you put him

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.229 
you're gonna have to do is you put him
in<00:03:48.890> these<00:03:48.980> slots<00:03:49.160> right<00:03:49.400> here<00:03:49.459> I<00:03:49.790> didn't<00:03:50.120> put

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
in these slots right here I didn't put

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.130 
in these slots right here I didn't put
them<00:03:50.300> down<00:03:50.480> because<00:03:50.630> they're<00:03:50.840> too<00:03:50.959> expensive

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
them down because they're too expensive

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.530 
them down because they're too expensive
and<00:03:51.530> I<00:03:51.560> don't<00:03:51.620> really<00:03:51.920> care<00:03:52.190> but<00:03:53.150> you<00:03:53.239> can<00:03:53.390> put

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
and I don't really care but you can put

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.790 
and I don't really care but you can put
them<00:03:53.630> in<00:03:53.780> these<00:03:53.870> little<00:03:53.930> crevices<00:03:54.290> that<00:03:54.709> you

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
them in these little crevices that you

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.530 
them in these little crevices that you
see<00:03:54.980> outside<00:03:55.489> of<00:03:55.610> each<00:03:55.760> hidden<00:03:55.940> Tesla<00:03:56.360> and

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
see outside of each hidden Tesla and

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.300 
see outside of each hidden Tesla and
that's<00:03:56.959> gonna<00:03:57.110> work<00:03:57.260> out<00:03:57.380> well<00:03:57.560> for<00:03:57.620> you<00:03:57.860> as
