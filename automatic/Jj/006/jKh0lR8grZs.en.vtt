let's learn about a lock the talk

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.730 
let's learn about a lock the talk
converter<00:00:05.850> what<00:00:06.270> is<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.420> longer<00:00:06.930> token<00:00:07.440> order

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
converter what is a longer token order

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.160 
converter what is a longer token order
and<00:00:07.919> how<00:00:08.250> exactly<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:09.120> locked<00:00:09.480> up<00:00:09.690> top<00:00:09.990> and

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
and how exactly a locked up top and

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.759 
and how exactly a locked up top and
rotor<00:00:10.349> works

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
rotor works

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.430 
rotor works
so<00:00:11.490> before<00:00:12.210> learning<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.719> would<00:00:13.110> have<00:00:13.230> loved

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
so before learning I would have loved

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.410 
so before learning I would have loved
the<00:00:13.650> token<00:00:14.280> order<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.759> should<00:00:14.790> be<00:00:15.120> knowing

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
the token order you should be knowing

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.560 
the token order you should be knowing

video so here we will be talking only I

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.889 
video so here we will be talking only I
got<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.219> locked<00:00:35.550> up<00:00:35.760> talk<00:00:36.390> about<00:00:36.660> how<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
got a locked up talk about how the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.600 
got a locked up talk about how the
locking<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.500> happening<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.070> not<00:00:38.190> about<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
locking is happening and not about the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.459 
locking is happening and not about the
exact<00:00:38.879> walking<00:00:39.239> off<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> talk<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:39.690> water<00:00:40.020> so

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
exact walking off a talk on water so

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.319 
exact walking off a talk on water so
it's<00:00:40.710> important<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.160> see<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.430> particular

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
it's important to see that particular

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.979 
it's important to see that particular
video<00:00:42.480> before<00:00:42.930> viewing<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.440> video<00:00:43.739> okay<00:00:44.550> so

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
video before viewing this video okay so

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.410 
video before viewing this video okay so
as<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.379> all<00:00:46.530> know<00:00:46.739> torque<00:00:47.700> converters<00:00:48.210> are

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
as you all know torque converters are

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.290 
as you all know torque converters are
used<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:49.110> semi-automatic<00:00:49.940> way<00:00:50.940> curves<00:00:51.210> and

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
used in semi-automatic way curves and

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.790 
used in semi-automatic way curves and
automatic<00:00:51.780> vehicles<00:00:52.219> token<00:00:53.219> water<00:00:53.430> has<00:00:53.850> a

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
automatic vehicles token water has a

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.180 
automatic vehicles token water has a
tomboy<00:00:55.850> impeller<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.210> stator<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:59.070> a

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
tomboy impeller and stator and it's a

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.760 
tomboy impeller and stator and it's a
fluid<00:00:59.430> coupling<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:00.629> like<00:01:00.870> an<00:01:00.989> egg<00:01:01.260> or<00:01:01.620> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
fluid coupling so it's like an egg or a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.800 
fluid coupling so it's like an egg or a
closed<00:01:02.100> unit<00:01:02.579> inside<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:03.899> have<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.470> impeller<00:01:05.309> a

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
closed unit inside we have a impeller a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.060 
closed unit inside we have a impeller a
turbine<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.049> stator

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
turbine and stator

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.500 
turbine and stator
so<00:01:08.900> now<00:01:09.900> let's<00:01:10.280> let's<00:01:11.280> say<00:01:11.460> about<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.909> small

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
so now let's let's say about a small

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.330 
so now let's let's say about a small
briefing<00:01:12.960> about<00:01:13.080> how<00:01:13.320> I'm<00:01:13.950> gonna<00:01:14.100> work

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
briefing about how I'm gonna work

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.140 
briefing about how I'm gonna work
exactly

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
exactly

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.060 
exactly
so<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.689> talker<00:01:15.900> motor<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.350> connected<00:01:16.560> towards

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
so the talker motor is connected towards

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.770 
so the talker motor is connected towards
the<00:01:17.250> flywheel<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> ancient<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.479> here<00:01:18.659> we

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
the flywheel of the ancient so here we

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.740 
the flywheel of the ancient so here we
have<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.229> flywheel<00:01:19.740> over<00:01:19.950> here<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.630> this<00:01:21.630> is

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
have the flywheel over here and this is

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.660 
have the flywheel over here and this is
a<00:01:21.780> top<00:01:22.080> one<00:01:22.259> north<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.680> Kaazing<00:01:23.189> it's<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.400> closed

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
a top one north of Kaazing it's a closed

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.240 
a top one north of Kaazing it's a closed
unit<00:01:24.090> we<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.479> fluid<00:01:24.810> inside<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:26.040> this

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
unit we have fluid inside and on this

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.429 
unit we have fluid inside and on this
side<00:01:26.549> opposite<00:01:27.360> towards<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> edge<00:01:28.140> another

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
side opposite towards the edge another

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.490 
side opposite towards the edge another
flagging<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.520> have<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.299> Imperial<00:01:30.869> base<00:01:31.110> it's

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
flagging we have the Imperial base it's

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.039 
flagging we have the Imperial base it's
connected<00:01:32.400> towards<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.420> talk<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.900> what<00:01:34.020> a

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
connected towards the talk and what a

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.109 
connected towards the talk and what a
phasing<00:01:34.409> itself<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.189> as<00:01:35.400> we<00:01:35.579> have<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> float

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
phasing itself so as we have the float

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.450 
phasing itself so as we have the float
is<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.479> as<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.900> token<00:01:37.170> order<00:01:37.500> or<00:01:37.650> gates<00:01:37.829> this

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
is it as a token order or gates this

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.310 
is it as a token order or gates this
droid<00:01:38.790> will<00:01:39.030> be<00:01:39.150> pushed<00:01:39.420> towards<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
droid will be pushed towards the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.639 
droid will be pushed towards the
opposite<00:01:40.650> side<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:42.509> token<00:01:42.990> water<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.530> on

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
opposite side of the token water so on

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.380 
opposite side of the token water so on
the<00:01:43.740> opposite<00:01:44.100> side<00:01:44.340> we<00:01:44.549> have<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.119> target

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the opposite side we have the target

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.899 
the opposite side we have the target
which<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.259> floating<00:01:46.890> inside<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.490> top<00:01:47.700> and

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
which is floating inside the top and

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.240 
which is floating inside the top and
water<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:48.600> connected<00:01:49.170> using<00:01:49.680> an<00:01:49.890> output

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
water we just connected using an output

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.889 
water we just connected using an output
shaft<00:01:50.579> towards<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.329> gearbox

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
shaft towards the gearbox

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.700 
shaft towards the gearbox
so<00:01:52.290> as<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.950> fluid<00:01:53.549> comes<00:01:54.119> at<00:01:54.360> keep<00:01:54.710> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
so as this fluid comes at keep the

because only the fluid force will result

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.530 
because only the fluid force will result
in<00:02:50.840> its<00:02:50.990> rotation<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:51.950> will<00:02:52.790> be<00:02:52.970> slippage

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
in its rotation so the will be slippage

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.230 
in its rotation so the will be slippage
there<00:02:53.810> will<00:02:54.200> be<00:02:54.230> impelling<00:02:54.800> losses<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.490> there

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
there will be impelling losses and there

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.970 
there will be impelling losses and there
will<00:02:56.390> behave<00:02:56.780> generation<00:02:57.440> due<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.650> this

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
will behave generation due to this

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.090 
will behave generation due to this
losses<00:02:58.730> so<00:02:59.420> a<00:02:59.450> lock<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.080> top<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:00.740> water<00:03:00.920> is

turbine<00:03:59.750> over<00:03:59.959> here<00:04:00.170> at<00:04:00.230> this<00:04:00.410> point<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:01.570> the

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
turbine over here at this point and the

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.370 
turbine over here at this point and the
other<00:04:02.720> side<00:04:03.320> of<00:04:04.060> this<00:04:05.060> class<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:06.019> locked<00:04:06.200> up

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
other side of this class the locked up

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.620 
other side of this class the locked up
clutch<00:04:06.709> is<00:04:06.920> connected<00:04:07.400> towards<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.150> casing

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
clutch is connected towards the casing

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.030 
clutch is connected towards the casing
so<00:04:09.440> that<00:04:10.280> means<00:04:10.579> the<00:04:11.060> turbine<00:04:11.570> will<00:04:11.989> rotate<00:04:12.139> in

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
so that means the turbine will rotate in

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.360 
so that means the turbine will rotate in
kasing<00:04:13.400> spear<00:04:13.719> that<00:04:14.719> means<00:04:15.049> the<00:04:15.230> turbine<00:04:15.709> will

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
kasing spear that means the turbine will

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.150 
kasing spear that means the turbine will
rotate<00:04:16.400> in<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.090> speed<00:04:17.389> of<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:18.380> flame<00:04:18.680> on

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
rotate in the speed of the flame on

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.729 
rotate in the speed of the flame on
engine<00:04:19.729> because<00:04:20.359> the<00:04:20.810> casing<00:04:21.229> is<00:04:21.320> directly

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
engine because the casing is directly

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.350 
engine because the casing is directly
connected<00:04:22.039> to<00:04:22.250> watch<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.639> flaming<00:04:23.180> on

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
connected to watch the flaming on

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.330 
connected to watch the flaming on
towards<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.930> engine<00:04:24.110> so<00:04:24.650> that's<00:04:24.830> how<00:04:25.130> a

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
towards the engine so that's how a

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.850 
towards the engine so that's how a
lock-up<00:04:25.699> is<00:04:26.030> happening<00:04:26.840> on<00:04:26.990> locked<00:04:27.440> up<00:04:27.620> top

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
lock-up is happening on locked up top

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.969 
lock-up is happening on locked up top
and<00:04:28.009> water<00:04:28.360> is<00:04:29.360> working<00:04:29.870> so<00:04:30.169> that's<00:04:30.830> the

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
and water is working so that's the

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.189 
and water is working so that's the
basics<00:04:31.370> now<00:04:31.610> that's<00:04:31.850> going<00:04:32.389> to<00:04:32.539> detail<00:04:32.990> how<00:04:33.139> it

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
basics now that's going to detail how it

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.430 
basics now that's going to detail how it
happens<00:04:33.680> so<00:04:34.430> here<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.150> have<00:04:35.389> drawn<00:04:36.139> a<00:04:36.169> cup

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
happens so here I have drawn a cup

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.650 
happens so here I have drawn a cup
section<00:04:36.710> of<00:04:37.009> it<00:04:37.190> this<00:04:37.580> is<00:04:37.759> our<00:04:37.910> output<00:04:38.120> shaft

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
section of it this is our output shaft

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.969 
section of it this is our output shaft
over<00:04:38.990> here<00:04:39.669> so<00:04:40.669> here<00:04:41.449> this<00:04:41.870> is<00:04:41.930> output<00:04:42.500> on<00:04:42.830> the

we have the turbine over here and we

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.129 
we have the turbine over here and we
have<00:05:09.710> a<00:05:09.740> pump<00:05:10.099> impeller<00:05:10.460> over<00:05:10.880> here<00:05:11.090> so<00:05:11.720> what

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
have a pump impeller over here so what

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:13.900 
have a pump impeller over here so what
happens<00:05:12.530> is<00:05:12.710> that<00:05:12.740> a<00:05:12.919> cruising<00:05:13.430> speed<00:05:13.460> or<00:05:13.880> a

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
happens is that a cruising speed or a

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.400 
happens is that a cruising speed or a
very<00:05:14.449> high<00:05:14.720> speed

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
very high speed

gearbox<00:05:56.539> and<00:05:56.750> towards<00:05:57.560> the<00:05:57.650> rear<00:05:57.860> wheels<00:05:58.130> so

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
gearbox and towards the rear wheels so

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.390 
gearbox and towards the rear wheels so
that's<00:05:59.570> how<00:05:59.750> it<00:05:59.900> becomes<00:06:00.199> a<00:06:00.409> mechanical

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
that's how it becomes a mechanical

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.969 
that's how it becomes a mechanical
bonding<00:06:02.150> or<00:06:02.389> a<00:06:02.419> mechanical<00:06:03.050> linkage<00:06:03.260> is<00:06:03.770> been
