00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.859
 Torsen is a trademark of the JTEKT company. 

00:00:06.648 --> 00:00:10.087
 The Torsen differential has many patented components 

00:00:10.087 --> 00:00:15.241
 and is the most unique and ingenious method to provide differential movement 

00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:18.155
 and to overcome the traction difference problem. 

00:00:24.953 --> 00:00:27.983
 The internal components of a Torsen are very different 

00:00:27.983 --> 00:00:30.414
 from that of a conventional differential. 

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:36.133
 At the heart of the system is an assembly of special gears. 

00:00:39.338 --> 00:00:43.123
 Let us see a cross section of these gears at the crossing point. 

00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:49.110
 As we see, one is a normal cylindrical gear 

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:51.528
 and the other is a worm gear. 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.089
 A Torsen works according to the simple principle of the worm and worm gear. 

00:00:59.715 --> 00:01:02.861
 That is, a spinning worm that turns the wheel. 

00:01:04.658 --> 00:01:07.909
 But the spinning wheel cannot turn the worm. 

00:01:10.395 --> 00:01:13.775
 Just keep this principle in mind during this discussion. 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.955
 A pair of such worm wheels are fitted in the housing. 

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:30.653
 The power that the housing receives is fed to the worm wheels. 

00:01:34.877 --> 00:01:38.214
 Each end of the wheels is equipped with a cylindrical gear. 

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:45.179
 Now let's look at different driving scenarios. 

00:01:46.408 --> 00:01:48.251
 When the vehicle moves straight ahead, 

00:01:48.917 --> 00:01:52.113
 the worm wheels will move the worms. 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.317
 Both drive wheels will therefore rotate at the same speed. 

00:01:57.171 --> 00:01:59.996
 Keep in mind here that, in this condition, 

00:01:59.996 --> 00:02:03.126
 the worm wheels do not turn on their own axis. 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.364
 In this state, the mechanism moves as a single unit. 

00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:13.656
 When the vehicle is taking a turn 

00:02:13.772 --> 00:02:17.555
 the left wheel must turn at a higher speed than the right wheel. 

00:02:19.454 --> 00:02:23.275
 This speed difference is perfectly supported in the Torsen. 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.840
 The worm of the faster left axle 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.632
 will turn the corresponding worm wheel on its own axis. 

00:02:36.446 --> 00:02:39.261
 On the other hand, in relation to the housing, 

00:02:39.261 --> 00:02:42.877
 the slow right axis turns in the opposite direction. 

00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:56.269
 The correct worm gear will therefore turn in the opposite direction. 

00:03:05.241 --> 00:03:08.445
 The engaging gears at the ends of the worm gear 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.413
 will ensure that the worm wheels turn at the same speed. 

00:03:14.686 --> 00:03:18.022
 Thus it guarantees a perfect operation of the differential. 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.326
 Now let's figure out how 

00:03:25.326 --> 00:03:29.374
 De Torsen deals with the traction difference of the drive wheels. 

00:03:29.911 --> 00:03:31.383
 As you might know, 

00:03:31.383 --> 00:03:34.665
 when your vehicle encounters a situation as shown, 

00:03:34.665 --> 00:03:37.601
 the smooth wheel starts to spin very quickly 

00:03:38.024 --> 00:03:40.545
 and will consume most of the engine power. 

00:03:42.947 --> 00:03:45.741
 As a result, the vehicle gets stuck. 

00:03:48.387 --> 00:03:51.831
 But if a Torsen differential is used in this case, 

00:03:52.075 --> 00:03:55.366
 as soon as the smooth wheel starts to spin excessively, 

00:03:55.712 --> 00:03:58.619
 the speed change is transferred to the worm gear. 

00:03:59.288 --> 00:04:02.058
 The right-hand worm gear carries the speed change 

00:04:02.058 --> 00:04:03.528
 to the left worm gear 

00:04:03.804 --> 00:04:06.497
 because they are connected via cylindrical gears. 

00:04:07.235 --> 00:04:09.022
 Here comes the cunning part. 

00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:14.363
 The left-hand worm wheel will not turn the corresponding worm 

00:04:14.363 --> 00:04:19.323
 because, as we said, a worm wheel cannot power a worm. 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.571
 As a result, the entire mechanism becomes locked 

00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:27.616
 and the left and right wheels rotate together. 

00:04:28.033 --> 00:04:30.526
 This turns a large amount of torque 

00:04:30.526 --> 00:04:33.050
 transferred to the wheel with the high traction 

00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:37.185
 and the vehicle can therefore overcome the traction difference problem. 

00:04:40.116 --> 00:04:44.045
 To carry the load, two more pairs of worm gear are added. 

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:50.744
 If you are familiar with the other technologies 

00:04:50.744 --> 00:04:53.456
 used to manage the traction difference, 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.564
 maybe you have already noticed a big advantage of Torsen. 

00:04:57.816 --> 00:05:00.424
 While the other technologies the drive wheel temporarily 

00:05:00.424 --> 00:05:03.718
 let slip before blocking 

00:05:03.833 --> 00:05:07.038
 the locking in Torsen happens immediately. 

00:05:07.797 --> 00:05:11.797
 That means, when the vehicle meets a job with a traction difference, 

00:05:12.137 --> 00:05:13.628
 get the wheels locked. 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.174
