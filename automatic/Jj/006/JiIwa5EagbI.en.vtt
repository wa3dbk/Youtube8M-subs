simply<00:02:16.209> there<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.660> kind<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:16.930> deaden<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.260> sound

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
simply there to kind of deaden the sound

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.800 
simply there to kind of deaden the sound
and<00:02:18.400> if<00:02:18.520> you<00:02:18.580> were<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.790> take<00:02:18.940> them<00:02:19.090> off<00:02:19.270> it

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
and if you were to take them off it

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.140 
and if you were to take them off it
would<00:02:19.930> lock<00:02:20.140> up<00:02:20.350> just<00:02:20.590> fine<00:02:20.800> but<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.760> idea<00:02:22.060> of

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
would lock up just fine but the idea of

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.770 
would lock up just fine but the idea of
just<00:02:22.660> having<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.940> know<00:02:25.060> something<00:02:25.450> fairly

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
just having you know something fairly

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.750 
just having you know something fairly
fragile<00:02:26.110> like<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.770> on<00:02:26.950> my<00:02:27.069> knife<00:02:27.250> just

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
fragile like that on my knife just

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.460 
fragile like that on my knife just
turned<00:02:28.000> me<00:02:28.120> off<00:02:28.150> originally<00:02:28.630> I've<00:02:29.080> gotten

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
turned me off originally I've gotten

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.820 
turned me off originally I've gotten
past<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:29.920> now<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:31.209> other<00:02:31.360> thing<00:02:31.660> with<00:02:32.650> this

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
past that now the other thing with this

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.900 
past that now the other thing with this
knife<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.340> it's<00:02:33.850> it's<00:02:34.120> pretty<00:02:34.300> stiff<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.910> I

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
knife is it's it's pretty stiff and I

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.460 
knife is it's it's pretty stiff and I
just<00:02:37.090> mean<00:02:37.300> even<00:02:37.630> if<00:02:37.720> you<00:02:37.840> remove<00:02:38.020> all<00:02:38.380> the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
just mean even if you remove all the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.059 
just mean even if you remove all the
tension<00:02:38.800> on<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.010> lock<00:02:39.190> bar<00:02:39.459> it<00:02:40.239> is<00:02:40.800> not<00:02:41.800> very

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
tension on the lock bar it is not very

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.220 
tension on the lock bar it is not very
smooth<00:02:42.489> just<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.510> pivots<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.900> little<00:02:44.110> too

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
smooth just the pivots a little too

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.650 
smooth just the pivots a little too
tight<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.980> so<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:45.790> went<00:02:46.030> ahead<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.450> ordered

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
tight and so I went ahead and ordered

untraditional lockup we didn't see how

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.630 
untraditional lockup we didn't see how
it's<00:03:42.299> it<00:03:43.299> seems<00:03:43.600> fairly<00:03:43.900> late<00:03:44.350> and<00:03:44.739> you<00:03:45.549> know

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640

it's it seems fairly late and you know
it<00:03:45.910> is<00:03:46.030> actually<00:03:46.480> kind<00:03:46.690> of<00:03:46.870> late<00:03:47.049> if<00:03:47.890> you

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
it is actually kind of late if you

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.470 
it is actually kind of late if you
actually<00:03:48.070> look<00:03:48.430> at<00:03:48.549> where<00:03:48.760> these<00:03:49.060> ceramic

bar tab is you know fairly aggressive
come<00:04:13.060> straight<00:04:13.420> out<00:04:13.450> that's<00:04:14.290> because<00:04:14.500> that

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
come straight out that's because that

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.740 
come straight out that's because that
will<00:04:15.250> allow<00:04:15.519> you<00:04:15.579> to<00:04:15.790> get<00:04:15.940> good<00:04:16.120> purchase<00:04:16.570> on

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
will allow you to get good purchase on

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.339 
will allow you to get good purchase on
that<00:04:16.900> lock<00:04:17.109> bar<00:04:18.359> because<00:04:19.359> it<00:04:19.539> is<00:04:19.570> designed<00:04:20.169> to

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:20.349 
that lock bar because it is designed to

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:22.100 
that lock bar because it is designed to
come<00:04:20.530> in<00:04:20.680> further<00:04:21.039> than<00:04:21.459> what<00:04:21.609> you<00:04:21.760> would

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
come in further than what you would

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.240 
come in further than what you would
typically<00:04:23.110> see

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.070 

and<00:04:25.580> it's<00:04:25.970> kind<00:04:26.330> of<00:04:26.360> a<00:04:26.450> hard<00:04:26.660> thing<00:04:26.690> to<00:04:26.870> get

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
and it's kind of a hard thing to get

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
and it's kind of a hard thing to get
over<00:04:27.350> because<00:04:28.040> you're<00:04:28.490> used<00:04:28.730> to<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:30.680> idea<00:04:30.740> of

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
over because you're used to the idea of

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.940 
over because you're used to the idea of
that<00:04:31.370> lock<00:04:31.610> bar<00:04:31.850> traveling<00:04:32.540> over<00:04:32.950> fairly

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
that lock bar traveling over fairly

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.660 
that lock bar traveling over fairly
quickly<00:04:34.190> in<00:04:34.640> the<00:04:35.300> knife's<00:04:35.840> life<00:04:36.370> so<00:04:37.370> you<00:04:37.430> see

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
quickly in the knife's life so you see

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:38.920 
quickly in the knife's life so you see
something<00:04:37.910> like<00:04:38.000> this<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:38.300> you're<00:04:38.540> like<00:04:38.660> man

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
something like this and you're like man

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.570 
something like this and you're like man
you<00:04:39.200> know<00:04:39.230> I<00:04:39.320> open<00:04:39.770> it<00:04:39.860> a<00:04:39.920> few<00:04:40.100> hundred<00:04:40.130> times

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
you know I open it a few hundred times

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.810 
you know I open it a few hundred times
and<00:04:41.620> it's<00:04:42.620> gonna<00:04:42.740> be<00:04:42.890> touching<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.250> liner<00:04:43.490> and

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
and it's gonna be touching the liner and

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.760 
and it's gonna be touching the liner and
and<00:04:44.120> all<00:04:44.240> this<00:04:44.360> stuff<00:04:44.510> but<00:04:45.320> that's<00:04:45.440> not<00:04:45.680> the

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
and all this stuff but that's not the

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:46.480 
and all this stuff but that's not the
case<00:04:45.920> at<00:04:46.100> all

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
case at all

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.570 
case at all
that's<00:04:47.240> ceramic<00:04:47.870> ball<00:04:48.080> ceramic<00:04:48.620> is<00:04:48.710> very<00:04:48.770> very

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
that's ceramic ball ceramic is very very

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.130 
that's ceramic ball ceramic is very very
hard<00:04:50.080> very<00:04:51.080> hard<00:04:52.330> possibly<00:04:53.330> harder<00:04:53.690> than<00:04:53.840> this

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
hard very hard possibly harder than this

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.710 
hard very hard possibly harder than this
steel<00:04:54.770> itself<00:04:55.220> in<00:04:55.670> fact<00:04:55.910> I<00:04:56.030> think<00:04:56.090> it<00:04:56.330> is<00:04:56.510> it

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
steel itself in fact I think it is it

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.960 
steel itself in fact I think it is it
actually<00:04:56.840> kind<00:04:57.260> of<00:04:57.350> kind<00:04:58.310> of<00:04:58.340> wears<00:04:58.610> a<00:04:58.700> little

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
actually kind of kind of wears a little

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.810 
actually kind of kind of wears a little
channel<00:04:59.650> into<00:05:00.650> that<00:05:00.800> tang<00:05:01.100> right<00:05:01.370> there<00:05:03.820> so

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
channel into that tang right there so

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.930 
channel into that tang right there so
yeah<00:05:05.030> I<00:05:05.060> mean<00:05:05.300> it<00:05:05.830> stays<00:05:06.830> put<00:05:07.100> I've<00:05:07.340> seen

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
yeah I mean it stays put I've seen

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.790 
yeah I mean it stays put I've seen
lumens<00:05:08.720> ons<00:05:08.930> that<00:05:09.110> have<00:05:09.260> been<00:05:09.350> carried<00:05:09.560> for

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
lumens ons that have been carried for

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.610 
lumens ons that have been carried for
two<00:05:09.950> years<00:05:10.370> and<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:11.360> lock-up<00:05:11.780> looks<00:05:12.050> exactly

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
two years and the lock-up looks exactly

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.640 
two years and the lock-up looks exactly
like<00:05:12.890> this<00:05:13.280> but<00:05:14.240> it's<00:05:14.840> taken<00:05:15.140> me<00:05:15.230> these<00:05:15.380> three

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
like this but it's taken me these three

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.680 
like this but it's taken me these three
days<00:05:15.830> to<00:05:16.130> kind<00:05:16.250> of<00:05:16.370> get<00:05:16.550> past<00:05:16.790> those<00:05:17.330> little

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
days to kind of get past those little

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.400 
days to kind of get past those little
things<00:05:17.900> and<00:05:18.500> I<00:05:19.070> have<00:05:19.340> just<00:05:19.610> really<00:05:20.410> really

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
things and I have just really really

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.440 
things and I have just really really
grown<00:05:21.620> to<00:05:21.800> love<00:05:21.920> this<00:05:22.130> knife<00:05:22.340> it's<00:05:23.300> just

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
grown to love this knife it's just

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.730 
grown to love this knife it's just
really<00:05:23.750> really<00:05:23.990> nice<00:05:24.140> and<00:05:24.200> a<00:05:24.440> little<00:05:24.620> bit<00:05:24.710> a

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
really really nice and a little bit a

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.590 
really really nice and a little bit a
lot<00:05:24.920> definitely<00:05:25.640> would<00:05:25.970> recommend<00:05:26.000> picking

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
lot definitely would recommend picking

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.840 
lot definitely would recommend picking
one<00:05:26.720> up<00:05:27.020> like<00:05:27.860> I<00:05:27.980> mentioned<00:05:28.370> just<00:05:28.400> be<00:05:28.640> prepared

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
one up like I mentioned just be prepared

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.780 
one up like I mentioned just be prepared
for<00:05:29.560> some<00:05:30.560> features<00:05:30.919> on<00:05:31.100> it<00:05:31.280> that<00:05:31.310> may<00:05:31.610> be<00:05:31.669> a

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
for some features on it that may be a

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.040 
for some features on it that may be a
little<00:05:32.060> different<00:05:32.300> than<00:05:32.630> what<00:05:32.810> you're<00:05:33.020> used

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
little different than what you're used

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.470 
little different than what you're used
to<00:05:33.410> in<00:05:34.040> typical<00:05:34.520> frame<00:05:34.700> locks<00:05:35.620> but<00:05:36.620> uh<00:05:37.480> yeah

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
to in typical frame locks but uh yeah

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.270 
to in typical frame locks but uh yeah
and<00:05:39.020> that<00:05:39.260> by<00:05:39.410> the<00:05:39.470> way<00:05:39.620> is<00:05:39.770> the<00:05:39.890> reason<00:05:40.040> they

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
and that by the way is the reason they

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.100 
and that by the way is the reason they
put<00:05:40.550> the<00:05:42.580> lock<00:05:43.580> stabilizer<00:05:44.150> on<00:05:44.390> here<00:05:44.750> because

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
put the lock stabilizer on here because

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.780 
put the lock stabilizer on here because
people<00:05:45.440> were<00:05:45.560> complaining<00:05:45.890> about<00:05:46.160> how<00:05:46.430> stiff

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
people were complaining about how stiff

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.870 
people were complaining about how stiff
oh<00:05:47.000> the<00:05:47.240> the<00:05:47.270> lock<00:05:47.750> bars<00:05:47.990> pretty<00:05:48.350> stiff<00:05:48.650> too

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
oh the the lock bars pretty stiff too

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.690 
oh the the lock bars pretty stiff too
and<00:05:49.880> I<00:05:50.450> suspect<00:05:51.050> the<00:05:51.200> reason<00:05:51.350> for<00:05:51.680> that<00:05:51.740> is<00:05:52.280> the

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
and I suspect the reason for that is the

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.530 
and I suspect the reason for that is the
ultra<00:05:53.630> hard<00:05:53.840> surface<00:05:54.350> of<00:05:54.530> the<00:05:55.330> ceramic<00:05:56.330> ball

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
ultra hard surface of the ceramic ball

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.840 
ultra hard surface of the ceramic ball
hitting<00:05:57.260> the<00:05:57.470> ultra<00:05:57.710> hard<00:05:57.860> surface<00:05:58.220> of<00:05:58.460> the

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
hitting the ultra hard surface of the

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.950 
hitting the ultra hard surface of the
steel<00:05:59.740> it<00:06:00.740> can<00:06:00.890> cause<00:06:01.100> slippage<00:06:02.000> you<00:06:02.660> know<00:06:02.780> and

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
steel it can cause slippage you know and

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.360 
steel it can cause slippage you know and
you<00:06:03.050> can<00:06:03.200> actually<00:06:03.500> if<00:06:03.590> you<00:06:03.680> really<00:06:03.950> push<00:06:04.160> on

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
you can actually if you really push on

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.100 
you can actually if you really push on
it<00:06:04.490> you<00:06:04.580> can<00:06:04.730> feel<00:06:04.850> it<00:06:04.910> kind<00:06:05.150> of<00:06:05.210> move<00:06:05.390> and<00:06:05.690> I've

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
it you can feel it kind of move and I've

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.960 
it you can feel it kind of move and I've
seen<00:06:06.320> people<00:06:06.650> do<00:06:06.770> spine<00:06:07.070> whack<00:06:07.280> test<00:06:07.610> this

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
seen people do spine whack test this

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.930 
seen people do spine whack test this
knife<00:06:08.210> will<00:06:08.510> fail<00:06:09.280> fairly<00:06:10.280> well<00:06:10.610> I<00:06:10.640> hate<00:06:10.910> to

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
knife will fail fairly well I hate to

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.909 
knife will fail fairly well I hate to
say<00:06:11.120> fail<00:06:11.360> this<00:06:11.630> this<00:06:11.990> knife<00:06:12.169> will<00:06:12.440> close

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 
say fail this this knife will close

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.760 
say fail this this knife will close
under<00:06:13.340> that<00:06:13.430> kind<00:06:13.610> of<00:06:13.700> abuse<00:06:14.470> fairly<00:06:15.470> early

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
under that kind of abuse fairly early

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.290 
under that kind of abuse fairly early
maybe<00:06:15.980> earlier<00:06:16.370> than<00:06:16.550> some<00:06:16.790> knives<00:06:17.030> and

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
maybe earlier than some knives and

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.690 
maybe earlier than some knives and
that's<00:06:17.990> the<00:06:18.140> reason<00:06:18.410> why<00:06:18.560> because<00:06:18.800> you've<00:06:19.550> got

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
that's the reason why because you've got

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.570 
that's the reason why because you've got
two<00:06:20.380> surfaces<00:06:21.380> that<00:06:21.710> are<00:06:21.770> very<00:06:22.010> hard<00:06:22.370> and

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
two surfaces that are very hard and

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.670 
two surfaces that are very hard and
there's<00:06:23.090> not<00:06:23.330> a<00:06:23.390> ton<00:06:23.750> of<00:06:23.810> actual<00:06:24.290> contact

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
there's not a ton of actual contact

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
there's not a ton of actual contact
space<00:06:25.010> you<00:06:25.880> can<00:06:26.000> actually<00:06:26.150> see<00:06:27.370> that<00:06:28.370> line

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 
space you can actually see that line

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.610 
space you can actually see that line
right<00:06:28.730> there<00:06:29.030> that's<00:06:29.570> all<00:06:29.720> the<00:06:29.810> contact<00:06:30.290> it's

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
right there that's all the contact it's

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.820 
right there that's all the contact it's
making<00:06:31.070> so<00:06:31.790> to<00:06:32.390> circumvent<00:06:32.900> this<00:06:33.080> I<00:06:33.289> suspect

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
making so to circumvent this I suspect

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.020 
making so to circumvent this I suspect
it<00:06:34.340> was<00:06:34.430> just<00:06:34.789> theory<00:06:35.210> here<00:06:35.479> thoughts

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
it was just theory here thoughts

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.030 
it was just theory here thoughts

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:10.930 
I think I prefer this pivot even though

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.660 
I think I prefer this pivot even though
the<00:07:11.110> hassle<00:07:11.560> of<00:07:11.710> the<00:07:11.740> propriety<00:07:13.380> proprietary

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:14.670

proprietary even though there's a hassle
with<00:07:17.920> that<00:07:18.130> slight<00:07:18.520> hassle<00:07:18.880> not<00:07:19.060> a<00:07:19.120> big<00:07:19.300> deal

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 
with that slight hassle not a big deal

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.590

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:24.640 
it's kind of the flagship of this model

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.010 
stabilizer I think it looks cool I like
the<00:07:35.680> circle<00:07:36.100> how<00:07:36.670> it<00:07:36.820> kind<00:07:37.000> of<00:07:37.060> goes<00:07:37.120> in

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:38.020 
the circle how it kind of goes in

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.650 
the circle how it kind of goes in
