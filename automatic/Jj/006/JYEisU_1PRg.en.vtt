00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
around sunset this is actually my canon

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.849 
around sunset this is actually my canon
14<00:00:13.049> millimeter<00:00:13.530> rectilinear<00:00:14.900> 2.8<00:00:15.900> l<00:00:16.139> lens<00:00:16.470> and

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
14 millimeter rectilinear 2.8 l lens and

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.470 
14 millimeter rectilinear 2.8 l lens and
it's<00:00:17.699> extremely<00:00:18.300> wide<00:00:18.690> angle<00:00:19.140> but<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.770> also

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
it's extremely wide angle but it also

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.779 
it's extremely wide angle but it also
fixes<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.930> barrel<00:00:22.230> correction<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:23.550> see

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
fixes the barrel correction you see

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.290 
fixes the barrel correction you see

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
now this flash right here is not

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.810 
now this flash right here is not
transmitting<00:00:46.680> what<00:00:46.829> I've<00:00:46.920> done<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.370> I've

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
transmitting what I've done is I've

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.900 
transmitting what I've done is I've
turned<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.420> into<00:00:49.219> wireless<00:00:50.219> mode<00:00:50.550> as<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
turned this into wireless mode as a

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.029 
turned this into wireless mode as a
transmitter<00:00:51.750> I've<00:00:51.930> got<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> lot<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.379> videos<00:00:52.829> on

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
transmitter I've got a lot of videos on

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.910 
transmitter I've got a lot of videos on
how<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.219> do<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.809> but<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.870> basically<00:00:55.379> don't

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
how to do that but I basically don't

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.220 
how to do that but I basically don't
want<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.789> figure<00:00:57.149> into<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.600> flash

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
want this to figure into the flash

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.650 
want this to figure into the flash
calculation<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.250> want<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.760> have<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.510> control

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
calculation I want to have the control

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.509 
calculation I want to have the control
in<00:01:01.230> my<00:01:01.890> hand<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:03.090> diffuse<00:01:03.660> flash<00:01:04.320> source<00:01:04.680> so

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
in my hand of a diffuse flash source so

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.090 
in my hand of a diffuse flash source so
this<00:01:06.030> was<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.750> only<00:01:06.900> one<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.470> triggered

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
this was the only one that triggered

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.480 
this was the only one that triggered
during<00:01:08.490> those<00:01:08.760> exposures<00:01:09.240> as<00:01:09.659> long<00:01:10.650> as<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.979> you

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
during those exposures as long as I you

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.370 
during those exposures as long as I you
see<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> little<00:01:12.030> red<00:01:12.090> guy<00:01:12.210> blinking<00:01:12.810> as<00:01:12.960> long

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
see the little red guy blinking as long

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.140 
see the little red guy blinking as long
as<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.710> point<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.189> two<00:01:14.400> red<00:01:14.640> guys<00:01:14.880> together

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
as I point the two red guys together

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.330 
as I point the two red guys together
don't<00:01:16.140> need<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> radio<00:01:16.710> slave<00:01:16.979> or<00:01:17.159> anything

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
don't need a radio slave or anything

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.330 
don't need a radio slave or anything
like<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:18.509> one<00:01:18.869> will<00:01:19.229> send<00:01:19.619> off<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> light

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
like that this one will send off a light

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.210 
like that this one will send off a light
but<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.570> won't<00:01:21.840> calculate<00:01:22.140> an<00:01:22.560> exposure<00:01:22.979> but

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
but it won't calculate an exposure but

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.090 
but it won't calculate an exposure but
I'll<00:01:23.310> tell<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.759> guy<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.030> fire<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:25.439> guy<00:01:25.710> has

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
I'll tell this guy to fire this guy has

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.130 
I'll tell this guy to fire this guy has
a<00:01:26.130> light<00:01:26.490> sphere<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.119> which<00:01:27.390> gives<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
a light sphere on it which gives the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.429 
a light sphere on it which gives the
room<00:01:28.409> an<00:01:28.740> entire<00:01:29.369> fill<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:30.329> also<00:01:30.479> sends<00:01:31.229> light

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
room an entire fill but also sends light

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.280 
room an entire fill but also sends light
up<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> ceiling<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:33.450> what<00:01:33.960> I'm<00:01:34.079> going<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
up to the ceiling so what I'm going to

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.160 
up to the ceiling so what I'm going to
do<00:01:34.500> here<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.240> I'm<00:01:36.240> going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> turn<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.840> flash

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
do here is I'm going to turn this flash

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.170 
do here is I'm going to turn this flash
off<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.860> I'm<00:01:37.979> going<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.189> put<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.610> camera<00:01:39.000> on

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
off and I'm going to put the camera on

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.140 
off and I'm going to put the camera on
as<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.530> see<00:01:40.860> here<00:01:41.130> manual<00:01:41.579> mode<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.000> it's

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
as you can see here manual mode so it's

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.310 
as you can see here manual mode so it's
125th<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.200> second<00:01:43.619> at<00:01:43.770> f4<00:01:44.729> 5<00:01:45.000> ISO<00:01:45.689> 200<00:01:46.259> you

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
125th of a second at f4 5 ISO 200 you

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.139 
125th of a second at f4 5 ISO 200 you
can<00:01:46.439> see<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.770> dramatic<00:01:47.340> sunset<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
can see that dramatic sunset in the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.270 
can see that dramatic sunset in the
background<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.229> right<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:49.770> if<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:49.979> speed

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
background the right and so if I speed

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.310 
background the right and so if I speed
up<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.520> shutter<00:01:50.729> speed<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.060> won't<00:01:51.360> see<00:01:51.630> that

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
up the shutter speed I won't see that

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.730 
up the shutter speed I won't see that
much<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.009> background<00:01:53.689> so<00:01:54.689> right<00:01:54.899> here<00:01:55.229> you

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
much of the background so right here you

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.889 
much of the background so right here you
can<00:01:55.920> see<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.460> it's<00:01:56.700> pretty<00:01:57.180> much<00:01:57.390> completely

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
can see that it's pretty much completely

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.440 
can see that it's pretty much completely
dark<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:58.680> that's<00:01:58.829> what<00:01:59.009> we<00:01:59.159> want<00:01:59.399> we<00:01:59.610> want<00:02:00.299> to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
dark but that's what we want we want to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.810 
dark but that's what we want we want to
have<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.869> flash<00:02:01.200> be<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.250> one<00:02:02.399> responsible

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
have the flash be the one responsible

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.359 
have the flash be the one responsible

off and we'll have a good sized brush
let's<00:05:05.390> go<00:05:05.480> a<00:05:05.510> little<00:05:05.660> bit<00:05:05.840> larger<00:05:06.370> too<00:05:07.370> much

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
let's go a little bit larger too much

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:16.330 
let's go a little bit larger too much
oops<00:05:09.040> too<00:05:10.040> much<00:05:13.930> and<00:05:15.070> we're<00:05:16.070> going<00:05:16.220> to<00:05:16.250> make

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
oops too much and we're going to make

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.580 
oops too much and we're going to make
sure<00:05:16.520> that<00:05:16.550> opacity<00:05:17.330> is<00:05:17.450> set<00:05:17.660> to<00:05:17.780> 50%<00:05:18.050> the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
sure that opacity is set to 50% the

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.500 
sure that opacity is set to 50% the
reason<00:05:18.830> we're<00:05:18.950> doing<00:05:19.040> that<00:05:19.220> is<00:05:19.430> we<00:05:20.270> don't<00:05:20.390> want

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
reason we're doing that is we don't want

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.450 
reason we're doing that is we don't want
to<00:05:20.570> reveal<00:05:20.690> 100%<00:05:21.560> of<00:05:21.770> this<00:05:21.980> layer<00:05:22.190> we<00:05:22.370> will

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
to reveal 100% of this layer we will

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.860 
to reveal 100% of this layer we will
know<00:05:22.580> what<00:05:22.760> kind<00:05:22.970> of<00:05:23.030> want<00:05:23.150> it<00:05:23.180> to<00:05:23.240> blend<00:05:23.600> in

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
know what kind of want it to blend in

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.470 
know what kind of want it to blend in
with<00:05:24.080> the<00:05:25.040> background<00:05:25.310> layer<00:05:25.700> let's<00:05:26.240> go<00:05:26.390> ahead

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
with the background layer let's go ahead

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.200 
with the background layer let's go ahead
and<00:05:26.660> start<00:05:26.780> blending<00:05:27.020> in<00:05:27.290> this<00:05:27.440> second<00:05:27.830> layer

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
and start blending in this second layer

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.370 
and start blending in this second layer
we're<00:05:29.210> just<00:05:29.330> gonna<00:05:29.420> click<00:05:29.630> and<00:05:29.660> drag<00:05:29.840> our

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
we're just gonna click and drag our

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.210 
we're just gonna click and drag our
mouse<00:05:30.410> just<00:05:31.040> to<00:05:32.410> kind<00:05:33.410> of<00:05:33.470> fade<00:05:33.710> everything<00:05:34.070> in

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
mouse just to kind of fade everything in

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.240 
mouse just to kind of fade everything in
nice<00:05:34.720> let's<00:05:35.720> see<00:05:35.930> that<00:05:36.140> we're<00:05:36.320> kind<00:05:36.740> of<00:05:36.860> losing

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
nice let's see that we're kind of losing

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.950 
nice let's see that we're kind of losing
the<00:05:37.280> background<00:05:38.120> layer<00:05:38.270> and<00:05:38.480> kind<00:05:38.660> of<00:05:38.750> start

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
the background layer and kind of start

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.010 
the background layer and kind of start
seeing<00:05:39.020> a<00:05:39.380> little<00:05:39.680> bit<00:05:39.830> more<00:05:40.040> of<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:41.020> second

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
seeing a little bit more of the second

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.250 
seeing a little bit more of the second
layer<00:05:42.140> that<00:05:42.170> we<00:05:42.440> just<00:05:42.620> pasted<00:05:43.010> in<00:05:43.220> a<00:05:44.260> little

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
layer that we just pasted in a little

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:53.350 
layer that we just pasted in a little
bit<00:05:45.350> room<00:05:46.870> looking<00:05:47.870> good<00:05:49.000> oops<00:05:51.280> as<00:05:52.280> you<00:05:53.240> can

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
see it kind of got a little bit of

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.990 
see it kind of got a little bit of
Gary's<00:05:55.100> light<00:05:55.250> sphere<00:05:55.490> in<00:05:55.580> this<00:05:55.700> spot<00:05:55.940> so

to black and now everywhere that we
paint<00:06:02.630> we're<00:06:02.900> going<00:06:03.020> to<00:06:03.080> start<00:06:03.290> hiding<00:06:03.800> this

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
paint we're going to start hiding this

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.460 
paint we're going to start hiding this
layer<00:06:05.060> so<00:06:05.480> let's<00:06:05.630> go<00:06:05.750> brush<00:06:06.170> a<00:06:06.200> little<00:06:06.350> bit

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
layer so let's go brush a little bit

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.110 
layer so let's go brush a little bit
smaller<00:06:07.750> and<00:06:08.750> we<00:06:08.960> can<00:06:09.080> just<00:06:09.260> start<00:06:10.120> selecting

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
smaller and we can just start selecting

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.790 
smaller and we can just start selecting
and<00:06:11.300> painting<00:06:11.900> over<00:06:12.020> here<00:06:12.350> just<00:06:12.470> to<00:06:12.590> hide<00:06:12.770> a

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
and painting over here just to hide a

little<00:06:13.040> bit<00:06:13.250> of<00:06:13.370> that<00:06:13.520> there<00:06:14.450> and<00:06:15.460> we'll<00:06:16.460> start

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
little bit of that there and we'll start

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.950 
little bit of that there and we'll start
doing<00:06:16.730> in<00:06:16.970> the<00:06:17.060> second<00:06:17.390> layer<00:06:17.540> we'll<00:06:17.750> select

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
doing in the second layer we'll select

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.060 
doing in the second layer we'll select
this<00:06:18.680> layer<00:06:18.950> layer<00:06:19.760> mask<00:06:20.500> put<00:06:21.500> our<00:06:21.620> brush<00:06:21.830> back
