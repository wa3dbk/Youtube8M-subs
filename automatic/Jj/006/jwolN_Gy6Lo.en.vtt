00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.389
 hi i am andre and this is the 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.469
 kensington keyfolio exact case for the 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.209
 ipad air 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.010
 a case that besides protecting you 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.289
 iPad can also be used to 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.940
 easy to type texts I am 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.960
 I'm curious if I'm just as productive here 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:25.210
 can be with me when on my laptop at the 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.190
 exact portfolio case is just one 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.510
 micro usb cable included to it 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.400
 to charge the keyboard 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.720
 when you first see the case 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.030
 stands out that the case 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.680
 fairly hefty is he is good in the 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.850
 hand and is entirely made of plastic 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.530
 finished 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.600
 use was made of hard ones 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.940
 plastics and a more soft one 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.289
 plastic plastic finish the 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.940
 inside of the case 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.069
 as we are used to from a 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.379
 soft-touch material, which is none 

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:52.870
 will cause scratches if you get the case 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.670
 once opened you will also see there 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.739
 the keyboard what with magnets on the 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.600
 inside of the case so stuck 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.600
 also just to remove is for loose 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.949
 use the keys are slightly smaller 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.750
 than with a normal laptop but that 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.850
 does not take away that you nice and quick on 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.770
 can type all important keys 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.539
 are therefore in the usual place 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.729
 at the top we still find 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:14.649
 different states and the sluts 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.299
 and off button and the right side 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.829
 has a micro usb connection 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.810
 to charge it 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:22.119
 furthermore we also find on the inside 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.259
 still the hard plastic case in which the 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.789
 can be clicked 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.100
 Clicking in is fairly easy 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.350
 but you have to press well 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.600
 In addition, this case is not possible 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.609
 to quickly remove the because 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.710
 it's pretty hard to get out again 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.179
 to get the case you also need so much 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.490
 busy and you have the idea that you 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.590
 the plastic case is going to break it 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.450
 keyfolio you can get the exact keyboard 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.500
 easily connect to your ipad via 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.609
 bluetooth 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.039
 if the keyboard and time are not 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:50.109
 is used, it automatically starts 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.579
 a sleep mode that also covers the battery life 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:53.200
 renewed 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.390
 as said, type on this keyboard 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.649
 easy and everything goes fast 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.960
 An additional advantage is that the lot 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.329
 specific AOS shortcuts 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.130
 allowing you to quickly copy-paste 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.710
 or for example multitasking on the ipad 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.329
 you can use the ipad in different positions 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.700
 and it is also possible 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.470
 to flatten it 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.420
 however, you do need the keyboard 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.980
 to do this 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.500
 when you are done with the case you can 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.690
 easy to close and are the most 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.920
 connections it is easily accessible 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.250
 held together with one 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.250
 magnetic closure 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.360
 with this keyboard case your ipad will be there 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.220
 a good replacement for your laptop 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.410
 you can type on it really fast 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.940
 are handy shortcuts on one 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.580
 small drawback is that it is removed from 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.650
 the ipad air is a bit tricky 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.110
 do you want the kensington keyfolio exactly 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.350
 case with or without 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.660
 backlighting 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.030
 view keyboard or order click 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.060
