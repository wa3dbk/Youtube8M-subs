like some kind of um one off chance that
a<00:00:31.740> isn't<00:00:32.130> butter<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.450> gun<00:00:33.660> was<00:00:33.899> probably

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
a isn't butter so this gun was probably

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.049 
a isn't butter so this gun was probably
one<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.500> guns<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.070> anticipate<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.850> be<00:00:35.880> one

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
using UAV could sing stuff with alterous

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.330 
using UAV could sing stuff with alterous
a<00:01:33.180> spy<00:01:33.420> falling<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.320> ghost<00:01:34.829> makes

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
a spy falling for you and ghost makes

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.830 
a spy falling for you and ghost makes
you<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.549> detective<00:01:35.909> no<00:01:36.299> one<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.570> see<00:01:36.689> you

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
you in detective no one can see you

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.240 
you in detective no one can see you
inspire<00:01:37.140> play<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.560> think<00:01:37.829> it's<00:01:37.950> going<00:01:38.130> to

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
inspire play and I think it's going to

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.460 
inspire play and I think it's going to
be<00:01:38.400> brilliant<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.030> at<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> moment<00:01:39.930> like

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
be brilliant and at the moment like

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.350 
be brilliant and at the moment like
right<00:01:40.500> now<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.159> think<00:01:41.670> they<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.939> spy<00:01:42.119> plane

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
right now I think they have to spy plane

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.670 
right now I think they have to spy plane
off<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:42.570> I'm<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.869> under<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.290> radar<00:01:43.439> they

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
off but I'm just under the radar they

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.010 
off but I'm just under the radar they
have<00:01:43.799> no<00:01:44.009> idea<00:01:44.280> where<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.490> am<00:01:44.630> my<00:01:45.630> voice<00:01:45.840> is

have no idea where I am my voice is

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.690 
have no idea where I am my voice is
cracking<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.470> second<00:01:46.979> time<00:01:47.100> commentary<00:01:47.549> up

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
cracking the second time commentary up

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.219 
cracking the second time commentary up
taking<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.060> drink<00:01:48.210> accelerations<00:01:48.869> give<00:01:49.079> me<00:01:49.170> a

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
taking a drink accelerations give me a

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.310 
taking a drink accelerations give me a
second<00:01:49.560> one<00:01:52.460> yeah<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> spy<00:01:53.880> plane<00:01:54.320> the

second one yeah so the spy plane the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.660 
second one yeah so the spy plane the
enemy<00:01:55.500> spy<00:01:55.680> plane<00:01:55.890> can't<00:01:56.100> see<00:01:56.280> me<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.579> I'm

my teammates and kill them but you know
I<00:02:09.300> fail<00:02:10.110> here<00:02:10.319> with<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.470> recoil<00:02:10.830> because<00:02:11.069> I

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
I fail here with the recoil because I

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.030 
I fail here with the recoil because I
this<00:02:11.730> gun<00:02:11.879> does<00:02:12.030> have<00:02:12.209> recoil<00:02:12.569> but<00:02:13.290> a

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
this gun does have recoil but a

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.589 
this gun does have recoil but a
get<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.340> two<00:02:14.459> shots<00:02:14.700> off<00:02:14.819> straight<00:02:15.090> away<00:02:15.120> and

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
get the two shots off straight away and

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.209 
get the two shots off straight away and
there<00:02:15.959> was<00:02:16.049> no<00:02:16.260> recoil<00:02:16.650> between<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.099> two

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
there was no recoil between the two

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:18.740 
there was no recoil between the two
shots<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:17.730> well<00:02:18.000> there<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.209> little<00:02:18.540> bit<00:02:18.629> but

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
shots and well there is a little bit but

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.050 
shots and well there is a little bit but
not<00:02:18.930> too<00:02:18.959> much<00:02:19.109> and<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:20.459> can<00:02:20.579> pretty<00:02:20.700> much<00:02:20.790> get

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
not too much and you can pretty much get

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.940 
not too much and you can pretty much get
that<00:02:21.209> shot<00:02:21.450> off<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.719> kill<00:02:21.870> them<00:02:22.049> pretty

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
that shot off and kill them pretty

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.500 
that shot off and kill them pretty
easily<00:02:23.010> but<00:02:23.370> you're<00:02:23.670> going<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.879> see<00:02:24.000> the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
easily but you're going to see the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.720 
easily but you're going to see the
immense<00:02:24.750> power<00:02:25.049> of<00:02:25.230> this<00:02:25.349> gun<00:02:25.560> as<00:02:26.099> as<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.609> game

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
immense power of this gun as as the game

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.569 
immense power of this gun as as the game
progresses<00:02:27.060> as<00:02:27.329> there<00:02:27.689> as<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.859> use<00:02:29.069> it<00:02:29.219> more<00:02:29.370> and

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
progresses as there as I use it more and

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.399 
progresses as there as I use it more and
this<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.420> second<00:02:30.780> game<00:02:30.870> i<00:02:30.989> used<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.349> i

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
helicopter so you see i'm using the UAV

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.440 
helicopter so you see i'm using the UAV
care<00:02:41.250> package<00:02:41.579> in<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.819> attack<00:02:42.000> helicopter

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
care package in the attack helicopter

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.349 
care package in the attack helicopter
cos<00:02:42.599> i'm<00:02:43.079> only<00:02:43.260> level<00:02:43.680> six<00:02:44.189> or<00:02:44.400> five<00:02:44.639> here<00:02:45.120> and

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
cos i'm only level six or five here and

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.509 
cos i'm only level six or five here and
I'm<00:02:45.480> like<00:02:45.629> well<00:02:45.840> actually<00:02:46.680> no<00:02:46.920> I'm<00:02:47.040> level<00:02:47.280> 90

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.009 
I'm like well actually no I'm level 90
something<00:02:47.790> because<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.150> just<00:02:48.599> don't<00:02:48.750> watch<00:02:48.870> it

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
something because I just don't watch it

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.319 
something because I just don't watch it
so<00:02:49.109> I<00:02:49.139> think<00:02:49.200> I'm<00:02:49.439> level<00:02:49.680> nine<00:02:50.180> straight<00:02:51.180> away
