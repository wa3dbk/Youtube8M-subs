00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.550

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.430

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.610

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.750
 events this desire to my soul 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.120
 desire to share when you share with 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.730
 something with a man in the end you yourself learned 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.460

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.950
 something you and shares your energy and in 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.260
 you make up for yourself in this way 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.260
 I think that it should be so 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.140
 but not only from someone else but 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.000
 itself something to tell and when you 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.729

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.560

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.490
 desire to engage in organizational 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.040
 activities but as participants always 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.290

 the nearest great constant after 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.970
 question means well many guys are young 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.369
 I do not know older watch your videos 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.979
 online on different resources and want 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.630
 move as much as you can 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.719
 wish these tips 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.929
 i wish everyone to listen to myself this 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.190
 how do you want to move like this 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.830
 just from myself 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.160
 system to make myself perfect but 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.140
 need for this specific base 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.849
 turn on the base communicate more with 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.099
 train with interesting people 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.010
 tracers with your friends more 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.800
 joint training but sometimes be 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:32.000
 alone with a while because 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.790
 which is also very useful but exactly doing 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.430
 emphasis on how you want to move 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.049
 you are not togs popular move up on 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.599
 the moment they upon your wish 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.799
 develop it develop your 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:47.799
 inner self and honestly express yourself
