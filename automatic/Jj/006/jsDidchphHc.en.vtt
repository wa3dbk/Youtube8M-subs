00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
anything you know out of the guitar when

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.920

just sounds fantastic all the way from

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.640 
just sounds fantastic all the way from
base<00:02:19.180> through<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.660> trouble<00:02:20.019> it<00:02:20.110> just<00:02:20.200> is<00:02:20.500> like

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
base through to trouble it just is like

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.350 
base through to trouble it just is like
really<00:02:20.950> really<00:02:21.250> clear<00:02:21.430> as<00:02:21.849> you<00:02:21.970> can<00:02:22.090> hear<00:02:22.269> in

really really clear as you can hear in
that<00:02:22.510> solo<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:24.280> think<00:02:24.879> this<00:02:25.150> guitar<00:02:25.480> is

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
that solo so I think this guitar is

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.960 
that solo so I think this guitar is
primarily<00:02:26.140> meant<00:02:27.069> to<00:02:27.190> be<00:02:27.280> used<00:02:27.430> fingerstyle

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.569 
just judging from the relatively flat
fingerboard<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.430> wide<00:02:30.970> string<00:02:31.299> spacing

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
fingerboard and wide string spacing

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.380 
fingerboard and wide string spacing
