00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.359
 good afternoon here we are again with 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.189
 the second part of the monograph 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.430
 dedicated to the subject 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.830
 fx plus 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.720
 today we will talk about the first way of 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.550
 operation that gives us a 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.759
 difference that is the professional simile 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.320
 this is the one that is activated by default at 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.230
 register the locomotive in the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.210
 central 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.949
 There is also a new 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.160
 most basic operation that is the 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:34.000
 standard but it's about the conventional 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.630
 that all the locomotives have 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.640
 and you do not need to talk about him 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.780
 is the standard that we have mentioned that 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.300
 no need to talk and 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:49.559
 semi-professional that is the one we will talk about 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.420
 however before explaining the way 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.970
 Operating semi professional os 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.829
 we will explain two things that do not use that 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.340
 they must ink us and we think they are 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.340
 Interesting 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.150
 behind 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.520
 the first is that you need the version 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:11.180
 3.0 of the central office software for 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.400
 to enjoy the mx plus despite 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.720
 that in the manual of the locomotive indicates 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.890
 which is version 2.5 the necessary 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:26.260
 version 2.5 has never come into existence 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.260
 going merkin directly to the 3.0 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.020
 the second thing that we wanted you 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.020
 comment is what 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.330
 now the palette of locomotives 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.409
 available is seen by pressing the button 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.929
 the locomotive 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.229
 It has some icons that indicate us 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:48.469
 what type of decoder it has installed every 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.469
 locomotive 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.530
 here you see the locomotives with the m 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.770
 Red color 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.390
 these are locomotives with the mx system 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.090
 the locomotives that do not have any 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.320
 symbol are locomotives with the system 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.450
 digital of normal motorola merklin and 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.450
 the first locomotive that has a 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.700
 different symbol is the one that has the mf x 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.700
 plus here with more 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.660
 which is why we 're going to do the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.570
 demonstration 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.270
 now let's explain the semi mode 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:29.400
 professional we make sure you're 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.400
 activated we go back to the tool 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.959
 the profession my perfect professional 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.060
 we check that we have levels of 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.069
 enough fuel to start 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.800
 the game we have here 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:48.140
 We have 700 78 liters 56 kilos of sand 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.740
 very well 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.740
 behind 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:58.660
 we activated the lights was locomotive 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.660
 now 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.160
 we activate the sound 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.480
 of sand and has decreased to forty 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.680
 and one hundred kilograms and the level of 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.989
 fuel is at 444 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.209
 we will always start it by spending something 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.430
 of sand since during the game 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.760
 will keep but against the fuel 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.110
 will go down already we have 321 liters 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.360
 goes down during the game 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.460
 now when we see the indicators 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.280
 get yellow but it just happened 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:03.110
 with diesel means that this 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.110
 fuel is in reserve 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.090
 to download it in a pretty way 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.780
 accelerated because we have a factor 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:15.590
 quite elevated and at this moment 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.130
 the locomotive has just stopped 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.130
 let's do it 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.600
 of spent fuel being colored 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.600
 Red 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.069
 and then the locomotive will maintain 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.750
 this march emergency until 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:42.670
 let's refuel 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.680
 the particularity of this game mode 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.440
 what we have now is that you can 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.840
 spare at will and where and when 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.970
 is wanted even in motion that is 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.850
 with the locomotive running now to 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.139
 this emergency speed we are going to 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.009
 refuel 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:03.069
 constant 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:03.069
 and we are going to refuel diesel fuel 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.770
 we have let's say fill the deposit 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:14.439
 liters 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:16.119
 and here is what I was saying before 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:18.069
 when locomotive has entered into reserve 

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:19.990
 that we have the consumption factors 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:23.449
 we have a very consumer tractor 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:27.499
 high diesel 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:30.229
 to be able to make the purpose 

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:32.779
 will empty at a certain speed and power 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.830
 is to prove what happened now is what 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:35.830
 let down 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.910
 and the sand factor when we're not going 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.700
 to go down 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.700
 12 8 we will leave you in 7 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.620
 we activate it 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.510
 we stop the locomotive and now to 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.850
 tear 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.460
 you will see how the indicator of the 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.449
 sand 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.449
 we must fix 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:07.020
 I have got 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.060
 the level of progress that we have 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.060
 requested to see extra low 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.450
 Y 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.520
 the long level and how style will go 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.889
 down to 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.160
 the same happens in cities between reserves 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:25.880
 and could come to a halt if not 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.460
 we report building 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.350
 very well 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.930
 now we are finished with our 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.180
 second book to stay 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:36.669
 with the next one we will talk to you 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.370
 of the two superior game modes the 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:41.820
 professional and the specialist until the 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.820
 next
