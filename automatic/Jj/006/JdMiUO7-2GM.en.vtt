think the only complicated process in

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.250 
think the only complicated process in
this<00:00:25.019> whole<00:00:25.289> procedure<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:27.720> hollandaise

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
this whole procedure is the hollandaise

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.140 
this whole procedure is the hollandaise
sauce<00:00:28.289> which<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.820> little<00:00:29.939> difficult

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
sauce which is a it's a little difficult

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.910 
sauce which is a it's a little difficult
because<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.599> have<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.779> emulsify<00:00:31.140> two<00:00:31.439> fats

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920
