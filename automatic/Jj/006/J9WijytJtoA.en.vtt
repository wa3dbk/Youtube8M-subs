00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
missed we get delay vectors we talk

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.030 
missed we get delay vectors we talk
about<00:03:08.360> it<00:03:08.630> we<00:03:08.720> brief<00:03:08.990> the<00:03:09.170> localizer<00:03:09.590> approach

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
about it we brief the localizer approach

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.590 
about it we brief the localizer approach
and<00:03:10.250> we<00:03:10.310> come<00:03:10.490> back<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:10.880> again<00:03:10.970> we<00:03:11.270> don't<00:03:11.420> try

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
and we come back and again we don't try

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.840 
and we come back and again we don't try
to<00:03:11.660> convert<00:03:12.020> this<00:03:12.560> midstream<00:03:13.160> into<00:03:13.820> a

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
to convert this midstream into a

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.250 
to convert this midstream into a
localizer<00:03:14.360> approach<00:03:15.970> so<00:03:16.970> we<00:03:17.480> are<00:03:17.810> clear<00:03:18.050> about

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
localizer approach so we are clear about

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.630 
localizer approach so we are clear about
which<00:03:18.410> approach<00:03:18.740> we're<00:03:18.920> doing<00:03:19.190> even<00:03:19.310> if<00:03:19.520> the

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
which approach we're doing even if the

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.140 
which approach we're doing even if the

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
plate encompasses multiple approaches

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.690 
plate encompasses multiple approaches
another<00:03:23.150> thing<00:03:23.450> that<00:03:23.720> I<00:03:24.500> mentioned<00:03:25.100> was<00:03:25.550> the

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
another thing that I mentioned was the

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.280 
another thing that I mentioned was the
touchdown<00:03:26.060> zone<00:03:26.270> elevation<00:03:26.840> that's<00:03:26.990> only

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
touchdown zone elevation that's only

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.280 
touchdown zone elevation that's only
important<00:03:27.800> if<00:03:28.640> we<00:03:29.450> go<00:03:29.570> all<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.870> way<00:03:29.900> down<00:03:30.140> to

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
important if we go all the way down to

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.780 
important if we go all the way down to
decision<00:03:30.710> height<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.130> can't<00:03:31.370> see<00:03:31.520> the<00:03:31.640> runway

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
decision height and can't see the runway

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.460 
decision height and can't see the runway
but<00:03:32.300> we<00:03:32.390> can't<00:03:32.630> see<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.930> approach<00:03:33.200> lighting

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
but we can't see the approach lighting

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.340 
but we can't see the approach lighting
system<00:03:33.950> so<00:03:34.670> unless<00:03:35.570> that<00:03:35.720> were<00:03:35.810> really<00:03:36.170> low

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
system so unless that were really low

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.650 
system so unless that were really low
day<00:03:36.620> I<00:03:36.680> might<00:03:37.010> not<00:03:37.160> mention<00:03:37.490> that<00:03:37.640> at<00:03:37.760> all<00:03:38.350> I

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
day I might not mention that at all I

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.850 
day I might not mention that at all I
talked<00:03:41.660> about<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:43.930> missed<00:03:44.930> approach<00:03:45.050> after

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
talked about the missed approach after

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.590 
talked about the missed approach after
talking<00:03:46.070> about<00:03:46.220> decision<00:03:46.850> height<00:03:47.030> so<00:03:47.300> the

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
talking about decision height so the

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.300 
talking about decision height so the
briefing<00:03:48.050> follows<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:48.590> sequence<00:03:48.980> that<00:03:49.190> we'd

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
briefing follows the sequence that we'd

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.880 
briefing follows the sequence that we'd
actually<00:03:49.700> fly<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:51.610> I<00:03:53.620> mentioned<00:03:54.620> that<00:03:54.680> will

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
actually fly and I mentioned that will

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.980 
actually fly and I mentioned that will
be<00:03:55.100> a<00:03:55.130> parallel<00:03:55.610> entry<00:03:55.940> into<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.240> hold<00:03:56.480> so

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
be a parallel entry into the hold so

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.300 
be a parallel entry into the hold so
we're<00:03:57.320> not<00:03:57.380> going<00:03:57.530> to<00:03:57.590> get<00:03:57.740> to<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:57.950> hold<00:03:58.160> and

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
we're not going to get to the hold and

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.449 
we're not going to get to the hold and
start<00:03:58.700> arguing<00:03:59.240> amongst<00:03:59.480> ourselves<00:03:59.690> or<00:04:00.650> if

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
start arguing amongst ourselves or if

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.550

with a co-pilot it's particularly

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.090 
with a co-pilot it's particularly

minimum sector altitude but because
we're<00:04:54.590> getting<00:04:54.830> radar<00:04:55.130> vectors<00:04:55.520> in<00:04:56.150> a<00:04:56.389> fairly

flat region of the country I didn't
think<00:04:59.690> it<00:04:59.840> was<00:04:59.930> pertinent<00:05:00.550> so<00:05:02.050> that's<00:05:03.050> the<00:05:03.229> ILS

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
think it was pertinent so that's the ILS
