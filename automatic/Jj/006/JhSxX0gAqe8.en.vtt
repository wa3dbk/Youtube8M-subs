00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
the way over his head so you can

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.880 
the way over his head so you can
actually<00:03:58.510> just<00:03:58.690> kind<00:03:59.260> of<00:03:59.320> pull<00:03:59.560> that<00:03:59.709> right

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.229 
off and it pulls off of his head just
like<00:04:02.260> that<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:02.890> then<00:04:03.400> I<00:04:03.670> don't<00:04:04.030> know<00:04:04.090> if<00:04:04.150> you

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
like that and then I don't know if you

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.449 
like that and then I don't know if you
can<00:04:04.390> get<00:04:04.570> kind<00:04:04.840> of<00:04:04.959> see<00:04:05.590> in<00:04:05.830> there<00:04:06.100> but<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.430> can

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
can get kind of see in there but you can

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.430 
can get kind of see in there but you can
see<00:04:07.239> that<00:04:07.390> there<00:04:07.540> are<00:04:07.660> just<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:07.989> small<00:04:08.290> little

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
see that there are just the small little

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.110 
see that there are just the small little
holes<00:04:08.770> right<00:04:09.160> there<00:04:09.220> on<00:04:09.459> either<00:04:09.610> side<00:04:09.910> of<00:04:09.940> his

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
holes right there on either side of his

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.430 
holes right there on either side of his
head<00:04:10.330> so<00:04:10.600> then<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:10.840> can<00:04:10.959> just<00:04:11.140> take<00:04:11.320> these

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
head so then you can just take these

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.310 
head so then you can just take these
glasses<00:04:12.100> they<00:04:12.700> do<00:04:12.760> just<00:04:13.150> fit<00:04:13.330> right<00:04:13.690> over<00:04:13.750> his

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.729 
glasses they do just fit right over his
face<00:04:14.770> like<00:04:15.190> that<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:16.049> they<00:04:17.049> just<00:04:17.260> plug<00:04:17.470> into

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
face like that and they just plug into

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.620 
face like that and they just plug into
the<00:04:17.919> holes<00:04:18.100> on<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.340> side<00:04:18.520> of<00:04:18.549> his<00:04:18.760> head<00:04:18.970> so

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
the holes on the side of his head so

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
the head but they work well enough to

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.700

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
little something extra other than what

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.800 
little something extra other than what
he's<00:05:27.070> got<00:05:27.250> here<00:05:30.240> but<00:05:31.240> there<00:05:31.390> you<00:05:31.450> go<00:05:31.510> guys

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
there's a look at Stan door I know

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.110 
there's a look at Stan door I know
Stanley<00:05:35.620> had<00:05:35.860> nothing<00:05:36.310> to<00:05:36.400> do<00:05:36.490> with<00:05:36.520> mashes<00:05:37.000> of

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
Stanley had nothing to do with mashes of

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.540 
Stanley had nothing to do with mashes of
the<00:05:37.210> universe<00:05:37.570> so<00:05:38.170> it<00:05:38.350> is<00:05:38.590> a<00:05:38.650> bit<00:05:39.070> odd<00:05:39.220> to<00:05:39.400> see

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
the universe so it is a bit odd to see

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.000 
the universe so it is a bit odd to see
him<00:05:39.580> make<00:05:39.880> a<00:05:39.910> cameo<00:05:40.360> in<00:05:40.420> this<00:05:40.660> line<00:05:40.930> but<00:05:41.740> in<00:05:41.890> my

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
him make a cameo in this line but in my

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.650 
him make a cameo in this line but in my
opinion<00:05:42.130> he<00:05:42.460> falls<00:05:42.880> into<00:05:43.090> the<00:05:43.240> same<00:05:43.420> category

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
opinion he falls into the same category

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.260 
opinion he falls into the same category
as<00:05:43.990> figures<00:05:44.380> like<00:05:44.560> Moe<00:05:44.800> lar<00:05:45.070> he's<00:05:45.700> just<00:05:45.940> a<00:05:46.030> fun

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
as figures like Moe lar he's just a fun

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.730 
as figures like Moe lar he's just a fun
little<00:05:46.300> extra<00:05:46.870> that<00:05:47.050> you<00:05:47.200> shouldn't<00:05:47.590> feel

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
little extra that you shouldn't feel

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.710 
little extra that you shouldn't feel
obligated<00:05:47.980> to<00:05:48.400> get<00:05:48.580> if<00:05:48.790> it's<00:05:49.210> just<00:05:49.450> not<00:05:49.570> your

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
obligated to get if it's just not your

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.500 
obligated to get if it's just not your
thing<00:05:52.680> but<00:05:53.680> even<00:05:53.800> still<00:05:54.100> it's<00:05:54.910> a<00:05:55.060> really<00:05:55.330> nice

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
thing but even still it's a really nice

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.870 
thing but even still it's a really nice
action<00:05:55.780> figure<00:05:56.230> I<00:05:56.410> really<00:05:57.160> do<00:05:57.340> like<00:05:57.490> the<00:05:57.670> cool

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
action figure I really do like the cool

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.970 
action figure I really do like the cool
cosmic<00:05:58.450> looking<00:05:58.720> armor<00:05:58.990> he's<00:05:59.140> wearing<00:05:59.470> the

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
cosmic looking armor he's wearing the

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.680 
cosmic looking armor he's wearing the
glitter<00:06:00.250> speckles<00:06:00.730> make<00:06:00.910> it<00:06:01.060> really<00:06:01.450> stand

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
glitter speckles make it really stand

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.570 
glitter speckles make it really stand
