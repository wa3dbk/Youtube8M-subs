really good manual shift I have to admit
but<00:02:08.530> Volkswagen<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:09.649> now<00:02:09.740> these<00:02:09.950> DSG<00:02:10.670> gearbox

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
but Volkswagen and now these DSG gearbox

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.720 
but Volkswagen and now these DSG gearbox
ease<00:02:11.330> are<00:02:11.510> just<00:02:11.900> fantastic<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:13.070> have<00:02:13.430> to

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
ease are just fantastic and I have to

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.430 
ease are just fantastic and I have to
say<00:02:13.910> I've<00:02:14.150> really<00:02:14.450> loved<00:02:14.720> to<00:02:14.870> drive<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.230> car

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.720 
say I've really loved to drive the car
with<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.800> transmission<00:02:16.130> I<00:02:16.370> think<00:02:16.550> it<00:02:16.640> would

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
with that transmission I think it would

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.430 
with that transmission I think it would
pull<00:02:16.940> an<00:02:17.030> extra<00:02:17.420> five<00:02:17.660> ten<00:02:17.989> percent<00:02:18.350> of

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
pull an extra five ten percent of

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.820 
pull an extra five ten percent of
enjoyment<00:02:18.770> from<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:20.600> would<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:21.320> say<00:02:21.590> have

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
enjoyment from it so would I say have

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:31.450 
enjoyment from it so would I say have
the<00:02:21.920> DSG<00:02:22.220> yes<00:02:23.150> old

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.600 

so<00:02:32.460> has<00:02:32.700> LD<00:02:33.240> done<00:02:33.540> enough<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:34.770> make<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.100> TT

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
so has LD done enough to make the TT

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.420 
so has LD done enough to make the TT

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
UK it could be very useful indeed you

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.630 
UK it could be very useful indeed you
wonder<00:03:37.620> whether<00:03:37.709> how<00:03:37.890> D<00:03:38.070> actually<00:03:38.370> booked

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
wonder whether how D actually booked

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.100 
wonder whether how D actually booked
this<00:03:38.910> weather<00:03:39.209> because<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.720> moment<00:03:40.050> it

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
this weather because the moment it

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.740 
this weather because the moment it
starts<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.620> rain<00:03:41.190> hard<00:03:41.640> out<00:03:42.060> east<00:03:42.420> suddenly

make<00:03:42.930> lots<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.350> sense<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.950> amount<00:03:44.519> of

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
make lots of sense the amount of

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.310 
make lots of sense the amount of

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
a half back in the day so this has got

to be just under five seconds I would

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:57.570 
to be just under five seconds I would
have<00:04:48.290> thought<00:04:48.380> in<00:04:48.740> real<00:04:49.100> money

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.920 

it's<00:04:58.580> an<00:04:58.700> interesting<00:04:58.970> engine<00:04:59.480> I<00:04:59.570> think<00:04:59.600> it's

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
it's an interesting engine I think it's

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.020 
it's an interesting engine I think it's
actually<00:05:00.170> very<00:05:00.560> successful<00:05:00.770> because<00:05:01.430> it

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
actually very successful because it

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.990 
actually very successful because it
merges<00:05:02.630> that<00:05:03.170> balance<00:05:03.560> between<00:05:03.680> great<00:05:04.310> boost

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
merges that balance between great boost

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.250 
merges that balance between great boost
in<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.300> mid-range<00:05:05.570> from<00:05:05.810> a<00:05:05.870> turbocharged

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
in the mid-range from a turbocharged

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.600 
in the mid-range from a turbocharged
engine<00:05:06.320> but<00:05:06.590> it<00:05:06.680> has<00:05:06.830> got<00:05:07.010> an<00:05:07.070> appetite<00:05:07.400> for

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
engine but it has got an appetite for

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.310 
engine but it has got an appetite for
revs<00:05:07.970> so<00:05:08.180> you<00:05:08.240> can<00:05:08.420> rev<00:05:08.570> it<00:05:08.690> right<00:05:08.870> out<00:05:09.080> it's

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
revs so you can rev it right out it's

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.070 
revs so you can rev it right out it's
worth<00:05:09.530> taking<00:05:09.800> it<00:05:10.130> out<00:05:10.490> to<00:05:10.790> 7000<00:05:11.420> rpm<00:05:11.810> it<00:05:11.930> does

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
worth taking it out to 7000 rpm it does

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.500 
worth taking it out to 7000 rpm it does
reward<00:05:12.470> that<00:05:12.710> but<00:05:13.400> loads<00:05:13.910> and<00:05:14.180> loads<00:05:14.210> of

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
reward that but loads and loads of

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.980 
reward that but loads and loads of
mid-range<00:05:14.750> it's<00:05:15.440> got<00:05:15.740> what<00:05:16.160> two<00:05:16.460> hundred<00:05:16.850> and

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
mid-range it's got what two hundred and

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.240 
mid-range it's got what two hundred and
sixty<00:05:17.990> yards<00:05:18.110> for<00:05:18.710> the<00:05:18.740> torque<00:05:19.040> which<00:05:19.220> is

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
sixty yards for the torque which is

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
sixty yards for the torque which is
pretty<00:05:19.550> impressive

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
pretty impressive

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.140

it's pretty well managed here the T T's
always<00:05:45.020> felt<00:05:45.320> like<00:05:45.440> a<00:05:45.500> well<00:05:45.740> balanced<00:05:46.100> package

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310

to<00:05:46.580> me<00:05:46.700> not<00:05:47.000> quite<00:05:47.180> so<00:05:47.420> nose-heavy<00:05:47.810> is<00:05:48.050> maybe
