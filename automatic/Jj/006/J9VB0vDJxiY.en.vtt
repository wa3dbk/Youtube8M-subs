let's<00:01:45.020> keep<00:01:45.170> moving<00:01:45.230> the<00:01:45.920> training<00:01:46.280> was

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
let's keep moving the training was

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.890 
let's keep moving the training was
intense<00:01:46.790> I<00:01:46.940> mean<00:01:47.090> by<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.270> time<00:01:47.420> you<00:01:47.570> finished

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
intense I mean by the time you finished

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.450 
intense I mean by the time you finished
the<00:01:47.990> training<00:01:48.260> you<00:01:48.650> felt<00:01:48.920> like<00:01:49.010> you'd<00:01:49.220> shot<00:01:49.400> a

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
the training you felt like you'd shot a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.830 
the training you felt like you'd shot a
big<00:01:49.670> portion<00:01:49.910> of<00:01:50.120> the<00:01:50.210> movie<00:01:50.450> but<00:01:50.570> we'd<00:01:50.720> never

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
big portion of the movie but we'd never

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.390 
big portion of the movie but we'd never
roll<00:01:51.080> cameras

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
roll cameras

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.430 
roll cameras
that<00:01:52.880> was<00:01:53.060> great<00:01:53.420> to<00:01:53.660> kind<00:01:54.080> of<00:01:54.170> get<00:01:54.320> to<00:01:54.410> see

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
that was great to kind of get to see

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.950 
that was great to kind of get to see
that<00:01:54.800> how<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.190> move<00:01:55.520> in<00:01:55.670> formation<00:01:55.960> didn't

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
that how to move in formation didn't

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.170 
that how to move in formation didn't
even<00:01:57.080> know<00:01:57.260> the<00:01:57.410> names<00:01:57.710> of<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.250> weapons<00:01:58.640> when

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
even know the names of the weapons when

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.300 
even know the names of the weapons when
we<00:01:59.270> started<00:01:59.720> by<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.440> end<00:02:00.680> we're<00:02:00.890> doing<00:02:01.160> you

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
we started by the end we're doing you

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.900 
we started by the end we're doing you
know<00:02:01.340> blind<00:02:02.120> mag<00:02:02.360> changes<00:02:03.760> I'm<00:02:04.760> actually

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
know blind mag changes I'm actually

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.850 
know blind mag changes I'm actually
really<00:02:05.240> surprised<00:02:05.720> how<00:02:06.020> much<00:02:06.200> they<00:02:06.380> picked<00:02:06.650> up

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
really surprised how much they picked up

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.980 
really surprised how much they picked up
I<00:02:07.190> think<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.850> lot<00:02:08.000> of<00:02:08.030> it's<00:02:08.300> due<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.810> their

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
I think a lot of it's due to their

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.260 
I think a lot of it's due to their
