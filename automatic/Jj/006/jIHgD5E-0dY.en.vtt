00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
okay our next maneuver here is going to

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.289 
okay our next maneuver here is going to
be<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.589> tick-tock<00:00:05.009> first<00:00:05.790> we're<00:00:06.000> going<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.210> do

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
be the tick-tock first we're going to do

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.620 
be the tick-tock first we're going to do
a<00:00:06.330> basic<00:00:06.569> elevator<00:00:07.259> tick-tock<00:00:07.740> right<00:00:08.010> now

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:08.630 
a basic elevator tick-tock right now

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.970 
a basic elevator tick-tock right now
here<00:00:09.630> we<00:00:09.750> go<00:00:09.900> we'll<00:00:10.050> go<00:00:10.170> ahead<00:00:10.230> this<00:00:10.559> maneuver

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
here we go we'll go ahead this maneuver

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.280 
here we go we'll go ahead this maneuver
is<00:00:11.099> gonna<00:00:11.599> really<00:00:12.599> consist<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.110> our

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
is gonna really consist of our

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.110 
is gonna really consist of our
collective<00:00:13.860> management<00:00:14.460> also<00:00:14.700> as<00:00:15.030> our

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
collective management also as our

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.970 
collective management also as our
psychic<00:00:15.509> management<00:00:16.020> we<00:00:16.560> don't<00:00:16.710> want<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.890> be

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
psychic management we don't want to be

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.640 
psychic management we don't want to be
stick<00:00:17.250> banging<00:00:17.609> during<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:17.880> we<00:00:18.029> do<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.359> so

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
stick banging during this we do this so

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.870 
stick banging during this we do this so
we're<00:00:19.650> going<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.920> give<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.189> shot<00:00:20.400> we'll<00:00:20.730> see

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
we're going to give it a shot we'll see

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.470 
we're going to give it a shot we'll see
what<00:00:21.000> happens<00:00:21.330> there<00:00:21.539> we<00:00:21.930> go<00:00:26.210> okay<00:00:27.210> what<00:00:27.359> we're

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
what happens there we go okay what we're

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.970 
what happens there we go okay what we're
doing<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.840> using<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.199> collective<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.740> stop

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
doing is using the collective to stop

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.759 
doing is using the collective to stop
the<00:00:29.160> helicopter<00:00:29.849> but<00:00:30.810> use<00:00:30.990> an<00:00:31.140> elevator<00:00:31.439> to

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
the helicopter but use an elevator to

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.799 
the helicopter but use an elevator to
get<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.980> proper<00:00:32.309> angle<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.270> we<00:00:33.660> get

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
get the proper angle so that we get

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.240 
get the proper angle so that we get
enough<00:00:34.020> thrust<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.469> keep<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.710> helicopter<00:00:35.160> in

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
enough thrust to keep the helicopter in

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.270 
enough thrust to keep the helicopter in
the<00:00:35.309> air<00:00:35.370> as<00:00:36.200> we<00:00:37.200> can<00:00:37.350> see<00:00:37.530> here<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.040> very

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
the air as we can see here it's a very

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.760 
the air as we can see here it's a very
smooth<00:00:38.670> maneuver<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:40.050> don't<00:00:40.230> want<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.469> jerk

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
smooth maneuver we don't want to jerk

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.950 
smooth maneuver we don't want to jerk
anything<00:00:41.070> otherwise<00:00:41.579> I'll<00:00:41.820> really<00:00:42.390> kill<00:00:42.570> our

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
anything otherwise I'll really kill our

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.529 
anything otherwise I'll really kill our
head<00:00:43.140> speed<00:00:43.670> it<00:00:44.670> takes<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.940> lot<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.090> power<00:00:45.300> to

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
head speed it takes a lot of power to

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.940 
head speed it takes a lot of power to
get<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.690> back<00:00:45.899> we're<00:00:46.200> gonna<00:00:46.289> continue<00:00:46.590> this

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
get it back we're gonna continue this

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.090 
get it back we're gonna continue this
maneuver<00:00:48.200> and<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.320> basically<00:00:49.770> there

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
maneuver and that basically there

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.689 
maneuver and that basically there
consists<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.730> our<00:00:50.910> tick-tock<00:00:51.840> there<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:53.399> next

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
consists of our tick-tock there the next

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.260 
consists of our tick-tock there the next
maneuver<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:56.430> next<00:00:56.670> maneuver<00:00:56.969> we're<00:00:57.149> going

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
maneuver the next maneuver we're going

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.479 
maneuver the next maneuver we're going
to<00:00:57.329> go<00:00:57.420> ahead<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.719> do<00:00:57.920> is<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.129> aileron

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
to go ahead and do is the aileron

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.650 
to go ahead and do is the aileron
tick-tock<00:00:59.910> I'm<00:01:00.059> gonna<00:01:00.210> go<00:01:00.329> ahead<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.480> do<00:01:00.600> it

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
tick-tock I'm gonna go ahead and do it

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.450 
tick-tock I'm gonna go ahead and do it
from<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.899> angle<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.770> go<00:01:02.399> ahead

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
from this angle so we can go ahead

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.950 
from this angle so we can go ahead
really<00:01:02.670> get<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> good<00:01:03.120> visual<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> blades

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
really get a good visual on the blades

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.250 
really get a good visual on the blades
on<00:01:04.320> what<00:01:04.739> angle<00:01:04.979> we're<00:01:05.309> looking<00:01:05.339> for<00:01:06.140> so<00:01:07.140> here

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
on what angle we're looking for so here

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.080 
on what angle we're looking for so here
we<00:01:07.409> go<00:01:07.530> it's<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.740> same<00:01:07.799> same<00:01:08.369> concept<00:01:08.909> just

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
we go it's the same same concept just

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.580 
we go it's the same same concept just
with<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.299> aaaaaah<00:01:09.420> instead<00:01:09.810> elevator<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
with a aaaaaah instead elevator for the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.249 
with a aaaaaah instead elevator for the
motions<00:01:11.010> here<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:11.760> go<00:01:14.750> again<00:01:15.750> we're<00:01:16.229> looking

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
motions here we go again we're looking

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.410 
motions here we go again we're looking
for<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> proper<00:01:17.130> angle<00:01:17.460> very<00:01:17.729> smooth<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.330> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
for a proper angle very smooth on the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.450 
for a proper angle very smooth on the
collective<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.619> want<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.830> be<00:01:19.890> nice<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.250> slow

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
collective just want to be nice and slow

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.170 
collective just want to be nice and slow
with<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.180> nothing<00:01:21.450> too<00:01:21.570> rapid<00:01:22.049> and

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
with it so it's nothing too rapid and

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.460 
with it so it's nothing too rapid and
again<00:01:24.180> if<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.420> use<00:01:24.450> too<00:01:24.810> much<00:01:24.960> collective

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
again if we use too much collective

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.080 
again if we use too much collective
we'll<00:01:25.590> go<00:01:25.710> ahead<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:25.950> load<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.640> head

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
we'll go ahead and load the head

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.730 
we'll go ahead and load the head
same<00:01:27.600> thing<00:01:27.810> with<00:01:27.930> cyclic

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.399 

and<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.890> basically<00:01:32.250> consists<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.790> our<00:01:33.409> Aylan

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
and that basically consists of our Aylan

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.590 
and that basically consists of our Aylan
on<00:01:34.500> tik-tok<00:01:35.570> what<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:36.689> can<00:01:36.840> go<00:01:36.990> into<00:01:37.200> now<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:38.600> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
on tik-tok what we can go into now is a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.960 
on tik-tok what we can go into now is a
four<00:01:40.140> point<00:01:40.320> tick-tock<00:01:40.799> we<00:01:41.640> have<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.790> little

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
four point tick-tock we have a little

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.039 
four point tick-tock we have a little
bit<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.119> wind<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.630> might<00:01:42.780> be<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> little

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
bit of wind so it might be a little

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.929 
bit of wind so it might be a little
difficult<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.830> what<00:01:44.430> we're<00:01:44.520> gonna<00:01:44.640> go<00:01:44.820> ahead

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
difficult but what we're gonna go ahead

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.149 
difficult but what we're gonna go ahead
and<00:01:45.060> try<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.360> anyway<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.500> combination<00:01:46.799> of

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
and try it anyway it's a combination of

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.460 
and try it anyway it's a combination of
both<00:01:47.340> our<00:01:47.610> elevator<00:01:48.509> tik<00:01:48.750> toks<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.170> railing

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
both our elevator tik toks and railing

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.410 
both our elevator tik toks and railing
on<00:01:49.530> tick-tock<00:01:49.979> we'll<00:01:50.880> go<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.179> see<00:01:51.240> what

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
on tick-tock we'll go and see what

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.899 
on tick-tock we'll go and see what
happens

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
happens
