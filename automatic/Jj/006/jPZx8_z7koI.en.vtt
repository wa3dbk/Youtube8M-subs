candles<00:03:35.090> in<00:03:35.269> my<00:03:35.390> bedroom<00:03:35.720> when<00:03:35.989> I'm<00:03:36.110> at<00:03:36.260> my

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
candles in my bedroom when I'm at my

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.670 
candles in my bedroom when I'm at my
parents<00:03:36.650> house<00:03:36.769> um<00:03:37.720> so<00:03:38.720> they<00:03:38.900> only<00:03:39.200> need<00:03:39.530> to

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
parents house um so they only need to

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.990 
parents house um so they only need to
fill<00:03:39.860> this<00:03:39.890> room<00:03:40.250> they<00:03:40.400> don't<00:03:40.579> need<00:03:40.670> to<00:03:40.790> fill<00:03:40.970> a

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
fill this room they don't need to fill a

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.390 
fill this room they don't need to fill a
ton<00:03:41.420> of<00:03:41.450> space<00:03:41.720> so<00:03:42.019> these<00:03:42.620> are<00:03:42.829> cheaper<00:03:43.160> these

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
ton of space so these are cheaper these

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.000
