00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.120
 the past when the word businessman 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.670
 it was pejorative and it was even said as 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.329
 as a known trader or entrepreneur 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.430

 to another person who is with us from 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.239
 accidentally but fairly repeated 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.530
 Y 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.409
 look with more emotion 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.319

00:03:53.409 --> 00:04:00.930
 our help us face the 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.930
 questioned they look to control 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.090
 in the bank of chile is the experience 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:10.000
 now committed to making mention of 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.230
 what has allowed us to have everything 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.230
 what you need 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.690
 because the bank has all chili 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:24.090
 you will find better solutions 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.090
 financial always 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.949
 Chilean bank Banco de Chile 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.620
 and 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:45.449
 well on Thursday, he warned me 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.489
 the loss of objective 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.929
 gamonal germ that started Mexico from a 

00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:50.139
 mission that had entrusted the 

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:52.719
 chilean 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.030
 and then I stayed without paying and came 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:56.590
 returning sergio fields that has been 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.279
 several times with us he has done very 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.449
 well and sergio fields was in Cuba or 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:03.219
 it also brings us a lot 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.300
 information about games for 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.800
 American people 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.710
 I want to tell you sergio that was talked about 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.639
 much the leading excess and here it was 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.620
 that axis or browser 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:14.080
 last Sunday deputy director of said of 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.539
 eb and a I made a comment about something 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.779
 that published the mercury in relation to 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:24.490
 leader the shooting federation 

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:26.740
 donsini urged he complained saying of 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.539
 that was false to what had been said but 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.669
 in this program he and I were not talked about 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.889
 I just made a comment based on 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.409
 a publication of another medium which was 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.669
 well outside that you went to rest you 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:39.120
 You took a very big impression with 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.120
 madness 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.000
 during all the years that we have lived 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.460
 let's consciously say the story this 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.400
 country we have had scraps and impressions 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.469
 what is Cuba of people who express themselves 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.020
 It is a disaster and people who 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:54.699
 says it's paradise then there is 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.900
 the restlessness I think a lot of people 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.000
 know Cuba 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.669
 and know what really happens and the 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.970
 situation is surprising for one 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:06.780
 because one realizes that there is excess 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.870
 as to say that everything is 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.170
 unusable the excess in saying that it is a 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.170
 paramo
