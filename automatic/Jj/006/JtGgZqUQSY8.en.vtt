arizona and the forecast today is for
118<00:00:06.270> degrees<00:00:06.509> fahrenheit<00:00:07.350> for<00:00:07.649> our<00:00:07.770> high<00:00:08.010> so<00:00:08.340> i

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
118 degrees fahrenheit for our high so i

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.850 
118 degrees fahrenheit for our high so i
thought<00:00:08.610> what<00:00:09.300> better<00:00:09.420> day<00:00:09.719> than<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:10.230> do<00:00:10.830> a

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
thought what better day than to do a

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.200 
thought what better day than to do a
torture<00:00:11.190> test<00:00:11.400> on<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.670> experimental

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
torture test on the experimental

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.930 
torture test on the experimental
airlines<00:00:12.480> construction<00:00:13.080> techniques<00:00:13.500> see<00:00:13.769> if

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
airlines construction techniques see if

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.400 
airlines construction techniques see if
anything<00:00:14.940> melts<00:00:15.330> or<00:00:15.450> detaches<00:00:15.990> or<00:00:16.109> anything

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
anything melts or detaches or anything

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.099 
anything melts or detaches or anything
so<00:00:16.650> i'm<00:00:16.740> going<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.980> sacrifice<00:00:17.760> maybe<00:00:18.359> my

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
so i'm going to sacrifice maybe my

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.849 
so i'm going to sacrifice maybe my

weather<00:00:23.400> conditions<00:00:23.910> here<00:00:24.090> today<00:00:24.420> I'm<00:00:24.900> just

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
weather conditions here today I'm just

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.179 
weather conditions here today I'm just
going<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.170> sit<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.439> out<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.710> Sun<00:00:25.859> for<00:00:25.890> about

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
going to sit it out in the Sun for about

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.429 
going to sit it out in the Sun for about
half<00:00:26.400> an<00:00:26.550> hour<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.880> see<00:00:27.060> what<00:00:27.539> happens<00:00:27.900> right

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
half an hour and see what happens right

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.820 
half an hour and see what happens right
now<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:29.150> outside<00:00:30.150> air<00:00:30.330> temp<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.830> 119

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
now the outside air temp is a 119

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.680 
now the outside air temp is a 119
degrees<00:00:33.920> Fahrenheit<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.510> using<00:00:36.510> an<00:00:36.570> infrared

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
degrees Fahrenheit and using an infrared

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.420 
degrees Fahrenheit and using an infrared
thermometer<00:00:37.350> here<00:00:37.500> I'm<00:00:37.680> looking<00:00:38.010> at<00:00:38.280> some

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
thermometer here I'm looking at some

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.240 
thermometer here I'm looking at some
stuff<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:40.320> wood<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.829> 128<00:00:41.760> degrees<00:00:43.250> this

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
stuff like the wood is 128 degrees this

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.180 
stuff like the wood is 128 degrees this
kind<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.940> grey<00:00:45.149> rock<00:00:45.450> right<00:00:45.690> here<00:00:47.870> 146<00:00:48.870> degrees

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
kind of grey rock right here 146 degrees

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.040 
kind of grey rock right here 146 degrees
and<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.449> should<00:00:51.629> be<00:00:51.660> pretty<00:00:51.780> interesting

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
and so it should be pretty interesting

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.720 
and so it should be pretty interesting
test<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.739> i'll<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:52.860> put<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.190> camera<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
test so i'll just put the camera on the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.819 
test so i'll just put the camera on the
plane<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:53.969> we'll<00:00:54.899> just<00:00:55.050> let<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.320> hang<00:00:55.469> out<00:00:55.590> for

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
plane and we'll just let it hang out for

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:12.200 
plane and we'll just let it hang out for
half<00:00:56.010> an<00:00:56.129> hour<00:00:56.190> see<00:00:56.430> what<00:00:56.550> happens

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.789 

alright<00:01:13.210> well<00:01:13.390> after<00:01:13.780> 30<00:01:14.110> minutes<00:01:14.290> in<00:01:14.470> the<00:01:14.590> Sun

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
alright well after 30 minutes in the Sun

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.219 
alright well after 30 minutes in the Sun
the<00:01:15.070> Arizona<00:01:15.430> fugly<00:01:15.790> jet<00:01:16.030> looks<00:01:16.479> actually

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
the Arizona fugly jet looks actually

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.880 
the Arizona fugly jet looks actually
really<00:01:17.830> good<00:01:17.979> the<00:01:19.229> outdoor<00:01:20.229> thermometer<00:01:20.320> got

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
really good the outdoor thermometer got

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.260 
really good the outdoor thermometer got
up<00:01:21.009> to<00:01:21.159> 133<00:01:21.909> hanging<00:01:22.720> out<00:01:22.810> in<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:22.990> Sun<00:01:23.200> and<00:01:23.409> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
up to 133 hanging out in the Sun and the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:32.730 
up to 133 hanging out in the Sun and the
surface<00:01:25.270> of<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.689> plane<00:01:25.930> is<00:01:29.009> 138<00:01:30.009> degrees<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
surface of the plane is 138 degrees the

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.690 
surface of the plane is 138 degrees the
yellow<00:01:33.220> part<00:01:33.490> just<00:01:34.060> for<00:01:34.180> what<00:01:34.390> it's<00:01:34.509> worth<00:01:34.539> is

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
yellow part just for what it's worth is

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.700 
yellow part just for what it's worth is
129<00:01:36.700> degrees<00:01:36.970> and<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:40.320> let's<00:01:41.320> see<00:01:41.409> the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
129 degrees and the let's see the

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.630 
129 degrees and the let's see the
underside<00:01:41.979> is<00:01:43.500> 116<00:01:44.500> degrees<00:01:44.649> which<00:01:45.039> is<00:01:45.069> about

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
underside is 116 degrees which is about

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.950 
underside is 116 degrees which is about
the<00:01:45.700> ambient<00:01:46.149> temperature<00:01:46.179> a<00:01:46.509> little<00:01:46.720> cool

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
the ambient temperature a little cool

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.930 
the ambient temperature a little cool
but<00:01:47.170> to<00:01:47.979> look<00:01:48.130> at<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.310> plane<00:01:48.600> wings<00:01:49.600> still<00:01:49.869> on

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
but to look at the plane wings still on

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.520 
but to look at the plane wings still on
it's<00:01:51.940> generally<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.479> little<00:01:52.750> kind<00:01:52.929> of<00:01:52.990> mushy<00:01:53.350> ur

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
it's generally a little kind of mushy ur

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.160 
it's generally a little kind of mushy ur
feeling<00:01:54.009> the<00:01:54.970> vertical<00:01:55.330> stabilizers<00:01:55.840> held<00:01:56.049> on

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
feeling the vertical stabilizers held on

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.919 
feeling the vertical stabilizers held on
only<00:01:56.319> by<00:01:56.530> hot<00:01:56.920> glue<00:01:57.159> and<00:01:57.340> it's<00:01:57.690> actually<00:01:58.690> still

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
only by hot glue and it's actually still

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.710 
only by hot glue and it's actually still
pretty<00:01:59.229> intact<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.970> glue<00:02:01.149> feels<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.569> little

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
pretty intact the glue feels a little

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.999 
pretty intact the glue feels a little
bit<00:02:01.899> soft<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:04.020> blue<00:02:05.020> and<00:02:05.319> two<00:02:05.530> sided<00:02:05.770> foam

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.580

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
a little bit loose I don't think it

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.350 
a little bit loose I don't think it
would<00:02:11.380> fall<00:02:11.620> off<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:11.830> flight<00:02:12.250> but<00:02:12.580> it's<00:02:12.850> not

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
would fall off and flight but it's not

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.710 
would fall off and flight but it's not

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
optimal the duct tape that's president

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.810 
optimal the duct tape that's president

packing<00:02:19.180> tape<00:02:19.209> looks<00:02:19.570> great<00:02:20.049> actually<00:02:20.530> it's

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
packing tape looks great actually it's

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.960 
packing tape looks great actually it's
just<00:02:20.799> as<00:02:20.920> smooth<00:02:21.130> as<00:02:21.250> can<00:02:21.370> be<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:23.500> servos<00:02:23.970> seem

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
just as smooth as can be the servos seem

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.979 
just as smooth as can be the servos seem
okay<00:02:25.560> mounted<00:02:26.560> with<00:02:26.680> two<00:02:26.799> sided<00:02:27.040> foam<00:02:27.280> tape

okay mounted with two sided foam tape

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.680 
okay mounted with two sided foam tape
they<00:02:28.989> seem<00:02:29.230> really<00:02:29.410> solid<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:31.180> so<00:02:31.329> maybe<00:02:31.510> it's

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
they seem really solid and so maybe it's
