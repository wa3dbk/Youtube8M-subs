00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.170
 doha malhangu to focus on the program that will 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.330
 mess with your head 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.160
 there we are back with one more legend to 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.300
 blame the program that is 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.210
 your head 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.320
 Mariana does not put her finger in the 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.310
 sorry people 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.559
 joaozinho does not go to the table well I already 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.989
 Saw this by saying that does not the boy do 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:38.559
 Do not do that, girl, and there when we 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.629
 Do not do it, do not do it for 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.149
 what do they do precisely 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.559
 Otherwise, I'll tell you the 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.140
 happens in a child's brain 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.079
 every time we start a 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.059
 phrase with not the region capable of 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.329
 control the impulses in the brain 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.219
 called pre frontal cortex in the brain 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.260
 of the child the prefrontal cortex is still 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.100
 does not manage to control all these 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.680
 impulses 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.500
 for example if you say to a child 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.450
 do not go to the table, what happens to you? 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.140
 the brain read this command this 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.200
 order 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.450
 the brain understands come up on the table as the 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.150
 cortex is not fully strengthened 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.340
 to prevent this impulse to the child already 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.799
 go out doing what you just 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.470
 telling her not to do that is why 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.360
 that children do just that 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.400
 The opposite of what we are asking of them 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.680
 but it is very different with non- adults 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.630
 Look, I'm going to tell you a lot. 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.200
 do not think of an elephant color 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.310
 pink and then I could not think about the elephant 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.590
 pink 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.049
 imagine for kids if we adults 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.240
 that we have a cortex that accounts for 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.649
 controlling our impulses imagines a 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.780
 children's brain 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.909
 another factor aggravating the quantity not 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.250
 the unnecessary that all of us who 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.329
 we educate children parents grandparents anyway 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.490
 responsible 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.100
 we tell the child what happens in the 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.130
 brain of saying so not the brain 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.409
 learn to ignore these hands to say 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.630
 'no' is sometimes part of the job and 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.149
 put limits what we can not do is 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.520
 go around saying no to the kids 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.590
 at all times in addition the brain of 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.569
 a child is eager to learn the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.840
 children they like to explore them 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.670
 has 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.239
 curiosity and experiencing situations 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.910
 dangerous without suffering any consequences 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.220
 active in the brains of children the system 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.269
 reward that generates a sense of well-being 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.239
 being and pleasure 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.700
 so think well the brain does not read or not 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.370
 in front of the command you say 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.930
 if you speak many no's to the child 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.379
 the child's brain learns to 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.049
 ignore the unnecessary ones and still 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.060
 this aggravating factor is the question of 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.709
 children are curious by nature and 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.069
 often do not suffer from 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.660
 consequences of dangerous attitudes 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.670
 so what I have to say to you 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.079
 what is father and mother is time to do 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.110
 brain gymnastics 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:58.269
 it's time to think strategically 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.940
 think positively and help the brain 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:04.150
 your child to say yes but not 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.000
 stay there for you this tip commands 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.980
 positive for children remember not to 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.560
 only when it is necessary 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.540
 I'll stay here until the week I 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.430
 It comes with another legend cuca the program 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.879
 that is messing with your head 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.879
 salt 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.489
 ae 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.900
 donate the morning to focus the program that will 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.900
 mess with your head
