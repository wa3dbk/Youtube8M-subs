than the root at the bottom of the chord
it<00:03:17.950> changes<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.580> chords<00:03:19.030> character<00:03:19.510> quite<00:03:19.690> a

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
it changes that chords character quite a

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.700 
it changes that chords character quite a
bit<00:03:19.990> so<00:03:20.890> here's<00:03:21.100> a<00:03:21.160> b5<00:03:21.580> over<00:03:21.820> F<00:03:21.940> sharp<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:23.260> then

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
bit so here's a b5 over F sharp and then

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.590 
bit so here's a b5 over F sharp and then
it<00:03:23.830> moves<00:03:24.010> up<00:03:24.160> three<00:03:24.400> frets<00:03:24.550> to<00:03:25.210> the<00:03:25.360> same

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
it moves up three frets to the same

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.270 
it moves up three frets to the same
chord<00:03:25.930> type<00:03:26.430> d5<00:03:27.430> over<00:03:27.760> a

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
chord type d5 over a

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:42.490 
chord type d5 over a
and<00:03:29.820> so<00:03:30.330> here's<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.720> rhythm

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.559 

now<00:03:43.500> you<00:03:43.560> noticed<00:03:44.129> also<00:03:44.390> probably<00:03:45.390> as<00:03:45.480> I

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
now you noticed also probably as I

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.210 
now you noticed also probably as I
played<00:03:45.810> that<00:03:46.019> there<00:03:46.260> were<00:03:46.349> two<00:03:46.560> transition

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
played that there were two transition

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.759 
played that there were two transition
points<00:03:47.670> where<00:03:47.819> I<00:03:47.849> used<00:03:48.120> open<00:03:48.540> strings<00:03:48.959> I'm

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
points where I used open strings I'm

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.500 
points where I used open strings I'm
going<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.010> do<00:03:50.549> that<00:03:50.730> again<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.000> little<00:03:51.269> slower

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
going to do that again a little slower

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.479 
going to do that again a little slower
show<00:03:52.260> you<00:03:52.319> where<00:03:52.500> those<00:03:52.620> transition<00:03:53.159> points

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
show you where those transition points

00:03:53.489 --> 00:04:08.400 
show you where those transition points
are<00:03:53.670> where<00:03:54.120> I'm<00:03:54.209> hitting<00:03:54.330> open<00:03:54.720> strings

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.840 

okay<00:04:09.410> and<00:04:09.680> then<00:04:09.800> that<00:04:09.980> whole<00:04:10.190> thing<00:04:10.250> repeats

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
okay and then that whole thing repeats

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.330 
okay and then that whole thing repeats
and<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.870> second<00:04:12.170> time<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.830> strumming<00:04:13.220> is

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
and the second time the strumming is

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.980 
and the second time the strumming is
slightly<00:04:13.670> different<00:04:13.970> and<00:04:14.300> another

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
slightly different and another

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.770 
slightly different and another
difference<00:04:15.380> is<00:04:15.500> instead<00:04:15.830> of<00:04:16.100> a<00:04:16.370> b5<00:04:17.180> over<00:04:17.630> F

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
difference is instead of a b5 over F

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.290 
difference is instead of a b5 over F
sharp<00:04:18.080> and<00:04:18.290> d5<00:04:18.800> over<00:04:19.070> a<00:04:19.130> we're<00:04:19.880> actually<00:04:20.030> going

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:20.300 
sharp and d5 over a we're actually going

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.870 
sharp and d5 over a we're actually going
to<00:04:20.360> use<00:04:20.450> an<00:04:20.930> f-sharp<00:04:21.500> power<00:04:22.010> cord<00:04:22.400> and<00:04:22.610> an<00:04:22.730> a

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
to use an f-sharp power cord and an a

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.300 
to use an f-sharp power cord and an a
power<00:04:23.210> cord<00:04:23.630> straight<00:04:24.560> power<00:04:24.740> cords<00:04:25.130> here's

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
power cord straight power cords here's

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:36.750 
power cord straight power cords here's
the<00:04:25.430> second<00:04:25.790> half

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:56.860 

so<00:04:37.760> both<00:04:38.150> together

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.089 

and<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:57.960> only<00:04:58.110> other<00:04:58.229> thing<00:04:58.500> that<00:04:58.530> needs<00:04:58.979> to

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
and the only other thing that needs to

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:00.830 
and the only other thing that needs to
be<00:04:59.190> said<00:04:59.340> about<00:04:59.460> that<00:04:59.729> is<00:04:59.910> when<00:05:00.449> you<00:05:00.539> play<00:05:00.690> the

be said about that is when you play the

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.230 
be said about that is when you play the
whole<00:05:00.990> thing<00:05:01.050> in<00:05:01.410> a<00:05:01.500> cycle<00:05:01.979> you<00:05:02.699> go<00:05:02.819> back<00:05:03.060> to

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
whole thing in a cycle you go back to

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.020 
whole thing in a cycle you go back to
the<00:05:03.360> a<00:05:03.389> sus<00:05:03.750> 2<00:05:03.960> chord<00:05:04.289> you<00:05:05.009> have<00:05:05.159> to<00:05:05.340> stop<00:05:05.699> the

the a sus 2 chord you have to stop the
low<00:05:06.449> E<00:05:06.479> string<00:05:06.629> from<00:05:07.080> ringing<00:05:07.379> and<00:05:07.710> I'm<00:05:08.069> going

roughly clean sound so here's the

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:21.630 
roughly clean sound so here's the
introduction<00:05:58.789> played<00:05:59.330> slow

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.220 

now<00:06:22.640> right<00:06:22.820> at<00:06:22.940> the<00:06:23.030> air<00:06:23.150> at<00:06:23.390> the<00:06:23.510> end<00:06:23.660> there<00:06:23.930> I

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
now right at the air at the end there I

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.310 
now right at the air at the end there I
hit<00:06:24.740> the<00:06:25.090> volume<00:06:26.090> knob<00:06:26.420> up<00:06:26.630> all<00:06:26.810> the<00:06:26.930> way<00:06:27.080> and

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
hit the volume knob up all the way and

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.530 
hit the volume knob up all the way and
as<00:06:28.100> you<00:06:28.130> noticed<00:06:28.610> it's<00:06:28.790> kind<00:06:28.970> of<00:06:29.060> hard<00:06:29.210> to<00:06:29.270> do

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
as you noticed it's kind of hard to do

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.900

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
what I'm actually going to do to play it

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.190

roll it back to that same semi distorted

roll it back to that same semi distorted
tone<00:07:05.900> and<00:07:06.170> we're<00:07:07.100> going<00:07:07.220> to<00:07:07.310> start<00:07:07.550> up<00:07:07.670> here<00:07:07.700> in

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.300 
tone and we're going to start up here in

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:17.750 
is in the bass line but the significance

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:23.410 
is in the bass line but the significance
of<00:07:17.870> that<00:07:20.260> on<00:07:21.260> this<00:07:21.470> part<00:07:21.770> is<00:07:22.010> that<00:07:22.550> if<00:07:22.700> that<00:07:23.060> e

of that on this part is that if that e

of that on this part is that if that e
happens<00:07:23.900> to<00:07:23.960> be<00:07:24.050> the<00:07:24.140> fourth<00:07:24.410> tone<00:07:24.770> over<00:07:25.490> a<00:07:25.520> B

happens to be the fourth tone over a B
and<00:07:26.060> that's<00:07:26.690> significant<00:07:27.350> in<00:07:27.440> the<00:07:27.500> way<00:07:27.530> this

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:27.740 
and that's significant in the way this

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.540 
and that's significant in the way this
sounds<00:07:28.310> because<00:07:29.380> chord<00:07:30.380> tones<00:07:30.650> are<00:07:30.920> the<00:07:31.280> first

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:31.550

and<00:07:36.380> when<00:07:37.190> he<00:07:37.640> takes<00:07:37.880> in<00:07:38.450> this<00:07:38.600> case<00:07:38.780> a<00:07:38.810> fourth

and when he takes in this case a fourth
and<00:07:39.640> sustains<00:07:40.640> it<00:07:40.880> and<00:07:41.030> inserts<00:07:41.390> it<00:07:41.540> on<00:07:41.630> top<00:07:41.870> of

and sustains it and inserts it on top of

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.440 
and sustains it and inserts it on top of
a<00:07:42.110> chord<00:07:42.350> it<00:07:42.530> creates<00:07:42.860> a<00:07:43.010> suspension<00:07:43.460> which

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:44.450 
a chord it creates a suspension which

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.630 
a chord it creates a suspension which
gives<00:07:45.140> it<00:07:45.260> a<00:07:45.320> little<00:07:45.530> dissonance<00:07:46.160> it<00:07:46.340> makes<00:07:46.550> it

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:46.640 
gives it a little dissonance it makes it

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.610 
gives it a little dissonance it makes it
sound<00:07:46.730> a<00:07:46.850> little<00:07:46.970> weird

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:47.620 
sound a little weird

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:53.010 
sound a little weird
so<00:07:48.620> the<00:07:48.710> beginning

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:53.020 

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.969 

and<00:07:53.139> then<00:07:53.919> down<00:07:54.490> to<00:07:54.669> here<00:07:54.850> B<00:07:55.300> and<00:07:55.960> then<00:07:56.560> in<00:07:56.710> a

and then down to here B and then in a

and then down to here B and then in a
