let's<00:02:28.099> talk<00:02:28.340> about<00:02:28.639> some<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:29.299> build

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
let's talk about some of the build

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.879 
let's talk about some of the build
quality<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.170> what<00:02:30.469> you're<00:02:30.560> going<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.739> get

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:30.889 
quality and what you're going to get

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.640 
quality and what you're going to get
physically<00:02:31.700> on<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.269> phone<00:02:32.450> itself<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:33.170> have

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
physically on the phone itself I have

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.610 
physically on the phone itself I have
long<00:02:34.010> lamented<00:02:34.400> about<00:02:35.329> capacitive<00:02:36.019> buttons<00:02:36.049> I

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
long lamented about capacitive buttons I

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.500 
long lamented about capacitive buttons I
think<00:02:37.219> that<00:02:37.370> sometimes<00:02:37.609> they<00:02:37.969> don't<00:02:38.090> work<00:02:38.329> as

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
think that sometimes they don't work as

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.360 
think that sometimes they don't work as
well<00:02:38.540> as<00:02:38.780> advertised<00:02:39.230> specials<00:02:39.500> physical

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
well as advertised specials physical

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.099 
well as advertised specials physical
buttons<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:40.879> I've<00:02:41.299> gone<00:02:41.420> on<00:02:41.599> the<00:02:41.689> record<00:02:41.810> as

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
buttons and I've gone on the record as

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:44.110 
buttons and I've gone on the record as
saying<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:42.349> did<00:02:42.500> not<00:02:42.680> enjoy<00:02:43.099> them<00:02:43.310> on<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.760> nexus

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
saying I did not enjoy them on the nexus

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.569 
saying I did not enjoy them on the nexus
one<00:02:44.409> however<00:02:45.409> the<00:02:45.650> g-tube<00:02:46.040> capacitive

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
one however the g-tube capacitive

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.220 
one however the g-tube capacitive
buttons<00:02:46.609> obviously<00:02:47.569> right<00:02:47.750> they're<00:02:48.019> all

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
buttons obviously right they're all

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.679 
buttons obviously right they're all
backlit<00:02:48.829> really<00:02:49.579> do<00:02:49.760> work<00:02:49.879> quite<00:02:50.209> nicely<00:02:50.239> and

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 
backlit really do work quite nicely and

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.390 
backlit really do work quite nicely and
you<00:02:50.720> work<00:02:50.930> almost<00:02:51.349> as<00:02:51.500> well<00:02:51.680> as<00:02:51.739> physical

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
you work almost as well as physical

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.619 
you work almost as well as physical
button<00:02:52.700> so<00:02:52.909> if<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.060> sort<00:02:53.209> of<00:02:53.299> had<00:02:53.450> those

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
button so if you sort of had those

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.599 
button so if you sort of had those
Furies<00:02:53.870> like<00:02:54.079> I<00:02:54.230> did<00:02:54.409> what<00:02:55.370> not<00:02:55.519> the

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
Furies like I did what not the

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:56.709 
Furies like I did what not the
capacitive<00:02:56.090> buttons<00:02:56.120> are<00:02:56.389> going<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.569> work

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:56.719 
capacitive buttons are going to work

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:58.420 
capacitive buttons are going to work
don't<00:02:57.439> worry<00:02:57.709> and<00:02:57.919> you<00:02:57.950> can<00:02:58.099> actually<00:02:58.219> see

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
don't worry and you can actually see

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.970 
don't worry and you can actually see
them<00:02:58.790> when<00:02:59.419> they're<00:02:59.599> not<00:02:59.750> backlit<00:03:00.139> as<00:03:00.560> well<00:03:00.769> so

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
them when they're not backlit as well so

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.589 
them when they're not backlit as well so
now<00:03:01.099> I'm<00:03:01.159> sort<00:03:01.370> of<00:03:01.400> going<00:03:01.519> to<00:03:01.639> disappear<00:03:02.150> like

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
now I'm sort of going to disappear like

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.000 
now I'm sort of going to disappear like
we've<00:03:02.780> seen<00:03:02.959> with<00:03:03.049> some<00:03:03.200> of<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.379> galaxy<00:03:03.829> s

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
we've seen with some of the galaxy s

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.009 
we've seen with some of the galaxy s
variants<00:03:04.639> I<00:03:04.849> like<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.359> option<00:03:05.389> of<00:03:05.719> having<00:03:05.840> a

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
variants I like the option of having a

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.349 
variants I like the option of having a
trackpad<00:03:06.260> I<00:03:06.680> don't<00:03:07.129> use<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.519> very<00:03:07.549> often<00:03:07.969> but<00:03:08.299> I

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
trackpad I don't use it very often but I

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:09.789 
trackpad I don't use it very often but I
like<00:03:08.569> the<00:03:08.599> fact<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:09.019> it's<00:03:09.139> there<00:03:09.409> sometimes

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
like the fact that it's there sometimes

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:10.990 
like the fact that it's there sometimes
you<00:03:09.889> want<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.099> use<00:03:10.189> it<00:03:10.219> in<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.430> game<00:03:10.669> or<00:03:10.939> an

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
you want to use it in a game or an

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.059 
you want to use it in a game or an
application<00:03:11.569> for<00:03:12.049> simple<00:03:12.349> navigation<00:03:12.469> it's

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
application for simple navigation it's

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.009 
application for simple navigation it's
nice<00:03:13.250> sort<00:03:13.549> of<00:03:13.579> have<00:03:13.760> that<00:03:13.969> choice<00:03:14.239> this<00:03:14.840> is<00:03:14.989> a

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
nice sort of have that choice this is a

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.009 
nice sort of have that choice this is a
user<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.739> flexibility<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.430> do<00:03:16.639> that<00:03:16.870> so<00:03:17.870> this

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
user the flexibility to do that so this

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.149 
user the flexibility to do that so this
is<00:03:18.049> very<00:03:18.379> much<00:03:18.590> stock<00:03:19.449> android<00:03:20.449> 2.2<00:03:21.109> but<00:03:22.010> there

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 
is very much stock android 2.2 but there

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.770 
is very much stock android 2.2 but there
are<00:03:22.190> a<00:03:22.250> lot<00:03:22.549> of<00:03:22.579> google<00:03:23.120> ad<00:03:23.269> on<00:03:23.479> things
