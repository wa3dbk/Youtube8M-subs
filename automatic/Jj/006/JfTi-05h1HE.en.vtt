around<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:53.830> map<00:01:54.010> picking<00:01:54.370> people<00:01:54.520> off<00:01:54.790> I

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
around the map picking people off I

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.610 
around the map picking people off I
choose<00:01:55.360> not<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:55.660> do<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:55.930> because<00:01:56.110> I'm<00:01:56.350> more

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
choose not to do that because I'm more

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.890 
choose not to do that because I'm more
comfortable<00:01:56.860> with<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.760> spawns<00:01:58.090> on<00:01:58.330> one<00:01:58.570> side

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
comfortable with the spawns on one side

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.990 
comfortable with the spawns on one side
so<00:01:59.590> I<00:01:59.620> kind<00:01:59.920> of<00:01:59.980> stick<00:02:00.190> to<00:02:00.310> that<00:02:00.400> side<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:00.880> this

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
so I kind of stick to that side and this

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.540 
so I kind of stick to that side and this
particular<00:02:01.480> building<00:02:01.690> i'm<00:02:01.960> in<00:02:01.990> if<00:02:02.440> there<00:02:03.430> is<00:02:03.520> a

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
particular building i'm in if there is a

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.670 
particular building i'm in if there is a
heat<00:02:03.880> map<00:02:03.910> in<00:02:04.480> this<00:02:04.780> game<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:05.350> would<00:02:05.470> see

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
heat map in this game you would see

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.250 
heat map in this game you would see
funds<00:02:06.220> read<00:02:06.520> all<00:02:06.700> around<00:02:07.390> this<00:02:07.510> building<00:02:07.750> the

lines of sight it offers you and you
just<00:02:10.180> get<00:02:10.479> so<00:02:10.660> many<00:02:10.780> kills<00:02:11.080> of<00:02:11.290> people

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590

there's<00:02:16.210> a<00:02:16.270> revenge<00:02:16.660> spawn<00:02:17.080> system<00:02:17.320> and<00:02:17.770> how

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
there's a revenge spawn system and how

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.070 
there's a revenge spawn system and how
it<00:02:17.980> works<00:02:18.280> is<00:02:18.520> you<00:02:18.730> kill<00:02:19.180> someone<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.750> the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
it works is you kill someone and the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.860 
it works is you kill someone and the

kill them and what you should do is

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.690 
kill them and what you should do is
export<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.560> I<00:02:32.590> actually<00:02:32.830> outstayed<00:02:33.670> my

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
prevented that with a claymore but it's

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.860 
prevented that with a claymore but it's
all<00:02:38.320> good<00:02:38.580> anyways<00:02:39.580> though<00:02:39.790> back<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.450> Swan

all good anyways though back to the Swan
system<00:02:41.320> you<00:02:42.160> should<00:02:42.310> exploit<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:43.000> so<00:02:43.480> when<00:02:43.690> you

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
system you should exploit it so when you

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.060 
system you should exploit it so when you
kill<00:02:43.930> someone<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.320> know<00:02:44.740> they're<00:02:44.890> going<00:02:45.010> to

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
kill someone you know they're going to

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.160 
kill someone you know they're going to
run<00:02:45.220> back<00:02:45.490> to<00:02:45.670> you<00:02:45.760> so<00:02:45.970> kill<00:02:46.270> them<00:02:46.480> move<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:47.140> a

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
run back to you so kill them move to a

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.050 
run back to you so kill them move to a
different<00:02:47.410> spot<00:02:47.650> move<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.520> a<00:02:48.550> different<00:02:48.760> area

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
different spot move to a different area

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.900 
different spot move to a different area
continue<00:02:49.810> moving<00:02:50.050> and<00:02:50.410> then<00:02:50.770> kill<00:02:51.550> them<00:02:51.640> again

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
continue moving and then kill them again

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.970 
continue moving and then kill them again
and<00:02:52.209> what<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:52.959> should<00:02:52.990> view<00:02:53.440> as<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.620> general

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
and what you should view as a general

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.030 
and what you should view as a general
tip<00:02:54.190> is<00:02:54.400> stop<00:02:54.790> drop<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:55.989> listen<00:02:56.530> I<00:02:56.680> realize

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
tip is stop drop and listen I realize

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.790 
tip is stop drop and listen I realize
it's<00:02:57.519> kind<00:02:57.760> of<00:02:57.820> a<00:02:57.940> of<00:02:58.480> stealing<00:02:59.080> stop<00:02:59.350> drop<00:02:59.620> and

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
it's kind of a of stealing stop drop and

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.650 
it's kind of a of stealing stop drop and
roll<00:02:59.830> which<00:03:00.250> is<00:03:00.400> what<00:03:00.610> happens<00:03:01.090> or<00:03:01.330> what<00:03:01.570> you

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
roll which is what happens or what you

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.720 
roll which is what happens or what you
should<00:03:01.840> do<00:03:02.080> when<00:03:02.560> you<00:03:02.680> get<00:03:02.800> lit<00:03:02.980> on<00:03:03.100> fire<00:03:03.130> but

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
should do when you get lit on fire but

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.370 
should do when you get lit on fire but
it<00:03:04.300> makes<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.600> lot<00:03:04.750> of<00:03:04.780> sense<00:03:04.870> in<00:03:05.110> this<00:03:05.230> game

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
it makes a lot of sense in this game

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.770 
it makes a lot of sense in this game
because<00:03:05.530> footsteps<00:03:06.040> are<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.430> lot<00:03:06.910> louder<00:03:07.150> than

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
because footsteps are a lot louder than

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.259 
because footsteps are a lot louder than

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.240 
kind of tactic is going to get you way
more<00:03:28.750> kills<00:03:29.170> it's<00:03:29.470> going<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.680> prevent<00:03:29.920> way

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
more kills it's going to prevent way

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.100 
more kills it's going to prevent way
more<00:03:30.489> deaths<00:03:30.790> so<00:03:31.150> it's<00:03:31.660> something<00:03:31.810> you<00:03:31.959> should

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
more deaths so it's something you should

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.600 
more deaths so it's something you should
look<00:03:32.260> into<00:03:32.470> if<00:03:32.769> you<00:03:32.860> don't<00:03:33.040> do<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.370> already

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
look into if you don't do that already

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.810 
look into if you don't do that already
you<00:03:33.760> should<00:03:33.910> and<00:03:35.100> now<00:03:36.100> I<00:03:36.130> move<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.640> this<00:03:36.760> side

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
you should and now I move to this side

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.030 
you should and now I move to this side

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
of the map and I'm looking around this

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.979 
of the map and I'm looking around this
window<00:03:39.459> it's<00:03:39.640> also<00:03:39.820> another<00:03:40.150> good<00:03:40.420> spot<00:03:40.690> make

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
window it's also another good spot make

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:41.940 
window it's also another good spot make
