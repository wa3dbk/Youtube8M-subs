00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 Well, you've already asked if you 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:10.889
 Fall in love with a drug dealer 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:13.080
 could that happen in fact 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.000
 this book the storyteller of 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.680
 antonia michaelis you have one 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.570
 review wanted because the book is so 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.070
 is controversial and I recently 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.170
 have read and that's why there is now 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.580
 also the review first 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.099
 maybe once to content it 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.480
 is a bit gray at anna anna 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.250
 she's never had a mouse 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.219
 friend is actually rather he 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.739
 aspiration comes from a total cure 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.940
 family where everything is pink fluffy and 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.590
 she's just finishing high school 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.360
 that's why it's so incredible 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.520
 Surprising that she calculated with 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.079
 but abel is in fact in 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.239
 his level actually only as the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.399
 Polish short goods dealer known 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.379
 quite a outsider with a 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.789
 dubious reputation because he likes to stand 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.199
 on the playground and makes drugs 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.329
 as the first two really 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.550
 collide and a short one 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.210
 anna is totally curious 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.040
 on him and decides without further ado and 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.299
 spontaneously following them to school 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.200
 and to see what he actually is in 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.420
 his free time is what I do 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.369
 at drug dealers so and thus finds 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.080
 she out that privately privately quite different 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.759
 is as in school because he has one 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.979
 little sister around him 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.259
 caring and loving 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.189
 fairy tale therefore tells the title of 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.950
 storytellers 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.930
 Well, and then the two learn each other 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.790
 in the end actually know and 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.079
 love 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.829
 Of course, that is not 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.850
 all pink clouds here because clear first 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.229
 the two come out completely 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.240
 different worlds first time 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.720
 Purple and she is so protected 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.729
 good girl and the other problem 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.049
 is still that abel with his 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.430
 single mother and his 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.990
 little sister actually together 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.119
 lives but the mother seems lost 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.320
 but now I have to go alone 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.790
 take care of his sister he has 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.350
 terrible fear that the youth office him 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.299
 His sister takes away and she into one 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.920
 nursing family packs and therefore he has to 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.840
 to keep it a secret all the time 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.360
 meanwhile the only one is to 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.370
 home to take care of the child and more 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.200
 of course he has to earn his own money 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.510
 with he can ever buy food and 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.490
 what else you need in everyday life 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.900
 whole leads to huge big problems 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.920
 and someday actually happen 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.780
 It also kills and it gets more and more exciting 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.210
 I will not tell you anymore because I like it 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.340
 hate when saved and therefore 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.080
 I'll let that go right away 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.240
 crack point I found the book 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.290
 incredibly great 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.610
 not because of the story i can 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.080
 right away I could say 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.550
 also no full score at the 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.960
 I have four ratings now 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.760
 awarded by five stars 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.280
 simply because there are a few things there 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.520
 Does she really really give me a fuck? 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.160
 annoying but in itself is the book 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.990
 really beautiful especially antonia 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.760
 michaelis writing style that makes that 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.170
 really everything again 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.170
 maybe not quite in the story 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.680
 so great is she has such an incredible 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.630
 descriptive writing style that can do it 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.130
 Do not really explain that's it 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.540
 always finds exactly the right words 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.610
 so that the story even if only 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.620
 Everyday things describe in what 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.030
 it does not get magical 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.040
 necessarily like a fairy tale though 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.930
 of course in this book also sections 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.150
 There are stories told in fairy tales 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.110
 because yes , the title says it all 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.709
 but overall a lot 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.720
 extraordinary language you 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.590
 used and that pulls you right in 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.330
 her spell 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.220
 So that was not the book actually 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.070
 can put more out of hand a little 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.959
 example maybe on page 53 so 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.780
 At the beginning no fear is revealed 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.260
 nothing of the action in the scene 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.060
 Here is Anna in a mensa and 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.920
 observed there an incident of 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.890
 something happens and breaks 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.420
 mensa employee is pretty annoyed 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.600
 And Anna describes this woman is like 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.140
 follows her tone was at least as cold as 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.150
 ice cream did not taste like vanilla 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.530
 He tasted of scouring 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.500
 a smock striped life 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:59.730
 disappointment lay around the woman's mouth 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:03.959
 bitter ones in which allahs fold her 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:06.080
 you all know nothing written to her 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:10.470
 and try the money of your parents 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:13.590
 Nobody gives me education here 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.970
 what, yes, I just think this 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.950
 descriptions the antonia michaelis 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.090
 delivered here are awesome so with the 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.949
 the smock 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.660
 cancel life disappointment that is 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.970
 so things that impress and which one 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.020
 not forget again 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.669
 That's why I'm honest with you 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.020
 then incredibly mixed feelings 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.520
 behind the book went because 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.490
 I read the first pages and 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.600
 was immediately incredibly fascinated by it 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.130
 But I already knew that I was 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.860
 spoiled that is a very 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.360
 There is a controversial position in the book and me 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.430
 I was terrified that I was this 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.500
 reached me and that the whole thing 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.720
 so I have about 200 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.190
 always read with this fear in the pages 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.979
 neck to be equal to something 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.540
 terrible happens and then is 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.790
 this place popped up and I have to 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:57.330
 say it also makes me awful 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.610
 annoyed so it was somehow unnecessary 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.960
 I do not know why you call the author 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.940
 why have you come here? 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.330
 that should be what we are told exactly 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.190
 should 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.330
 but it is a place you look at 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.740
 can get pretty upset 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.810
 maybe rightly too and yes 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.280
 my euphoria for the book was afterwards 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.630
 I'm pretty muffled all the way 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.360
 I honestly say I still have it 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.130
 like to read to the end and as I said 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.990
 think it's very good overall because it is 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.280
 actually a book which one more 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.510
 busy after you finish it 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.710
 has read that is also from the end yes 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.270
 a little different than that 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.979
 maybe used to from teen books 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.660
 on the one hand it is a very 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.520
 dramatic ending on the other side 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.410
 is it then a bit again? 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.500
 fluffy but also here I tell 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.090
 Of course not too much either way 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.380
 you do not quite get rid of it I wanted to 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.820
 this review actually direct 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.380
 after reading the book 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.690
 turn and I just could not 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.520
 because you still have so loses then 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.169
 you feel so many different 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.150
 which flow into you when you're with 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.039
 this book is done that you look 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.060
 first has to arrange and yes I have 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.620
 Now that's what I'm doing 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.050
 almost a month now that I am 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.979
 have read it and not at all 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.660
 now in retrospect, if I am one 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.919
 have a little distance say the book 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.990
 you do not forget that's for 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:08.550
 very much worth and maybe 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.810
 should you really read it around 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.320
 yourself a opinion about it 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.210
 form 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.250
 it's a love story but not 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.500
 just that it is just a book what 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:20.370
 much about interpersonal matters 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:22.380
 tells something of social 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.500
 distinguished and to justice in 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.050
 tells our country and in itself simply 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.389
 just 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.370
 well written that was it already 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:33.129
 for this sunday I am next week 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.840
 finally fit again I hope and until 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:38.159
 Enjoy your week have one 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.159
 nice weekend makes it good
