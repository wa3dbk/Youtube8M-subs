00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.340
 now with the afternoons today from begin 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.830
 point we are going to show you how to do the 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.980
 maintenance of an automatic pedal and 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.630
 labor x 0 how are we going to do the 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.250
 maintenance 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:22.780
 first of all we are going to dismantle the 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.780
 body of the pedal with the hd of g 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:39.440
 we disassembled a complete thread and we're going to 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.440
 be able to separate the body from the shaft 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.700
 now we have the axis and we have to 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.270
 disassemble the nuts that we have here 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:55.820
 up to get the balls and everything 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.820
 the internal continent of the axis 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.910
 of old age we loosen the nuts 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.410
 the nut counter 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.079
 and the door is complicated because here 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:21.520
 come all the loose balls and now 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.520
 we can all fall 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.360
 the traca 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.330
 and really with very bad we take all 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.330
 the balls 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.180
 all the balls of the shaft we raise the 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.530
 bottom part and we also take out 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.530
 all the balls 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.270
 the axis of the pedal and now we can 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.270
 disassemble but complete 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.530
 erm age 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.260
 we have disassembled all the pieces and 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.530
 now we have them all clean 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.510
 cleaned with rapid maxi liner for 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.200
 remove all the fat as you see is already 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.600
 everything clean even the balls we have 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.160
 able to clean all with rapid lines 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.430
 and a simple bag we have put the 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.110
 balls we have put the pike and rubbing 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.860
 we were able to clean all the balls 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:49.990
 now only need to mount the other time 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.990
 we put the protective rubber 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.220
 the pedal thread 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.690
 and now we just have to play with the 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.730
 cap and then we're going to put them all 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.730
 the grease inside the cap 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.940
 and now ball by ball we have to 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.360
 entertain behind in putting each of 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.360
 the balls 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.750
 we have to me 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.930
 we already have all the balls in the 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.120
 Bottom part of the cap with grease 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.730
 the cap and we assemble 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.440
 the gas removes 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.440
 and we already have the bottom 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:53.810
 mounted, you need to reassemble 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.810
 all the balls on top 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.790
 we have already put the first nut 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.030
 we press it until we see that it rolls 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.510
 as fine as possible we have that 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.510
 adjust 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.570
 and we put the nut counter 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.180
 we press the right and necessary we see that 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.500
 now he is too strong 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.500
 we loose a little 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.120
 and we have it 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.120
 ready 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.300
 we put a little bit of fat all over the 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.500
 axis 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.500
 a little bit in the thread 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:15.110
 and we can mount the other time in the 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.110
 pedal body 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.800
 and we have 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:40.169
 the pedal ready greased and as new and 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.169
 your neighbor rolls 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.300
 we already have if you have any doubt 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.159
 You can write to our channel 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.650
 youtube and that I invite you to see all the 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:51.979
 videos that we have of basic mechanics 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.979
 thank you
