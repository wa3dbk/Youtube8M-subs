00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 youtuber program with which I have the 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.890
 samsung galaxy i a 63 10 i will be cut 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.059
 violence in three different ways 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.219
 uninstall applications from the most 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.599
 long to the shortest but before the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.570
 I invite you to subscribe to my channel what 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.940
 can you do here below 17 subscribe 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.830
 a subscriber subscribe in that way 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.210
 be aware of all my videos 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.880
 can you ask comments or 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.980
 suggestions we go to the long form of 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.500
 uninstall basically consists of 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.300
 leave here our in the menu 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.420
 applications but on the main page 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.450
 from start to settings settings or 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.860
 configuration according to language 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.379
 we look for the administrator of 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.079
 applications and here in the administrator 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.000
 of applications we can see all the 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.789
 applications that we have and diabetes 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.430
 basically install those that do not 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.770
 we use very often for 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.280
 example right here at the beginning this one 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.829
 angry birds I installed it to prove it 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.469
 but you are not using it uninstall it 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.879
 around here it's very interesting not to use 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.690
 this application to explain why 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.700
 because normally the games 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.520
 store cache information and 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.250
 information on the sd card in this 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.900
 case does not have information for 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.700
 show them how to have been 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.000
 Stored before additional information 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.750
 fear let's see it's soon 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.750
 this 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.700
 neither this 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.670
 that is to say it has for example information 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.650
 additional to the application stored by 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.320
 example has the card you have 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.360
 stored 32 kilobytes and all a 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.930
 21st century tribute to challenge the cache 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.000
 of used 157 megabytes the form 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.400
 interesting how interesting 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.430
 uninstall written curaca applications 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.860
 to erase kachin delete data and that 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.350
 way to be sure that when the 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.659
 application 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.990
 and will not leave the photo for the information 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.580
 residual information protocol one 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.310
 next installation soon that the 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.069
 use that is data from us and we 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.869
 ordered new skin again is already 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.420
 it remained to uninstall applications although the 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.950
 long form another way and that is a lot 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.989
 simpler is to let squeeze 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.720
 the button here the center and that 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.920
 quickly we enter the 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.870
 task manager and the music that 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.730
 in the little circle 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.849
 then we're going to the second option that 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.799
 it's downloads and here we have all the 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.060
 applications and the things in which 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.280
 uninstall here 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.830
 simply the machine is to install and 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.990
 you accept 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.090
 here we can not be sure and we are 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.710
 uninstalling achieving cache or data 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.840
 simply the application we know that it 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.120
 We do not know if there is information left 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.430
 there has been easily stored des 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.030
 we installed an hour the easiest way 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.210
 it is still entering here by applications 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.640
 giving you here uninstall and configuration 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.790
 here those that appeared with a sign 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.650
 unless you are is we can install that 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.210
 which we have downloaded for 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.700
 example of these three are two is 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.670
 installable and all those that are agile 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.500
 they have a sign of a minus sign and they are 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.770
 the installers for example to install 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.320
 ilan wolff minutes we will accept 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.570
 charles erwin the talking tom charles 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.850
 howell and so it's simple you can install 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.920
 for this third option and shorter and 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.360
 easier to use and above all 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.709

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.220
