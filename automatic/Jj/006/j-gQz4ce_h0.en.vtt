00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:44.489
 the journey to thank today 1 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.170
 and the expectation of playing some more 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.220
 five years or so 45 years I think 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.110
 that what we are going to calm down after 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.500
 You see how how he as 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.260
 is that the situation is to be able to play more 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.420
 four years palm trees 17 years I think 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.619
 you can build a legal story more 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.890
 depends very much on the condition of the 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.750
 people can reach the club to 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.270
 win titles and set a time 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.950
 victorious because only as soon as people 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.950
 actually manages other entity 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.079
 the carol selection is the dream of any 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.929
 player 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:40.259
 we know that according to age 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:44.619
 It increases so I admire him a lot. 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.780
 presented information but with the 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.530
 dream word is a very very thing 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.110
 broad 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.619
 I think until the day I close the 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.939
 career 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.039
 The day I stop playing, I go. 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:58.060
 return to the independent Brazilian national team 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:00.579
 I could reach or not but I always 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.209
 I was a guy who was loud and the 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.209
 Secretary 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.150
 portugal knows well marks and many 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.530
 against him 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.350
 before the palm trees already had several 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.700
 several shirts that your program with it 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.960
 Saved at home is a fantastic guy. 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.120
 inside the field everyone knows outside 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.580
 field is also a guy who has a 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.930
 Wonderful story silly and I will 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.110
 load think unhurried 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.630
 this weight of playing with the shirt 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.810
 of the team in a position that in taking that 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.959
 I was an idol and I hope I got to do it. 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.520
 my story inside the palm trees 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.970
 Of course I wanted to be a reference. 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.970
 for everyone 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.739
 but his I used to not get 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.140
 out 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.840
 I always spoke in Basque I stayed four 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.800
 years that were two games in three games 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.120
 so for me it's a much more 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.980
 boring and here in the palm trees I had a 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.720
 serious injury to the elbow and five months 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.580
 away and adding that to the difficult phase 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.830
 of the team so for me it was a moment 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.200
 most difficult of my career ever 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.239
 had experienced this in a situation where 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.709
 that was also very 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.470
 psychologically exhausting for me 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.160
 but thanks God I got back and it was 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.160
 acquiring rhythm 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.660
 is 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.069
 Osvaldo dude, I like to fish but it's 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:41.409
 much more profitable my children too 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:44.620
 I liked it a lot but it's not, it's not mine. 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.620
 second passion 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.780
 Thank you for everything. Put it there. 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.569
 best of the top 200 firefighters 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.540
 my biggest dream is the face is when 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.519
 retire you look back and and I do not 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.890
 I have regretted nothing 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.010
 of course you frustrate something 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.810
 It will stay because we can not 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.670
 achieve everything that people plan 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.220
 But I 'm very happy in your career. 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.609
 accomplished wonderful things and 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.900
 they play in big clubs because 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.870
 had base of the guild but afterwards always 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.300
 had small loans and everyone 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.880
 Do you know how much you leave the Great Cycle? 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.810
 It's very difficult to go back and now I'm back 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.160
 Sign me up, that 's the deal. 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.539
 when I stop playing 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.110
 I could look back and see a 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.110
 beautiful career 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:47.430
 Carlos Henrique looks at me when I am 

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:51.430
 playing with the legendary who is crazy right? 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:53.589
 people are practically every day 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.169
 playing concentrate and when he came back 

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:59.439
 playing and focused place sÃ£o paulo is 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:03.779
 the most frequent in the family 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:08.800
 children playing football playing pool 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:11.229
 see a movie then in life today 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.949
 President Lula that there are palm trees and 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.949
 Ricardo 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.510
 good is my greatest football idol 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.690
 I think it's a reference to everyone in my 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.040
 and Raphael was with me. 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.660
 the goalkeeper who inspired me when I 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.580
 I started playing since I was little 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.050
 despite playing in the team's rival that the 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.490
 inter and what to do next play 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.200
 I'm still not very clear in the head I 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.880
 I have some possibilities. 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.630
 ideas but everything very vague still nothing 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.630
 very matured 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.880
 is
