know from from a pure profile point of
view<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.299> doesn't<00:01:06.630> really<00:01:06.720> look<00:01:07.200> all<00:01:07.439> that

impressive<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:08.280> from<00:01:09.180> certain<00:01:09.510> angles<00:01:09.689> it

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
impressive but from certain angles it

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.469

actually does look pretty good the
transformation<00:01:12.960> itself<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.950> somewhat

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
transformation itself is somewhat

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.810 
transformation itself is somewhat
finicky<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:16.259> yields<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.820> decent-looking

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
finicky but it yields a decent-looking

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
that you would use to make the limbs of

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.490 
that you would use to make the limbs of
a<00:02:37.890> connect<00:02:38.400> seein<00:02:38.760> those<00:02:39.690> action<00:02:40.470> figures

a connect seein those action figures

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.460 
a connect seein those action figures
that<00:02:41.010> would<00:02:41.130> come<00:02:41.370> packaged<00:02:42.060> with<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.959> larger

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
that would come packaged with the larger

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.500 
that would come packaged with the larger
sets<00:02:43.769> I<00:02:44.160> always<00:02:44.970> did<00:02:45.180> like<00:02:45.330> those<00:02:46.489> so<00:02:47.510> after

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
sets I always did like those so after

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.460 
sets I always did like those so after
sculpting<00:02:49.470> on<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.660> bits<00:02:51.660> around<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.200> waist

back<00:03:26.760> piece

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
back piece

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.710 
back piece
which<00:03:27.760> would<00:03:28.030> form<00:03:28.330> the<00:03:28.390> cockpit<00:03:28.960> I<00:03:30.210> also<00:03:31.210> gave

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
which would form the cockpit I also gave

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.470 
which would form the cockpit I also gave
her<00:03:32.050> a<00:03:32.080> totally<00:03:33.069> new<00:03:33.310> head<00:03:34.920> I<00:03:36.060> wanted<00:03:37.060> one<00:03:37.240> that

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
her a totally new head I wanted one that

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.690 
her a totally new head I wanted one that
would<00:03:37.750> have<00:03:37.959> a<00:03:37.990> bit<00:03:38.260> of<00:03:38.290> articulation<00:03:39.220> you

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
would have a bit of articulation you

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
would have a bit of articulation you
know<00:03:39.850> an<00:03:40.090> actual<00:03:40.750> neck<00:03:41.170> that<00:03:41.560> could<00:03:41.740> turn<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:43.690> I

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
know an actual neck that could turn so I

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.380 
know an actual neck that could turn so I
took<00:03:43.930> one<00:03:44.410> of<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.680> shoulder<00:03:45.190> pieces<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:46.360> I

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
took one of the shoulder pieces that I

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.449 
took one of the shoulder pieces that I
had<00:03:46.570> cut<00:03:46.840> off<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:47.350> make<00:03:47.500> him<00:03:47.680> put<00:03:47.830> a<00:03:47.860> new<00:03:48.040> arms

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
had cut off to make him put a new arms

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.400 
had cut off to make him put a new arms
and<00:03:48.730> I<00:03:49.600> sculpted<00:03:50.470> around<00:03:51.250> it<00:03:51.640> make<00:03:52.420> making<00:03:53.290> a

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
and I sculpted around it make making a

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.890 
and I sculpted around it make making a
new<00:03:53.620> head<00:03:53.980> that<00:03:54.610> had<00:03:54.850> a<00:03:54.880> ball<00:03:55.209> joint<00:03:55.510> on<00:03:55.780> the

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
new head that had a ball joint on the

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.320 
new head that had a ball joint on the
inside<00:03:56.350> so<00:03:56.830> she<00:03:57.370> can<00:03:57.550> look<00:03:57.700> left<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.239> right

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
inside so she can look left and right

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.380 
inside so she can look left and right
and<00:03:58.870> even<00:03:59.530> a<00:03:59.560> little<00:03:59.770> bit<00:03:59.890> up<00:04:00.160> and<00:04:00.280> down<00:04:00.400> of

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
and even a little bit up and down of

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.690 
and even a little bit up and down of
course<00:04:01.750> she<00:04:01.989> still<00:04:02.290> is<00:04:02.739> stuck<00:04:03.190> by<00:04:03.640> the

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
course she still is stuck by the

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.910 
course she still is stuck by the
original<00:04:04.090> limitations<00:04:04.989> of<00:04:05.170> that<00:04:05.380> ball<00:04:05.650> joint

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
original limitations of that ball joint

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.759 
original limitations of that ball joint
that<00:04:06.070> I<00:04:06.160> mentioned<00:04:06.370> before<00:04:06.870> but<00:04:07.870> it's<00:04:08.440> better

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
that I mentioned before but it's better

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.040 
that I mentioned before but it's better
than<00:04:09.070> having<00:04:09.130> a<00:04:09.610> static<00:04:10.300> head<00:04:10.540> that<00:04:10.750> doesn't

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
than having a static head that doesn't

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.170 
than having a static head that doesn't
move<00:04:11.110> at<00:04:11.290> all<00:04:12.180> so<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:14.220> sculpted<00:04:15.220> some<00:04:15.610> hands

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
move at all so I sculpted some hands

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.479 
move at all so I sculpted some hands
they're<00:04:16.810> just<00:04:16.840> fists<00:04:17.650> I<00:04:17.769> put<00:04:17.980> on<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.220> ends<00:04:18.400> of

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
they're just fists I put on the ends of

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.670 
they're just fists I put on the ends of
your<00:04:18.519> arms<00:04:18.820> and<00:04:19.030> there's<00:04:19.540> wrist<00:04:19.900> articulation

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
your arms and there's wrist articulation

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.610 
your arms and there's wrist articulation
but<00:04:21.340> you<00:04:21.609> know<00:04:21.760> it<00:04:21.910> it's<00:04:22.690> hard<00:04:23.380> to<00:04:23.440> take

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
but you know it it's hard to take

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.320 
but you know it it's hard to take
pictures<00:04:23.860> of<00:04:24.010> those<00:04:24.160> things<00:04:24.460> and<00:04:24.880> because

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
pictures of those things and because

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.360 
pictures of those things and because
they<00:04:25.419> all<00:04:25.630> fuzzy<00:04:26.020> saw<00:04:26.200> let's<00:04:26.770> just<00:04:26.980> see<00:04:27.160> what

and because I I paint at the bottom of
the<00:05:14.970> wings<00:05:15.150> black<00:05:15.540> so<00:05:15.810> that<00:05:15.930> the<00:05:16.170> tail<00:05:16.530> thing

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
that goes around would be it would blend

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.770
