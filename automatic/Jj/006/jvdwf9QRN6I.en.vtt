00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
today I'm going to show you how to do a

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.669 
today I'm going to show you how to do a
mid<00:00:07.200> not<00:00:07.620> tutorial<00:00:08.580> this<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.570> my<00:00:09.929> version<00:00:10.469> of

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
mid not tutorial this is my version of

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.700 
mid not tutorial this is my version of
the<00:00:10.920> top<00:00:11.130> knot<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.580> guess<00:00:11.790> I'm<00:00:12.599> not<00:00:12.960> personally

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
the top knot I guess I'm not personally

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.369 
the top knot I guess I'm not personally
a<00:00:13.740> big<00:00:13.860> fan<00:00:14.009> top<00:00:14.580> knots<00:00:14.849> um<00:00:15.299> you'll<00:00:16.170> probably

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
a big fan top knots um you'll probably

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.650 
a big fan top knots um you'll probably
never<00:00:16.590> catch<00:00:17.220> me<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.640> one<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.480> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
never catch me in one so this is the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.800 
never catch me in one so this is the
closest<00:00:19.260> I'll<00:00:19.560> get<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.189> sort<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.300> top<00:00:21.539> nut

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
closest I'll get to sort of the top nut

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.970 
closest I'll get to sort of the top nut
concept<00:00:22.500> but<00:00:23.029> midway<00:00:24.029> down<00:00:24.410> my<00:00:25.410> head<00:00:25.619> so

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
concept but midway down my head so

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.890 
concept but midway down my head so
instead<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.640> top<00:00:26.760> like<00:00:27.150> top<00:00:27.420> knots<00:00:27.660> are

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
instead of on top like top knots are

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.660 
instead of on top like top knots are
this<00:00:28.560> one's<00:00:28.830> going<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.070> live<00:00:29.250> right<00:00:29.460> about

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
this one's going to live right about

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.140 
this one's going to live right about
here

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
here

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.030 
here
and<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.720> won't<00:00:30.900> be<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> low<00:00:31.260> messy<00:00:31.679> bun<00:00:31.830> either

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
and it won't be a low messy bun either

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.450 
and it won't be a low messy bun either
so<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> good<00:00:33.210> way<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.600> find<00:00:34.160> what<00:00:35.160> would<00:00:35.309> be<00:00:35.430> a

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
so a good way to find what would be a

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.060 
so a good way to find what would be a
good<00:00:35.670> mid<00:00:36.090> section<00:00:36.899> for<00:00:37.320> your<00:00:37.440> head<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.890> to

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
good mid section for your head is to

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.220 
good mid section for your head is to
find<00:00:38.309> your<00:00:38.460> occipital<00:00:38.790> bone<00:00:39.210> which<00:00:39.899> was<00:00:40.050> that

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
find your occipital bone which was that

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.049 
find your occipital bone which was that
little<00:00:40.350> round<00:00:40.649> bone<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.190> sticks<00:00:41.370> out<00:00:41.700> sort

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
little round bone that sticks out sort

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.360 
little round bone that sticks out sort
of<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.360> go<00:00:42.480> straight<00:00:42.870> behind<00:00:43.260> your<00:00:43.440> ears<00:00:43.620> and

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
of you go straight behind your ears and

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.369 
of you go straight behind your ears and
just<00:00:44.579> go<00:00:44.700> an<00:00:44.879> inch<00:00:45.059> or<00:00:45.239> two<00:00:45.390> above<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.899> so

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
just go an inch or two above that so

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.380 
just go an inch or two above that so
that's<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.829> good<00:00:46.860> mid-range<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:48.090> if<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.300> were

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
that's a good mid-range so if you were

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.690 
that's a good mid-range so if you were
to<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.600> looking<00:00:48.960> at<00:00:49.110> your<00:00:49.260> hair<00:00:49.469> from<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> side

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
to be looking at your hair from the side

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.400 
to be looking at your hair from the side
it's<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:51.390> kind<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.660> going<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.110> line

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
it's just kind of going to be a line

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.040 
it's just kind of going to be a line
continuing<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.760> that's<00:00:53.969> that's<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.840> goal<00:00:55.020> of

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
continuing so that's that's the goal of

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.389 
continuing so that's that's the goal of
where<00:00:55.379> we're<00:00:55.500> going<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.680> have<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.129> bun

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
where we're going to have this bun

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.029 
where we're going to have this bun
positioned<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.199> start<00:00:58.440> with<00:00:58.559> nearly<00:00:58.800> any

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
positioned you can start with nearly any

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.770 
positioned you can start with nearly any
texture<00:00:59.550> hair<00:00:59.789> if<00:01:00.030> your<00:01:00.180> hair<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.449> stick

texture hair if your hair is stick
straight<00:01:01.199> you're<00:01:01.949> not<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
straight you're not going to have the

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
look a little bit more lived-in and a

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
little bit softer and then I also like

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:13.720 
little bit softer and then I also like
to<00:03:12.470> loosen<00:03:12.769> up<00:03:12.830> some<00:03:13.010> hairs<00:03:13.220> around<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.550> face

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
and then pin those back so that may seem

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.660 
and then pin those back so that may seem
like<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.700> really<00:03:16.970> dumb<00:03:17.269> idea<00:03:17.300> but<00:03:18.519> again<00:03:19.519> the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
like a really dumb idea but again the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.210 
like a really dumb idea but again the
whole<00:03:19.790> concept<00:03:20.209> is<00:03:20.390> for<00:03:20.660> this<00:03:20.780> to<00:03:20.930> look<00:03:21.220> sort

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
whole concept is for this to look sort

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.699 
whole concept is for this to look sort
of<00:03:22.280> lived<00:03:22.580> in<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.150> not<00:03:23.660> like<00:03:24.019> a<00:03:24.049> perfect<00:03:24.319> bun

of lived in and not like a perfect bun
so<00:03:25.489> by<00:03:25.640> loosening<00:03:26.000> up<00:03:26.239> these<00:03:26.390> hairs<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:27.110> then

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
so by loosening up these hairs and then

so by loosening up these hairs and then
grabbing<00:03:27.500> a<00:03:27.709> pin<00:03:27.920> and<00:03:28.190> just<00:03:28.370> softly<00:03:28.819> pinning
