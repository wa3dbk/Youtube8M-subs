some old power line I am NOT making this

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.730 
some old power line I am NOT making this
up<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:18.209> mediately<00:01:20.429> there<00:01:21.429> was<00:01:21.549> a<00:01:21.579> great<00:01:21.969> flash

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740

Deward<00:01:32.740> gone<00:01:33.719> aha<00:01:34.719> I've<00:01:35.109> discovered<00:01:35.380> the

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
Deward gone aha I've discovered the

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.919 
Deward gone aha I've discovered the
humane<00:01:36.429> method<00:01:37.390> for<00:01:38.200> capital<00:01:38.860> punishment<00:01:38.979> and

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
humane method for capital punishment and

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.459 
humane method for capital punishment and
it<00:01:40.929> turns<00:01:41.200> out<00:01:41.439> that<00:01:41.799> he<00:01:42.369> was<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:42.670> dentist

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
it turns out that he was a dentist

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.380 
it turns out that he was a dentist
because<00:01:44.469> that's<00:01:45.039> who<00:01:45.369> you<00:01:45.520> want<00:01:45.759> in<00:01:45.939> charge<00:01:46.209> of

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
because that's who you want in charge of

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.389 
because that's who you want in charge of
your<00:01:46.539> cabinet<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.909> nobody<00:01:49.869> said<00:01:50.200> what<00:01:51.039> do<00:01:51.250> we

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
your cabinet and nobody said what do we

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:57.059 
your cabinet and nobody said what do we
do<00:01:51.579> it's<00:01:52.270> got<00:01:52.539> to<00:01:52.659> involve<00:01:52.959> a<00:01:53.079> chair<00:01:55.860> I'm<00:01:56.860> not

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
do it's got to involve a chair I'm not

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.420 
do it's got to involve a chair I'm not
making<00:01:57.520> this<00:01:57.549> up

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
making this up

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:08.710 
making this up
so<00:02:00.860> this<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:03.050> a<00:02:04.760> very<00:02:05.760> bad<00:02:06.180> stench<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:07.520> moldy

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
so this is a very bad stench of moldy

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.580 
so this is a very bad stench of moldy

old Sparky is the electrocution juice is
available<00:02:14.070> Florida<00:02:14.610> will<00:02:15.210> get<00:02:15.360> back<00:02:15.570> to<00:02:15.810> old

Sparky<00:02:16.560> in<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.950> second<00:02:17.580> now<00:02:18.420> how<00:02:19.140> does

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
Sparky in a second now how does

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.870 
Sparky in a second now how does
electrocuting<00:02:21.470> kill<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.770> well<00:02:23.250> here's<00:02:23.760> a

electrocuting kill you well here's a

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.290 
electrocuting kill you well here's a
mnemonic<00:02:24.450> that's<00:02:24.990> pretty<00:02:25.470> easy<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.920> remember

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
mnemonic that's pretty easy to remember

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.720 
mnemonic that's pretty easy to remember

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
minimum 1 volt village you need to

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.360 
minimum 1 volt village you need to
voltage<00:02:37.140> in<00:02:37.650> an<00:02:37.860> excess<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:39.080> 1,000<00:02:40.080> volts<00:02:40.440> the

reason for that is because your body's

reason for that is because your body's
resistance<00:02:44.360> is<00:02:45.360> about<00:02:46.580> 3,500<00:02:47.580> ohms<00:02:48.950> normally

resistance<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.420> your<00:02:54.600> skin<00:02:55.020> brings<00:02:55.500> down<00:02:55.860> and

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
resistance of your skin brings down and
