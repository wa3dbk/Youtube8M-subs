00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:06.770
 dear friends of youtube hello this 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.950
 videos of my healthy today I want 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.929
 present the service cycle to you 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.309
 here we see I have already gained access 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.309
 to the service cycle 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.350
 then to access this particular 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.789
 diagnostic cycle is very simple a 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.760
 morning off 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.010
 just take these two buttons 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.939
 at the same time then the water button 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.889
 connection and abo pause and rotate the 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.960
 program selector of a position 

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:39.159
 clockwise therefore in this case 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.780
 on the 90 degree cottons cycle 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:43.670
 after a few seconds they will begin to 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.850
 turn on all the spin sequence in 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:52.699
 this way and taking the various buttons 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:59.929
 we can verify precisely the 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:03.199
 operation of the various lights for 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:04.040
 this point who via murlo and let's go 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.140
 over 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.030
 in fact rotating the selector of 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.369
 programs you can test the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.469
 pump loading solenoid valves 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:17.560
 centrifugal drain and all the others 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:22.270
 options there are all the various components 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.270
 sorry for the washing machine then 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.890
 with 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.730
 water drain in the compartment 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.730
 May 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:55.720
 loading of water in the compartment of 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:55.720
 Braille washing evident 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.650
 hot water in the washing compartment 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.830
 in this phase the 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.200
 water heater resistance 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.310
 since this is not a washing machine with 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.460
 system comes only for the state 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.600
 there had been resistance to the jet system 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.200
 he would also put the pump into operation 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.190
 of the display system we can read 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.190
 the water temperature 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:59.010
 as the engine rises the washing 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.500
 and spin-off with water 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.500
 inside 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.110
 to water discharge 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.250
 and spin at maximum speed without 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.250
 load balancing 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.860
 should start at moments 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.830
 here we are 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.159
 and very important at this stage than in the 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.750
 there are no baskets for any reason 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.569
 clothes 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.600
 must be empty 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.580
 the display 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.440
 You can view the speed of 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:17.800
 basket rotation divided by 10 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.800
 Now is a around 750 turns 800 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.980
 maximum speed 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.870
 a little less than the maximum to tell the truth 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.840
 for people around 1150 laps 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.139
 the maximum city should 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.139
 trento 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.420
 end of the test 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.920
 now we wait for the basket 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:07.090
 obviously stop and the blog must 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.090
 unlock yourself instantly 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:20.410
 here we are to leave the service cycle 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:24.040
 it is necessary to switch off the machine 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:27.700
 setting the program selector to 0 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:30.380
 rotate one click clockwise 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.510
 turn off the machine again e 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.990
 bring the selector back 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.100
 one click clockwise programs 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.130
 from now on it will be possible 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.150
 again select the various programs of 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.150
 washing as always 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.199
 thanks for watching this video and 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.979
 in a moment we'll see each other in the second 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.979
 part
