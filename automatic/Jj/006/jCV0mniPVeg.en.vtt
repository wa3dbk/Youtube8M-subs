00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
outer corner and then flick it out so

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.630 
outer corner and then flick it out so
that<00:01:28.229> there<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.680> kind<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.479> that<00:01:30.479> pull<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:32.549> it

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
that there is kind of that pull and it

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.609 
that there is kind of that pull and it
might<00:01:32.790> look<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.060> little<00:01:33.210> wonky<00:01:33.509> at<00:01:33.810> first<00:01:34.049> but

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
might look a little wonky at first but

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.380 
might look a little wonky at first but
then<00:01:34.740> I'm<00:01:34.890> going<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.070> take<00:01:35.130> my<00:01:35.430> e<00:01:35.460> 40<00:01:36.030> x<00:01:36.150> sigma

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
then I'm going to take my e 40 x sigma

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.359 
then I'm going to take my e 40 x sigma
this<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.869> only<00:01:36.990> non<00:01:37.650> drugstore<00:01:38.159> brush

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
this is the only non drugstore brush

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.249 
this is the only non drugstore brush
that<00:01:38.520> i'm<00:01:38.670> using<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.180> i'm<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.930> going<00:01:40.229> to

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
that i'm using and i'm just going to

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.539 
that i'm using and i'm just going to
blend<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.369> out<00:01:41.610> along<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.420> edges<00:01:46.460> we're<00:01:47.460> it

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
blend that out along the edges we're it

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.280 
blend that out along the edges we're it
once<00:01:47.759> more<00:01:48.090> make<00:01:48.360> sure<00:01:48.509> everything<00:01:49.079> on<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
once more make sure everything on the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.520 
once more make sure everything on the
outer<00:01:49.439> corner<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.920> nice<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.250> packed<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:51.530> then

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
outer corner is nice and packed in then

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.620 
outer corner is nice and packed in then
i'm<00:01:52.770> going<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.100> take<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.579> elf<00:01:53.790> crease<00:01:54.360> brush

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
i'm going to take the elf crease brush

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.679 
i'm going to take the elf crease brush
and<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.470> darkest<00:01:56.399> color<00:01:56.729> here<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.210> mat<00:01:57.450> one

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
and the darkest color here the mat one

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.289 
and the darkest color here the mat one
and<00:01:57.990> i'm<00:01:58.680> just<00:01:58.920> going<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.250> dab<00:01:59.790> that<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
and i'm just going to dab that on the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.179 
and i'm just going to dab that on the
outer<00:02:00.450> corner<00:02:02.810> i'm<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:04.649> going<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.829> whip<00:02:05.159> that

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
outer corner i'm just going to whip that

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.800 
outer corner i'm just going to whip that
up<00:02:05.430> into<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.850> crease<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.119> little<00:02:06.240> bit<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.750> then

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
up into the crease a little bit and then

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.139 
up into the crease a little bit and then
flick<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.710> out<00:02:07.799> it's<00:02:08.039> not<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.759> much<00:02:08.789> product

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
flick it out it's not that much product

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.780 
flick it out it's not that much product
so<00:02:10.659> then<00:02:10.869> I'm<00:02:11.110> just<00:02:11.319> going<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.709> really<00:02:12.220> softly

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
so then I'm just going to really softly

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.960 
so then I'm just going to really softly
blend<00:02:13.150> this<00:02:13.269> out<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:15.400> now<00:02:15.549> I'm<00:02:15.670> going<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.879> go

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
blend this out so now I'm going to go

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.490 
blend this out so now I'm going to go
back<00:02:16.000> in<00:02:16.299> with<00:02:16.329> the<00:02:16.569> flat<00:02:16.840> shader<00:02:17.140> brush<00:02:17.200> from

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
back in with the flat shader brush from

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.890 
back in with the flat shader brush from
ELF<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:18.129> I'm<00:02:18.310> going<00:02:18.519> to<00:02:18.579> take<00:02:18.760> any<00:02:19.030> just<00:02:19.329> white

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
ELF and I'm going to take any just white

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.839 
ELF and I'm going to take any just white
eyeshadow<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.709> can<00:02:20.860> be<00:02:20.980> frosted<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:21.579> can<00:02:21.700> be

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
eyeshadow it can be frosted it can be

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.699 
eyeshadow it can be frosted it can be
mad<00:02:22.060> but<00:02:22.599> I<00:02:22.659> would<00:02:22.870> recommend<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.409> to<00:02:23.439> be

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
mad but I would recommend it to be

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.500 
mad but I would recommend it to be
somewhere<00:02:24.099> in<00:02:24.159> between<00:02:24.310> not<00:02:24.849> too<00:02:25.090> too<00:02:25.269> frosty

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
somewhere in between not too too frosty

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.800 
somewhere in between not too too frosty
because<00:02:26.110> then<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.970> can<00:02:28.120> let<00:02:28.239> get<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.569> little

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
because then you can let get a little

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.780 
because then you can let get a little
crazy<00:02:28.989> so<00:02:29.709> I'm<00:02:29.769> going<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:29.980> take<00:02:30.129> that<00:02:30.189> on<00:02:30.370> the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
crazy so I'm going to take that on the

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.729 
crazy so I'm going to take that on the
flat<00:02:31.510> shader<00:02:31.750> brush<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.109> this<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.319> a<00:02:32.349> coverall

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
flat shader brush and this is a coverall

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.789

the brow bone just can look kind of
Gracie<00:02:43.389> sometimes<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.230> then<00:02:44.829> I'm<00:02:45.069> also<00:02:45.280> just

eyeliner<00:02:51.819> you<00:02:52.090> don't<00:02:52.269> actually<00:02:52.420> have<00:02:52.599> to<00:02:52.720> do

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
eyeliner you don't actually have to do

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.330 
eyeliner you don't actually have to do
this<00:02:53.019> if<00:02:53.139> you<00:02:53.200> don't<00:02:53.260> want<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.709> but<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:54.190> is

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
this if you don't want to but this is

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.149 
this if you don't want to but this is
just<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.639> add<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.790> little<00:02:54.879> bit<00:02:55.150> of<00:02:55.209> I<00:02:56.200> don't<00:02:56.980> know

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
just to add a little bit of I don't know

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.860 
just to add a little bit of I don't know
a<00:02:57.340> little<00:02:57.459> bit<00:02:57.639> of<00:02:57.760> jazz<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.389> it<00:02:58.480> if<00:02:58.599> you<00:02:58.689> will

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
a little bit of jazz to it if you will

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.640 
a little bit of jazz to it if you will
so<00:02:59.769> I'm<00:02:59.920> just<00:03:00.159> going<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.909> apply<00:03:01.629> a<00:03:02.109> little<00:03:02.530> bit

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
so I'm just going to apply a little bit

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.089 
so I'm just going to apply a little bit
of<00:03:02.889> liquid<00:03:03.280> eyeliner<00:03:04.200> it's<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.319> very<00:03:05.500> thin<00:03:05.829> line

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
of liquid eyeliner it's a very thin line

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:15.890 
of liquid eyeliner it's a very thin line
so<00:03:06.400> nothing<00:03:06.670> too<00:03:06.819> crazy

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.479 

so<00:03:16.900> you<00:03:17.020> can<00:03:17.260> stick<00:03:17.500> with<00:03:17.530> just<00:03:17.800> a<00:03:18.010> thin<00:03:18.220> line

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
so you can stick with just a thin line

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.190 
so you can stick with just a thin line
or<00:03:18.849> you<00:03:19.000> could<00:03:19.120> do<00:03:19.239> what<00:03:19.330> I'm<00:03:19.420> about<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.750> do<00:03:19.930> and
