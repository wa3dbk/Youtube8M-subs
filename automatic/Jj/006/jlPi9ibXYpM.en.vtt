00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.850
 good hello how about youtube friends in 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.750
 this video I just want to show me 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.500
 something that I have created and I want to tell you that 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.700
 I will continue creating more things 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.030
 make it easier to work and make it more 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.390
 easy to work in 4d cinema 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:26.410
 I'm just going to 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.320
 activate global lighting 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.000
 only activated 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.000
 but the properties that are going to follow 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.310
 here as well as if it were an object for 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.100
 measure as a polygonal object 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:43.550
 if I see what I mean it will be this 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.550
 I created an espresso is here 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.510
 in particular is that this lighting 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:51.160
 global 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.940
 Double click 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.250
 now I'm going to 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.410
 this object and here is 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.130
 they will tell you but it will be that this works 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:04.269
 good if it works I was seeing a 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.360
 tutorial where he explained how 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.790
 drag up 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.370
 how to drag them the properties of 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.540
 these parts of here on the screen and 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:20.220
 work and to see what 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.660
 and true as I have activated 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.490
 just that are the options I'm going to 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:29.540
 give you fixed animation 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:34.160
 depth and fusion 2011 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.430
 and normal down here are the 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.409
 routes that also drag up here 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.929
 simply unique title as well 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.289
 and I'm going to perform to see how much I 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.289
 late 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.130
 It should not take long since it's a global 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.940
 and I put very low effects 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.660
 so the effect should not be very 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:02.260
 it should not be left in effect it is simply 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:05.140
 some sideways as it results 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.170
 and when you 're enough, I would say 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.490
 because we must be for the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.490
 materials that have this object 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.120
 very good that global action is fine 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.819
 we can 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.110
 alter here several things generally 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.170
 one 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.250
 puts in this option to the general and 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.250
 cantv radiance already 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.280
 and well let's place these options 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.410
 that nothing else was general and almost 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.930
 radiant but then I told myself not to 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.720
 because it may reach users who 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.520
 yes they are going to use this object that now what 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.440
 I have turned an object that has 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.010
 properties also any links not 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.530
 go 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.560
 well he tells me that he can be in the 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.700
 other effects like the details here the 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.950
 Caustic fractal just a little fuzzy 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.370
 hide certain things 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.250
 things like that so leave another one 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.260
 options although they are not all and as I said 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.599
 which we are going to see generally and almost 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:13.620
 irradiance very soon I hope to rise and 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:17.280
 make another object of this cancer to the 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.280
 ambient occlusion 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.910
 and it's also going to be another effect that he 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.990
 Depth of field 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:36.270
 and changed color but soon make them 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:40.050
 you can quickly observe 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.650
 they are simply connections 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.650
 What have I done 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:51.200
 they are simply connections 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.780
 it's not so complex I say but if it took 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.870
 its time to do the same has been everything 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.120
 I hope 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:03.959
 is downloaded in this 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:07.349
 if you liked it good I hope supply this 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.349
 here it's over
