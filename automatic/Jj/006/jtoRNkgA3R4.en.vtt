vocalizations<00:01:09.660> but<00:01:10.590> that's<00:01:10.830> probably<00:01:11.400> what

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
vocalizations but that's probably what

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.220 
vocalizations but that's probably what
they're<00:01:11.850> most<00:01:12.180> known<00:01:12.540> for<00:01:14.900> so<00:01:15.900> what<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.110> one

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
they're most known for so what is one

thing that we don't know about these
hyenas<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:19.140> think<00:01:19.560> one<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.040> really<00:01:20.700> neat

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
hyenas I think one of the really neat

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.840 
hyenas I think one of the really neat
things<00:01:21.030> about<00:01:21.450> them<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.050> they<00:01:22.790> not<00:01:23.790> only

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
things about them is that they not only

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.320 
things about them is that they not only
can<00:01:24.540> eat<00:01:24.840> or<00:01:25.260> break<00:01:25.950> bone<00:01:26.250> when<00:01:26.790> they<00:01:26.940> eat<00:01:27.150> it

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
can eat or break bone when they eat it

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.360 
can eat or break bone when they eat it
but<00:01:27.600> they<00:01:27.780> actually<00:01:27.960> digest<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.100> their

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
but they actually digest it their

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.210 
but they actually digest it their
digestive<00:01:30.180> system<00:01:30.690> is<00:01:30.870> amazing<00:01:31.410> they<00:01:31.830> will

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
digestive system is amazing they will

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.400 
digestive system is amazing they will
pick<00:01:32.640> up<00:01:32.880> what<00:01:33.210> all<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.510> other<00:01:33.540> animals<00:01:34.200> leave

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
pick up what all the other animals leave

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.280 
pick up what all the other animals leave
behind<00:01:35.300> so<00:01:36.300> in<00:01:36.450> terms<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.750> their<00:01:36.869> social

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290

structure<00:01:37.830> there<00:01:38.040> they're<00:01:38.490> very<00:01:38.700> different

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
structure there they're very different

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.690 
structure there they're very different
from<00:01:39.300> typical<00:01:39.630> mammals<00:01:40.260> it<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.800> a<00:01:40.830> matriarchal

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700
