compartment motors were disassembled by
the<00:03:13.570> marina<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.780> I<00:03:16.810> would<00:03:17.170> say<00:03:17.350> they<00:03:17.890> need<00:03:18.130> to

the marina so I would say they need to

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.960 
the marina so I would say they need to
be<00:03:18.340> replaced

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
be replaced

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.330

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
electrical isolator switches the hours

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.080 
electrical isolator switches the hours
eight<00:03:41.380> to<00:03:41.800> nine<00:03:41.950> hundred<00:03:41.980> hours<00:03:42.610> on<00:03:42.940> the
