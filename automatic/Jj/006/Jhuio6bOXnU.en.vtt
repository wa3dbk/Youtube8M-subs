00:01:23.770 --> 00:02:04.370 

babe

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.660 

if<00:02:05.380> you're<00:02:05.560> looking<00:02:05.800> at<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:05.979> century<00:02:06.369> range

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
if you're looking at the century range

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.940 
if you're looking at the century range
and<00:02:07.509> we're<00:02:07.840> considering<00:02:08.410> which<00:02:08.560> rod<00:02:08.800> we

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
and we're considering which rod we

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.460 
and we're considering which rod we
should<00:02:09.100> use<00:02:09.340> for<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:09.880> absolute<00:02:10.690> maximum

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
should use for the absolute maximum

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.010 
should use for the absolute maximum
range<00:02:12.060> where<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.209> want<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.510> fish<00:02:13.660> beyond

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
range where you want to fish beyond

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.800 
range where you want to fish beyond
where<00:02:14.260> anyone<00:02:14.680> else<00:02:14.860> can<00:02:15.100> fish<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:16.660> you're

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
where anyone else can fish and you're

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.270 
where anyone else can fish and you're
absolutely<00:02:17.110> going<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.530> look<00:02:17.739> at<00:02:17.920> blowing

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
absolutely going to look at blowing

absolutely going to look at blowing
everybody<00:02:18.910> away<00:02:19.360> with<00:02:19.570> the<00:02:19.630> casting

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
everybody away with the casting

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.500 
everybody away with the casting
capabilities<00:02:20.770> in<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.220> right<00:02:21.400> hands<00:02:21.850> there's

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
capabilities in the right hands there's

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.890 
capabilities in the right hands there's
only<00:02:22.690> one<00:02:22.930> rod<00:02:23.110> for<00:02:23.320> that<00:02:23.440> that's<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.950> FMA<00:02:24.900> you

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
only one rod for that that's the FMA you

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.210 
only one rod for that that's the FMA you
may<00:02:26.110> remember<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:27.100> groundbreaking<00:02:28.080> FMJ<00:02:29.220> that

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
may remember the groundbreaking FMJ that

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.920 
may remember the groundbreaking FMJ that
was<00:02:30.340> out<00:02:30.519> about<00:02:30.790> maybe<00:02:31.090> eight<00:02:31.360> years<00:02:31.390> ago<00:02:31.810> I

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
was out about maybe eight years ago I

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.960 
was out about maybe eight years ago I
had<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.410> hand<00:02:32.739> in<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.010> design<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.700> was<00:02:33.880> an

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
had a hand in the design it was an

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.509 
had a hand in the design it was an
incredible<00:02:34.390> rod<00:02:34.600> this<00:02:35.050> is<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.530> FMA<00:02:35.980> which<00:02:36.370> is

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
incredible rod this is the FMA which is

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.940 
incredible rod this is the FMA which is
an<00:02:36.640> updated<00:02:37.209> version<00:02:37.500> with<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.530> lot<00:02:38.739> of<00:02:38.769> new

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
an updated version with a lot of new

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.180 
an updated version with a lot of new
technology<00:02:39.550> basically<00:02:40.360> it's<00:02:40.930> got<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.320> ATT

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
technology basically it's got the ATT

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.160 
technology basically it's got the ATT
system<00:02:42.670> which<00:02:42.940> is<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.239> ante<00:02:43.570> twist<00:02:43.959> and

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
system which is the ante twist and

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.080 
system which is the ante twist and
torque<00:02:44.410> system<00:02:44.920> so<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.250> don't<00:02:45.489> get<00:02:45.580> any

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
torque system so you don't get any

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.800 
torque system so you don't get any
screen<00:02:46.390> with<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.630> cast<00:02:47.340> parallel<00:02:48.340> but<00:02:48.810> these

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
screen with the cast parallel but these

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.360 
screen with the cast parallel but these
three<00:02:50.019> options<00:02:50.380> with<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.620> handles<00:02:51.010> so<00:02:51.220> you've

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
three options with the handles so you've

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.340 
three options with the handles so you've
got<00:02:51.459> plenty<00:02:51.670> of<00:02:51.820> choice<00:02:52.120> depending<00:02:53.110> on<00:02:53.170> what

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
got plenty of choice depending on what

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.840 
got plenty of choice depending on what
sort<00:02:53.650> of<00:02:53.680> cosmetics<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.370> would<00:02:54.489> like<00:02:54.670> with

included the Japanese shrink rubber a
small<00:03:01.000> section<00:03:01.540> on<00:03:01.660> either<00:03:02.019> end<00:03:02.350> so<00:03:02.590> that

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
small section on either end so that

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.250 
small section on either end so that
because<00:03:03.850> of<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.060> tolerances<00:03:04.630> of<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.900> insert

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
because of the tolerances of the insert

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.800
