there'd<00:02:54.720> be<00:02:54.720> like<00:02:54.870> five<00:02:55.530> phase<00:02:55.890> members<00:02:56.310> like

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
there'd be like five phase members like

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.160 
there'd be like five phase members like
it'd<00:02:56.610> just<00:02:57.000> be<00:02:57.150> like<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.450> leaders<00:02:57.750> i<00:02:57.930> probably

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
it'd just be like the leaders i probably

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.110 
it'd just be like the leaders i probably
had<00:02:58.380> adapt<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.830> go<00:02:58.950> maybe<00:02:59.280> rain<00:02:59.550> would<00:02:59.760> go<00:02:59.910> like

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
had adapt to go maybe rain would go like

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.760 
had adapt to go maybe rain would go like
you<00:03:00.330> know<00:03:00.510> just<00:03:00.780> like<00:03:00.870> five<00:03:01.140> like<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.560> main

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
you know just like five like the main

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.860 
you know just like five like the main
like<00:03:02.070> my<00:03:02.400> group<00:03:02.700> of<00:03:02.850> friends<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:03.390> think<00:03:03.720> they'd

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
like my group of friends I think they'd

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.870 
like my group of friends I think they'd
be<00:03:03.990> more<00:03:04.020> like<00:03:04.410> lenient<00:03:04.920> toward<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.430> like<00:03:05.730> if

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
be more like lenient toward that like if

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.360 
be more like lenient toward that like if
it<00:03:06.030> was<00:03:06.150> just<00:03:06.720> like<00:03:06.840> on<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.500> East<00:03:07.680> Coast<00:03:07.800> like
