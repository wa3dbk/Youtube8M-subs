however the tricky part is this board is

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.299 
however the tricky part is this board is
actually<00:00:33.809> attached<00:00:34.230> I'm<00:00:34.800> not<00:00:34.980> sure<00:00:35.160> if<00:00:35.219> you

it is even connected to this board here
that<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.289> wanted<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.129> replace<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.760> effectively

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
that I wanted to replace so effectively

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.459 
that I wanted to replace so effectively
to<00:00:51.629> replace<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:53.250> entire<00:00:53.670> board<00:00:54.300> all<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.289> way

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
to replace the entire board all the way

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.400 
to replace the entire board all the way
I<00:00:55.829> would<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:56.910> had<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.180> essentially<00:00:57.480> take<00:00:57.809> off

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
I would have had to essentially take off

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.920 
I would have had to essentially take off
the<00:00:58.949> garage<00:00:59.160> door<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.449> had<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
the garage door and I just had the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.110 
the garage door and I just had the
garage<00:01:01.109> door<00:01:01.379> rebuilt<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.370> new<00:01:02.579> spring<00:01:02.879> put

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
garage door rebuilt in a new spring put

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.649 
garage door rebuilt in a new spring put
in<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:04.019> month<00:01:04.739> or<00:01:04.860> two<00:01:04.979> ago<00:01:05.030> because<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.240> spring

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
in a month or two ago because the spring

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.539 
in a month or two ago because the spring
broke<00:01:06.930> but<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.260> had<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.470> replaced<00:01:07.710> with<00:01:08.490> a

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
broke but we had it replaced with a

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.660 
broke but we had it replaced with a
brand<00:01:08.790> new<00:01:08.880> spring<00:01:09.860> so<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.890> didn't<00:01:11.280> think<00:01:11.520> that

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
brand new spring so I didn't think that

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.800 
brand new spring so I didn't think that
was<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> right<00:01:12.030> thing<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.270> do<00:01:12.360> take<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
was the right thing to do take on the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.910 
was the right thing to do take on the
challenge<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.140> bringing<00:01:13.260> down<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.680> garage

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
challenge of bringing down that garage

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.020 
challenge of bringing down that garage
door<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.549> replace<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.909> one

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
door just like you replace that one

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.749 
door just like you replace that one
board<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.810> didn't<00:01:16.740> do<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:16.890> instead<00:01:17.490> what<00:01:17.729> I

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
board so I didn't do that instead what I

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.609 
board so I didn't do that instead what I
did<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.630> realized<00:01:18.930> now<00:01:19.049> that's<00:01:19.259> what<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.409> did

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
did and I realized now that's what I did

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.899 
did and I realized now that's what I did
a<00:01:19.650> couple<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:19.979> years<00:01:20.100> ago<00:01:20.369> when<00:01:20.580> we<00:01:20.670> had<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
a couple of years ago when we had the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.850 
a couple of years ago when we had the
house<00:01:21.060> repainted<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.720> 2008<00:01:23.540> was<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.990> kind<00:01:25.770> of

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
house repainted in 2008 was I kind of

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.280 
house repainted in 2008 was I kind of
had<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.100> cut<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.400> off<00:01:26.520> halfway<00:01:27.060> here<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.259> I

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
had to cut it off halfway here so I

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.350 
had to cut it off halfway here so I
essentially<00:01:28.920> got<00:01:29.009> cut<00:01:29.280> off<00:01:29.310> all<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.090> wood<00:01:30.240> up

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
essentially got cut off all the wood up

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.200 
essentially got cut off all the wood up
here<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.630> good<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.049> no<00:01:31.140> rotted<00:01:31.500> all<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.829> here

here is good and no rotted all up here

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.670 
here is good and no rotted all up here
I'm<00:01:33.210> gonna<00:01:33.450> obviously<00:01:33.689> be<00:01:33.960> repainting<00:01:34.590> all

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.880 
angle which is just nice because things
like<00:02:00.090> extension<00:02:01.020> cords<00:02:01.320> get<00:02:01.439> caught<00:02:01.649> on<00:02:01.770> it

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
like extension cords get caught on it

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.889 
like extension cords get caught on it
when<00:02:02.009> you're<00:02:02.100> moving<00:02:02.310> around<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.880> house<00:02:03.420> and

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
when you're moving around the house and

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.600 
when you're moving around the house and
sometimes<00:02:04.350> people<00:02:04.649> hit<00:02:04.950> their<00:02:05.130> feet<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.430> that

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
sometimes people hit their feet on that

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.609 
sometimes people hit their feet on that
up<00:02:05.729> kind<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.420> poor<00:02:06.600> design<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:07.079> my<00:02:07.170> opinion

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
up kind of a poor design in my opinion

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.410 
up kind of a poor design in my opinion
so<00:02:07.770> tapering<00:02:08.670> them<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:08.940> way

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
so tapering them that way

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.240 
so tapering them that way
avoids<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.619> probably<00:02:10.860> helps<00:02:11.039> avoid

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
avoids that it probably helps avoid

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.230 
avoids that it probably helps avoid
future<00:02:11.730> rod<00:02:12.090> as<00:02:12.270> well

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
future rod as well

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.880 
future rod as well
and<00:02:13.330> by<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.750> way<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:13.900> did<00:02:14.080> seal<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.500> bottoms<00:02:14.830> of

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
and by the way I did seal the bottoms of

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.000 
and by the way I did seal the bottoms of
these<00:02:15.040> really<00:02:15.280> Wilson<00:02:15.670> try<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.240> help<00:02:16.450> avoid

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
these really Wilson try to help avoid

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.380 
these really Wilson try to help avoid
rot<00:02:18.010> in<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.190> future<00:02:18.490> and<00:02:18.730> getting<00:02:19.150> ready<00:02:19.270> to

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
rot in the future and getting ready to

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.540 
rot in the future and getting ready to
paint<00:02:19.600> this<00:02:19.870> so<00:02:20.680> did<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:20.890> replacement<00:02:21.250> on<00:02:21.490> the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
paint this so did a replacement on the

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.490 
paint this so did a replacement on the
board<00:02:21.790> on<00:02:21.940> this<00:02:22.120> side<00:02:22.330> which<00:02:22.540> is<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.080> the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
board on this side which is the to the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.710 
board on this side which is the to the
double-wide<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.190> then<00:02:25.120> on<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.510> other<00:02:25.540> side

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
double-wide and then on the other side

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.840 
double-wide and then on the other side
essentially<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.740> same<00:02:26.860> thing<00:02:27.160> I<00:02:27.370> had<00:02:27.730> the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
essentially the same thing I had the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.130 
essentially the same thing I had the
same<00:02:28.000> challenge<00:02:28.510> couldn't<00:02:28.750> replace<00:02:28.990> the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
same challenge couldn't replace the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.500 
same challenge couldn't replace the
whole<00:02:29.290> board<00:02:29.530> but<00:02:29.880> this<00:02:30.880> is<00:02:31.060> an<00:02:31.180> explanation

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
whole board but this is an explanation

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.800 
whole board but this is an explanation
of<00:02:31.900> why<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.770> just<00:02:33.640> for<00:02:33.940> information<00:02:34.570> on<00:02:34.690> the

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
of why and just for information on the

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.250 
of why and just for information on the
other<00:02:34.930> side<00:02:35.350> of<00:02:35.380> this<00:02:35.680> two-car<00:02:36.670> garage

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
other side of this two-car garage

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.180 
other side of this two-car garage
essentially<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.320> had<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.530> do<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.710> same<00:02:38.740> thing

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
essentially you had to do the same thing

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.150 
essentially you had to do the same thing
a<00:02:40.150> couple<00:02:40.690> years<00:02:40.870> back<00:02:41.020> in<00:02:41.170> 2008<00:02:41.770> when<00:02:41.920> we<00:02:41.950> had

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
a couple years back in 2008 when we had

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.300 
a couple years back in 2008 when we had
the<00:02:42.280> house<00:02:42.430> painted<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:44.350> little<00:02:44.680> damaged<00:02:45.100> here

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
the house painted a little damaged here

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.360 
the house painted a little damaged here
I'm<00:02:45.430> going<00:02:45.550> to<00:02:45.610> caulk<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.690> then<00:02:47.370> repaint

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
I'm going to caulk that and then repaint

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.340 
I'm going to caulk that and then repaint
this<00:02:48.610> side<00:02:48.820> as<00:02:49.000> well<00:02:49.210> and<00:02:49.840> just<00:02:49.900> for

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
this side as well and just for

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.740 
this side as well and just for
information<00:02:50.830> of<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.100> owner<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.730> purposely<00:02:52.450> cut

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
information of the owner I purposely cut

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.240 
information of the owner I purposely cut
this<00:02:52.990> one<00:02:53.200> in<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.350> slightly<00:02:53.620> different<00:02:53.770> kind<00:02:54.130> of

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
this one in a slightly different kind of

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.730 
this one in a slightly different kind of
a<00:02:54.370> taper<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:55.420> reason<00:02:55.750> being<00:02:55.930> is<00:02:56.260> that<00:02:56.320> we

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
a taper the reason being is that we

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.220 
a taper the reason being is that we
edged<00:02:56.980> along<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.820> cement<00:02:58.240> here<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:58.690> whenever

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
edged along the cement here and whenever

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.400 
edged along the cement here and whenever
you've<00:02:59.500> got<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.830> the<00:03:00.280> edger<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.990> it<00:03:01.990> used<00:03:02.230> to

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
you've got the the edger and it used to

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.870 
you've got the the edger and it used to
hit<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.980> piece<00:03:03.160> of<00:03:03.310> wood<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:03.490> would<00:03:03.700> come

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
hit the piece of wood that would come

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.000 
hit the piece of wood that would come
down<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:04.540> was<00:03:04.690> another<00:03:05.050> source<00:03:05.830> of

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
down and that was another source of

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.590 
down and that was another source of
damage<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.700> wood<00:03:06.850> in<00:03:07.060> addition<00:03:07.450> to

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
damage to the wood in addition to

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.930 
damage to the wood in addition to
potential<00:03:08.170> wood<00:03:08.380> rot<00:03:08.620> because<00:03:09.580> we've<00:03:09.820> got

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
potential wood rot because we've got

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.880 
potential wood rot because we've got
sprinkler<00:03:10.300> systems<00:03:10.630> here<00:03:10.780> as<00:03:10.870> well<00:03:11.080> so<00:03:11.620> you

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
sprinkler systems here as well so you

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.520 
sprinkler systems here as well so you
know<00:03:12.580> in<00:03:12.820> 2008<00:03:13.630> I<00:03:13.690> actually<00:03:13.870> tapered<00:03:14.380> that

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
know in 2008 I actually tapered that

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.110 
know in 2008 I actually tapered that
down<00:03:14.710> cut<00:03:15.040> it<00:03:15.130> flush<00:03:15.340> with<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.580> wall<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:15.970> that

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
down cut it flush with the wall so that

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.120 
down cut it flush with the wall so that
one<00:03:16.270> so<00:03:16.990> there's<00:03:17.170> no<00:03:17.470> more<00:03:17.590> wood<00:03:17.800> rot<00:03:17.980> which

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
one so there's no more wood rot which

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.530 
one so there's no more wood rot which
you<00:03:18.250> can<00:03:18.370> see<00:03:18.520> we've<00:03:18.670> had<00:03:18.850> no<00:03:19.000> more<00:03:19.180> wood<00:03:19.330> rot

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
you can see we've had no more wood rot

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.300 
you can see we've had no more wood rot
sense<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:21.160> then<00:03:21.940> you<00:03:22.810> can<00:03:23.070> see<00:03:24.070> that<00:03:24.250> I

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
sense and then you can see that I

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.800 
sense and then you can see that I
tapered<00:03:24.640> it<00:03:24.730> flush<00:03:25.150> so<00:03:25.270> that<00:03:25.390> you<00:03:25.510> can<00:03:25.660> edge

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
tapered it flush so that you can edge

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.660 
tapered it flush so that you can edge
easily<00:03:26.350> so<00:03:26.530> that's<00:03:26.650> an<00:03:26.860> explanation<00:03:27.130> for<00:03:27.520> why

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
easily so that's an explanation for why

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.340 
easily so that's an explanation for why
this<00:03:28.240> board<00:03:28.540> is<00:03:28.630> tapered<00:03:28.960> the<00:03:29.020> way<00:03:29.140> it<00:03:29.230> is<00:03:29.320> on

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
this board is tapered the way it is on

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.860 
this board is tapered the way it is on
this<00:03:29.620> side
