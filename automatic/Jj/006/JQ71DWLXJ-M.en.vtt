00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.210
 Hello, my name is Dmitry 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.640
 reftinsky 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.309
 in this video we'll talk about 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.889
 how to assemble the wardrobe compartment at home 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.719
 conditions to begin with you need to spend 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.889
 preliminary measurement to within 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.500
 one centimeter 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.240
 based on the data obtained draw 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.340
 sketch of the future wardrobe 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.500
 here you need to determine what will be 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:28.859
 internal equipment and appearance 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:31.769
 cabinet take a simple sheet and 4 formats in 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.739
 In our case, the cabinet length is three 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.760
 meters we want us to have three 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.629
 doors and 4 inner sections 1 section for 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.180
 long things the second section of the sticks 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.680
 third section for short items 4 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.660
 ironing board section with 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.320
 additional shelves and withdrawable 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.989
 drawers 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.390
 if we have three doors then the width of each 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.239
 doors 1 meter far right door 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.760
 overlaps two sections so section 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.010
 for long things we do 60 wide 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.989
 centimeters a section for shelves 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.170
 do in two compartments of 40 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.229
 centimeters left door should block 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.970
 fourth section and part 3 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.580
 reserve 15 centimeters for ironing 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.310
 board and 50 under the section with withdrawable 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.939
 boxes and thus the width of the heart 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.060
 under short clothes 95 centimeters so 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:28.220
 how short clothes are more than long in 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.220
 the result is a sketch like this 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.550
 you find a company for manufacturing 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.140
 parts for the future cabinet 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.720
 manufacturing sliding doors shelves and 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.700
 additive parts better put on 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.920
 manufacturing company is extremely not 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.920
 We recommend to refer to the so-called 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.390
 the master of the garage is the third now you 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.030
 measure accurately 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.730
 as follows if it is a niche like 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.220
 In our case, the dimensions are taken in three 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.190
 points inside the niche and at two points 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.930
 outside width 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.760
 we make measurements with an accuracy of three 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.520
 millimeters and rounded to a smaller 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.830
 side of the obtained dimensions 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.290
 choose minimal and it will be width 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.050
 your closet for doors 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.150
 we measure the external height and niche width 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:19.340
 as external dimensions may vary 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:22.280
 from internal with this and the size whether you 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.440
 traveling company where you make a drawing and 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.430
 order there the necessary items for 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.220
 future cabinet 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.450
 fifth on receipt of these items 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.420
 start assembly 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.900
 assembly for example will produce our 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.640
 wizard installer denis first build 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.640
 the closet starts with one of the side 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.620
 sections to begin with we will assemble a section with 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.780
 drawers and space for 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.250
 ironing boards 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.360
 set the amplifier for stability 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.360
 and rigidity of the structure 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.080
 the second we put decorative caps on 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.860
 those screws that will be difficult to access 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.270
 after installing the bottom shelf third 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.270
 we put shelves 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.069
 fourth install section on her 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.709
 place in the corner we do not fasten to the wall 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:19.840
 5 we collect the second section from the other edge 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:22.909
 and also set in place the sixth 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.430
 we collect the central sections of the bottom 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.620
 power amplifier fasten immediately and 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.900
 We put plugs on those screws that 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.790
 will not be available after installing the bottom 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.970
 shelves 7 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.519
 if we have neighboring shelves at different 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.980
 height, we first install the shelves 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:45.170
 which is located below and then those 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:47.659
 which are above 8 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.859
 install the mezzanine and fix it 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.859
 and partitions wardrobe 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:03.890
 9 we attach the cabinet to the wall 10 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.970
 we establish elements of internal 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.970
 filling the cabinet 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.459

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.640
 then our top and bottom panels 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:54.510
 made of 25 meter long plates 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:05:00.090

 assembly will be about ten percent 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.460
 on its value 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.590
