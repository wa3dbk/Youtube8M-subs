00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.339
 greet you friends spring has come 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.570
 the weather every day more and more 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.750
 teasing us with its warmth 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.920
 luring you from cities you want somewhere 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.900
 go fishing in the mountains 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.590
 just somewhere to lie in the woods to breathe 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.340
 fresh air well and in such campaigns 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.869
 need to solve the issue of provisions often 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.660
 the stew helps us out 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.390
 not just a stew and stew home 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.899
 making my own speech today 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.230
 about how we cook this stew with our 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.760
 forces in this matter helps us autoclave 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.390
 which was a few years ago 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.670
 purchased from craftsmen 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:52.020
 actually these craftsmen he 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.860
 and our autoclave was made fit 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.730
 24 half-liter jars and here they are on the table 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.430
 in each of these cans is necessary 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:06.360
 put on two slips of laurel 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.049
 com peas black pepper and after such 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:15.170
 here's the fill dock on more tea 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:18.720
 a spoonful of salt after all these preparations 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.549
 the next task is cutting the meat in 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.110
 twenty four banks we take 12 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.549
 kilogram of choice 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.509
 fresh meat and sharp knives that are not 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.750
 nice to work 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.170
 cut them into small portions 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.920
 the pieces that fill the jars to 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.650
 the very top as soon as it is a procedure 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.630
 is ending 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.960
 the next stage is placing the cans in 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.689
 autoclave autoclave they fit in three 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.670
 tiers of ban banin each tier and 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.070
 own in this kind of it all 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.560
 I will prepare I will note that in 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.399
 autoclave added about a liter of water 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.860
 which will help 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:11.450
 stew our meat as you see here 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:14.930
 the result of filling cans with raw meat 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:19.459
 the next stage of my set in 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:23.470
 autoclave for days autoclave already has water 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:26.450
 about a liter as I said before 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:31.640
 we cover the banks with lids and 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:35.599
 don't spin well our autoclave 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:39.470
 filled to capacity and the next task 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:41.299
 it is to close the lid between of the clam and 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.650
 the lid will be large 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:50.090
 gasket and in order to squeeze 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.860
 all this reliably we use bolts and 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.950
 the nuts 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.870
 at first you can just do it with your fingers 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.930
 but then you have to reach out and 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.480
 keys 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.730
 because you need to do all this safely 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.349
 so that the cover does not tear off the gasket 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:13.360
 not broken in general then the process is simple and 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:16.970
 clear after the cap is installed 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:21.880
 on the autoclave it is placed on the gas 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:24.920
 gas burner 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.579
 exhibited the necessary pressure or rather 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.060
 pressure should reach two atmospheres 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:34.880
 and here with this pressure 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.600
 constantly have to watch meat 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:42.049
 stews about an hour after 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.329
 the extinguishing process is completed gas is turned off 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.819
 and the autoclave is cooling off 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:49.450
 he himself immediately remove the cover in no way 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:54.170
 the case can not be because everything will explode 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:58.010
 you need to cool gradually here autoclave 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:01.120
 already cool we pull out the cans and 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.120
 start spinning 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:08.959
 carry with hands accustomed to twisting 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:13.010
 in true movements, the banks turn into 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:15.139
 canned food can only say that 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.519
 the disadvantage of their canned food is that 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:21.950
 container glass principle we never 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.040
 there was no such case that we were in a campaign 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.870
 somewhere her 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:30.200
 it broke but by the way this option is not 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.320
 excluded so you just need to be 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:39.180
 careful and attentive exactly 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:43.920
 who in his backpack carries glass 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:47.520
 cans with the local stew as you see 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:52.590
 fat here is more true not fat fat not 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:56.010
 froze so that the banks are still warm well and 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.870
 In time, everything will work out in my opinion here. 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.720
 all twenty-four banks are exposed 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.030
 twisted 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.920
 the next step is to cool it all. 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:10.140
 the wealth we will use 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:13.470
 in our campaigns that are closest to us 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.660
 will ask so to speak and 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.150
 hardship but in quotes for someone this 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.790
 for us this joy rest on 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:24.330
 nature is unity with nature 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:27.450
 for this we actually climb out 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:30.650
 asphalt from exhaust to nature 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:34.680
 this is the end result of our efforts 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:40.640
 for example, two cans of braised meat is here 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:44.090
 frozen fat on top a centimeter and a half 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.090
 with meat 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.840
 in sauce 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:55.830
 but personally we will now open the jars 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:30.280
 such a stew we respect the purchase is no longer 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:34.200
 ate a long time and this favorite food of tourists in 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.200
 buckwheat with stew 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:41.100
 Yummy Thank you for your attention.
