00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
area but I'll just show you a look of

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.500 
area but I'll just show you a look of
kind<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.280> walking<00:01:02.489> into<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.000> stadium<00:01:03.239> it's

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
kind of walking into the stadium it's

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.670 
kind of walking into the stadium it's
kind<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.719> different<00:01:03.930> from<00:01:04.170> down<00:01:04.409> below<00:01:04.650> I

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
kind of different from down below I

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.830 
kind of different from down below I
think<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.250> gives<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> cooler<00:01:06.360> look<00:01:06.659> of

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
think this gives you a cooler look of

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.230 
think this gives you a cooler look of
what<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.080> might<00:01:07.229> look<00:01:07.409> like<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.770> real<00:01:07.950> life<00:01:08.240> but

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
what it might look like in real life but

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.149 
what it might look like in real life but
walking<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.840> end<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.350> stadium<00:01:10.590> these<00:01:10.979> are

them but out into the lobby this is the
common<00:04:00.239> area<00:04:00.390> I<00:04:00.810> think<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:01.620> looks<00:04:01.770> pretty<00:04:02.040> nice

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
and I'm sure this is where they hold

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.759
