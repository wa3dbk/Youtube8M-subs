borrego is going to make it appear
it's<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.400> seems<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.730> confirm<00:02:15.000> borrego<00:02:15.480> as<00:02:15.690> a

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
it's so it seems to confirm borrego as a

it's so it seems to confirm borrego as a

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
ways to make it more powerful the fact

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.520 
ways to make it more powerful the fact
is<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.090> he<00:02:57.300> basically<00:02:57.570> breeds<00:02:57.990> untapped

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
is is that he basically breeds untapped

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.960 
is is that he basically breeds untapped
all<00:02:58.740> your<00:02:58.860> permanence<00:02:59.310> whenever<00:02:59.610> he<00:02:59.760> deals

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
all your permanence whenever he deals

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.580 
all your permanence whenever he deals
damage<00:03:00.150> which<00:03:00.510> hopefully<00:03:00.690> means<00:03:01.020> that<00:03:01.230> return

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
damage which hopefully means that return

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.800 
damage which hopefully means that return
and<00:03:01.920> so<00:03:02.220> as<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.370> vulture<00:03:02.670> on<00:03:02.730> commander<00:03:03.270> will<00:03:03.660> be

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
and so as a vulture on commander will be

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.270 
and so as a vulture on commander will be
very<00:03:04.380> very<00:03:04.470> fun<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:04.980> build<00:03:05.100> around

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
very very fun to build around

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.950

potentially<00:03:05.700> very<00:03:06.000> powerful<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.540> won't<00:03:06.750> say

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
potentially very powerful I won't say

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.400 
potentially very powerful I won't say
he's<00:03:07.140> crazy<00:03:07.770> broken<00:03:08.280> in<00:03:08.430> any<00:03:08.550> sense<00:03:08.850> he's<00:03:09.000> not

he's crazy broken in any sense he's not

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.650 
he's crazy broken in any sense he's not
but<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.440> do<00:03:10.680> think<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.250> he'll<00:03:12.000> probably<00:03:12.300> have

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
but I do think that he'll probably have

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.410 
but I do think that he'll probably have
more<00:03:13.140> power<00:03:13.470> than<00:03:13.880> saying<00:03:14.880> I<00:03:14.970> think<00:03:15.180> geist

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
more power than saying I think geist

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.260 
more power than saying I think geist

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
saint traft does as a commander because

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.540 
saint traft does as a commander because

guys<00:03:21.300> is<00:03:21.570> is<00:03:22.050> a<00:03:22.110> weaker<00:03:22.590> card<00:03:22.920> but<00:03:23.910> also<00:03:24.150> guys

I<00:03:31.710> think<00:03:31.890> will<00:03:31.980> be<00:03:32.070> an<00:03:32.160> all-star<00:03:32.340> will

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700

I think will be an all-star will
probably<00:03:33.270> be<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.450> nice<00:03:33.720> card<00:03:34.050> for<00:03:34.320> flickr<00:03:34.620> decks

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
probably be a nice card for flickr decks

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.560 
probably be a nice card for flickr decks
it<00:03:35.100> fits<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.520> control<00:03:35.880> theme<00:03:36.210> it<00:03:36.390> fits

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
it fits the control theme it fits

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.960 
it fits the control theme it fits
everything<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:37.200> think<00:03:37.590> it's<00:03:37.680> very<00:03:38.190> very<00:03:38.730> cool

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
everything I think it's very very cool

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.120 
everything I think it's very very cool
and<00:03:39.240> it<00:03:40.230> will<00:03:40.350> see<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> lot<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.650> play<00:03:40.830> in<00:03:40.860> terms

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
and it will see a lot of play in terms

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.680 
and it will see a lot of play in terms
of<00:03:41.190> conspiracy<00:03:41.670> itself<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.180> limited<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:42.600> will

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
of conspiracy itself and limited it will

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.210 
of conspiracy itself and limited it will
probably<00:03:42.840> also<00:03:43.050> be<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.260> monster<00:03:43.500> giving<00:03:44.040> you

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220

resetting<00:03:44.910> your<00:03:44.940> board<00:03:45.240> will<00:03:45.420> pretty<00:03:45.600> much

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690

make control decks viable if he's your

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.460 
make control decks viable if he's your
card<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.480> reason<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.750> think<00:03:48.810> he's<00:03:48.960> a<00:03:48.990> cycle<00:03:49.410> is

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
card the reason I think he's a cycle is

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.570 
card the reason I think he's a cycle is
because<00:03:49.680> if<00:03:49.770> you<00:03:49.830> look<00:03:49.980> at<00:03:50.070> this<00:03:50.130> aren't<00:03:50.370> over

to be a little blurred it looks like

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.750

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
in the journey into Nick's I think it

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.620 
in the journey into Nick's I think it
came<00:04:20.400> in<00:04:20.520> a<00:04:20.580> drain<00:04:20.730> snake<00:04:20.760> spac<00:04:21.210> kind<00:04:21.480> of<00:04:21.540> like

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
came in a drain snake spac kind of like

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.050 
came in a drain snake spac kind of like
a<00:04:21.660> promotional<00:04:22.200> card<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.710> here<00:04:23.700> it<00:04:23.820> seems

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
a promotional card and here it seems

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.490 
a promotional card and here it seems
kind<00:04:24.300> of<00:04:24.360> sliced<00:04:24.630> off<00:04:24.840> but<00:04:25.050> it<00:04:25.169> just<00:04:25.320> says

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
kind of sliced off but it just says

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.050 
kind of sliced off but it just says
conspiracy<00:04:26.160> and<00:04:26.400> then

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
conspiracy and then

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.970 
conspiracy and then
some<00:04:27.419> stuff<00:04:27.630> for<00:04:27.810> dad<00:04:27.990> is<00:04:28.169> a<00:04:28.230> new<00:04:28.680> spin<00:04:28.919> on

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980

drafting<00:04:29.580> exciting<00:04:29.910> new<00:04:30.000> abilities<00:04:30.389> like

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
drafting exciting new abilities like

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.810 
drafting exciting new abilities like
this<00:04:31.320> this<00:04:31.560> is<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:31.919> they<00:04:31.980> left<00:04:32.190> some<00:04:32.520> letters

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
this this is and they left some letters

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.390 
this this is and they left some letters
free<00:04:33.690> so<00:04:34.260> you<00:04:34.290> probably<00:04:34.620> guess<00:04:35.010> at<00:04:35.160> some<00:04:35.190> of

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
free so you probably guess at some of

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.100 
free so you probably guess at some of
them<00:04:35.490> to<00:04:36.150> defeat<00:04:36.360> your<00:04:36.419> enemies<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:36.780> cover

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
them to defeat your enemies and cover

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.600 
them to defeat your enemies and cover

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
new imagens first time ever something

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.730 
new imagens first time ever something
something<00:04:39.150> so<00:04:39.690> this<00:04:39.930> cards<00:04:40.200> pretty<00:04:40.440> sure<00:04:40.590> its

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
something so this cards pretty sure its

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.080 
something so this cards pretty sure its
real<00:04:40.800> it<00:04:41.220> makes<00:04:41.430> sense<00:04:41.580> that<00:04:41.730> they<00:04:41.820> would<00:04:41.880> have

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
real it makes sense that they would have

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.970 
real it makes sense that they would have
