quantum instrumentation telling me that
JJ's<00:00:20.119> didn't<00:00:21.320> have<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:23.029> quantum<00:00:24.029> vibrations

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
JJ's didn't have the quantum vibrations

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.179 
JJ's didn't have the quantum vibrations

those<00:00:43.020> areas<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.620> body<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.969> from<00:00:45.629> memory

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
those areas of body and that from memory

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.380 
those areas of body and that from memory
I<00:00:46.260> haven't<00:00:46.739> fully<00:00:47.340> checked<00:00:47.610> my<00:00:47.820> records<00:00:48.030> but

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
I haven't fully checked my records but

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.360 
I haven't fully checked my records but
from<00:00:48.600> memory<00:00:48.930> his<00:00:49.200> general<00:00:49.530> vitality<00:00:50.070> was

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
from memory his general vitality was

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.290 
from memory his general vitality was
very<00:00:50.789> very<00:00:51.059> low<00:00:51.649> I<00:00:52.649> think<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.340> was<00:00:53.430> down<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.730> 68

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
very very low I think it was down to 68

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.680 
very very low I think it was down to 68
if<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.719> remember<00:00:55.110> correctly<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:56.000> his<00:00:58.190> zero<00:00:59.190> is

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
if I remember correctly and his zero is

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.850 
if I remember correctly and his zero is
basically<00:01:00.739> pretty<00:01:01.739> close<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.100> Jin<00:01:02.309> bones<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
basically pretty close to Jin bones and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.370 
basically pretty close to Jin bones and
he<00:01:04.860> didn't<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:06.060> all<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.270> long<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.900> live<00:01:07.110> I

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
he didn't have all that long to live I

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.530 
he didn't have all that long to live I
knew<00:01:08.040> things<00:01:08.250> were<00:01:08.490> serious<00:01:08.909> but<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.270> didn't

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
knew things were serious but I didn't

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.530 
knew things were serious but I didn't
know<00:01:09.630> what<00:01:09.810> they<00:01:09.960> were<00:01:10.909> until<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:11.939> brought<00:01:12.299> on

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
know what they were until we brought on

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.020 
know what they were until we brought on
probably<00:01:13.530> off<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.920> quantum<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.400> suspected

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
probably off of the quantum I suspected

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.020 
probably off of the quantum I suspected
that<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.450> maybe<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.820> papillomavirus<00:01:17.820> or

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
that in maybe a a papillomavirus or

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.370 
that in maybe a a papillomavirus or
herpes<00:01:18.590> virus<00:01:19.590> involved<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.310> his<00:01:21.080> little<00:01:22.080> toe

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
herpes virus involved in his little toe

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.380 
herpes virus involved in his little toe
where<00:01:23.369> he<00:01:23.460> felt<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> little<00:01:23.820> watery<00:01:24.240> like

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
where he felt a little watery like

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.080 
where he felt a little watery like
structure<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.140> was<00:01:25.290> secluded<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.100> but

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
structure and that was secluded that but

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.749 
structure and that was secluded that but
I<00:01:27.299> didn't<00:01:27.750> put<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:27.990> together<00:01:28.590> with<00:01:29.070> his<00:01:29.549> ear

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
I didn't put that together with his ear

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.249 
I didn't put that together with his ear
problem<00:01:30.119> because<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.390> haven't<00:01:30.600> recognized

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
problem because I haven't recognized

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.880 
problem because I haven't recognized
papilloma<00:01:31.829> before<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:33.180> know<00:01:33.270> but<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.600> go<00:01:33.890> so

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
papilloma before you know but we go so

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.249 
papilloma before you know but we go so
this<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.700> me<00:01:35.820> at<00:01:36.150> least<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.689> first<00:01:37.049> on

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
this for me at least is the first on

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.330 
this for me at least is the first on
many<00:01:37.439> occasions<00:01:38.040> first<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.460> all<00:01:41.509> finding

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
many occasions first of all finding

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.109 
many occasions first of all finding
evidence<00:01:44.340> for<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.200> parameter<00:01:46.200> budgie<00:01:47.119> secondly

evidence for a parameter budgie secondly

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.109 
evidence for a parameter budgie secondly
for<00:01:48.890> learning<00:01:49.890> about<00:01:49.920> from<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.430> distribution

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
for learning about from the distribution

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.499 
for learning about from the distribution
of<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.509> viruses<00:01:52.020> vibrations<00:01:53.000> in<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.149> bungee

of the viruses vibrations in a bungee

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.649 
of the viruses vibrations in a bungee
and<00:01:54.810> there's

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
and there's

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.330 
and there's
lots<00:01:55.930> of<00:01:56.049> details<00:01:56.439> that<00:01:56.590> we<00:01:56.890> could<00:01:57.070> share

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
lots of details that we could share

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.920 
lots of details that we could share
we'll<00:01:57.729> just<00:01:57.880> keep<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.180> general<00:01:58.450> principles

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
we'll just keep the general principles

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.510 
we'll just keep the general principles
and<00:02:00.780> thirdly<00:02:01.780> for<00:02:02.409> seeing<00:02:02.979> a<00:02:03.130> little<00:02:03.340> bugger

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
and thirdly for seeing a little bugger

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.180 
and thirdly for seeing a little bugger
you<00:02:03.700> know<00:02:03.880> that<00:02:04.090> where<00:02:04.270> we've<00:02:04.479> stopped

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
you know that where we've stopped

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.300 
you know that where we've stopped
traditional<00:02:06.190> treatment<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.970> supplements

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
traditional treatment and supplements

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.690 
traditional treatment and supplements
getting<00:02:09.310> better<00:02:09.489> on<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:09.970> way<00:02:10.899> to<00:02:11.709> improving

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
getting better on the way to improving

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.820 
getting better on the way to improving
so<00:02:13.360> we're<00:02:13.569> going<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.870> have<00:02:13.989> a<00:02:14.020> look<00:02:14.140> today<00:02:14.350> and

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
so we're going to have a look today and

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.550 
so we're going to have a look today and
see<00:02:15.459> how<00:02:15.670> much<00:02:15.970> better<00:02:16.209> he's<00:02:16.390> got<00:02:16.630> have<00:02:17.410> of

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
see how much better he's got have of

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.010 
see how much better he's got have of
these<00:02:17.770> this<00:02:18.190> year<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.330> side<00:02:19.569> of<00:02:19.690> his<00:02:19.810> face

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
these this year and the side of his face

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.500 
these this year and the side of his face
but<00:02:20.380> he<00:02:20.830> looks<00:02:21.069> from<00:02:21.489> either<00:02:21.730> their<00:02:21.970> canoe

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510
