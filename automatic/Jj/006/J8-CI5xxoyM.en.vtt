has a really really great way of saying
this<00:04:55.400> would<00:04:55.639> not<00:04:55.820> be<00:04:55.880> a<00:04:56.090> simple<00:04:56.750> process<00:04:56.960> this

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
this would not be a simple process this

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.140 
this would not be a simple process this
would<00:04:57.620> be<00:04:57.740> complicated<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.580> relationships

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
would be complicated the relationships

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.659 
would be complicated the relationships
will<00:04:59.270> be<00:04:59.360> complicated<00:05:00.050> what<00:05:01.009> seems<00:05:01.340> like<00:05:01.639> a

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
will be complicated what seems like a

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.189 
will be complicated what seems like a
good<00:05:01.970> thing<00:05:02.210> for<00:05:02.330> somebody<00:05:02.599> to<00:05:02.660> do<00:05:02.810> might<00:05:03.020> turn

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 
good thing for somebody to do might turn

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.200 
good thing for somebody to do might turn
out<00:05:03.259> to<00:05:03.320> be<00:05:03.470> a<00:05:03.500> bad<00:05:03.680> thing<00:05:03.740> and<00:05:04.190> the<00:05:04.729> other<00:05:04.910> side

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
out to be a bad thing and the other side

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.300 
out to be a bad thing and the other side
might<00:05:05.449> be<00:05:05.599> doing<00:05:05.840> just<00:05:05.870> as<00:05:06.169> much<00:05:06.320> good<00:05:07.009> for

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
might be doing just as much good for

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.589 
might be doing just as much good for
their<00:05:07.430> people<00:05:07.610> at<00:05:07.940> least<00:05:08.090> they<00:05:08.210> think<00:05:08.270> they

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
their people at least they think they

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.570 
their people at least they think they
are<00:05:08.630> and<00:05:09.080> they're<00:05:09.830> just<00:05:10.009> kind<00:05:10.280> of<00:05:10.340> at<00:05:10.460> odds

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
are and they're just kind of at odds

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.270 
are and they're just kind of at odds
there's<00:05:11.000> lots<00:05:11.240> of<00:05:11.419> lessons<00:05:11.599> here<00:05:11.990> about<00:05:12.280> the

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
there's lots of lessons here about the

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.600 
there's lots of lessons here about the
clashing<00:05:13.699> of<00:05:13.789> cultures<00:05:14.240> and<00:05:14.539> nations<00:05:15.229> and<00:05:15.770> the

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
clashing of cultures and nations and the

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.339 
clashing of cultures and nations and the
differences<00:05:17.060> between<00:05:17.120> opinions<00:05:17.960> and<00:05:18.199> what

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
differences between opinions and what

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:20.020 
differences between opinions and what
maybe<00:05:18.650> religions<00:05:19.160> do<00:05:19.400> I<00:05:19.430> mean<00:05:19.669> you<00:05:19.729> can<00:05:19.849> draw

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
maybe religions do I mean you can draw

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.450 
maybe religions do I mean you can draw
all<00:05:20.120> kinds<00:05:20.150> of<00:05:20.449> comparisons<00:05:20.750> but<00:05:21.710> I<00:05:21.949> thought

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
all kinds of comparisons but I thought

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.070 
all kinds of comparisons but I thought
it<00:05:22.610> was<00:05:22.699> handled<00:05:22.940> really<00:05:23.150> well<00:05:23.300> it<00:05:23.720> was<00:05:23.900> not

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
it was handled really well it was not

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.409 
it was handled really well it was not
handled<00:05:24.560> to<00:05:25.099> simply<00:05:25.520> or<00:05:25.669> easily<00:05:26.030> they<00:05:26.180> didn't

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
handled to simply or easily they didn't

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.029 
handled to simply or easily they didn't
just<00:05:26.780> have<00:05:26.990> a<00:05:27.020> happy<00:05:27.349> ending<00:05:27.620> and<00:05:27.740> everybody

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
just have a happy ending and everybody

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:30.939 
just have a happy ending and everybody
live<00:05:28.280> they<00:05:29.090> made<00:05:29.750> hard<00:05:30.020> choices<00:05:30.080> they<00:05:30.800> also

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
live they made hard choices they also

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.159 
live they made hard choices they also
made<00:05:31.130> it<00:05:31.250> very<00:05:31.370> clear<00:05:31.430> at<00:05:31.699> the<00:05:31.789> end<00:05:31.940> that<00:05:32.690> while

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
made it very clear at the end that while

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.010 
made it very clear at the end that while
in<00:05:33.620> the<00:05:34.520> moment<00:05:34.940> you<00:05:35.090> might<00:05:35.240> find<00:05:35.449> some<00:05:35.599> common

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
in the moment you might find some common

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.620 
in the moment you might find some common
ground<00:05:36.520> there's<00:05:37.520> a<00:05:37.789> war<00:05:38.240> that's<00:05:38.389> going<00:05:38.479> to

ground there's a war that's going to

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.969 
ground there's a war that's going to
happen<00:05:38.810> whether<00:05:39.139> people<00:05:39.380> want<00:05:39.590> it<00:05:39.740> to<00:05:39.830> or<00:05:39.949> not
