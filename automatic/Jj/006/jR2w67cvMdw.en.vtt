lawn service run over the sprinkler head
back<00:00:39.019> at<00:00:39.319> the<00:00:39.530> end<00:00:39.739> of<00:00:40.190> last<00:00:40.489> summer<00:00:40.819> so<00:00:41.749> it

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.989 
back at the end of last summer so it
really<00:00:42.260> wasn't<00:00:42.469> a<00:00:42.620> concern<00:00:42.829> something<00:00:43.699> to<00:00:43.789> fix

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:43.999

really wasn't a concern something to fix
right<00:00:44.179> then<00:00:44.449> but<00:00:45.289> now<00:00:45.440> with<00:00:45.649> summer<00:00:45.889> coming<00:00:45.979> up

head<00:00:54.559> it's<00:00:55.039> a<00:00:55.069> pretty<00:00:55.249> simple<00:00:55.639> job<00:00:55.749> not<00:00:56.749> much

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
head it's a pretty simple job not much

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.809 
head it's a pretty simple job not much
to<00:00:57.199> it<00:00:57.229> at<00:00:57.499> least<00:00:57.649> it<00:00:57.859> should<00:00:58.129> be<00:00:58.339> that<00:00:58.549> way

00:00:58.809 --> 00:00:58.819 
to it at least it should be that way

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:01.889 
to it at least it should be that way
we'll<00:00:59.600> see<00:00:59.870> all<00:01:00.199> projects<00:01:01.039> are<00:01:01.219> an<00:01:01.429> adventure

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
we'll see all projects are an adventure

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.299 
we'll see all projects are an adventure
so<00:01:02.899> we'll<00:01:03.139> see<00:01:03.289> what<00:01:03.440> we<00:01:03.469> have<00:01:03.739> when<00:01:03.979> we<00:01:04.100> dig

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
so we'll see what we have when we dig

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.340 
so we'll see what we have when we dig
down<00:01:04.610> underneath<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:05.659> top<00:01:05.900> of<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:06.110> sprinkler

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
down underneath the top of the sprinkler

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.410 
down underneath the top of the sprinkler
head<00:01:06.680> but<00:01:07.580> today<00:01:07.790> we're<00:01:07.970> just<00:01:08.000> going<00:01:08.390> to

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
head but today we're just going to

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.780 
head but today we're just going to
replace<00:01:08.750> it<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:09.229> then<00:01:10.130> you<00:01:10.310> will<00:01:10.430> have<00:01:10.580> to

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
replace it and then you will have to

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.880 
replace it and then you will have to
adjust<00:01:11.060> it<00:01:11.480> to<00:01:11.690> make<00:01:12.470> sure<00:01:12.620> that<00:01:12.740> it's

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890

the<00:01:19.490> project<00:01:19.810> okay<00:01:20.810> here<00:01:21.050> we<00:01:21.170> have<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.470> old

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.320 
the project okay here we have the old
sprinkler<00:01:22.070> head<00:01:22.280> you<00:01:22.490> can<00:01:22.610> actually<00:01:22.790> see<00:01:23.180> that

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
sprinkler head you can actually see that

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.580 
sprinkler head you can actually see that
it's<00:01:23.480> a<00:01:23.570> little<00:01:23.660> bit<00:01:23.780> at<00:01:23.930> an<00:01:24.020> angle<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:24.470> it's

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
it's a little bit at an angle so it's

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.890 
it's a little bit at an angle so it's
been<00:01:24.740> run<00:01:24.890> over<00:01:24.920> more<00:01:25.340> than<00:01:25.460> once<00:01:25.730> if<00:01:26.600> you<00:01:26.720> look

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
been run over more than once if you look

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.300 
been run over more than once if you look
real<00:01:27.110> close<00:01:27.530> you<00:01:28.010> can<00:01:28.550> see<00:01:28.820> that<00:01:29.860> the<00:01:30.860> top<00:01:31.070> was

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
real close you can see that the top was

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.170 
real close you can see that the top was
sheared<00:01:31.610> off<00:01:31.790> by<00:01:32.300> a<00:01:32.330> lawn<00:01:32.660> mower<00:01:32.870> blade<00:01:34.180> for

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
sheared off by a lawn mower blade for

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.730 
sheared off by a lawn mower blade for
this<00:01:35.270> project<00:01:35.510> you<00:01:35.840> shouldn't<00:01:36.170> need<00:01:36.290> a<00:01:36.350> whole

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
this project you shouldn't need a whole

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.910 
this project you shouldn't need a whole
lot<00:01:36.770> of<00:01:37.130> tools<00:01:38.170> basically<00:01:39.170> just<00:01:39.320> a<00:01:39.440> trial<00:01:39.710> to

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
lot of tools basically just a trial to

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.770 
lot of tools basically just a trial to
dig<00:01:40.070> around<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.610> old<00:01:40.880> sprinkler<00:01:41.330> head<00:01:41.540> and

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
dig around the old sprinkler head and

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.940 
dig around the old sprinkler head and
some<00:01:42.970> silicone<00:01:43.970> tape<00:01:44.320> you<00:01:45.320> can<00:01:45.470> see<00:01:45.680> with<00:01:45.830> the

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
some silicone tape you can see with the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.710 
some silicone tape you can see with the
new<00:01:46.160> one<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:46.700> this<00:01:47.030> is<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.240> way<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.450> old<00:01:47.570> one

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
new one and this is the way the old one

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.780 
new one and this is the way the old one
is<00:01:47.870> -<00:01:48.080> it's<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.470> threaded<00:01:49.010> connection<00:01:49.550> so<00:01:49.730> it

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
is - it's a threaded connection so it

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.730 
is - it's a threaded connection so it
should<00:01:50.000> just<00:01:50.030> thread<00:01:50.480> down<00:01:50.659> on<00:01:50.870> there<00:01:51.140> with

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
have an adventure with these projects so

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.300 
have an adventure with these projects so
this<00:02:35.170> may<00:02:35.350> not<00:02:35.380> be<00:02:35.709> as<00:02:35.890> simple<00:02:36.340> as<00:02:36.520> I<00:02:36.910> expected

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
this may not be as simple as I expected

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.030 
this may not be as simple as I expected
hey<00:02:39.420> we<00:02:40.420> just<00:02:40.570> left<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:41.020> Home<00:02:41.260> Depot<00:02:41.440> as<00:02:41.800> you

hey we just left the Home Depot as you

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.860 
hey we just left the Home Depot as you
can<00:02:42.160> probably<00:02:42.310> see<00:02:42.520> behind<00:02:42.820> me<00:02:42.880> we<00:02:43.630> had<00:02:43.780> to

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
can probably see behind me we had to

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.390 
can probably see behind me we had to
make<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.020> quick<00:02:44.290> trip<00:02:44.319> there<00:02:44.709> because<00:02:44.980> our<00:02:45.220> new

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
make a quick trip there because our new

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.180 
make a quick trip there because our new
sprinkler<00:02:45.850> head<00:02:46.090> doesn't<00:02:46.780> match<00:02:47.140> with<00:02:47.739> the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
sprinkler head doesn't match with the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:55.729 
sprinkler head doesn't match with the
threaded<00:02:48.700> nipple<00:02:50.040> down<00:02:51.040> inside<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:54.310> ground

threaded nipple down inside the ground

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.930 
threaded nipple down inside the ground
you<00:02:56.739> can<00:02:56.860> see<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.100> just<00:02:57.160> slips<00:02:57.610> in<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:57.820> out

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
you can see it just slips in and out

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.259 
you can see it just slips in and out
it's<00:02:58.150> supposed<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.390> be<00:02:58.510> threaded<00:02:58.930> and<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:01.120> we

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
it's supposed to be threaded and so we

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.540 
it's supposed to be threaded and so we
had<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.600> get<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:02.080> reduction<00:03:03.070> bushing<00:03:03.940> or<00:03:05.550> a

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
had to get a reduction bushing or a

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.490 
had to get a reduction bushing or a
flush<00:03:06.970> bushing<00:03:07.480> as<00:03:07.630> this<00:03:07.780> one's<00:03:07.989> called<00:03:08.170> it

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500
