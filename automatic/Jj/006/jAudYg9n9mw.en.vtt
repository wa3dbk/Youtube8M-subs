that right yep so what does this help
with<00:03:56.280> it<00:03:56.640> just<00:03:56.880> slows<00:03:57.150> down<00:03:57.420> the<00:03:57.600> process<00:03:57.780> or

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
with it just slows down the process or

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.710 
with it just slows down the process or
yeah<00:03:59.070> how<00:03:59.340> I<00:03:59.370> kind<00:03:59.730> of<00:03:59.790> think<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.330> it<00:04:00.480> is

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
yeah how I kind of think of it is

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.140 
yeah how I kind of think of it is
outrunning<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.709> because<00:04:02.520> it's<00:04:02.670> not<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.820> cure

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
outrunning it because it's not a cure

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.550 
outrunning it because it's not a cure
it's<00:04:03.300> not<00:04:03.450> gonna<00:04:03.570> eradicate<00:04:04.110> it<00:04:04.200> from<00:04:04.230> my<00:04:04.380> body

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
it's not gonna eradicate it from my body

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.790 
it's not gonna eradicate it from my body
but<00:04:04.770> I'm<00:04:05.010> thinking<00:04:05.580> that<00:04:05.760> if<00:04:06.030> we<00:04:06.090> can<00:04:06.480> just

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
but I'm thinking that if we can just

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.560 
but I'm thinking that if we can just
build<00:04:07.800> up<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.220> muscle<00:04:08.580> quickly<00:04:08.970> then<00:04:09.330> you<00:04:09.360> can

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
build up the muscle quickly then you can

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.890 
build up the muscle quickly then you can
outrun<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:10.110> yes<00:04:10.470> keep<00:04:10.860> me<00:04:11.160> healthy<00:04:11.720> is<00:04:12.720> this

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
outrun it yes keep me healthy is this

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.050 
outrun it yes keep me healthy is this
rare<00:04:13.200> this<00:04:13.470> is<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.739> FSH<00:04:14.220> yeah

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
rare this is a FSH yeah

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.490
