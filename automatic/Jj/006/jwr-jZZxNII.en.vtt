the bottom plate and repainted it and I
touched<00:01:35.020> up<00:01:35.260> on<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:36.190> top<00:01:36.400> okay<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:38.530> let<00:01:39.010> me

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
touched up on the top okay so let me

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:48.950 
touched up on the top okay so let me
show<00:01:39.130> you<00:01:39.370> how<00:01:39.549> it<00:01:39.790> works

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:58.790 

give<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.130> little<00:01:50.900> close-up<00:01:56.000> okay<00:01:57.770> now<00:01:58.770> I

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
give you a little close-up okay now I

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.330 
give you a little close-up okay now I
did<00:01:59.130> her<00:01:59.220> patterns<00:01:59.670> earlier<00:02:00.950> when<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:01.979> do<00:02:02.100> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
did her patterns earlier when I do the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.700 
did her patterns earlier when I do the
patterns<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.060> do<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.780> top<00:02:03.990> buttons

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
patterns I just do the the top buttons

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.610 
patterns I just do the the top buttons
pretty<00:02:05.370> much<00:02:05.610> if<00:02:05.940> I<00:02:06.150> get<00:02:06.360> those<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.900> all<00:02:07.410> the

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
pretty much if I get those in all the

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.279 
pretty much if I get those in all the
other<00:02:07.770> patterns<00:02:08.250> are<00:02:08.520> going<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.030> fall<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.020> line

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
other patterns are going to fall in line

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.960 
other patterns are going to fall in line
because<00:02:10.770> those<00:02:10.979> are<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.280> major<00:02:11.430> ones<00:02:11.580> that

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
because those are the major ones that

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.420 
because those are the major ones that
work<00:02:12.660> all<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.990> rest<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.350> patterns<00:02:13.770> that

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
work all the rest of the patterns that

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.630 
work all the rest of the patterns that
are<00:02:14.580> in<00:02:15.180> combination<00:02:15.930> but<00:02:16.340> these<00:02:17.340> are<00:02:17.520> her

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
are in combination but these are her

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.150 
are in combination but these are her
patterns<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:19.470> came<00:02:19.740> out<00:02:19.980> all<00:02:20.970> right<00:02:22.160> and

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
patterns that came out all right and

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.140 
patterns that came out all right and
I'll<00:02:24.150> show<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:25.310> we'll<00:02:26.310> do<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.489> little<00:02:26.670> selling

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.660 
okay on that now I have the Kansas
canvas<00:03:16.020> this<00:03:16.230> is<00:03:16.290> four<00:03:16.680> layers<00:03:16.890> of<00:03:17.040> canvas

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:28.880 

through<00:03:20.670> that<00:03:24.319> sounds<00:03:25.319> a<00:03:25.380> little<00:03:25.500> louder<00:03:27.890> it's

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
through that sounds a little louder it's

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.850 
through that sounds a little louder it's
okay<00:03:29.390> like<00:03:30.390> I've<00:03:30.540> said<00:03:30.720> before<00:03:30.780> canvas<00:03:31.680> is<00:03:31.830> a

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
okay like I've said before canvas is a

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.130 
okay like I've said before canvas is a
lot<00:03:32.100> denser<00:03:32.480> then<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:36.180> other<00:03:36.360> fabrics<00:03:36.930> and

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
lot denser then the other fabrics and

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.509 
lot denser then the other fabrics and
stuff<00:03:37.380> so<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.739> sounds<00:03:38.310> a<00:03:38.370> lot<00:03:38.489> louder

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
stuff so it sounds a lot louder

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.280
