00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
would say the easiest thing for me was

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.909 
would say the easiest thing for me was
probably<00:06:27.199> the<00:06:27.380> diet<00:06:27.820> if<00:06:28.820> I<00:06:29.000> eat<00:06:29.240> pretty<00:06:29.449> clean

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 
probably the diet if I eat pretty clean

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:34.390 
probably the diet if I eat pretty clean
on<00:06:30.919> a<00:06:30.979> regular<00:06:31.220> basis<00:06:31.669> anyway<00:06:32.030> so<00:06:33.220> the<00:06:34.220> hardest

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 
on a regular basis anyway so the hardest

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.670 
on a regular basis anyway so the hardest
thing<00:06:34.669> was<00:06:34.940> trying<00:06:35.840> to<00:06:35.900> get<00:06:35.960> in<00:06:36.110> enough<00:06:36.349> sleep
