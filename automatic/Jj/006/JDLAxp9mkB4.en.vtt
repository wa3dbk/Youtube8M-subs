00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.710
 hi hi all today I find 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.379
 for a new video where I'm going to 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.799
 present a design from a factory to 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.690
 coal 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.269
 So the design is done by Mrs. Mbow 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.790
 jumbo you can find a link for 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.890
 his video in the description is a 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.970
 very fast one minute tutorial 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.820
 I 'll explain a little 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.650
 little longer the operation 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.289
 so what is this factory 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.570
 here I place my wood here I have my 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.250
 coal coming in and it's a factory 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.529
 which turns totally automatically there 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.200
 you can see it i'm going to remove 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.420
 by the way totally the charcot here 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.770
 for you to see at the moment 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.690
 where I will come back after the construction 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.570
 we will have char colba here is 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.980
 already sent his product from the garden glue 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.050
 with the wood we put here the raw wood 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.840
 so how is it made is very 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.289
 very simple it is very very compact 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.760
 especially it is in 2 x 4 x 6 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.340
 end I will put the dimensions all 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.770
 way in the title surely how that 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.719
 is building you need a platform 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.420
 of the cost of 6 out of two you place a 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.610
 hopper then hopper as a result 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.740
 like that you put a hopper that goes 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.049
 in this drop earl has therefore yielded dropper 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.930
 to me not OPR above I 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:20.009
 put an oven here I put a hopper that 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.340
 goes to the oven there over double 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.290
 chest here is a hopper that goes to this 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.320
 oven and for the redstone part very 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.110
 simple a comparator a beam of 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.979
 stay here and a middle block and that's the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.360
 construction is complete 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.560
 so as I said if you want 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.979
 see the construction could see it 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.890
 also in his video to him so very 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.810
 simple is here to turn on the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.079
 system so I need to put some 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.180
 wood 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.430
 normal so the wood will go in the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.530
 oven and game but I need to put 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.540
 a tank sticks here and there 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.299
 machined and after a while I 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.439
 will come back there will be some glue here 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.820
 so how does it work I you 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:02.610
 explained a little bit very simply 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:07.039
 so here you put the wood so the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.569
 wood pass duo bitter fear directly 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.959
 then once it is cooked 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.209
 this hopper retrieves him brings in this 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.099
 drop hour there he puts it in this drop 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.129
 hour there that he puts it in his rights 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.219
 by that and that he takes in the trunk there 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.409
 up is there up 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:27.209
 here we were afraid that they would recover the 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.790
 trunk items if we ever miss 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.920
 charcot so all the charcot in fact that 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.409
 you will produce the first school tank 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.689
 who's going to arrive he's going to serve 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:39.450
 here is feeding the oven so all the 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:41.730
 school tank that will happen at the beginning he goes 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.269
 back in the oven forever he 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.919
 there is food then once 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.790
 that this oven will be full in char glue 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:53.879
 so the age to simulate the one who has in 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.900
 too much so the surplus of tanks pass of 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:59.849
 coal will come in this hopper here it is 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.650
 which is normal since it is in 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.650
 Basically it is used to reserves 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.519
 feed the oven here then 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.980
 so we will do the same thing once 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.000
 that this one is full so it puts a 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.290
 little moment to fill 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.419
 so this one you are obliged 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.889
 to wait for them to fill up 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:22.439
 take a little while but but 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:26.310
 frankly it's worth it 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:29.609
 once this hopper is full there 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.790
 means that the oven is charged to him the 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.709
 hopper that is used to power the oven is 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.540
 loaded also and suddenly all the 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.959
 surplus will remain in the trunk 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.069
 so we can see here here is the time 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.489
 that I build and that I speak a 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.379
 little bit that already it has already harvested 16 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.599
 coal so it's a coal plant 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.579
 which is self-powered in fact that's the 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.959
 single thing only thing you have to 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.209
 to actually do is to feed 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.739
 put wood so the only problem of 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.239
 his cooking but it's not very serious 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.739
 but the only thing is we put a 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.290
 moment before getting coal because 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.930
 that the oven must be full and that 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.389
 is being full so in fact there is 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.069
 cistac of charcot that you are not going 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.719
 see in fact so they will be done 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.150
 and once these six taxes have done 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:13.199
 all the rest all the surplus will be 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.409
 for you in the trunk 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:18.479
 so here I hope that the video you 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.620
 will be pleased if this is the case do not hesitate to 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.880
 put in glass jar etc etc 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.860
 and do not hesitate especially go make a 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.349
 turn on the chain of even jumbo who 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.370
 is a super youtuber English speakers that's 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.210
 for that I make this video it's 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.219
 because I know that many have a 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.020
 little trouble with with English so 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:33.210
 this is not ethical, and that's 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.990
 super good what makes so here I 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.010
 find you for a new video 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.010
 ciao world month
