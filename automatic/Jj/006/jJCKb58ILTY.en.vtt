so<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.790> cross<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.439> his<00:01:46.439> ability

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
so that you can cross it and his ability

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.679 
so that you can cross it and his ability
is<00:01:46.920> he's<00:01:47.100> able<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.579> slow<00:01:47.880> down<00:01:48.090> time<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
is he's able to slow down time so the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.620 
is he's able to slow down time so the
whole<00:01:48.869> world<00:01:49.590> slows<00:01:50.009> down<00:01:50.250> except<00:01:51.240> he<00:01:51.479> and

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
whole world slows down except he and

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.020 
whole world slows down except he and
crash<00:01:51.840> when<00:01:52.229> crashes<00:01:52.590> jack<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:52.979> have<00:01:53.189> moved<00:01:53.700> in

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
crash when crashes jack on have moved in

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.080 
crash when crashes jack on have moved in
real<00:01:54.270> time<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:55.049> they<00:01:55.200> can<00:01:55.229> speed<00:01:55.649> through

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
real time so they can speed through

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.039 
real time so they can speed through
