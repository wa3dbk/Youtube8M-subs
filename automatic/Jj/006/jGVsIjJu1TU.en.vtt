00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.559 
can relate and very much connect with
where<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.859> customers<00:01:50.280> are<00:01:50.429> coming<00:01:50.819> from<00:01:51.000> we

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
where the customers are coming from we

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:54.649 
where the customers are coming from we
did<00:01:51.719> a<00:01:51.750> lot<00:01:51.929> of<00:01:52.280> output<00:01:53.479> demonstrations<00:01:54.479> there

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
did a lot of output demonstrations there

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.230 
did a lot of output demonstrations there
so<00:01:55.020> we<00:01:55.140> brought<00:01:55.319> files<00:01:55.649> down<00:01:56.069> we<00:01:56.880> brought<00:01:57.060> some

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
so we brought files down we brought some

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.779 
so we brought files down we brought some
team<00:01:57.420> members<00:01:57.450> here<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:59.130> wouldn't<00:01:59.549> take

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
team members here that I wouldn't take

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.630 
team members here that I wouldn't take
to<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> show<00:02:00.359> they<00:02:00.899> allow<00:02:01.140> us<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:02.130> know<00:02:02.189> get

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
to a show they allow us to you know get

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.480 
to a show they allow us to you know get
to<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.819> rips<00:02:03.149> bring<00:02:03.840> files<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.619> produce

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
to the rips bring files and produce

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.789 
to the rips bring files and produce
those<00:02:05.759> files<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.539> machine<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.229> take<00:02:07.619> that

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
those files on the machine and take that

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.160 
those files on the machine and take that
output<00:02:08.039> home<00:02:08.429> with<00:02:08.670> us<00:02:08.879> which<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.840> think<00:02:10.049> is<00:02:10.140> a

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
output home with us which I think is a

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.009 
output home with us which I think is a
unique<00:02:10.739> scenario<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:12.090> had<00:02:12.870> my

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
unique scenario and that I had my

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.660 
unique scenario and that I had my
production<00:02:13.470> staff<00:02:13.709> here<00:02:13.950> with<00:02:14.129> me<00:02:14.280> doing<00:02:14.459> it

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
production staff here with me doing it

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.850 
production staff here with me doing it
not<00:02:14.849> me<00:02:15.030> bringing<00:02:15.450> back<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:16.200> answers<00:02:16.650> and

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
not me bringing back the answers and

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.809

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
displays that look at equipment but

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.160
