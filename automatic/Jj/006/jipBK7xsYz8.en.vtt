hi<00:00:12.540> I'm<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.440> middle<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:14.120> Scania<00:00:15.120> our

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
hi I'm in the middle of the Scania our

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.650 
hi I'm in the middle of the Scania our
620<00:00:15.990> build<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.070> I've<00:00:17.910> just<00:00:18.060> been<00:00:18.240> working<00:00:18.570> on

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
620 build and I've just been working on

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.820 
620 build and I've just been working on
the<00:00:18.779> fifth-wheel<00:00:20.600> have<00:00:21.600> us<00:00:21.750> set<00:00:22.590> up<00:00:22.619> a

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
the fifth-wheel have us set up a

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.210 
the fifth-wheel have us set up a
diminished<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.490> I'm<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:24.720> testing<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.949> I

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
diminished and I'm just testing it so I

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.070 
diminished and I'm just testing it so I
thought<00:00:26.519> I'd<00:00:26.730> make<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.939> quick<00:00:27.090> video<00:00:27.420> just<00:00:27.750> to

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
thought I'd make a quick video just to

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.770 
thought I'd make a quick video just to
show<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.400> how<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.240> don't<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:32.450> just<00:00:33.450> kind<00:00:33.690> of

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
show you I how I don't and just kind of

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.190 
show you I how I don't and just kind of
moon<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.040> her<00:00:35.250> simple<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:35.790> hey<00:00:36.450> first

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
moon you to her simple of this hey first

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.500 
moon you to her simple of this hey first
of<00:00:37.320> all<00:00:37.440> if<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.219> watch<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.700> here<00:00:39.000> for<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
of all if you watch in here for the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.080 
of all if you watch in here for the
little<00:00:39.780> catch<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.200> fifth<00:00:40.379> wheel<00:00:40.850> it<00:00:41.850> is

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
little catch in the fifth wheel it is

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.459 
little catch in the fifth wheel it is
see<00:00:42.950> it<00:00:44.000> should<00:00:45.000> say<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.629> what<00:00:46.140> I'm<00:00:46.230> doing

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
see it should say this what I'm doing

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.639 
see it should say this what I'm doing
here<00:00:46.829> hey<00:00:47.190> I'm<00:00:48.000> using<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.360> Arduino<00:00:48.899> with<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
here hey I'm using this Arduino with the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.740 
here hey I'm using this Arduino with the
air<00:00:50.239> it's<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.449> servo<00:00:53.120> servo<00:00:54.120> controlled<00:00:54.539> by

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
air it's the servo servo controlled by

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.479 
air it's the servo servo controlled by
the<00:00:54.809> knob<00:00:56.780> program<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:58.230> one<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.039> generic

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the knob program it's one of the generic

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.510 
the knob program it's one of the generic
programs<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.059> comes<00:01:00.300> with<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.930> Arduino<00:01:01.680> IDE

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
programs that comes with the Arduino IDE

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.730 
programs that comes with the Arduino IDE
so<00:01:03.510> if<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.719> download<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:06.330> IDE<00:01:06.720> for<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
so if you download the the IDE for a the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.850 
so if you download the the IDE for a the
Arduino<00:01:08.100> should<00:01:08.490> be<00:01:08.610> able<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.150> very<00:01:09.689> quickly

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
Arduino should be able to very quickly

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.890 
Arduino should be able to very quickly
download<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.340> your<00:01:11.369> Arduino<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.180> be<00:01:12.780> able

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
download it to your Arduino and be able

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.660 
download it to your Arduino and be able
to<00:01:13.049> test<00:01:13.229> your<00:01:13.380> circles<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.430> fashion

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
to test your circles in this fashion

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.460 
to test your circles in this fashion
that's<00:01:15.450> very<00:01:15.659> simple<00:01:15.840> okay<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:17.840> hey<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:19.350> have

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
that's very simple okay so hey we have

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.490 
that's very simple okay so hey we have
this<00:01:19.619> power<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.280> comes<00:01:20.460> from<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:22.320> latch

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
this power that comes from the latch

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.030 
this power that comes from the latch
here<00:01:23.420> that<00:01:24.420> goes<00:01:24.570> over<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.840> here<00:01:25.140> which<00:01:25.770> used

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
here that goes over to here which used

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.870 
here that goes over to here which used
to<00:01:26.189> have<00:01:26.570> this<00:01:27.570> little<00:01:27.630> device<00:01:28.140> here<00:01:28.560> which<00:01:29.549> is

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
to have this little device here which is

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.740 
to have this little device here which is
just<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.720> little<00:01:31.430> lever<00:01:32.430> for<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> way<00:01:33.689> to

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
just a little lever for a way to

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.690 
just a little lever for a way to
manually<00:01:34.170> open<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.009> close<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.340> fifth<00:01:35.490> wheel

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
manually open and close the fifth wheel

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.719 
manually open and close the fifth wheel
it's<00:01:36.299> very<00:01:36.540> simple<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.740> what<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.280> done<00:01:38.520> was

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
it's very simple so what I done was

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.440 
it's very simple so what I done was
remove<00:01:39.659> -<00:01:39.869> obviously<00:01:40.579> then<00:01:41.579> under<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.060> panel

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
remove - obviously then under this panel

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.780 
remove - obviously then under this panel
here<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.200> take<00:01:43.380> out<00:01:43.530> these<00:01:43.649> two<00:01:43.710> screws<00:01:43.950> for

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
here you take out these two screws for

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.420 
here you take out these two screws for
the<00:01:44.939> measure<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:45.799> two<00:01:46.799> screws<00:01:47.070> there<00:01:47.250> one

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
the measure it so two screws there one

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.770 
the measure it so two screws there one
there<00:01:47.850> one<00:01:47.909> there<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:49.729> in<00:01:50.729> here<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.000> have<00:01:51.180> very

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
there one there so in here I have very

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.889 
there one there so in here I have very
small<00:01:52.079> servo<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.250> from<00:01:54.210> hobbyking<00:01:54.720> it's

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
small servo it is a from hobbyking it's

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:02.569 
small servo it is a from hobbyking it's
a<00:01:54.990> HK<00:01:59.210> 5325<00:02:00.210> small<00:02:00.479> tow<00:02:00.689> hook<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.890> servers<00:02:02.430> I

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
a HK 5325 small tow hook it servers I

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.300 
a HK 5325 small tow hook it servers I
usually<00:02:02.880> use<00:02:03.030> for<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.630> steering<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.649> in

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
usually use for the steering in the in

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.119 
usually use for the steering in the in
the<00:02:05.610> tractors<00:02:06.030> are<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.329> big<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:07.129> comparisons

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
the tractors are that big so comparisons

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.779 
the tractors are that big so comparisons
it's<00:02:08.489> much<00:02:08.670> more<00:02:08.849> but<00:02:09.569> them

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
it's much more but them

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.030 
it's much more but them
this<00:02:11.420> soul<00:02:11.629> doesn't<00:02:12.260> have<00:02:12.349> a<00:02:12.409> huge<00:02:12.769> amount<00:02:12.980> of

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
this soul doesn't have a huge amount of

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.380 
this soul doesn't have a huge amount of
torque<00:02:13.250> so<00:02:13.459> it<00:02:13.730> would<00:02:13.879> be<00:02:13.969> no<00:02:14.090> good<00:02:14.239> for

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
torque so it would be no good for

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.940 
torque so it would be no good for
steering<00:02:14.629> there's<00:02:14.900> no<00:02:15.079> way<00:02:15.230> they'd<00:02:15.500> steer<00:02:15.739> the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
steering there's no way they'd steer the

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.520 
steering there's no way they'd steer the
wheels<00:02:16.819> on<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.030> lorry<00:02:17.269> or<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.629> or<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.170> tractor

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
wheels on a lorry or the or the tractor

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.300 
wheels on a lorry or the or the tractor
just<00:02:18.950> wouldn't<00:02:19.519> be<00:02:19.579> able<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.790> do<00:02:19.989> so<00:02:20.989> um<00:02:21.349> all<00:02:21.769> I

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
just wouldn't be able to do so um all I

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.660 
just wouldn't be able to do so um all I
don't<00:02:22.459> was<00:02:22.909> they<00:02:23.409> got<00:02:24.409> this<00:02:24.560> little<00:02:24.799> sheet<00:02:25.519> of

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
don't was they got this little sheet of

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.530 
don't was they got this little sheet of
plastic<00:02:25.849> here<00:02:27.189> see<00:02:28.189> ya

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
plastic here see ya

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.710 
plastic here see ya
I<00:02:30.819> just<00:02:31.819> could<00:02:32.780> hold<00:02:33.069> for<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.189> servo<00:02:34.579> and<00:02:34.760> two

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
I just could hold for the servo and two

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.629 
I just could hold for the servo and two
holes<00:02:35.989> for<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.290> screws<00:02:36.430> mounting<00:02:37.430> it<00:02:37.549> in

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:37.639 
holes for the screws mounting it in

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:41.349 
holes for the screws mounting it in
there<00:02:37.909> and<00:02:38.739> so<00:02:39.739> far<00:02:39.980> I've<00:02:40.219> just<00:02:40.430> sat<00:02:41.000> on<00:02:41.030> into

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
there and so far I've just sat on into

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:46.929 
there and so far I've just sat on into
position<00:02:41.750> there<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.519> it's<00:02:44.079> it<00:02:45.079> held<00:02:45.939> both

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:46.939 
position there and it's it held both

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.379 
position there and it's it held both
directions<00:02:47.299> here<00:02:47.720> by<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.560> body<00:02:48.829> of<00:02:49.099> the<00:02:49.389> body

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:50.389 
directions here by the body of the body

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:51.940 
directions here by the body of the body
of<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.569> lorry<00:02:50.810> so<00:02:51.049> I<00:02:51.139> just<00:02:51.290> caught<00:02:51.530> her<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.769> fit

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
of the lorry so I just caught her to fit

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.929 
of the lorry so I just caught her to fit
in<00:02:52.099> this<00:02:52.519> rectangular<00:02:52.970> space<00:02:53.239> here<00:02:53.599> and<00:02:54.939> once

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:55.939 
in this rectangular space here and once

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.960 
in this rectangular space here and once
I<00:02:56.060> put<00:02:56.239> this<00:02:56.450> this<00:02:57.290> cover<00:02:57.560> back<00:02:57.799> on<00:02:58.010> it's<00:02:58.730> held

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
I put this this cover back on it's held

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.599 
I put this this cover back on it's held
from<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.810> right<00:03:00.230> hand<00:03:00.409> side<00:03:00.620> here<00:03:00.769> as<00:03:00.950> well<00:03:01.099> so

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
from the right hand side here as well so

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.530 
from the right hand side here as well so
that<00:03:02.090> sort<00:03:02.329> of<00:03:02.500> can't<00:03:03.500> move<00:03:03.680> now<00:03:03.950> so<00:03:04.299> it's<00:03:05.299> very

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
that sort of can't move now so it's very

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.649 
that sort of can't move now so it's very
simple<00:03:06.049> very<00:03:06.579> simple<00:03:07.579> modification<00:03:07.849> just<00:03:08.329> to

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659 
simple very simple modification just to

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.860 
simple very simple modification just to
add<00:03:08.780> this<00:03:09.489> 15m<00:03:10.489> movement<00:03:10.669> there's<00:03:11.389> no<00:03:11.510> huge

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
add this 15m movement there's no huge

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.390 
add this 15m movement there's no huge
obviously<00:03:12.590> it's<00:03:12.680> moving<00:03:12.950> now<00:03:13.069> because<00:03:13.340> I

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
obviously it's moving now because I

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.969 
obviously it's moving now because I
don't<00:03:13.459> have<00:03:13.609> to<00:03:14.260> cover<00:03:15.260> up<00:03:15.409> when<00:03:15.739> I<00:03:15.799> go<00:03:15.919> to

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:15.979 
don't have to cover up when I go to

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:21.129 
don't have to cover up when I go to
cover<00:03:16.159> on<00:03:16.310> that<00:03:16.519> hold<00:03:17.299> it<00:03:17.419> in<00:03:17.540> place<00:03:17.629> so<00:03:20.139> now

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
cover on that hold it in place so now

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.490 
cover on that hold it in place so now
when<00:03:21.530> I<00:03:21.560> move<00:03:21.769> Cyril<00:03:22.629> Cyril<00:03:23.629> doesn't<00:03:24.260> move

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
when I move Cyril Cyril doesn't move

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.089 
when I move Cyril Cyril doesn't move
inside<00:03:25.190> mm<00:03:25.669> here<00:03:27.129> so<00:03:28.569> yeah<00:03:29.590> as<00:03:30.590> far<00:03:30.799> as<00:03:30.859> I<00:03:31.040> can

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
inside mm here so yeah as far as I can

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.710 
inside mm here so yeah as far as I can
see<00:03:31.400> that's<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.510> simplest<00:03:33.109> solution<00:03:33.319> I<00:03:33.769> I

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
see that's the simplest solution I I

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.869 
see that's the simplest solution I I
closed<00:03:35.720> this<00:03:35.870> on<00:03:36.049> the<00:03:36.229> trailer<00:03:36.620> earlier<00:03:37.549> and

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
closed this on the trailer earlier and

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.319 
closed this on the trailer earlier and
tried<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:38.750> pull<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.079> trailer<00:03:39.260> off<00:03:39.530> and<00:03:40.329> so

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
tried to pull the trailer off and so

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.649 
tried to pull the trailer off and so
held<00:03:41.989> the<00:03:42.229> Eldar<00:03:43.099> that's<00:03:43.280> pretty<00:03:43.519> well<00:03:43.669> so<00:03:44.180> it

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
held the Eldar that's pretty well so it

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.039 
held the Eldar that's pretty well so it
didn't<00:03:44.900> release<00:03:45.079> the<00:03:45.260> trailer<00:03:45.440> so<00:03:47.049> hopefully

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
didn't release the trailer so hopefully

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.830 
didn't release the trailer so hopefully
that'll<00:03:48.500> work<00:03:48.709> -<00:03:48.769> as<00:03:49.190> a<00:03:49.250> good<00:03:50.060> design<00:03:50.629> for<00:03:50.659> a

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
that'll work - as a good design for a

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.469 
that'll work - as a good design for a
sport<00:03:51.370> ultimately<00:03:52.370> we<00:03:52.609> won't<00:03:52.790> know<00:03:52.940> until<00:03:53.269> we

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:53.479 
sport ultimately we won't know until we

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:58.449 
sport ultimately we won't know until we
actually<00:03:53.840> am<00:03:54.609> testy<00:03:56.109> testin<00:03:57.109> the<00:03:58.040> lorry<00:03:58.220> will

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
actually am testy testin the lorry will

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.210 
actually am testy testin the lorry will
its<00:03:58.609> own<00:03:58.879> driver<00:03:59.359> hauling<00:04:00.049> a<00:04:00.260> load<00:04:00.889> on<00:04:00.949> the

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
its own driver hauling a load on the

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.849 
its own driver hauling a load on the
trailer<00:04:01.370> then<00:04:02.239> we<00:04:02.419> see<00:04:02.629> if<00:04:02.689> the<00:04:03.019> motor<00:04:03.500> is<00:04:03.620> up

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
trailer then we see if the motor is up

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.679 
trailer then we see if the motor is up
to<00:04:04.040> the<00:04:04.129> job<00:04:04.280> or<00:04:04.430> not<00:04:04.549> and<00:04:04.819> if<00:04:04.939> so<00:04:05.120> we<00:04:05.359> just<00:04:05.540> have

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689 
to the job or not and if so we just have

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.589 
to the job or not and if so we just have
to<00:04:05.840> come<00:04:06.530> back<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:07.150> change<00:04:08.150> it<00:04:08.239> up<00:04:08.359> with<00:04:08.569> a

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
to come back and change it up with a

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.439 
to come back and change it up with a
difference<00:04:08.989> or<00:04:09.109> not<00:04:09.409> a<00:04:09.650> big<00:04:09.829> deal<00:04:10.389> ok<00:04:11.389> so

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:11.449 
difference or not a big deal ok so

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.020 
difference or not a big deal ok so
that's<00:04:12.049> all<00:04:12.199> I<00:04:12.229> want<00:04:12.680> to<00:04:12.769> talk<00:04:12.889> to<00:04:13.040> it<00:04:13.129> on<00:04:13.280> hey
