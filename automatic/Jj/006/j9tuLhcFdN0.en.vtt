00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.960
 Yes, very much is Ars This time I want to use the Captain Falcon 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.400
 I was used captain Falcon've done 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.650
 What a real cf you're using 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.650
 It will be fun 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:39.860
 Cf beat is true even with the previous Sumabra x and so on 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.330
 I from 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.330
 I feel like the present feature 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.600
 If you use something cf 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.820
 It will be fun 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:05.950
 It feels like you want to support something even if someone is using it 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.950
 This guy has a truly magical attraction 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:16.610
 The present work is the previous work 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.540
 It is at all such a thing but this film I'd had was about had entered Toka 3 a little less than is really boots 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.290
 Absent 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:25.360
 There was a really strong character 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:29.060
 It is not as strong as the deluxe of ス ブ ラ ラ though 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.790
 Still it has been strengthened enough 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.050
 Yappa hot water members Why from the founder 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.050
 It is interesting to use really 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.219
 It was dangerous now 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.219
 8 cf Interesting really 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.800
 The second game is zero suit Samus 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.610
 Compatibility or so much 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.610
 I wonder if it does not change 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:11.850
 Even in the case of cf 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:15.260
 Nde basically is fast movement to such it is possible or was also in the back 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:20.880
 Is there is no Toka bad opponent 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:24.510
 The person who is not good when I use cf is a villager after all 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:28.660
 I think that the return of the top b will be from the bottom 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:34.770
 I think I or are the enemy planes stand at the Gakesai 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.770
 It is basically not good at any character to be a villager partner in that sense 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.440
 The knee of the arrow enters and I pray for breath 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.819
 It really is easy to use a combo 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:22.600
 a kelp also to is the early occurrence Daigo 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:22.600
 It is easy to use to detect in you can use at all in like this Toka grasp in a future second time 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.730
 Yeah I want to continue to aim at Toka another soon finish 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.420
 I want 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.550
 It is a good space pattern also property 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.890
 3000 eyes are cf 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:11.230
 I do not want to lose because this is already a mirror 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.230
 cf I don't want to lose it 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.060
 No Naa interesting 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.199
 It's a little scary 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.199
 I This is a good 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.639
 Even if only smash crashes , is this okay ? 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.849
 Mainland where there was 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:53.860
 It Is You headquartered bought in I was for the time being mirror 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:54.669
 Well , for now I would like to finish this time Thank you for watching 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.569
