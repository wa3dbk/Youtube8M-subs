ball-joint so left and right up and down
these<00:03:42.049> shoulder<00:03:42.560> pads<00:03:42.590> are<00:03:42.980> on<00:03:43.010> a<00:03:43.070> ball-joint

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
these shoulder pads are on a ball-joint

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.770 
these shoulder pads are on a ball-joint
so<00:03:44.000> you<00:03:44.120> get<00:03:44.269> nice<00:03:44.840> movement<00:03:45.790> on<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:46.940> hinge<00:03:47.239> hit

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
so you get nice movement on a hinge hit

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.530 
so you get nice movement on a hinge hit
the<00:03:47.959> arms<00:03:48.230> on<00:03:48.380> a<00:03:48.410> hinge<00:03:48.970> so<00:03:49.970> you<00:03:50.030> get<00:03:50.390> a<00:03:50.420> little

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
the arms on a hinge so you get a little

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.580 
the arms on a hinge so you get a little
bit<00:03:50.780> moving<00:03:51.049> here<00:03:51.260> ball<00:03:51.769> joints<00:03:52.280> of<00:03:52.459> out

is<00:04:58.800> very<00:04:59.490> much<00:04:59.730> loose<00:05:00.180> but<00:05:00.630> I<00:05:00.840> could<00:05:01.410> fix<00:05:01.650> that

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
is very much loose but I could fix that

is very much loose but I could fix that
later<00:05:02.190> with<00:05:02.550> some<00:05:03.230> superglue

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
later with some superglue
