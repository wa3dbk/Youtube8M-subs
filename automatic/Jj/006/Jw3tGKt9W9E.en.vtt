00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.400 
working but they couldn't fix it because
it<00:00:36.329> turned<00:00:36.540> out<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.719> an<00:00:36.930> operating<00:00:37.380> system

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410

was quitting because on sir because

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.090 
was quitting because on sir because
because<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.480> logic<00:00:42.899> board<00:00:43.079> went<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.800> it's

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
because the logic board went and so it's

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.569 
because the logic board went and so it's
all<00:00:44.250> good<00:00:44.280> because<00:00:44.719> I<00:00:45.719> got<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.469> what's<00:00:47.430> that
