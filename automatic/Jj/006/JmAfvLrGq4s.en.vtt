00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
with the majora's mask now this is from

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.270 
with the majora's mask now this is from
The<00:01:56.390> Legend<00:01:56.660> of<00:01:56.750> Zelda<00:01:56.930> series<00:01:57.080> and<00:01:57.770> we<00:01:57.860> do<00:01:58.040> see

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
The Legend of Zelda series and we do see

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.070 
The Legend of Zelda series and we do see
plenty<00:01:58.520> of<00:01:58.670> characters<00:01:59.120> from<00:01:59.330> it<00:01:59.510> and<00:01:59.690> i<00:01:59.810> even

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
plenty of characters from it and i even

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.320 
plenty of characters from it and i even
have<00:02:00.230> mental<00:02:00.620> minna<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:01.430> wolf<00:02:01.670> link<00:02:01.850> on<00:02:02.060> here

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
have mental minna and wolf link on here

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.300 
have mental minna and wolf link on here
but<00:02:02.870> I<00:02:02.930> think<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.350> skull<00:02:03.680> kid<00:02:03.920> with<00:02:04.130> just

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
but I think the skull kid with just

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.760 
but I think the skull kid with just
having<00:02:04.580> a<00:02:04.900> totally<00:02:05.900> different<00:02:06.440> atmosphere

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
having a totally different atmosphere

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.550 
having a totally different atmosphere
about<00:02:07.640> him<00:02:07.760> and<00:02:07.910> his<00:02:08.509> smash<00:02:08.810> attack<00:02:09.229> could<00:02:09.410> be

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
about him and his smash attack could be

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.580 
about him and his smash attack could be
him<00:02:09.740> turning<00:02:10.040> into<00:02:10.750> Majora's<00:02:11.750> incarnation<00:02:12.410> or

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
him turning into Majora's incarnation or

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.590 
him turning into Majora's incarnation or
you<00:02:13.280> know<00:02:13.400> or<00:02:13.760> something<00:02:14.030> along<00:02:14.240> that<00:02:14.420> line

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
you know or something along that line

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.050 
you know or something along that line
and<00:02:15.020> just<00:02:15.440> go<00:02:15.620> run<00:02:15.890> around<00:02:15.920> just<00:02:16.400> smash<00:02:16.820> it<00:02:16.850> in

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
and just go run around just smash it in

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.490 
and just go run around just smash it in
everybody<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.540> he'd<00:02:17.750> be<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:17.870> great<00:02:18.110> light

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
everybody and he'd be a great light

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.020 
everybody and he'd be a great light
character<00:02:19.100> which<00:02:19.280> we<00:02:19.430> don't<00:02:19.520> see<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.790> whole<00:02:19.850> lot

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
character which we don't see a whole lot

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.949

of<00:02:21.070> number<00:02:22.070> 4<00:02:22.430> i'm<00:02:22.760> thinking<00:02:23.150> it's<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.360> babies

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959

of number 4 i'm thinking it's the babies
baby<00:02:24.410> mario<00:02:24.800> baby<00:02:25.340> luigi<00:02:25.760> then<00:02:26.540> coming<00:02:26.959> in
