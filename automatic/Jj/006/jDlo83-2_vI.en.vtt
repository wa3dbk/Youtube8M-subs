00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.740 

any<00:02:07.189> good<00:02:07.399> it's<00:02:07.759> like<00:02:08.200> but<00:02:09.200> it's<00:02:10.180> like<00:02:11.180> felt

any good it's like but it's like felt
inside<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.920> think<00:02:13.040> this<00:02:13.129> is<00:02:13.250> where<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.370> put

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
inside I think this is where you put

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.170 
inside I think this is where you put
your<00:02:13.550> computer<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.900> feels<00:02:15.080> really<00:02:15.260> nice<00:02:15.470> I

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.600 

don't<00:02:20.180> know<00:02:20.300> if<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.450> could<00:02:21.190> see<00:02:22.190> it<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:25.400> feels

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
don't know if you could see it it feels

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.050 
don't know if you could see it it feels
like<00:02:25.790> cool<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:27.549> let's<00:02:28.549> say<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:28.700> can<00:02:28.819> fit<00:02:29.030> a

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
like cool and let's say you can fit a

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.280 
like cool and let's say you can fit a
lot<00:02:29.330> of<00:02:29.480> things<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:30.099> like<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:31.190> little<00:02:31.310> like

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
lot of things I like the little like

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.369 
lot of things I like the little like
water<00:02:33.290> bottle<00:02:34.420> it's<00:02:35.420> really<00:02:35.690> more<00:02:35.900> for<00:02:35.959> looks

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
water bottle it's really more for looks

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.710 
water bottle it's really more for looks
than<00:02:36.650> anything<00:02:37.060> but<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:38.180> looks<00:02:38.330> like<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:38.599> could

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
than anything but it looks like it could

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.990 
than anything but it looks like it could
last<00:02:38.989> a<00:02:39.500> long<00:02:40.280> time

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
last a long time

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.309 
last a long time
the<00:02:41.299> material<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:41.810> really<00:02:41.930> good<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.290> think

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
the material is really good and I think

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.800 
the material is really good and I think
it's<00:02:42.560> waterproof<00:02:42.890> except<00:02:43.489> kind<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.239> skeptical

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
it's waterproof except kind of skeptical

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.150 
it's waterproof except kind of skeptical
of<00:02:44.959> this<00:02:45.170> part<00:02:45.410> cuz<00:02:45.590> I<00:02:45.680> think<00:02:45.950> if<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:46.130> gets

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
of this part cuz I think if it gets

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.240 
of this part cuz I think if it gets
water<00:02:46.519> on<00:02:46.760> it<00:02:46.940> it<00:02:47.150> might<00:02:47.299> like<00:02:47.810> blend<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.950> red

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
water on it it might like blend the red

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.050 
water on it it might like blend the red
and<00:02:49.400> white<00:02:49.780> but<00:02:52.180> but<00:02:53.180> yeah<00:02:54.190> this<00:02:55.190> is<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.849> snow
