this time around but in any case it's a

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
sure if this is intentional but it is it

sure if this is intentional but it is it
does<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.280> separation<00:01:41.670> here<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.000> can<00:01:42.150> see

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
does have a separation here you can see

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.410 
does have a separation here you can see
it<00:01:44.040> doesn't<00:01:44.369> doesn't<00:01:44.579> really<00:01:44.759> close<00:01:45.000> all<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
it doesn't doesn't really close all the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.819 
it doesn't doesn't really close all the
way<00:01:45.509> but<00:01:45.720> that's<00:01:45.840> that's<00:01:46.200> kind<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.470> cool<00:01:46.619> if

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
way but that's that's kind of cool if

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.560 
way but that's that's kind of cool if
that<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.130> intentional<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.390> so

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
that is intentional we like that so

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
actually inside the box rather than just

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.580 
actually inside the box rather than just
immediately<00:02:08.610> tossing<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.209> aside<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.810> since

and<00:02:12.480> we<00:02:12.569> have<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> little<00:02:12.900> bit<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.110> time

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
and we have a little bit of time

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.810 
and we have a little bit of time
because<00:02:13.710> we're<00:02:13.860> not<00:02:13.980> exactly<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.370> first<00:02:14.640> to

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
because we're not exactly the first to

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.280 
because we're not exactly the first to
do<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.060> unboxing<00:02:15.570> no<00:02:15.720> why<00:02:15.930> don't<00:02:16.080> we<00:02:16.140> do<00:02:16.260> that

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
do this unboxing no why don't we do that

we're<00:02:23.850> not<00:02:23.940> gonna<00:02:24.060> flip<00:02:24.450> through<00:02:24.660> those<00:02:24.840> books

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
we're not gonna flip through those books

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.170 
we're not gonna flip through those books
because<00:02:25.350> that<00:02:26.190> would<00:02:26.340> take<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.520> while<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.060> also

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
because that would take a while and also

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.540 
because that would take a while and also
not<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:27.990> lot<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.260> people<00:02:28.650> read<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.130> manual

not a lot of people read the manual

not a lot of people read the manual
maybe<00:02:30.330> that'll<00:02:30.660> be<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.810> feature<00:02:31.080> in<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.410> future

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730

headphones here one of the things I

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.270 
headphones here one of the things I
wanted<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.960> talk<00:02:34.170> about<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.560> which<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.800> think<00:02:34.950> I

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
wanted to talk about and which I think I

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.950 
wanted to talk about and which I think I
called<00:02:35.520> out<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.120> full<00:02:36.300> review<00:02:36.660> is<00:02:36.810> that

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
called out in the full review is that

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.590 
called out in the full review is that
these<00:02:37.140> have<00:02:37.470> been<00:02:37.650> redesigned<00:02:38.370> somewhat<00:02:38.820> you

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
these have been redesigned somewhat you

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.990 
these have been redesigned somewhat you
can<00:02:39.720> see<00:02:39.870> it's<00:02:40.050> more<00:02:40.230> like<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.470> linguini<00:02:41.220> noodle

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
can see it's more like a linguini noodle

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.780 
can see it's more like a linguini noodle
than<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.660> spaghetti<00:02:43.020> noodle<00:02:43.290> on<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.370> previous

so that when it gets hung up on your
collar<00:03:05.400> maybe<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:06.180> won't<00:03:06.390> stick<00:03:07.140> as<00:03:07.410> badly

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010
