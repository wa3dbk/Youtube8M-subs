guys and welcome to another Raspberry Pi

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.490 
guys and welcome to another Raspberry Pi
2<00:00:11.010> video<00:00:11.730> today<00:00:12.599> we're<00:00:12.900> going<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.139> be<00:00:13.230> looking

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
2 video today we're going to be looking

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.730 
2 video today we're going to be looking
at<00:00:13.639> IPTV<00:00:14.639> streaming<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:16.260> we're<00:00:16.410> going<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.650> be

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
at IPTV streaming and we're going to be

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.990 
at IPTV streaming and we're going to be
using<00:00:17.240> Cody<00:00:18.240> or<00:00:18.630> XBMC<00:00:19.580> so<00:00:20.580> if<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.760> want<00:00:20.939> to

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
using Cody or XBMC so if you want to

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.250 
using Cody or XBMC so if you want to
know<00:00:21.090> how<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.270> install<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.930> pie<00:00:22.199> you

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
know how to install that on a pie you

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.800 
know how to install that on a pie you
can<00:00:22.650> check<00:00:22.859> out<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.430> video<00:00:23.640> here<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.480> that

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
can check out this video here and that

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.589 
can check out this video here and that
will<00:00:24.900> take<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.410> through<00:00:25.560> step<00:00:25.800> by<00:00:25.830> step<00:00:26.599> so

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
will take you through step by step so

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.929 
will take you through step by step so
just<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.869> show<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> pie<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.550> do

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
just to show you this is a pie I do

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.179 
just to show you this is a pie I do
capture<00:00:30.420> directly<00:00:31.170> from<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.560> pie<00:00:31.740> hence<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
capture directly from the pie hence the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.940 
capture directly from the pie hence the
clarity<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.790> video<00:00:33.620> as<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.710> can<00:00:34.739> see

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
clarity of the video as you can see

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.410 
clarity of the video as you can see
there<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.309> an<00:00:35.370> arm<00:00:35.520> 7<00:00:35.880> processor<00:00:37.610> so<00:00:38.610> what<00:00:39.300> we

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
there it's an arm 7 processor so what we

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.160 
there it's an arm 7 processor so what we
need<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.690> do<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.129> go<00:00:41.129> into<00:00:41.329> a<00:00:42.329> system<00:00:44.030> and<00:00:45.110> go<00:00:46.110> to

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
need to do is go into a system and go to

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.510 
need to do is go into a system and go to
live<00:00:46.710> TV<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.809> then<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:49.649> from<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> general

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
live TV and then just from the general

00:00:50.520 --> 00:01:00.260 
live TV and then just from the general
tab<00:00:52.910> there<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.210> enable<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:57.469> and<00:00:59.000> then<00:01:00.000> go

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
tab there just enable that and then go

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.399 
tab there just enable that and then go
down<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:01.489> IPTV<00:01:02.489> simple<00:01:02.969> client<00:01:03.229> and<00:01:04.229> that

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
down to IPTV simple client and that

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.870 
down to IPTV simple client and that
enables<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:07.560> go<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.070> configure<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:10.880> then

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
enables that so go to configure and then

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.130 
enables that so go to configure and then
what<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.150> want<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.360> do<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.570> go<00:01:12.720> down<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
what you want to do is go down to the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.480 
what you want to do is go down to the
m3u<00:01:13.890> playlist<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.659> address<00:01:16.020> which<00:01:16.619> we're

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
m3u playlist and the address which we're

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.660 
m3u playlist and the address which we're
going<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.640> enter<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:19.189> HTTP<00:01:20.189> colon<00:01:20.490> forward

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
done what you want to do then is you

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.600 
done what you want to do then is you
want<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.500> turn<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> caching<00:01:44.189> off<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
want to turn the caching off and the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.069 
want to turn the caching off and the
reason<00:01:44.880> why<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.090> turn<00:01:45.270> caching<00:01:45.720> off<00:01:45.869> is

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
reason why we turn caching off is

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.859 
reason why we turn caching off is
because<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.740> live<00:01:46.950> TV<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.329> content

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
because this is live TV and the content

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.840 
because this is live TV and the content
is<00:01:48.990> constantly<00:01:49.439> changing<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.040> if<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.610> start

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
is constantly changing so if you start

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.850 
is constantly changing so if you start
caching<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.329> content<00:01:51.810> you're<00:01:52.500> going<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.710> get

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
caching the content you're going to get

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.490 
caching the content you're going to get
a<00:01:52.890> lot<00:01:53.040> more<00:01:53.070> failures<00:01:53.960> so<00:01:54.960> that's<00:01:55.140> reason<00:01:55.320> why

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
a lot more failures so that's reason why

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.410 
a lot more failures so that's reason why
we<00:01:55.619> turn<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:55.950> off<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.490> hit<00:01:56.700> OK<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:59.420> then

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
we turn that off so hit OK and then

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.469 
we turn that off so hit OK and then
enable<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.820> as<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:02.939> can<00:02:03.060> see<00:02:03.270> there

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
enable that and as you can see there

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.660 
enable that and as you can see there
it's<00:02:03.840> activated<00:02:05.210> 383<00:02:06.619> TV<00:02:07.619> channels<00:02:08.039> for<00:02:08.489> your

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
it's activated 383 TV channels for your

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.230 
it's activated 383 TV channels for your
viewing<00:02:09.090> pleasure

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.670 

so<00:02:13.240> once<00:02:13.690> code<00:02:14.260> is<00:02:14.440> restarted<00:02:15.300> as<00:02:16.320> we<00:02:17.320> will<00:02:17.440> see

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
so once code is restarted as we will see

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.860 
so once code is restarted as we will see
from<00:02:18.070> here<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:20.350> live<00:02:20.680> TV<00:02:21.130> option<00:02:21.910> doesn't

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
from here the live TV option doesn't

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.690 
from here the live TV option doesn't
always<00:02:23.430> appear<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:25.210> it<00:02:25.600> should<00:02:25.810> do<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:27.190> what

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
always appear and it should do so what

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.110 
always appear and it should do so what
you<00:02:27.790> need<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.060> do<00:02:28.210> is<00:02:28.650> go<00:02:29.650> back<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:30.130> system<00:02:33.120> just

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
you need to do is go back to system just

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.930 
you need to do is go back to system just
go<00:02:34.240> down<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.420> live<00:02:34.690> TV<00:02:35.110> again<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.940> surprise

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
go down to live TV again and surprise

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.780 
go down to live TV again and surprise
surprise<00:02:37.360> it's<00:02:38.350> not<00:02:38.650> enabled<00:02:38.920> even<00:02:39.550> though<00:02:39.670> we

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
surprise it's not enabled even though we

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.190 
surprise it's not enabled even though we
didn't<00:02:40.060> able<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.390> before<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:40.870> I<00:02:40.930> think<00:02:41.020> there's

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
didn't able it before so I think there's

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.220 
didn't able it before so I think there's
a<00:02:41.230> bug<00:02:41.440> there<00:02:41.710> so<00:02:42.700> just<00:02:43.090> hit<00:02:43.209> enable<00:02:43.450> again<00:02:43.870> and

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
a bug there so just hit enable again and

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.410 
a bug there so just hit enable again and
then<00:02:44.350> as<00:02:44.470> we<00:02:44.590> can<00:02:44.770> see<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.820> enables<00:02:46.270> the

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
then as we can see it enables the

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.690 
then as we can see it enables the
channels<00:02:46.810> but<00:02:47.350> then<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.650> actually<00:02:47.860> loads<00:02:48.400> them

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
channels but then it actually loads them

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:56.900 
channels but then it actually loads them
at<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:48.940> top<00:02:49.209> there
