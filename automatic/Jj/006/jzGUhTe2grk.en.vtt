content and so having a PC inside this
TV<00:00:58.950> kind<00:00:59.580> of<00:00:59.640> an<00:00:59.700> interesting<00:00:59.820> idea<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.330> like

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
TV kind of an interesting idea I like

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.000 
TV kind of an interesting idea I like
the<00:01:00.720> fact<00:01:00.900> that<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.140> modular<00:01:01.380> because<00:01:01.860> one

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
the fact that it's modular because one

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.030 
the fact that it's modular because one
downside<00:01:02.490> is<00:01:02.700> is<00:01:02.880> the<00:01:03.000> lifespan<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.450> a<00:01:04.040> large

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
downside is is the lifespan of a large

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.950 
downside is is the lifespan of a large
screen<00:01:05.309> television<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.940> a<00:01:06.150> lot<00:01:06.390> longer<00:01:06.570> than<00:01:06.900> a

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
screen television is a lot longer than a

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.380 
screen television is a lot longer than a
mini<00:01:07.229> PC<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.670> not<00:01:08.759> a<00:01:08.820> particularly<00:01:09.119> powerful

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
mini PC it's not a particularly powerful

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.410 
mini PC it's not a particularly powerful
PC<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:10.080> if<00:01:10.200> your<00:01:10.350> primary<00:01:10.640> usage<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.940> is<00:01:12.210> to

of IP television service you probably

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.490 
of IP television service you probably
don't<00:01:20.820> need<00:01:21.149> a<00:01:21.210> particular<00:01:21.780> bus<00:01:21.960> processor

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
don't need a particular bus processor

this booth you've been able to answer
the<00:01:28.050> question<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.500> appears<00:01:28.800> to<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
the question it appears to have a

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.669 
the question it appears to have a
separate<00:01:29.640> audio<00:01:30.149> port<00:01:30.960> that's<00:01:31.410> not

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
separate audio port that's not

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:33.499 
separate audio port that's not
integrated<00:01:32.310> directly<00:01:32.580> under<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.060> backplane

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
integrated directly under the backplane

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.870 
integrated directly under the backplane
of<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.110> television<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.550> how<00:01:35.819> you

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
of the television and so how you

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.190 
of the television and so how you
integrate<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.420> audio<00:01:36.720> into<00:01:36.960> your<00:01:37.050> home

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
integrate the audio into your home

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.770 
integrate the audio into your home
theater<00:01:37.440> system<00:01:38.039> that's<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.789> question<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
theater system that's a question the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.870 
theater system that's a question the
quality<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.890> think<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.190> is<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.310> cable<00:01:41.700> mess

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
quality is so I think it is a cable mess

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.100 
quality is so I think it is a cable mess
you<00:01:42.090> probably<00:01:42.360> have<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.539> integrate<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.959> with<00:01:43.050> a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
you probably have to integrate it with a

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.749 
you probably have to integrate it with a
separate<00:01:43.440> cable<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.100> quality<00:01:44.550> may<00:01:44.700> be

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
separate cable the quality may be

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.850 
separate cable the quality may be
questionable<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.259> that's<00:01:46.590> that's

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
questionable and so that's that's

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.010 
questionable and so that's that's
another<00:01:47.160> downside<00:01:47.429> an<00:01:48.209> additional<00:01:48.450> downside

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
another downside an additional downside

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.350 
another downside an additional downside
is<00:01:49.140> they<00:01:49.259> don't<00:01:49.410> have

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
is they don't have

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.660 
is they don't have
easy<00:01:51.080> way<00:01:51.410> to<00:01:51.440> navigate

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
easy way to navigate

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
to navigate the internet content so

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.399 
to navigate the internet content so
these<00:01:56.729> are<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.030> standard<00:01:57.570> full<00:01:57.750> 40<00:01:58.080> cable

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
these are the standard full 40 cable

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.740 
these are the standard full 40 cable
wireless<00:01:58.619> qwerty<00:01:59.310> keyboard<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.939> mouse<00:02:00.060> which

wireless qwerty keyboard and mouse which

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.440

is<00:02:00.930> difficult<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.340> living<00:02:02.640> room<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.210> lot<00:02:03.420> of

is difficult in the living room a lot of
times<00:02:03.630> people<00:02:03.930> don't<00:02:04.080> have<00:02:04.320> desks<00:02:04.770> or<00:02:05.060> easy<00:02:06.060> a

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
times people don't have desks or easy a

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.630 
times people don't have desks or easy a
good<00:02:06.869> platform<00:02:07.110> for<00:02:07.439> supporting<00:02:08.130> a<00:02:08.190> 40

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640

keyboard<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.209> mouse<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.619> they<00:02:10.739> need<00:02:10.890> to

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
keyboard and mouse and so they need to

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.240 
keyboard and mouse and so they need to
have<00:02:11.130> a<00:02:11.630> easier<00:02:12.630> device<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.770> be<00:02:13.830> able<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.130> help

have a easier device to be able to help
to<00:02:14.430> navigate<00:02:14.850> whatever<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.510> think<00:02:15.780> it's<00:02:15.870> an

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
to navigate whatever I think it's an

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.900 
to navigate whatever I think it's an
interesting<00:02:16.050> concept<00:02:16.700> something<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.790> could

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
interesting concept something you could

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.610 
interesting concept something you could
potentially<00:02:18.330> see<00:02:18.480> more<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:19.080> don't<00:02:19.380> see<00:02:19.500> that

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
potentially see more of I don't see that

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.470 
potentially see more of I don't see that
there's<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.920> need<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.190> but<00:02:20.700> something<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.239> wanted

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
there's a need to but something I wanted

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.350 
there's a need to but something I wanted
to<00:02:22.040> cover<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.190> thought<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.640> was<00:02:23.760> as<00:02:24.090> long<00:02:24.269> as

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
to cover I thought it was as long as

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.970 
to cover I thought it was as long as
first<00:02:24.599> time<00:02:24.750> I've<00:02:24.900> seen<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:25.380> particular

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
first time I've seen this particular

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.699 
first time I've seen this particular
model<00:02:26.190> at<00:02:26.580> CES<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.060> year<00:02:27.269> so<00:02:28.050> it's<00:02:28.380> the

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
model at CES this year so it's the

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.570
