and<00:01:44.909> all<00:01:45.180> three<00:01:45.540> ball<00:01:46.259> for<00:01:46.439> 2100<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.579> one<00:01:47.729> but

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
and all three ball for 2100 that one but

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.399 
and all three ball for 2100 that one but
the<00:01:48.000> other<00:01:48.030> two<00:01:48.240> for<00:01:48.390> two<00:01:48.509> thousand<00:01:48.869> coins<00:01:48.990> and

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
the other two for two thousand coins and

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.380 
the other two for two thousand coins and
we're<00:01:49.649> gonna<00:01:49.740> try<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.070> sell<00:01:50.220> them<00:01:50.340> all<00:01:50.430> 43.9<00:01:51.030> k

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
we're gonna try and sell them all 43.9 k

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.630 
we're gonna try and sell them all 43.9 k
at<00:01:51.540> least<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.899> think<00:01:51.960> one<00:01:52.259> for<00:01:52.470> 3.88<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.549> this

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
at least I think one for 3.88 and this

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.880 
at least I think one for 3.88 and this
is<00:01:53.759> always<00:01:54.000> self<00:01:54.240> 3.8<00:01:54.750> k<00:01:54.930> but<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.619> other<00:01:55.740> two

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
is always self 3.8 k but the other two

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.950 
is always self 3.8 k but the other two
43.9<00:01:56.430> k<00:01:56.759> because<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> formations<00:01:57.570> are<00:01:57.719> better

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
43.9 k because the formations are better

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.190 
43.9 k because the formations are better
on<00:01:58.170> them<00:01:58.350> too<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.790> have<00:01:59.969> no<00:02:00.270> idea<00:02:00.659> why

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
on them too and so I have no idea why

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.800 
on them too and so I have no idea why
they<00:02:01.530> were<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.860> market<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.640> all<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.240> all

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
they were on the market and all like all

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.870 
they were on the market and all like all
at<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.170> same<00:02:04.320> price<00:02:04.649> all<00:02:04.950> bike<00:02:05.340> barely

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
at the same price all bike barely

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.730 
at the same price all bike barely
contested<00:02:06.450> for<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.259> bids<00:02:07.439> but<00:02:07.590> you're

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
contested for and the bids but you're

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.859 
contested for and the bids but you're
seeing<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.039> next<00:02:08.310> stem<00:02:08.520> screen<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.360> they

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
seeing the next stem screen that they

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.190 
seeing the next stem screen that they
all<00:02:10.050> sold<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.370> think<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.640> was<00:02:11.730> like<00:02:11.819> in

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
all sold and I think it was like in

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.339 
all sold and I think it was like in
instance<00:02:12.590> so<00:02:12.770> we<00:02:12.890> made<00:02:13.069> an<00:02:13.250> instant<00:02:14.000> like<00:02:14.420> 6k

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
instance so we made an instant like 6k

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.050 
instance so we made an instant like 6k
