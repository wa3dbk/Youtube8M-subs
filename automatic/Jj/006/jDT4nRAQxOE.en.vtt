00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
hi everybody so here's my array of trout

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.640 
hi everybody so here's my array of trout
fishing<00:00:08.309> bait<00:00:08.670> over<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.750> years<00:00:10.019> I've<00:00:10.230> tested

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
fishing bait over the years I've tested

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.740 
fishing bait over the years I've tested
them<00:00:10.769> out<00:00:10.889> tried<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.340> find<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.670> best<00:00:11.880> ones<00:00:12.269> I

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
them out tried to find the best ones I

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.350 
them out tried to find the best ones I
started<00:00:13.679> out<00:00:13.830> basically<00:00:14.309> using<00:00:14.730> earthworms

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
started out basically using earthworms

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.590 
started out basically using earthworms
and<00:00:15.809> balls<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.920> fire<00:00:17.130> salmon<00:00:17.640> eggs<00:00:17.820> those<00:00:18.480> are

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
and balls the fire salmon eggs those are

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.320 
and balls the fire salmon eggs those are
my<00:00:18.750> two<00:00:18.810> staples<00:00:19.470> but<00:00:19.650> recently<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.460> found<00:00:21.060> some

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
my two staples but recently I found some

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.810 
my two staples but recently I found some
better<00:00:21.510> baits<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.260> right<00:00:23.039> here<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.310> have<00:00:23.460> some

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
better baits and right here I have some

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.089 
better baits and right here I have some
power<00:00:24.119> bait<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.230> it's<00:00:25.500> kind<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.920> dough

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
power bait and it's kind of in a dough

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.490 
power bait and it's kind of in a dough
form<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.730> here's<00:00:27.330> some<00:00:27.510> artificial<00:00:27.930> salmon

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
form and here's some artificial salmon

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.980 
form and here's some artificial salmon
eggs<00:00:28.619> from<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.890> gull<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:30.570> reason<00:00:30.869> why<00:00:30.960> I

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
eggs from the gull and the reason why I

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.810 
eggs from the gull and the reason why I
think<00:00:31.140> these<00:00:31.410> are<00:00:31.470> better<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:32.189> because<00:00:32.520> they

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
think these are better is because they

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.600 
think these are better is because they
float<00:00:33.239> um<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.350> I'll<00:00:34.410> show<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.649> later<00:00:34.890> I'll

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
float um and I'll show you later I'll

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.160 
float um and I'll show you later I'll
actually<00:00:35.760> show<00:00:36.000> them<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.390> action<00:00:36.600> floating

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
actually show them in action floating

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.990 
actually show them in action floating
kind<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.559> how<00:00:37.649> they<00:00:37.800> work<00:00:38.040> but<00:00:38.520> basically<00:00:38.940> you

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
kind of how they work but basically you

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.910 
kind of how they work but basically you
have<00:00:39.120> your<00:00:39.149> weight<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.899> about<00:00:40.079> six<00:00:40.440> inches<00:00:40.710> up

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
have your weight and about six inches up

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.069 
have your weight and about six inches up
you<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.340> your<00:00:41.700> hook<00:00:41.940> tied<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:42.390> four<00:00:42.780> above

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
you have your hook tied on four above

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.610 
you have your hook tied on four above
that<00:00:43.290> weight<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:44.600> these<00:00:45.600> artificial<00:00:46.410> baits

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
that weight and these artificial baits

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.580 
that weight and these artificial baits
right<00:00:46.770> here<00:00:47.129> will<00:00:47.399> float<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.809> it'll<00:00:48.989> stay<00:00:49.260> six

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
right here will float so it'll stay six

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.020 
right here will float so it'll stay six
inches<00:00:49.860> off<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.039> bottom<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.700> that's<00:00:50.820> where

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
inches off the bottom and that's where

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.910 
inches off the bottom and that's where
the<00:00:51.120> trout<00:00:51.360> are<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.230> they're<00:00:52.379> really<00:00:52.649> helpful

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
the trout are so they're really helpful

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.369 
the trout are so they're really helpful
in<00:00:53.190> catching<00:00:53.640> trout<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.539> zoning<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.110> on<00:00:55.140> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
in catching trout and zoning in on the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.590 
in catching trout and zoning in on the
area<00:00:55.649> where<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.980> trout<00:00:56.219> are<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.449> lot

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
area where the trout are and it's a lot

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.270 
area where the trout are and it's a lot
harder<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.930> do<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.230> with<00:00:58.410> baits<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.070> don't

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
harder to do that with baits that don't

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.430 
harder to do that with baits that don't
float<00:00:59.520> like<00:00:59.699> worms<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.359> balls<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.320> fire

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
float like worms and balls of fire

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.529 
float like worms and balls of fire
salmon<00:01:01.920> eggs<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.219> they<00:01:02.340> do<00:01:02.399> work<00:01:02.730> but

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
salmon eggs but they do work but

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.509 
salmon eggs but they do work but
recently<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.739> definitely<00:01:04.979> been<00:01:05.280> out

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
recently I have definitely been out

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.550 
recently I have definitely been out
fishing<00:01:06.000> probably<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.630> catching<00:01:07.320> three

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
fishing probably like catching three

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.200 
fishing probably like catching three
times<00:01:07.770> as<00:01:07.890> many<00:01:08.010> fish<00:01:08.340> with<00:01:08.549> these<00:01:08.640> artificial

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
times as many fish with these artificial

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.190 
times as many fish with these artificial
baits<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:09.840> with<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> earthworms<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:12.200> I

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
baits and as with the earthworms and I

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.469 
baits and as with the earthworms and I
even<00:01:13.770> more<00:01:14.010> than<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> DOE<00:01:14.520> base<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
even more than the DOE base I like the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.300 
even more than the DOE base I like the
artificial<00:01:15.840> salmon<00:01:16.409> eggs<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.890> DOE<00:01:17.070> baits

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
artificial salmon eggs the DOE baits

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.190 
artificial salmon eggs the DOE baits
they<00:01:17.460> get<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:17.729> your<00:01:17.909> fingers<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.330> be<00:01:18.630> kind<00:01:19.110> of

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
they get on your fingers and be kind of

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.899 
they get on your fingers and be kind of
get<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> mess<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.890> also<00:01:20.189> they<00:01:20.340> come<00:01:20.520> off<00:01:20.729> fairly

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
get a mess and also they come off fairly

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:21.560 
get a mess and also they come off fairly
easy

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
easy

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.960 
easy
these<00:01:22.140> artificial<00:01:22.860> salmon<00:01:23.369> eggs<00:01:23.520> stay<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
these artificial salmon eggs stay on the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.969 
these artificial salmon eggs stay on the
hook<00:01:24.090> very<00:01:24.390> well<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:25.080> even<00:01:25.380> says<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.799> fly

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
hook very well it even says you can fly

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.609 
hook very well it even says you can fly
fish<00:01:26.250> with<00:01:26.430> them<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.820> believe<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.619> also

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
fish with them and I believe it and also

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.080 
fish with them and I believe it and also
I<00:01:28.650> think<00:01:28.799> they<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.189> some<00:01:29.369> great<00:01:29.520> scent<00:01:29.909> in

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
I think they have some great scent in

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.760 
I think they have some great scent in
there<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.390> really<00:01:30.630> attracts<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> fish<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.740> I

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
there that really attracts the fish so I

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.230 
there that really attracts the fish so I
hope<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.490> learn<00:01:32.640> something<00:01:32.670> here

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
hope you learn something here

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.380 
hope you learn something here
oh<00:01:33.390> yeah<00:01:33.540> one<00:01:33.810> more<00:01:33.840> thing<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.439> i<00:01:35.430> have<00:01:35.909> i

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
oh yeah one more thing is i have i

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.499 
oh yeah one more thing is i have i
usually<00:01:37.110> use<00:01:37.140> white<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.619> orange<00:01:38.220> or<00:01:38.520> red<00:01:38.790> gulp

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
usually use white and orange or red gulp

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.600 
usually use white and orange or red gulp
artificial<00:01:40.259> salmon<00:01:40.650> eggs<00:01:40.829> i<00:01:41.040> think<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.400> kind

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
artificial salmon eggs i think that kind

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.730 
artificial salmon eggs i think that kind
of<00:01:41.729> mimics<00:01:42.060> regular<00:01:42.450> salmon<00:01:42.810> eggs<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.259> also

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
of mimics regular salmon eggs and also

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.380 
of mimics regular salmon eggs and also
if<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:43.979> put<00:01:44.189> two<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.430> there<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:44.909> really<00:01:45.060> helps

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
if you put two on there it really helps

eggs
gulp<00:02:02.909> floating<00:02:03.450> salmon<00:02:03.869> eggs<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.399> I<00:02:05.399> have<00:02:05.610> one

orange one white and as you can see

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.169 
orange one white and as you can see
they're<00:02:07.710> floating<00:02:07.890> really<00:02:08.369> well<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.910> have<00:02:09.119> a

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
they're floating really well I have a

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.960 
they're floating really well I have a
small<00:02:09.479> hook<00:02:09.660> four<00:02:10.050> pound<00:02:10.319> test<00:02:10.700> will<00:02:11.700> follow

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
small hook four pound test will follow

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.790 
small hook four pound test will follow
this<00:02:12.500> line<00:02:13.500> down<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.830> the

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
this line down to the

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.800 
this line down to the
where<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:15.730> can<00:02:15.849> see<00:02:16.060> my<00:02:16.239> weight<00:02:16.510> right<00:02:16.540> here

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
where you can see my weight right here

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.280 
where you can see my weight right here
anchoring<00:02:17.409> it<00:02:17.590> down<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:18.489> basically<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:20.110> is

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
anchoring it down so basically this is

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.589 
anchoring it down so basically this is
one<00:02:20.440> reason<00:02:20.650> why<00:02:20.799> the<00:02:20.920> baits<00:02:21.459> work<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:21.940> well<00:02:22.209> is

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
one reason why the baits work so well is

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:23.729 
one reason why the baits work so well is
because<00:02:22.989> when<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:23.170> have<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.319> weight<00:02:23.560> that

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
because when you have a weight that

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.699 
because when you have a weight that
anchors<00:02:24.099> it<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.489> bottom<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:26.290> baits<00:02:26.530> will

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
anchors it to the bottom the baits will

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.949 
anchors it to the bottom the baits will
float<00:02:26.920> straight<00:02:27.310> up<00:02:27.519> right<00:02:27.849> into<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.330> face<00:02:28.569> of

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
float straight up right into the face of

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.470 
float straight up right into the face of
the<00:02:29.739> trout<00:02:30.010> which<00:02:30.250> are<00:02:30.430> usually<00:02:30.670> around<00:02:31.180> six

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
the trout which are usually around six

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.729 
the trout which are usually around six
inches<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:31.900> couple<00:02:32.260> feet<00:02:32.410> off<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.590> bottom

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
inches to a couple feet off the bottom

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.360 
inches to a couple feet off the bottom
and<00:02:33.810> trot<00:02:34.810> are<00:02:34.930> pretty<00:02:35.140> finicky<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.190> lot<00:02:36.340> of

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
and trot are pretty finicky and a lot of

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.800 
and trot are pretty finicky and a lot of
times<00:02:36.610> I<00:02:36.730> won't<00:02:36.940> take<00:02:37.120> bait<00:02:37.390> that's<00:02:37.599> just

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
times I won't take bait that's just

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.630 
times I won't take bait that's just
sitting<00:02:37.989> right<00:02:38.140> on<00:02:38.319> the<00:02:38.500> bottom<00:02:38.950> which<00:02:39.340> is<00:02:39.489> one

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
sitting right on the bottom which is one

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.089 
sitting right on the bottom which is one
reason<00:02:39.849> I<00:02:40.269> think<00:02:40.870> these<00:02:41.260> floating<00:02:41.560> baits<00:02:41.860> work

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
reason I think these floating baits work

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.309 
reason I think these floating baits work
a<00:02:42.190> lot<00:02:42.370> better<00:02:42.549> than<00:02:43.090> things<00:02:43.360> like<00:02:43.450> worms<00:02:43.840> and

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
a lot better than things like worms and

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.470 
a lot better than things like worms and
balls<00:02:44.799> of<00:02:45.010> fire<00:02:45.329> so<00:02:46.329> thanks<00:02:46.930> for<00:02:47.019> watching
