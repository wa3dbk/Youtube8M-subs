00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
when I was playing it and the interface

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.420 
when I was playing it and the interface
itself<00:01:24.869> seemed<00:01:25.140> fairly<00:01:25.439> similar<00:01:25.950> enough<00:01:26.189> to

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
itself seemed fairly similar enough to

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.080 
itself seemed fairly similar enough to
twitch<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:28.250> actual<00:01:29.250> quality<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.820> stream

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
twitch the actual quality of the stream

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.420 
twitch the actual quality of the stream
wasn't<00:01:30.600> too<00:01:30.900> bad<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.439> mean<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.979> games<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.400> I
