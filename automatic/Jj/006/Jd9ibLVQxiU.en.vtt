00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
now it has a perfect amount of power I

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.520 
now it has a perfect amount of power I
put<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> different<00:01:21.509> order<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.439> it

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
put a different order on it so it

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:36.289 
put a different order on it so it
wouldn't<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.830> like<00:01:22.979> Holly

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.529 

I<00:01:50.609> basically<00:01:52.909> what<00:01:53.909> I'm<00:01:53.969> talking<00:01:54.299> about<00:01:54.329> by

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.580 
the landing gear
it's<00:01:56.009> basically<00:01:56.280> shop<00:01:56.630> shock-absorbing<00:01:57.630> so

it's basically shop shock-absorbing so

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.590 
it's basically shop shock-absorbing so
it<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.039> makes<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.490> flip<00:01:59.909> over<00:02:00.060> when<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.420> land

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600
