way you know and i think it just kind of
all<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.630> right<00:03:14.840> time<00:03:15.049> everyone's<00:03:15.500> kind<00:03:15.680> of

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
all the right time everyone's kind of

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.360 
all the right time everyone's kind of
aligned<00:03:16.010> and<00:03:16.190> just<00:03:16.400> culminated<00:03:16.970> and

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
aligned and just culminated and

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.810 
aligned and just culminated and
realizing<00:03:19.370> how<00:03:19.549> they<00:03:19.670> don't<00:03:20.230> what<00:03:21.230> i<00:03:21.260> can<00:03:21.530> and

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
realizing how they don't what i can and

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.160 
realizing how they don't what i can and
you<00:03:22.820> know<00:03:22.910> little<00:03:23.570> things<00:03:23.600> are<00:03:23.840> hard<00:03:24.049> to

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
you know little things are hard to

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.600 
you know little things are hard to
little<00:03:24.410> intangibles<00:03:24.920> i<00:03:25.010> think<00:03:25.190> that<00:03:25.459> make

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
little intangibles i think that make

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.009 
little intangibles i think that make
that<00:03:26.090> they<00:03:26.239> make<00:03:26.390> them<00:03:26.540> better<00:03:26.660> so<00:03:26.900> i<00:03:26.930> think

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
that they make them better so i think

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.449 
that they make them better so i think
i've<00:03:27.200> kind<00:03:27.380> of<00:03:27.410> figured<00:03:27.650> those<00:03:27.739> things<00:03:27.950> in<00:03:28.100> are

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459
