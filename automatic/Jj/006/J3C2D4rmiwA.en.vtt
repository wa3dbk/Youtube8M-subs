00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
take off and this is where the denatured

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.469

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
little silicone on here grease the first

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.219 
little silicone on here grease the first
time<00:01:35.210> when<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.299> crank<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.600> down<00:01:36.630> you'll<00:01:36.990> seal

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
time when you crank it down you'll seal

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.100 
time when you crank it down you'll seal
the<00:01:37.729> liquid<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.850> there<00:01:39.030> actually<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.720> fuel<00:01:39.960> in

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the liquid in there actually the fuel in

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.230 
the liquid in there actually the fuel in
there<00:01:40.259> I've<00:01:40.530> had<00:01:40.920> one<00:01:41.430> here<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.850> I've<00:01:41.970> had

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
there I've had one here that I've had

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.330 
there I've had one here that I've had
sealed<00:01:42.540> for<00:01:42.720> about<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> month<00:01:43.170> no<00:01:43.950> problem

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
sealed for about a month no problem

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.399 
sealed for about a month no problem
sealing<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.420> got<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.689> feel<00:01:46.140> bit<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
sealing it so you got to feel bit a

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.139 
sealing it so you got to feel bit a
little<00:01:46.439> bit<00:01:46.590> mailee<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.040> crank<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.399> down<00:01:47.460> so

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
little bit mailee and crank it down so

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.760 
little bit mailee and crank it down so
we're<00:01:48.720> going<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.899> get<00:01:48.960> into<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.259> in<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.439> second

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
we're going to get into that in a second

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.539 
we're going to get into that in a second
here<00:01:49.970> so<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> way<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.329> works<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.549> that

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
here so the way this works is the that

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.389 
here so the way this works is the that
would<00:01:53.670> come<00:01:53.850> off<00:01:54.500> this<00:01:55.500> lives<00:01:55.860> inside<00:01:56.159> here

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
would come off this lives inside here

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.719 
would come off this lives inside here
like<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:57.680> this<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.829> your<00:01:59.009> chafing<00:01:59.430> cover

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
like that this is your chafing cover

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.609 
like that this is your chafing cover
this<00:02:00.479> will<00:02:00.689> actually<00:02:00.810> put<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.110> out<00:02:01.290> we<00:02:01.500> can

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
this will actually put it out we can

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.990 
this will actually put it out we can
actually<00:02:01.920> regulate<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> flame<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.880> this

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
actually regulate the flame of this

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.410 
actually regulate the flame of this
we'll<00:02:03.180> get<00:02:03.390> into<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.840> second<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:06.240> pot

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
we'll get into that in a second the pot

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.589 
we'll get into that in a second the pot
goes<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.810> top<00:02:07.429> so<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.670> handles<00:02:09.149> again<00:02:09.450> our

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
goes on top so the handles again our

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.059 
goes on top so the handles again our
stainless<00:02:09.810> steel<00:02:10.110> with<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.470> they<00:02:10.890> have<00:02:10.979> a

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
stainless steel with a they have a

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.160 
stainless steel with a they have a
silicone<00:02:11.450> covering<00:02:12.450> on<00:02:12.599> them<00:02:12.840> and

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
silicone covering on them and

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.690 
silicone covering on them and
it<00:02:13.230> actually<00:02:13.410> keeps<00:02:13.680> them<00:02:13.860> cool<00:02:14.099> in<00:02:14.160> there<00:02:14.430> so

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
it actually keeps them cool in there so

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.250 
it actually keeps them cool in there so
when<00:02:15.209> you<00:02:15.300> pick<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.569> up<00:02:15.750> when<00:02:15.930> it's<00:02:16.080> boiling

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
when you pick this up when it's boiling

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.650 
when you pick this up when it's boiling
is<00:02:16.560> not<00:02:16.740> hot<00:02:17.220> at<00:02:17.370> all<00:02:17.459> it's<00:02:17.670> real<00:02:17.880> light<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.540> now

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
is not hot at all it's real light it now

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.720 
is not hot at all it's real light it now
do<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.989> what<00:02:19.260> they<00:02:19.349> call<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.530> pre<00:02:19.770> burn<00:02:20.010> which

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
do it what they call a pre burn which

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.500 
do it what they call a pre burn which
really<00:02:20.940> does<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.390> gasification<00:02:21.840> here<00:02:23.510> there

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
really does the gasification here there

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.070 
really does the gasification here there
we<00:02:24.599> go<00:02:25.160> so<00:02:26.160> what<00:02:26.370> happens<00:02:26.700> here<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.209> as<00:02:28.050> a

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
we go so what happens here is the as a

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.590 
we go so what happens here is the as a
fuel<00:02:28.470> warms<00:02:28.770> up<00:02:28.980> creates<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.640> small<00:02:29.910> gas<00:02:30.209> and

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
fuel warms up creates a small gas and

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.059 
fuel warms up creates a small gas and
there's<00:02:30.840> little<00:02:31.170> holes<00:02:31.319> drilled<00:02:31.709> around<00:02:31.920> the

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
there's little holes drilled around the

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.510 
there's little holes drilled around the
outer<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.459> is<00:02:32.580> all<00:02:32.790> brass<00:02:33.150> by<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.750> way<00:02:33.930> and

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
outer this is all brass by the way and

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.370 
outer this is all brass by the way and
in<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.970> minute<00:02:36.239> or<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:36.390> you'll<00:02:36.750> see<00:02:36.959> small

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
in a minute or so you'll see small

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.920 
in a minute or so you'll see small
little<00:02:38.180> flames<00:02:39.180> coming<00:02:39.510> out<00:02:39.569> of<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.750> holes

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
little flames coming out of the holes

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.830 
little flames coming out of the holes
and<00:02:40.110> there<00:02:40.290> they<00:02:40.380> go<00:02:40.410> they're<00:02:40.860> starting<00:02:40.980> to

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
and there they go they're starting to

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.240 
and there they go they're starting to
gassed<00:02:42.840> up<00:02:43.019> pretty<00:02:43.230> fast<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:43.620> that's<00:02:43.890> that's

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
gassed up pretty fast so that's that's

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.270 
gassed up pretty fast so that's that's
you're<00:02:44.580> going<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.760> be<00:02:44.910> your<00:02:45.650> your<00:02:46.650> flame<00:02:47.040> that

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
you're going to be your your flame that

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.650 
you're going to be your your flame that
you're<00:02:47.370> going<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.550> have<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:50.480> let's<00:02:51.480> say<00:02:51.540> we

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
you're going to have and let's say we

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.789 
you're going to have and let's say we
achieve<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.170> pretty<00:02:52.530> quick<00:02:54.590> here<00:02:55.590> I'm<00:02:55.709> going

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
achieve that pretty quick here I'm going

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.440 
achieve that pretty quick here I'm going
to<00:02:55.890> dump<00:02:56.040> 12<00:02:56.340> ounces<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.670> water<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:57.090> here<00:02:57.239> I

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
to dump 12 ounces of water in here I

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.240 
to dump 12 ounces of water in here I
think<00:02:57.660> this<00:02:57.780> is<00:02:57.840> closed<00:02:58.260> might<00:02:58.530> be<00:02:58.620> 16<00:02:59.069> let's

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
think this is closed might be 16 let's

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.370 
think this is closed might be 16 let's
go<00:02:59.370> oh<00:03:01.310> so<00:03:02.310> what<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.580> this<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:02.970> is<00:03:03.170> 16.9<00:03:04.170> out

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
go oh so what is this this is 16.9 out

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.800 
go oh so what is this this is 16.9 out
fluid<00:03:04.739> ounces<00:03:05.090> I'll<00:03:06.090> put<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:06.299> in<00:03:06.540> there<00:03:06.690> and

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
fluid ounces I'll put that in there and

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.970 
fluid ounces I'll put that in there and
we'll<00:03:06.900> come<00:03:07.080> back<00:03:07.230> in<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.470> few<00:03:07.500> minutes<00:03:07.680> so

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
we'll come back in a few minutes so

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.680 
we'll come back in a few minutes so
we'll<00:03:08.069> get<00:03:08.190> our<00:03:08.340> burn<00:03:08.910> gun<00:03:09.180> will<00:03:09.360> show<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.569> the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
we'll get our burn gun will show you the

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.390 
we'll get our burn gun will show you the
boil<00:03:09.900> okay<00:03:10.440> it's<00:03:10.650> been<00:03:10.769> about<00:03:10.830> eight<00:03:11.160> minutes

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
boil okay it's been about eight minutes

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.110 
boil okay it's been about eight minutes
now<00:03:11.700> we<00:03:11.970> got<00:03:12.180> almost<00:03:13.140> two-thirds<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:14.610> 32

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
now we got almost two-thirds of the 32

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.539 
now we got almost two-thirds of the 32
ounces<00:03:15.450> filled<00:03:15.690> up<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:15.900> put<00:03:16.080> about<00:03:16.400> 17<00:03:17.400> ounces

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
ounces filled up I put about 17 ounces

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.210 
ounces filled up I put about 17 ounces
of<00:03:17.880> water<00:03:18.030> in<00:03:18.209> here<00:03:18.329> maybe<00:03:18.769> and<00:03:19.769> we<00:03:19.859> got<00:03:19.980> a<00:03:20.010> hard

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
of water in here maybe and we got a hard

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.580 
of water in here maybe and we got a hard
boil<00:03:20.690> if<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:21.750> take<00:03:21.900> temperature<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.560> water

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
boil if I take temperature of the water

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.280 
boil if I take temperature of the water
got<00:03:23.370> we're<00:03:23.519> in<00:03:23.579> about<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.790> hundred<00:03:23.940> and

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
got we're in about a hundred and

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.880 
got we're in about a hundred and
ninety-eight<00:03:25.290> degrees<00:03:25.560> here<00:03:27.109> so<00:03:28.109> pretty

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
ninety-eight degrees here so pretty

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.970 
ninety-eight degrees here so pretty
impressive<00:03:29.959> one<00:03:30.959> thing<00:03:31.109> we<00:03:31.230> like<00:03:31.470> about<00:03:31.530> this

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
impressive one thing we like about this

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.940 
impressive one thing we like about this
stove<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:32.570> if<00:03:33.570> it's<00:03:33.810> in<00:03:33.959> windy<00:03:34.290> conditions<00:03:34.320> it

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
stove is if it's in windy conditions it

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.340 
stove is if it's in windy conditions it
still<00:03:35.220> does<00:03:35.730> pretty<00:03:36.030> well<00:03:36.170> considering<00:03:37.170> the

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
still does pretty well considering the

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.080 
still does pretty well considering the
fact<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.620> it<00:03:37.799> has<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:37.980> kind<00:03:38.549> of<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.760> built-in

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
fact that it has a kind of a built-in

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.150 
fact that it has a kind of a built-in
windscreen<00:03:39.510> but<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.040> denatured<00:03:41.040> alcohol

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
windscreen but the denatured alcohol

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.340 
windscreen but the denatured alcohol
holds<00:03:41.670> up<00:03:41.760> pretty<00:03:41.790> well<00:03:42.030> I'm<00:03:42.900> going<00:03:43.049> to<00:03:43.140> blow

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
holds up pretty well I'm going to blow

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:52.009 
holds up pretty well I'm going to blow
on<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:47.750> blow<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:48.780> pretty<00:03:49.019> hard<00:03:50.570> so<00:03:51.570> I<00:03:51.600> can't

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
on it I blow it pretty hard so I can't

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.259 
on it I blow it pretty hard so I can't
blow<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:52.410> out<00:03:52.579> now<00:03:53.579> we<00:03:53.700> got<00:03:53.820> a<00:03:53.850> good<00:03:54.030> hard

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
blow that out now we got a good hard

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.599 
blow that out now we got a good hard
boil<00:03:54.510> there<00:03:54.890> that's<00:03:55.890> pretty<00:03:56.040> impressive<00:03:56.250> if

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
boil there that's pretty impressive if

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.390 
boil there that's pretty impressive if
we<00:03:56.670> wanted<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:57.000> regulate<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.660> flame<00:03:58.319> we<00:03:59.100> drop

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
we wanted to regulate the flame we drop

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.759 
we wanted to regulate the flame we drop
the<00:03:59.670> chafing<00:04:00.180> cover<00:04:00.390> on<00:04:00.600> it<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.989> we<00:04:01.440> can<00:04:01.560> close

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
the chafing cover on it and we can close

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.800 
the chafing cover on it and we can close
and<00:04:02.069> open<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.370> damper<00:04:02.609> that'll<00:04:03.329> regulate<00:04:03.690> it

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
and open the damper that'll regulate it

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.360 
and open the damper that'll regulate it
and<00:04:03.870> keep<00:04:04.079> it<00:04:04.200> you<00:04:04.410> know<00:04:04.440> really<00:04:04.680> slow<00:04:05.010> simmer

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
and keep it you know really slow simmer

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.940 
and keep it you know really slow simmer
if<00:04:05.519> you<00:04:05.579> like<00:04:05.819> anyway<00:04:06.750> also<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:09.470> lid<00:04:10.470> will

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
if you like anyway also the lid will

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.590 
if you like anyway also the lid will
make<00:04:11.130> it<00:04:11.280> come<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:11.549> boil<00:04:11.760> much<00:04:12.000> faster<00:04:12.480> we

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
make it come to a boil much faster we

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.900 
make it come to a boil much faster we
did<00:04:12.750> this<00:04:12.870> burn<00:04:13.200> this<00:04:14.130> actual<00:04:14.459> this<00:04:14.489> boil

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
did this burn this actual this boil

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.759 
did this burn this actual this boil
without<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.450> lid<00:04:15.690> so<00:04:18.169> pretty<00:04:19.169> impressive<00:04:19.620> and

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
without the lid so pretty impressive and

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.080 
without the lid so pretty impressive and
I'm<00:04:20.280> going<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.459> go<00:04:20.549> over<00:04:20.579> here<00:04:20.700> and<00:04:20.789> check<00:04:20.940> the

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
I'm going to go over here and check the

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.060 
I'm going to go over here and check the
temperature<00:04:21.539> of<00:04:22.080> our<00:04:22.289> handle<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:22.950> they're

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
temperature of our handle and they're

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.220 
temperature of our handle and they're
they're<00:04:23.520> cool<00:04:23.789> to<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.090> touch

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
they're cool to the touch

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.490 
they're cool to the touch
rotate<00:04:26.010> that<00:04:26.160> around<00:04:27.350> where<00:04:28.350> is<00:04:28.440> the

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
rotate that around where is the

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.550 
rotate that around where is the
temperature<00:04:28.800> there<00:04:29.960> if<00:04:30.960> I<00:04:31.110> come<00:04:31.320> around<00:04:31.380> this

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
temperature there if I come around this

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.220 
temperature there if I come around this
way<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:31.770> I<00:04:32.040> get<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.310> temperature<00:04:32.490> it<00:04:33.090> says<00:04:33.420> 84

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
way and I get the temperature it says 84

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.150 
way and I get the temperature it says 84
degrees<00:04:35.540> there<00:04:36.540> we<00:04:36.600> go<00:04:36.720> so<00:04:37.560> those<00:04:37.740> are<00:04:37.770> not<00:04:37.980> hot

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
degrees there we go so those are not hot

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.520 
degrees there we go so those are not hot
at<00:04:38.310> all<00:04:38.430> that<00:04:39.390> water<00:04:39.570> is<00:04:39.780> definitely<00:04:40.110> boiling

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
at all that water is definitely boiling

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.940 
at all that water is definitely boiling
anyway<00:04:41.400> it's<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.670> estimate<00:04:42.150> spirit<00:04:42.570> stove

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
anyway it's the estimate spirit stove

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.730 
anyway it's the estimate spirit stove

know that with a full little tank here

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.820 
know that with a full little tank here
burns<00:04:54.210> about<00:04:54.450> 28<00:04:54.900> minutes<00:04:55.260> is<00:04:55.440> what<00:04:55.620> we've
