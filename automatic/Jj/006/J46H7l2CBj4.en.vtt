00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 we have here three numerical lines 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.799
 different places it here 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.469
 some markings here -2 to -10 here - 5 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.170
 - 11 1 - 7 he wants to know what 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.330
 represents this blue point and only for you 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.740
 give a little hint these marquinhos 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.720
 here or do not necessarily have a 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.910
 space of one unit may be more than 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.859
 that a unit then encourages you to pause 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.720
 the video discovered that this little blue dot 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.880
 represents the number is represented 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.340
 on these straights because well let's do this 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.910
 The first example here then here 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.200
 less two here is less 10 6 8 -2 until the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.360
 at least 10 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.640
 What do I have to do, I need to 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.730
 take eight is eight less and so that this 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.260
 point here is to the left - this well 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.940
 to the left - 10 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.070
 then it will be a much smaller number than 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.989
 at least 10 quiet and what's here 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.239
 It means so it's good if I skip two 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.610
 boxes here to the left or subtract 8 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.610
 if I skip two more houses for 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.770
 left I'm going up 38 again and 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.649
 two other houses to the left 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.339
 subtract 18 again as soon as it happens 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.580
 In this house here, I'm going to be 18 and 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.640
 here now a blip time - 18-8 will 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.320
 give less 26 and another way of 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.119
 think about it here is the following if I 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.950
 skip two marks to the left this 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.470
 equals minus eight that means 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.390
 so that one to the left here I speak 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.759
 only one of these distances 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.759
 that equals minus four then - 2 - 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.650
 4 here will be the least six 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.939
 so when I take 4 again here 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.549
 at least 10 when I take 4 - 14 when 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.009
 I take four minus 18 shot 4 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.340
 again this will give less 22 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.710
 and then when I take 4 again - 26 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.689
 ok let's do this our second now 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.570
 example and here is the following I am 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.840
 starting from the -11 world here รณ growth 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.880
 out of 5 and I want to find out 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.680
 blue dot is right then how much 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.750
 but I'm walking to the right on the line 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.570
 increase the number of games 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.270
 here I 'll have to add six right 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.920
 to leave - 11 arriving minus 5 ie 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.350
 popular two houses to the right 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.379
 this is equivalent to jumping six units or 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.950
 It's either when you jump over every little 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:16.230
 You're going to jump then more 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.220
 each unit has this one is equivalent to 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.170
 3 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.200
 and then when I come here to my side - 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.370
 Five, I'm going to add 3 and I'm going to stop. 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.800
 no less two 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.410
 When I jump over here I'm 13 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.600
 again I'm going to stop at another one there 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.870
 when I make that last jump one more 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.270
 plus three will give four more value logo 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.350
 of that interrogation there at that point is 4 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.720
 positive 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.670
 Let's now go to our last example 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.709
 and here is the following look has minus seven 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.880
 here is one and our question is 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.790
 right here 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.580
 Good if I leave at least seven to walk 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.510
 even if one here right commute I go 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.519
 have to add eight right - 7 + 81 and then 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.030
 if I make two more jumps to the 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.489
 Right, I'm going to stop where I spend one more 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.130
 8 which is equal then to 9 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.660
 here is the 9 positive which is another 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.069
 way of thinking about it here 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.769
 Now let's think as follows. 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.660
 so if two jumps equals 8 then 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.709
 one is from here to here for example 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.260
 equals to add four then -7 more 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.299
 four and come back here at least 3 when 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.160
 I'm bad 4 again I'm going to stop 11 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.489
 when I'm a 4 I'm gonna stop again 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:31.730
 here at 5 positive and 5 positive more 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.730
 four equals 9 until the next video
