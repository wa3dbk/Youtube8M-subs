is it all the way to the front as well

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.330 
is it all the way to the front as well
so<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.290> sensor<00:03:32.620> here<00:03:32.919> I<00:03:33.040> didn't<00:03:33.250> notice

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
so the sensor here I didn't notice

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.159 
so the sensor here I didn't notice
sometimes<00:03:33.609> this<00:03:34.480> flapper<00:03:34.870> here<00:03:35.019> the

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
sometimes this flapper here the

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:36.390 
sometimes this flapper here the
proximity<00:03:35.440> sensor<00:03:35.620> would<00:03:35.919> go<00:03:36.069> off<00:03:36.159> of<00:03:36.310> my

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
proximity sensor would go off of my

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.009 
proximity sensor would go off of my
phone<00:03:36.519> thinking<00:03:36.879> my<00:03:36.970> face<00:03:37.180> was<00:03:37.359> against<00:03:37.930> it

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
phone thinking my face was against it

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.710 
phone thinking my face was against it
because<00:03:38.139> it's<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.650> flap<00:03:39.310> of<00:03:39.489> leather<00:03:39.720> didn't

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720

overall<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.680> quality<00:04:09.040> is<00:04:09.099> really<00:04:09.129> nice<00:04:09.430> it

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
overall the quality is really nice it

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.479 
overall the quality is really nice it
almost<00:04:10.359> looks<00:04:10.629> like<00:04:10.720> handmade<00:04:11.290> as<00:04:11.829> far<00:04:12.340> as<00:04:12.430> the

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
almost looks like handmade as far as the

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.670 
almost looks like handmade as far as the
quality<00:04:12.819> goes<00:04:12.940> my<00:04:13.449> only<00:04:13.629> issue<00:04:13.810> was<00:04:14.079> that<00:04:14.139> the

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
quality goes my only issue was that the

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.960 
quality goes my only issue was that the
home<00:04:14.829> but<00:04:15.010> on<00:04:15.099> the<00:04:15.190> bottom<00:04:15.430> I<00:04:15.519> think<00:04:15.819> if<00:04:15.879> the

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
home but on the bottom I think if the

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.060 
home but on the bottom I think if the
flap<00:04:16.180> was<00:04:16.329> attached<00:04:16.630> from<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.900> top<00:04:17.109> or<00:04:17.380> if

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
flap was attached from the top or if

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.379 
flap was attached from the top or if
they<00:04:18.190> actually<00:04:18.459> they<00:04:18.579> had<00:04:18.699> a<00:04:18.729> cutaway<00:04:19.060> here

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
they actually they had a cutaway here

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:20.849 
they actually they had a cutaway here
that<00:04:19.630> didn't<00:04:19.870> cover<00:04:20.109> over<00:04:20.349> the<00:04:20.380> button<00:04:20.680> I

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
that didn't cover over the button I

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.110 
that didn't cover over the button I
probably<00:04:21.310> wouldn't<00:04:21.609> be<00:04:21.669> an<00:04:21.729> issue<00:04:21.849> at<00:04:22.029> all

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
probably wouldn't be an issue at all

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.060 
probably wouldn't be an issue at all
anymore<00:04:22.330> but<00:04:22.990> it<00:04:23.260> is<00:04:23.409> what<00:04:23.590> it<00:04:23.620> is<00:04:23.740> that's<00:04:24.010> just

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
anymore but it is what it is that's just

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.560
