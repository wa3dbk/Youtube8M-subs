yet<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.740> build<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.460> for<00:00:12.179> me<00:00:12.360> but<00:00:12.740> it's

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
yet and I build it for me but it's

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.400 
yet and I build it for me but it's
intended<00:00:14.219> only<00:00:14.490> for<00:00:14.780> cockpit<00:00:15.780> builders<00:00:16.199> I'm

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
on my own my own landing gear I decided

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.030 
on my own my own landing gear I decided
to<00:00:34.500> add<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:36.120> site<00:00:36.899> tech<00:00:39.770> to<00:00:40.770> make<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
to add the site tech to make the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.040 
to add the site tech to make the
modification<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.760> add<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.600> high-tech

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
modification and add this high-tech

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.920 
modification and add this high-tech
switch<00:00:43.789> and<00:00:44.789> connect<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.570> my<00:00:45.600> settings

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
switch and connect it to my settings

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.130 
switch and connect it to my settings

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
switch panel and as you can see here I

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.990 
switch panel and as you can see here I
wired<00:00:49.620> up<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.210> long<00:00:51.210> lever<00:00:51.480> switches<00:00:55.160> is<00:00:56.160> this

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
wired up to long lever switches is this

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.560 
wired up to long lever switches is this
is<00:00:57.149> pretty<00:00:57.360> simple<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.820> right<00:00:59.820> here<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.329> have

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
is pretty simple and right here you have

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.650 
is pretty simple and right here you have
the<00:01:00.750> SciTech<00:01:01.260> switch<00:01:02.219> board<00:01:02.579> with<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.090> LEDs

the SciTech switch board with the LEDs

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.440 
the SciTech switch board with the LEDs
and<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.270> so<00:01:06.590> notice<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:08.070> order<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:09.299> this

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
and so on so notice in order to do this

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.590 
and so on so notice in order to do this
mod<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.310> take<00:01:11.490> apart<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> cyclic

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
mod you have to take apart the cyclic

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.120 
mod you have to take apart the cyclic
switch<00:01:12.840> panel<00:01:13.200> now<00:01:13.790> imagine<00:01:14.790> my<00:01:14.939> like<00:01:15.860> it<00:01:16.860> was

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
switch panel now imagine my like it was

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.370 
switch panel now imagine my like it was
new<00:01:17.759> because<00:01:18.030> mine<00:01:18.479> was<00:01:18.509> through<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.140> lot<00:01:19.350> of

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
new because mine was through a lot of

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.429 
new because mine was through a lot of
things<00:01:20.090> so<00:01:21.320> if<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.560> was<00:01:23.340> new<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:24.600> only<00:01:24.810> thing

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
things so if this was new the only thing

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.499 
things so if this was new the only thing
I<00:01:25.650> would<00:01:25.710> need<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.610> do<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:28.759> take<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.939> back

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
I would need to do is take this back

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.179 
I would need to do is take this back

landing gear switch knob which is this

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.020 
landing gear switch knob which is this
and<00:01:38.600> here<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.780> have<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.290> ground<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.220> two

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and here you have the ground and two

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.980 
and here you have the ground and two
wires<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.720> inputs<00:01:43.439> which<00:01:43.920> should<00:01:44.579> be<00:01:44.990> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
wires for inputs which should be the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.719 
wires for inputs which should be the
ones<00:01:46.229> here<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.350> ground<00:01:49.729> connections

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
ones here so the the ground connections

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.010 
ones here so the the ground connections
are<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.600> ones

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
are this ones

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.550 
are this ones
it<00:01:52.890> goes<00:01:53.130> together<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.290> ground

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
it goes together to the to the ground

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.730 
it goes together to the to the ground
wire<00:01:55.920> of

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
wire of

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.530 
wire of
this<00:01:58.740> site<00:01:59.070> X<00:01:59.250> which<00:01:59.460> knob<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.149> inputs

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
this site X which knob and the inputs

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.490 
this site X which knob and the inputs
goes<00:02:00.930> one<00:02:01.560> input<00:02:01.710> here<00:02:02.070> one<00:02:02.450> over<00:02:03.450> there<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
goes one input here one over there the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.249 
goes one input here one over there the
only<00:02:04.710> thing<00:02:04.829> about<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.079> if<00:02:07.079> you

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
only thing about this is that if you

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.340 
only thing about this is that if you
skip<00:02:07.469> one

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
skip one

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.180 
skip one
the<00:02:10.350> switches<00:02:11.390> it's<00:02:12.390> kind<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.840> hard<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.650> attach

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
the switches it's kind of hard to attach

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.230 
the switches it's kind of hard to attach
them<00:02:14.490> back<00:02:15.390> here<00:02:15.860> you<00:02:16.860> you're<00:02:17.550> going<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:18.060> need

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
them back here you you're going to need

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.500 
them back here you you're going to need
to<00:02:18.420> make<00:02:18.630> these<00:02:19.350> wires<00:02:19.770> longer<00:02:20.640> or<00:02:20.850> something

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
to make these wires longer or something

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.130 
to make these wires longer or something
or<00:02:21.810> if<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.860> don't<00:02:23.130> know<00:02:23.220> what<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:23.670> are<00:02:23.730> doing

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
or if you don't know what you are doing

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.730 
or if you don't know what you are doing
better<00:02:25.140> leave<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.590> alone<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:27.380> if<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.500> don't

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
better leave it alone and if you don't

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.400 
better leave it alone and if you don't
want<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.100> use<00:02:29.670> this<00:02:29.910> part<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.140> switch

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
want to use this part of the switch

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.440 
want to use this part of the switch
panel<00:02:31.800> there<00:02:32.040> it's<00:02:32.250> going<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.670> be<00:02:32.730> much<00:02:33.210> more

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
panel there it's going to be much more

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.090 
panel there it's going to be much more
easier<00:02:33.900> okay<00:02:34.410> as<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.220> can<00:02:35.280> see<00:02:35.400> here<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:37.170> if

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
easier okay as you can see here that if

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.580 
easier okay as you can see here that if
you<00:02:38.280> want<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.520> do<00:02:38.610> like<00:02:38.790> me<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:40.260> add<00:02:40.410> the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
you want to do like me to add the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.700 
you want to do like me to add the
switchboard<00:02:41.100> back<00:02:41.730> here<00:02:41.970> it's<00:02:42.120> way<00:02:43.080> easier

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
switchboard back here it's way easier

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.170 
switchboard back here it's way easier
because<00:02:44.490> these<00:02:45.050> psychics<00:02:46.050> which<00:02:47.180> switches

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
because these psychics which switches

because these psychics which switches
are<00:02:48.330> connected<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:49.760> right<00:02:50.760> over<00:02:50.940> here<00:02:51.300> I<00:02:51.330> know

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
are connected to right over here I know

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.950 
are connected to right over here I know
if<00:02:51.960> you<00:02:52.140> can<00:02:52.320> see<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:54.420> connect<00:02:54.720> those

if you can see it and to connect those

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.100 
if you can see it and to connect those
and<00:02:55.260> keep<00:02:55.440> them<00:02:55.650> connected<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:56.310> kind<00:02:56.580> of

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
and keep them connected this kind of

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.870 
and keep them connected this kind of

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
kind of hard unless you make the wires

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.370 
kind of hard unless you make the wires
longer<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.470> only<00:03:01.770> thing<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.370> need<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:03.380> to

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
longer the only thing you need to to

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.150 
longer the only thing you need to to
connect<00:03:04.710> to<00:03:05.100> it's<00:03:05.640> it's<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.540> other<00:03:06.720> switch

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
connect to it's it's the other switch

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.400 
connect to it's it's the other switch
knob<00:03:08.160> this<00:03:09.080> must<00:03:10.080> remain<00:03:10.730> connected<00:03:12.410> through

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
knob this must remain connected through

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.570 
knob this must remain connected through
to<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.520> Celtic<00:03:14.940> switchboard<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:17.370> three

to the Celtic switchboard and the three

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.740 
to the Celtic switchboard and the three
wires<00:03:17.880> are<00:03:18.200> right<00:03:19.200> here<00:03:23.090> so<00:03:24.090> I'm<00:03:24.330> gonna<00:03:24.510> I

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
wires are right here so I'm gonna I

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.930 
wires are right here so I'm gonna I
don't<00:03:25.080> know<00:03:25.290> if<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.560> can<00:03:25.740> really<00:03:26.670> see

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
don't know if you can really see

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.050 
don't know if you can really see
anything<00:03:27.180> in<00:03:27.540> here<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.350> this<00:03:28.560> is<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:29.550> red<00:03:29.850> wire

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
anything in here so this is the red wire

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.110 
anything in here so this is the red wire
it's<00:03:30.390> ground<00:03:30.950> which<00:03:31.950> is<00:03:31.980> I<00:03:32.430> told<00:03:32.610> you<00:03:32.790> before

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
it's ground which is I told you before

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.830 
it's ground which is I told you before
goes<00:03:34.550> round<00:03:35.550> here<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.260> ground<00:03:37.260> down<00:03:38.100> here<00:03:38.840> you

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
goes round here and ground down here you

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.180 
goes round here and ground down here you
need<00:03:39.960> to<00:03:40.020> make<00:03:40.200> -<00:03:40.610> this<00:03:41.610> is<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.910> ground<00:03:42.800> the<00:03:43.800> D

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
need to make - this is the ground the D

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.140 
need to make - this is the ground the D
wire<00:03:44.400> which<00:03:44.700> is<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.870> red<00:03:46.080> one<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:47.760> ground

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
wire which is the red one and the ground

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.860 
wire which is the red one and the ground
can<00:03:48.990> be<00:03:49.140> connected<00:03:49.440> together<00:03:49.710> to<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:51.480> ground

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
can be connected together to the ground

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.380 
can be connected together to the ground
the<00:03:52.140> switchboard<00:03:53.010> wire<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.520> then<00:03:54.090> you<00:03:54.210> have

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
the switchboard wire and then you have

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.960 
the switchboard wire and then you have
two<00:03:54.720> these<00:03:55.170> are<00:03:55.350> two<00:03:55.620> inputs<00:03:55.980> which<00:03:56.250> you<00:03:56.490> will

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
two these are two inputs which you will

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.930 
two these are two inputs which you will
be<00:03:57.180> connected<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:58.310> inputs<00:03:59.310> are<00:03:59.550> this<00:04:00.120> one<00:04:00.920> yes

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
be connected the inputs are this one yes

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.330 
be connected the inputs are this one yes
this<00:04:02.940> other<00:04:03.150> one<00:04:03.390> which<00:04:04.200> can<00:04:04.830> be<00:04:05.010> connected

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
this other one which can be connected

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.430 
this other one which can be connected
through<00:04:06.890> to<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.160> other<00:04:08.310> two<00:04:08.790> wires<00:04:09.290> as<00:04:10.290> you

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
through to the other two wires as you

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.050 
through to the other two wires as you
can<00:04:10.590> see<00:04:10.740> here<00:04:11.720> now<00:04:12.720> this<00:04:13.320> modification<00:04:14.040> as<00:04:15.000> I

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
can see here now this modification as I

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.820 
can see here now this modification as I
told<00:04:15.390> you<00:04:15.540> before<00:04:15.900> if<00:04:16.020> you<00:04:16.260> don't<00:04:16.290> know<00:04:16.620> what

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
told you before if you don't know what

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.870 
told you before if you don't know what
you're<00:04:17.070> doing<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:18.180> better<00:04:18.390> leave<00:04:18.630> it<00:04:18.780> alone

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
you're doing you better leave it alone

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.730 
you're doing you better leave it alone
and<00:04:20.709> to<00:04:21.709> be<00:04:21.830> honest<00:04:22.160> is<00:04:22.310> pretty<00:04:22.610> simple<00:04:23.740> it's

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
and to be honest is pretty simple it's

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.130 
and to be honest is pretty simple it's
not<00:04:24.950> that<00:04:25.190> hard<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:25.760> if<00:04:26.330> you<00:04:26.480> accept<00:04:26.840> to<00:04:26.960> take

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
not that hard and if you accept to take

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.190 
not that hard and if you accept to take
apart<00:04:27.530> your<00:04:27.620> site<00:04:28.010> X<00:04:28.250> which<00:04:28.430> panel<00:04:29.200> you're

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
apart your site X which panel you're

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.640 
apart your site X which panel you're
going<00:04:30.350> to<00:04:30.410> be<00:04:30.500> fine<00:04:30.740> I'm<00:04:30.890> gonna<00:04:32.650> upload

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
going to be fine I'm gonna upload

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.420 

hope<00:05:02.150> it's<00:05:02.360> still<00:05:02.630> working<00:05:05.740> so<00:05:06.740> let's<00:05:07.130> go

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
hope it's still working so let's go

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:16.240 
hope it's still working so let's go
through<00:05:07.790> spent<00:05:10.360> come<00:05:11.360> on

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.760 

why<00:05:17.250> does<00:05:17.640> it<00:05:17.820> tell<00:05:18.030> me<00:05:18.060> new<00:05:18.870> harder<00:05:19.260> respond

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
why does it tell me new harder respond

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.960 
why does it tell me new harder respond
oh<00:05:20.720> it<00:05:21.720> doesn't<00:05:21.930> matter

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970

and as you can see here I have the

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:33.980 
and as you can see here I have the
spider<00:05:26.270> software<00:05:27.270> I<00:05:32.480> just<00:05:33.480> can<00:05:33.660> see<00:05:33.840> it's

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
spider software I just can see it's

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.540 
spider software I just can see it's
working<00:05:34.200> her<00:05:35.150> somehow<00:05:36.150> let<00:05:36.390> go<00:05:36.540> to<00:05:37.460> in<00:05:38.460> the

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
working her somehow let go to in the

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:51.629 
working her somehow let go to in the
same<00:05:39.980> see<00:05:40.980> if<00:05:41.100> it's<00:05:41.280> really<00:05:41.610> working
