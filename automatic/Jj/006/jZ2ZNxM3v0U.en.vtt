really<00:01:48.429> good<00:01:48.580> treat<00:01:48.910> for<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.330> defense<00:01:50.200> I

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
really good treat for the defense I

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.229 
really good treat for the defense I

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:52.239 
think they will love it because there

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:55.229 
think they will love it because there
was<00:01:52.390> nothing<00:01:52.599> done<00:01:53.500> like<00:01:53.950> that<00:01:54.099> before<00:01:54.239> that
