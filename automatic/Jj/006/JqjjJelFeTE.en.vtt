while this fact alone should be enough
to<00:00:21.180> make<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.480> think<00:00:21.689> twice<00:00:21.869> about<00:00:21.990> what<00:00:22.410> you

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590

worse<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.859> United<00:00:26.160> States<00:00:26.310> does<00:00:26.580> not<00:00:26.609> require

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
worse the United States does not require

so<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.539> really<00:00:30.750> have<00:00:30.779> no<00:00:31.019> idea<00:00:31.050> whether

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
so you really have no idea whether

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.380 
so you really have no idea whether
you're<00:00:32.130> buying<00:00:32.279> something<00:00:32.640> natural<00:00:33.210> or
