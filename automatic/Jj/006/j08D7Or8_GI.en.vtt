00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
this and just before I show you how this

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.249 
this and just before I show you how this
thing<00:01:23.189> works<00:01:24.140> let's<00:01:25.140> go<00:01:25.320> over<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:25.830> and

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.380 

change<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.820> make<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.060> go<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.180> lot

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
change this so you can make it go a lot

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.390 
change this so you can make it go a lot
faster<00:01:33.630> than<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.229> had<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.439> going<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.920> by<00:01:38.340> doing

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
faster than I had it going so by doing

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.819 
faster than I had it going so by doing
that<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:39.150> can<00:01:39.570> dispense<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.320> arrows<00:01:40.590> much

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
that you can dispense the arrows much

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:48.399 
that you can dispense the arrows much
faster<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.460> we've<00:01:41.579> got<00:01:41.759> three<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:43.619> go<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.040> and

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.929 

you<00:01:49.409> get<00:01:49.530> arrows<00:01:49.829> very<00:01:50.130> very<00:01:50.399> quickly<00:01:50.670> so

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
you get arrows very very quickly so

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.580 
you get arrows very very quickly so
let's<00:01:51.659> see<00:01:51.780> how<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.020> work<00:01:52.200> thing<00:01:52.500> so

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
let's see how this work thing so

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.080 
let's see how this work thing so
basically<00:01:55.590> as<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.100> can<00:01:56.250> see<00:01:56.460> we've<00:01:56.670> differed

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
basically as you can see we've differed

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.840 
basically as you can see we've differed
from<00:01:57.890> redownload<00:01:58.890> original<00:01:59.369> design<00:01:59.670> which

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
from redownload original design which

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.190 
from redownload original design which
hit<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.299> line<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.200> alternating<00:02:01.740> torches<00:02:03.200> up

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
hit a line of alternating torches up

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.170 
hit a line of alternating torches up
here<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.680> order<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.950> power<00:02:05.219> everything<00:02:05.520> the

here in order to power everything the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.180 
here in order to power everything the
problem<00:02:06.540> with<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.259> you've<00:02:08.009> got

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
problem with that is that you've got

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.470 
problem with that is that you've got
some<00:02:08.610> letter<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.420> some<00:02:09.750> letter<00:02:09.929> off<00:02:10.229> and

dispenser
powering<00:02:13.790> is<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:13.940> bit<00:02:14.180> funny<00:02:14.420> in<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:16.550> will

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
powering is a bit funny in that it will

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.340 
powering is a bit funny in that it will
select<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:20.090> will<00:02:20.390> dispense<00:02:20.810> when<00:02:21.110> there<00:02:21.260> are

select it will dispense when there are

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.760 
select it will dispense when there are

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
redstone updates on the blocks around it

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.300 
redstone updates on the blocks around it
and<00:02:25.580> it's<00:02:26.450> being<00:02:26.630> powered<00:02:28.360> so<00:02:29.710> as<00:02:30.710> a<00:02:30.800> result<00:02:31.010> of

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
and it's being powered so as a result of

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.490 
and it's being powered so as a result of
that<00:02:31.460> if<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.540> had<00:02:32.720> more<00:02:32.930> than<00:02:33.110> one<00:02:33.260> piece<00:02:33.470> of

that if you had more than one piece of

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.250 
that if you had more than one piece of
armor<00:02:33.920> in<00:02:34.190> here<00:02:34.490> it<00:02:35.300> would<00:02:35.480> just<00:02:35.540> dispense<00:02:36.170> a

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
armor in here it would just dispense a

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.860 
armor in here it would just dispense a
whole<00:02:36.440> load<00:02:36.650> of<00:02:36.680> them<00:02:36.890> out<00:02:37.070> which<00:02:37.370> is<00:02:37.730> not<00:02:38.000> what

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
whole load of them out which is not what

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.160 
whole load of them out which is not what
you<00:02:39.020> want<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:39.380> you<00:02:40.570> got<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:41.690> pressure<00:02:41.930> plate

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
you want so you got the pressure plate

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.830 
you want so you got the pressure plate
here<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.710> redstone<00:02:43.100> wire<00:02:43.490> under<00:02:43.820> here<00:02:44.060> which

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
here the redstone wire under here which

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.350 
here the redstone wire under here which
goes<00:02:45.080> up<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.560> this<00:02:45.830> alternating<00:02:46.790> pillar<00:02:47.240> of

the<00:02:51.110> top<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.590> down<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:51.860> other<00:02:51.890> side<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.459> pile

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
the top and down the other side to pile

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.390 
the top and down the other side to pile
the<00:02:52.820> top<00:02:53.000> dispenser<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:54.370> there's<00:02:55.370> one

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
the top dispenser and there's one

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.630 
the top dispenser and there's one
redstone<00:02:58.400> on<00:02:58.670> here<00:02:58.940> as<00:02:59.060> well<00:02:59.090> and<00:03:00.370> if<00:03:01.370> you<00:03:01.459> look

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
redstone on here as well and if you look

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.720 
redstone on here as well and if you look
at<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.820> back<00:03:01.970> here<00:03:02.770> you<00:03:03.770> also<00:03:03.920> have<00:03:04.250> this

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
at the back here you also have this

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.280 
at the back here you also have this
thing<00:03:05.920> which<00:03:07.000> is<00:03:08.000> also<00:03:08.330> powered<00:03:08.720> which<00:03:08.959> helps

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
thing which is also powered which helps

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.090 
thing which is also powered which helps
to<00:03:09.530> power<00:03:09.830> these<00:03:10.120> dispensers<00:03:11.120> at<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.390> back<00:03:12.100> so

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
to power these dispensers at the back so

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.340 
to power these dispensers at the back so
one<00:03:13.820> thing<00:03:14.030> you<00:03:14.150> might<00:03:14.180> not<00:03:14.510> notice<00:03:14.690> is<00:03:15.080> that

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
one thing you might not notice is that

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.710 
one thing you might not notice is that
to<00:03:15.920> get<00:03:16.100> arrows<00:03:16.459> out<00:03:16.610> really<00:03:16.910> quickly<00:03:17.180> as<00:03:17.510> well

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
to get arrows out really quickly as well

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.500 
to get arrows out really quickly as well
as<00:03:17.840> this<00:03:17.959> one<00:03:18.200> dropper<00:03:18.610> you've<00:03:19.610> got<00:03:19.820> two

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
as this one dropper you've got two

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.229 
as this one dropper you've got two
dispensers<00:03:21.140> on<00:03:21.410> either<00:03:21.650> side<00:03:21.980> because<00:03:22.580> if<00:03:23.120> you

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
dispensers on either side because if you

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.640 
dispensers on either side because if you
use<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:23.510> dropper<00:03:23.750> here<00:03:24.050> it<00:03:24.110> would<00:03:24.260> just<00:03:24.440> put

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
use the dropper here it would just put

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.890 
use the dropper here it would just put
things<00:03:24.860> into<00:03:25.040> this<00:03:25.250> check<00:03:25.750> dispenser<00:03:26.750> which

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
things into this check dispenser which

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.440 
things into this check dispenser which
shoots<00:03:27.170> you<00:03:27.350> so<00:03:29.260> basically<00:03:30.260> what<00:03:31.070> if<00:03:31.220> I<00:03:31.450> turn

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
shoots you so basically what if I turn

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.449 
shoots you so basically what if I turn
this<00:03:32.630> thing<00:03:32.690> off<00:03:32.930> but<00:03:33.170> what<00:03:33.350> it<00:03:33.530> does<00:03:33.739> is<00:03:34.310> it

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
this thing off but what it does is it

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.729 
this thing off but what it does is it
continually<00:03:34.880> fires<00:03:35.269> arrows<00:03:35.690> into<00:03:35.870> here<00:03:36.200> which

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
continually fires arrows into here which

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.199 
continually fires arrows into here which
is<00:03:36.890> close<00:03:37.130> to<00:03:37.160> you<00:03:37.370> so<00:03:37.519> you<00:03:37.610> just<00:03:37.760> pick<00:03:37.970> them<00:03:38.090> up

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
is close to you so you just pick them up

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.270 
is close to you so you just pick them up
so<00:03:38.989> that's<00:03:39.170> how<00:03:39.320> it<00:03:39.410> gets<00:03:39.530> throughout<00:03:39.860> so

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
so that's how it gets throughout so

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.690 
so that's how it gets throughout so
quickly<00:03:40.640> to<00:03:40.760> you<00:03:41.769> now<00:03:42.769> using<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.280> previous

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
quickly to you now using the previous

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.100 
quickly to you now using the previous
bug<00:03:43.970> as<00:03:44.269> I<00:03:44.390> mentioned<00:03:44.750> before<00:03:45.110> if<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:46.640> have

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
bug as I mentioned before if you have

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.990 
bug as I mentioned before if you have
this<00:03:48.110> clock<00:03:48.470> going<00:03:48.709> at<00:03:49.010> a<00:03:49.400> space<00:03:49.640> where<00:03:49.850> it's

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
this clock going at a space where it's

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.250 
this clock going at a space where it's
this<00:03:50.330> far<00:03:50.600> away<00:03:50.720> from<00:03:50.900> these<00:03:51.200> three<00:03:53.230> drop<00:03:54.230> a

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
this far away from these three drop a

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.759 
this far away from these three drop a
dispenser<00:03:54.860> things<00:03:55.330> then<00:03:56.330> at<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.470> moment

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
dispenser things then at the moment

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.080 
dispenser things then at the moment
nothing<00:03:57.920> will<00:03:58.190> happen<00:03:58.340> but<00:03:58.640> as<00:03:58.730> soon<00:03:58.880> as<00:03:58.940> you

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
nothing will happen but as soon as you

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.880 
nothing will happen but as soon as you
apply<00:03:59.330> a<00:03:59.420> constant<00:03:59.900> redstone<00:04:00.380> signal<00:04:00.560> to

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
apply a constant redstone signal to

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.690 
apply a constant redstone signal to
those<00:04:01.010> three<00:04:01.310> step<00:04:02.000> on<00:04:02.120> it<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:04.250> suddenly

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
those three step on it you suddenly

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.580 
those three step on it you suddenly
start<00:04:05.000> getting<00:04:05.330> loads<00:04:05.660> and<00:04:05.989> loads<00:04:06.019> of<00:04:06.290> arrows

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
start getting loads and loads of arrows

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.590 
start getting loads and loads of arrows
very<00:04:06.950> very<00:04:07.250> quickly<00:04:09.190> so<00:04:10.190> that<00:04:10.340> was<00:04:10.610> is<00:04:10.880> the<00:04:11.480> way

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
very very quickly so that was is the way

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.740 
very very quickly so that was is the way
to<00:04:11.660> solve<00:04:11.870> the<00:04:12.019> problem<00:04:12.380> built<00:04:12.590> this<00:04:12.739> set<00:04:12.980> up

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
to solve the problem built this set up

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.210 
to solve the problem built this set up
obviously<00:04:14.750> you'd<00:04:14.900> built<00:04:15.110> this<00:04:15.290> into<00:04:15.620> a<00:04:15.680> wall<00:04:15.950> I

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
obviously you'd built this into a wall I

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.009 
obviously you'd built this into a wall I
just<00:04:16.280> built<00:04:16.669> it<00:04:16.760> out<00:04:16.880> in<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.120> opens<00:04:17.450> just<00:04:17.930> to

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
just built it out in the opens just to

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.380 
just built it out in the opens just to
show<00:04:18.200> you<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:19.519> inside<00:04:19.880> of<00:04:19.910> it<00:04:20.120> and<00:04:20.269> how<00:04:20.359> it

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
show you the inside of it and how it

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.930 
show you the inside of it and how it
works<00:04:20.750> it's<00:04:21.049> fairly<00:04:21.320> compact<00:04:22.220> although<00:04:22.700> I

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
works it's fairly compact although I

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.430 
works it's fairly compact although I
reckon<00:04:23.780> you<00:04:23.840> could<00:04:23.960> turn<00:04:24.110> these<00:04:24.289> things

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
reckon you could turn these things

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.810 
reckon you could turn these things
around<00:04:24.560> to<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:24.950> side<00:04:25.160> and<00:04:25.340> make<00:04:25.460> it<00:04:25.580> even

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
around to the side and make it even

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:26.670 
around to the side and make it even
small

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
small

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.680 
small
