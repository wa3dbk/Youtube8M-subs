seems<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.280> be<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.610> best<00:02:13.760> it's<00:02:14.060> like<00:02:14.180> what

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
seems to be the best it's like what

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.620 
seems to be the best it's like what
everybody<00:02:15.220> when<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.250> lot<00:02:16.459> of<00:02:16.640> like<00:02:16.910> Ford<00:02:17.209> forms

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
everybody when a lot of like Ford forms

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.540 
everybody when a lot of like Ford forms
talks<00:02:17.900> about<00:02:18.200> how<00:02:18.500> they're<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:18.920> lot<00:02:19.340> better

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550

than<00:02:19.790> standing<00:02:20.090> there<00:02:20.209> little<00:02:20.390> filtered<00:02:20.750> a

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
than standing there little filtered a

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.680 
than standing there little filtered a
filter<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.170> like<00:02:21.610> like<00:02:22.610> 2<00:02:22.910> micron<00:02:23.510> or

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
filter to like like 2 micron or

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:24.970 
filter to like like 2 micron or
something<00:02:23.930> like<00:02:24.020> that<00:02:24.200> so<00:02:24.440> I<00:02:24.470> got<00:02:24.680> two<00:02:24.860> of

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
something like that so I got two of

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.289 
something like that so I got two of
those<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:27.190> yes<00:02:28.220> oil<00:02:28.519> does<00:02:28.730> go<00:02:28.880> through<00:02:29.090> both

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
those and yes oil does go through both

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.240 
those and yes oil does go through both
of<00:02:29.330> them<00:02:29.600> that's<00:02:30.230> why<00:02:30.440> it<00:02:30.500> took<00:02:30.830> me<00:02:31.010> probably

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
of them that's why it took me probably

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.160 
of them that's why it took me probably
like<00:02:31.700> good<00:02:31.940> five<00:02:32.209> minutes<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.690> get<00:02:32.810> this<00:02:32.959> whole

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
like good five minutes to get this whole

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.890 
like good five minutes to get this whole
system<00:02:33.410> Prime<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:34.400> had<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.180> pour<00:02:35.360> oil<00:02:35.390> on<00:02:35.780> all

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
system Prime I had to pour oil on all

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.060 
system Prime I had to pour oil on all
the<00:02:35.959> hoses<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:36.410> everything<00:02:36.590> because<00:02:37.010> I

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
the hoses and everything because I

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.920 
the hoses and everything because I
didn't<00:02:37.250> want<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.459> pump<00:02:37.670> because<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.720> pump

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
didn't want the pump because the pump

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.570 
didn't want the pump because the pump
had<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.230> suck<00:02:39.440> oil<00:02:39.680> from<00:02:39.950> all<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.220> way<00:02:40.310> there

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
had to suck oil from all the way there

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.820 
had to suck oil from all the way there
through<00:02:41.450> both<00:02:41.660> filters<00:02:41.989> had<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.470> fill<00:02:42.650> those

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
through both filters had to fill those

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.250 
through both filters had to fill those
up<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:43.370> then<00:02:43.430> through<00:02:44.390> all<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.690> hose<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:45.230> I

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
up and then through all the hose so I

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.380 
up and then through all the hose so I
went<00:02:45.590> ahead<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:45.739> primed<00:02:46.070> it<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.150> tried

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390
