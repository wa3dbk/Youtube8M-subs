00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 welcome to part 2 the perfect point 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:09.870
 find my name is oliver we bet now 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.940
 our series continues with part 2 and want 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.429
 well worth it again 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.100
 lay because apron does not have the biggest 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.750
 notoriety in germany 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.000
 Why is that so a little bit it lies 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.410
 That friend found a relative 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.939
 difficult system has and the people 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.380
 of course want to see violence and blood 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.900
 that there was a bit at the point 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.599
 want to be difficult to show the problem 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.489
 to get into the professional field because in the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.050
 moment of course full contact very far 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.760
 Above is the steaks thank god 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.190
 brought the kickboxing to TV 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.899
 everyone represents his style and point 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.450
 is actually nice to look for 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.070
 spectators but still relatively difficult too 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.690
 visualize for television to 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.059
 example for the sponsors 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.070
 There are no professionals so difficult 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.050
 As the spectator is boxing for 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.110
 spectators clearly boxing is a set of rules 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.680
 while kickboxing there is life could 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.390
 contact 1 biscuit one shared sight 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.980
 not really right through it anymore 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.040
 just gives a scary big 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.720
 set of rules and regulations 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.880
 friend enemy is one of this and that 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.799
 Wallis in the amateur area just comes 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.570
 not really a pity to the top 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.010
 Everything is very important, too 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.979
 for the professional sector one sees gaps 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.210
 you learn to move fast 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.500
 I need advertising for 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.210
 Friends of him wanted the movement 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.549
 Put it out a little bit more 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.200
 show how it really stands out 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.730
 from light contact of full contact and 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.500
 on the fight position 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.840
 then I start a bit on the fight 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.360
 position came again 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.740
 semi-contact or is there a bit 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.720
 from the traditional martial arts club 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.700
 and many come for example from the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.250
 karate are already such here 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.270
 Fists are usually deep and deep 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.220
 a deep fist 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.740
 I thought it was just shit 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.140
 but not at all this position has 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.420
 also heartily your senses fist down 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.750
 I can hurry up much faster 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.580
 Beat because pink takes the punch it 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.210
 was up here and the blow has already 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.860
 speed 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.510
 that is, the urban more in it 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.540
 I'm in easy contact here 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.820
 full contact them to blow dirt in 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.070
 She recognizes her field of vision to the front 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.660
 Immediately that the blow comes 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.830
 always better chances one can such a 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.900
 little bit to see the klitschko 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.410
 he also has the front below 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.450
 hang on such an old video seen from 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.580
 The opponent or kickbox said 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.270
 therefore been actually used to be so 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.820
 fought 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.100
 contact so that has his 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.860
 authority actually that the poor 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.660
 or at least one of the below is mostly 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.550
 the fast is down and that 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.709
 then mushroom always from your tact to the head 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.970
 high 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:41.430
 movement makes the pink explained 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:43.080
 little bit loose as we do that 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.230
 Of course you only have to actively save 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.030
 if he can do it all locally before 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.640
 there is no fast 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.530
 get rid of movements so be relaxed 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.690
 as in the side around as little as possible 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.129
 offer hit area because yes true 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.440
 right here the entire hit area 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.790
 but say I have the fist 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.610
 Here always like the second above 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.040
 catholic for example then i can do here 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.860
 stay with the one with the arm around man 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.330
 confessed to have the rear fist 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.580
 I mostly at chest height because from here 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.500
 can quickly call for face and 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.930
 But I can also good to 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.879
 spans blow 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:22.160
 if I so for example on the technology 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.019
 to move or make the feet 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.660
 this time one may want and that 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.910
 really with me back and forth he can 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.799
 completely normal and I move in the 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.060
 Moving pollen trap means loosely 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.530
 the paths and always the right one 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.760
 brought distance so that's her name 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.760
 needs one of the 14th 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.290
 The distance is always the same 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.370
 hold 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.680
 that's where she comes in. it always looks 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.889
 it stays the same always 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.180
 is gone and before my punches 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.930
 this is an exercise like at home 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.719
 or just easy 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.049
 or software training super bit 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:00.049
 more quickly 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.230
 I 'm actually done something before 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.519
 the pink must respond to the example 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.939
 exactly install then there is still 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:14.099
 an exercise where you are with the partner 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:16.019
 living together can say my friend 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.820
 exhibitions and we are trying now 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.680
 only from the movement with the claim 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.079
 called the researchers to catch the 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.870
 is also very important for the point 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.900
 they are always chosen outward so 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:39.539
 say it out and from me 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:42.650
 just always this movement and me 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.650
 had to go fast forward 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.830
 because you can just move on to 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.450
 recognize and have it loose on the road 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.910
 Not that scary high 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:05.530
 Cover and you play with the 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.530
 distance to my speed
