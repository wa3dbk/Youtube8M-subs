00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.680 
made rice balls I thought I'd go ahead
and<00:00:09.330> make<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.540> video<00:00:09.870> showing<00:00:10.650> how<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:10.920> make<00:00:11.280> them

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
and make a video showing how I make them

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.660 
and make a video showing how I make them
so<00:00:12.690> if<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.170> you<00:00:13.230> guys<00:00:13.349> were<00:00:13.530> curious<00:00:14.009> so<00:00:14.340> let's

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
so if and you guys were curious so let's

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.410 
so if and you guys were curious so let's
go<00:00:16.369> first<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.580> will<00:00:17.640> need<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.880> rice<00:00:18.119> cooker

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
go first you will need a rice cooker

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.769 
go first you will need a rice cooker
here<00:00:19.100> you<00:00:20.100> don't<00:00:20.279> necessarily<00:00:20.970> need<00:00:21.359> it

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
here you don't necessarily need it

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.840 
here you don't necessarily need it
because<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.560> can<00:00:22.740> make<00:00:22.920> rice<00:00:23.189> using<00:00:23.670> just

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
because you can make rice using just

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.450 
because you can make rice using just
regular<00:00:23.910> pot<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.869> stove<00:00:25.170> there<00:00:25.470> but<00:00:26.250> rice

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
regular pot of the stove there but rice

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.200 
regular pot of the stove there but rice
cookers<00:00:26.849> make<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.269> little<00:00:27.480> easier<00:00:28.070> rice<00:00:29.210> it

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
cookers make it a little easier rice it

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.189 
cookers make it a little easier rice it
should<00:00:30.390> be<00:00:30.480> better<00:00:30.630> if<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.810> get<00:00:30.960> japanese

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
should be better if you get japanese

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.490 
should be better if you get japanese
rice<00:00:32.480> because<00:00:33.480> it's<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.930> little<00:00:34.170> sticky

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
rice because it's a little sticky

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.610 
rice because it's a little sticky
stickier<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.630> rice<00:00:36.840> space<00:00:37.290> clump

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
stickier so the rice space clump

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.310 
stickier so the rice space clump
together<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.430> helps<00:00:38.700> if<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.969> says<00:00:39.320> sushi

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
together and it helps if it says sushi

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.760 
together and it helps if it says sushi
rice<00:00:40.579> here's<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.640> little<00:00:41.790> hint<00:00:41.820> there<00:00:42.770> what

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.200 

notice<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> first<00:00:55.739> time<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.100> put<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.879> water

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.189 
notice the first time you put for water
in<00:00:57.480> here<00:00:58.430> it's<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.699> really<00:01:01.610> thick<00:01:02.960> color<00:01:03.960> right

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
in here it's a really thick color right

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.930 
in here it's a really thick color right
there<00:01:05.060> what<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.210> want<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.509> do<00:01:08.840> is<00:01:09.840> rinse<00:01:10.350> it

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:18.710 
there what you want to do is rinse it
like<00:01:11.940> this<00:01:15.229> just<00:01:16.729> taking<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> rice<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.420> rub

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.510

so now we're going to do is dump out the
squatter<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.030> measure<00:01:51.360> how<00:01:51.689> much<00:01:51.810> water<00:01:52.140> we

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
squatter and measure how much water we

squatter and measure how much water we
need<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:53.490> put<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:55.729> typically<00:01:56.729> how<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.149> measure

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
need to put in typically how I measure

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.380 
need to put in typically how I measure
the<00:01:57.810> water<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.429> because<00:01:59.610> my<00:02:00.030> mom<00:02:00.240> has

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
rice you cook to finish so through the

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.559 
rice you cook to finish so through the
magic<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.470> video<00:03:01.549> it<00:03:02.549> will<00:03:02.700> be<00:03:02.880> finished<00:03:03.120> and

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
magic of video it will be finished and

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.039 
magic of video it will be finished and
we<00:03:04.410> can<00:03:04.620> proceed<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.310> making<00:03:05.579> this<00:03:05.780> rice<00:03:06.780> balls

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
we can proceed to making this rice balls

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.349 
we can proceed to making this rice balls
so<00:03:07.680> no<00:03:07.859> the<00:03:08.069> rice<00:03:08.250> is<00:03:08.400> done<00:03:08.609> but<00:03:08.880> we<00:03:09.000> need<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.299> a

little more confirmation first we need

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.080 
little more confirmation first we need
another<00:03:12.840> bowl<00:03:13.519> go<00:03:14.519> ahead<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:14.760> fill<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.000> up

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
another bowl go ahead and fill it up

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.390 

and<00:03:24.900> with<00:03:25.440> this<00:03:25.620> bowl<00:03:28.100> we're<00:03:29.100> going<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.310> need

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
and with this bowl we're going to need

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.470 
and with this bowl we're going to need
to<00:03:29.460> pour<00:03:29.790> some<00:03:30.000> salt<00:03:30.210> in<00:03:30.480> it<00:03:32.180> you're<00:03:33.180> going<00:03:33.390> to

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
to pour some salt in it you're going to

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:40.100 
to pour some salt in it you're going to
add<00:03:33.630> some<00:03:33.660> salt<00:03:34.080> in<00:03:34.230> there<00:03:38.450> just<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.660> then<00:03:40.020> you

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
add some salt in there just and then you

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.330 
add some salt in there just and then you
have<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.290> solve<00:03:40.650> them<00:03:43.040> disintegrate<00:03:44.040> into<00:03:44.160> the

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
have to solve them disintegrate into the

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.790 
have to solve them disintegrate into the
water<00:03:44.550> some<00:03:44.880> people<00:03:45.210> warm<00:03:46.200> up<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.500> water<00:03:46.710> in

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
water some people warm up the water in

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
water some people warm up the water in
the<00:03:46.890> microwave<00:03:47.060> I'll<00:03:48.060> just<00:03:48.390> some<00:03:48.860> steric<00:03:49.860> stir

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
the microwave I'll just some steric stir

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.790 
the microwave I'll just some steric stir
it<00:03:51.920> this<00:03:52.920> accomplishes<00:03:53.550> few<00:03:53.910> things<00:03:54.800> when

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
it this accomplishes few things when

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.230 
it this accomplishes few things when
you're<00:03:55.890> making<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.280> rice<00:03:56.490> and<00:03:56.760> your<00:03:56.850> for<00:03:57.090> mail

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
you're making the rice and your for mail

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.750 
you're making the rice and your for mail
with<00:03:57.420> your<00:03:57.570> hands<00:03:57.990> the<00:03:58.680> salt<00:03:59.010> water<00:03:59.190> here<00:03:59.580> will

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
with your hands the salt water here will

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.880 
with your hands the salt water here will
help<00:03:59.940> it<00:04:00.120> become<00:04:00.420> less<00:04:00.690> sticky<00:04:01.050> to<00:04:01.440> your<00:04:01.560> hands

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
and also young salt in the rice could

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.200 
and also young salt in the rice could
add<00:04:06.450> a<00:04:06.480> very<00:04:06.750> small<00:04:07.410> side<00:04:08.190> flavor<00:04:08.610> though<00:04:09.030> you

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
add a very small side flavor though you

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:15.920 
add a very small side flavor though you
probably<00:04:09.540> won't<00:04:09.780> even<00:04:09.900> taste<00:04:10.350> it<00:04:12.890> okay<00:04:14.930> next

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
probably won't even taste it okay next

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.720 
probably won't even taste it okay next
what<00:04:16.140> we<00:04:16.260> need<00:04:16.380> is<00:04:16.470> mix<00:04:16.859> for<00:04:17.250> this<00:04:17.400> i'm<00:04:17.670> going

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
what we need is mix for this i'm going

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:24.110 
what we need is mix for this i'm going
to<00:04:17.940> use<00:04:19.489> seven<00:04:20.630> soy<00:04:21.630> sauce<00:04:22.250> in<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.460> book<00:04:23.640> and

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
to use seven soy sauce in the book and

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.270 
to use seven soy sauce in the book and
after<00:04:24.480> you<00:04:24.570> have<00:04:24.600> it<00:04:24.840> in<00:04:24.930> bold<00:04:25.230> go<00:04:25.919> ahead<00:04:26.250> and

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
the plate because it can cool a little

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.570 
the plate because it can cool a little
bit<00:05:35.990> go<00:05:36.990> ahead<00:05:37.199> and<00:05:37.319> flatten<00:05:37.800> it<00:05:38.069> out<00:05:38.189> some

bit go ahead and flatten it out some
more<00:05:38.610> the<00:05:38.999> rice<00:05:39.180> can<00:05:39.449> cool<00:05:39.719> off
