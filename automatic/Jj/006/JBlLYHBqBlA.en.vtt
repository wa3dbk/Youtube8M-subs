00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.540 
transits the road to the Easter Egg step
number<00:00:17.360> 20<00:00:17.810> this<00:00:18.050> is<00:00:18.080> the<00:00:18.590> Richthofen<00:00:19.130> site<00:00:19.369> i

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
number 20 this is the Richthofen site i

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.450 
number 20 this is the Richthofen site i
know<00:00:19.820> people<00:00:20.090> had<00:00:20.450> have<00:00:21.170> completed<00:00:21.590> the<00:00:21.890> Maxis

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
know people had have completed the Maxis

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.880 
know people had have completed the Maxis
side<00:00:22.700> we've<00:00:23.360> decided<00:00:23.990> to<00:00:24.080> carry<00:00:24.289> on<00:00:24.440> with<00:00:24.770> the

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
side we've decided to carry on with the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.690 
side we've decided to carry on with the
Richthofen<00:00:25.460> side<00:00:25.730> we<00:00:26.360> actually<00:00:26.630> saw<00:00:26.960> a<00:00:26.990> video

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
Richthofen side we actually saw a video

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.120 
Richthofen side we actually saw a video
early<00:00:28.700> yesterday<00:00:29.330> in<00:00:29.660> it<00:00:29.930> I<00:00:30.320> don't<00:00:30.890> know<00:00:30.980> it

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
early yesterday in it I don't know it

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.260 
early yesterday in it I don't know it
looked<00:00:31.280> like<00:00:31.430> the<00:00:31.610> guys<00:00:31.789> were<00:00:31.970> actually

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
looked like the guys were actually

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.420 
looked like the guys were actually
hacking<00:00:32.510> it<00:00:32.809> because<00:00:33.680> they're<00:00:33.860> taking<00:00:34.160> force

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
hacking it because they're taking force

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.799 
hacking it because they're taking force
Y<00:00:34.699> for<00:00:35.180> swipes<00:00:35.510> without<00:00:36.220> jug<00:00:37.220> or<00:00:37.340> anything<00:00:37.809> and

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
Y for swipes without jug or anything and

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.119 
Y for swipes without jug or anything and
they<00:00:39.080> weren't<00:00:39.199> going<00:00:39.440> down<00:00:39.590> so<00:00:39.770> I<00:00:39.800> don't<00:00:40.070> know

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
they weren't going down so I don't know

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.040 
they weren't going down so I don't know
but<00:00:40.399> anyways<00:00:40.760> it's<00:00:41.300> been<00:00:41.540> solved<00:00:41.899> on<00:00:41.989> the

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
but anyways it's been solved on the

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.450 
but anyways it's been solved on the
Maxis<00:00:42.350> side<00:00:42.530> we're<00:00:42.649> still<00:00:42.829> on<00:00:42.950> the<00:00:43.040> Richthofen

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
Maxis side we're still on the Richthofen

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.250 
Maxis side we're still on the Richthofen
side<00:00:43.610> but<00:00:44.000> here's<00:00:44.180> step<00:00:44.450> number<00:00:44.600> 20<00:00:44.989> we<00:00:45.079> have

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
side but here's step number 20 we have

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.590 
side but here's step number 20 we have
some<00:00:45.530> Morse<00:00:45.770> code<00:00:46.070> Treyarch<00:00:46.820> man<00:00:46.970> loves<00:00:47.420> in

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
some Morse code Treyarch man loves in

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.810 
some Morse code Treyarch man loves in
Morse<00:00:47.780> code<00:00:47.870> ever<00:00:48.170> since<00:00:48.410> call<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:48.829> dead<00:00:49.040> I

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
Morse code ever since call the dead I

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.840 
Morse code ever since call the dead I
think<00:00:50.510> it's<00:00:50.690> almost<00:00:50.870> been<00:00:51.140> in<00:00:51.290> every<00:00:51.739> map<00:00:52.010> but

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
think it's almost been in every map but

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.120 
think it's almost been in every map but
there<00:00:53.390> are<00:00:53.540> several<00:00:53.960> messages<00:00:54.559> here<00:00:54.950> there

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
there are several messages here there

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.790 
there are several messages here there
were<00:00:55.190> actually<00:00:55.520> a<00:00:55.550> total<00:00:55.910> of<00:00:56.120> seven<00:00:56.989> messages

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
were actually a total of seven messages

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.910 
were actually a total of seven messages
and<00:00:58.489> I<00:00:59.360> don't<00:00:59.930> know<00:01:00.200> exactly<00:01:00.620> what<00:01:00.770> they<00:01:00.890> mean

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
and I don't know exactly what they mean

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.590 
and I don't know exactly what they mean

close to me can you do both I don't know

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.240 
close to me can you do both I don't know
I<00:01:32.720> have<00:01:33.080> no<00:01:33.260> idea<00:01:33.530> I'm<00:01:33.619> just<00:01:33.830> bringing<00:01:33.979> it<00:01:34.100> to

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
I have no idea I'm just bringing it to

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.480 
I have no idea I'm just bringing it to
you

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
you

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.469 
you
we're<00:01:34.790> like<00:01:34.909> I<00:01:35.030> said<00:01:35.210> we're<00:01:35.360> not<00:01:35.390> doing

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
we're like I said we're not doing

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.060 
we're like I said we're not doing
analysis<00:01:36.200> as<00:01:36.350> we're<00:01:36.500> going<00:01:36.650> through<00:01:36.830> here

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
analysis as we're going through here

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.249 
analysis as we're going through here
because<00:01:37.610> we're<00:01:37.970> just<00:01:38.150> trying<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:38.780> get<00:01:39.020> there

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
because we're just trying to get there

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.550 
because we're just trying to get there
ah<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:40.070> second<00:01:40.700> last<00:01:41.030> one<00:01:41.360> or<00:01:41.689> a<00:01:41.720> number<00:01:42.049> six

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
ah the second last one or a number six

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.679 
ah the second last one or a number six
is<00:01:42.830> energy<00:01:43.400> can<00:01:44.090> only<00:01:44.270> be<00:01:44.720> transformed<00:01:46.689> okay

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
is energy can only be transformed okay

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.249 
is energy can only be transformed okay
and<00:01:47.960> then<00:01:48.770> finally<00:01:49.210> we<00:01:50.210> shall<00:01:50.630> prevail<00:01:51.200> so

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
and then finally we shall prevail so

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.109 
and then finally we shall prevail so
yeah<00:01:54.259> I<00:01:54.290> don't<00:01:54.500> know<00:01:54.650> I<00:01:54.680> think<00:01:55.460> if<00:01:55.610> we<00:01:55.790> have<00:01:55.939> the

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
yeah I don't know I think if we have the

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.210 
yeah I don't know I think if we have the
power<00:01:56.299> on<00:01:56.540> I<00:01:56.570> if<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:57.590> have<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:57.770> power<00:01:58.009> off

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
power on I if you have the power off

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.800 
power on I if you have the power off
there's<00:01:58.460> obviously<00:01:58.850> normal<00:01:59.270> normal<00:01:59.659> normal

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
there's obviously normal normal normal

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.240 
there's obviously normal normal normal
you<00:02:00.590> know

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
you know

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.359 
you know
Morse<00:02:01.790> code<00:02:02.210> with<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.200> power<00:02:03.470> on<00:02:03.770> we're<00:02:04.159> doing

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
Morse code with a power on we're doing

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.199 
Morse code with a power on we're doing
Richthofen<00:02:05.240> side<00:02:05.479> so<00:02:06.200> I'm<00:02:06.619> not<00:02:06.979> sure<00:02:07.280> if<00:02:07.729> the

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
Richthofen side so I'm not sure if the

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.359 
Richthofen side so I'm not sure if the
message<00:02:08.630> is<00:02:08.840> from<00:02:09.049> Richthofen<00:02:09.679> or<00:02:09.920> if<00:02:10.250> it's

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
message is from Richthofen or if it's

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.789 
message is from Richthofen or if it's
actually<00:02:10.519> Dr<00:02:11.000> Maxis<00:02:11.180> because<00:02:11.750> he<00:02:11.870> said<00:02:12.140> if<00:02:12.560> the

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
actually Dr Maxis because he said if the

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.340 
actually Dr Maxis because he said if the
power<00:02:13.010> is<00:02:13.190> on<00:02:13.370> he<00:02:13.670> can't<00:02:13.940> communicate

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
power is on he can't communicate

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.690 
power is on he can't communicate
although<00:02:15.350> he<00:02:15.500> did<00:02:15.650> communicate<00:02:16.040> initially

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
although he did communicate initially

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.330 
although he did communicate initially
when<00:02:16.850> we<00:02:16.880> turned<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.209> power<00:02:17.359> on<00:02:18.160> so<00:02:19.160> maybe

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
when we turned the power on so maybe

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.800 
when we turned the power on so maybe
he's<00:02:19.579> trying<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.850> communicate<00:02:20.030> with<00:02:20.450> us<00:02:20.600> with

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
he's trying to communicate with us with

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:21.620 
he's trying to communicate with us with
Morse<00:02:21.079> code

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
Morse code

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.450 
Morse code
but<00:02:21.930> he's<00:02:22.050> obviously<00:02:22.200> not<00:02:22.590> telling<00:02:22.980> us<00:02:23.130> to

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
but he's obviously not telling us to

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.880 
but he's obviously not telling us to
turn<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.850> power<00:02:24.270> off<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:25.200> maybe<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:25.560> tends<00:02:25.830> to

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
turn the power off so maybe it tends to

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.160 
turn the power off so maybe it tends to
make<00:02:26.250> me<00:02:26.370> believe<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:26.970> it's<00:02:27.569> coming<00:02:28.050> from

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
make me believe that it's coming from

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.290 
make me believe that it's coming from
Richthofen<00:02:28.709> anyways<00:02:29.190> those<00:02:29.640> are<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.940> seven

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
Richthofen anyways those are the seven

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.390 
Richthofen anyways those are the seven
messages<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:30.990> get<00:02:31.200> took<00:02:31.709> me<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.980> while<00:02:32.130> I

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
messages that you get took me a while I

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.920 
messages that you get took me a while I
had<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.790> go<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.030> recapture<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.660> because<00:02:33.870> I

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
had to go and recapture that because I

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.620 
had to go and recapture that because I
thought<00:02:34.110> I'd<00:02:34.260> captured<00:02:34.650> enough<00:02:34.890> last<00:02:35.130> night

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
thought I'd captured enough last night

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.800 
thought I'd captured enough last night
but<00:02:36.630> it<00:02:36.780> wasn't<00:02:37.170> enough<00:02:37.760> it<00:02:38.760> only<00:02:39.300> had<00:02:39.540> two

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
but it wasn't enough it only had two

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.690 
but it wasn't enough it only had two
messages<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.470> there<00:02:40.560> was<00:02:40.650> more<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.220> sat<00:02:41.520> you

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
messages and there was more so I sat you

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.280 
messages and there was more so I sat you
know<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.820> just<00:02:42.060> recorded<00:02:42.480> for<00:02:42.690> like<00:02:42.810> 15<00:02:43.260> minutes

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
know I just recorded for like 15 minutes

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.770 
know I just recorded for like 15 minutes
and<00:02:43.770> then<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.490> just<00:02:44.670> kept<00:02:44.910> translating<00:02:45.690> the

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
and then I just kept translating the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.620 
and then I just kept translating the
Morse<00:02:45.959> code<00:02:46.670> until<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.790> repeated<00:02:48.300> until<00:02:48.510> the

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
Morse code until it repeated until the

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.120 
Morse code until it repeated until the
messages<00:02:49.050> started<00:02:49.350> repeating<00:02:49.620> themselves

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
messages started repeating themselves

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.949 
messages started repeating themselves
and<00:02:50.310> then<00:02:50.430> okay<00:02:50.880> that's<00:02:51.090> cool<00:02:51.270> so<00:02:51.750> we<00:02:51.840> get

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
and then okay that's cool so we get

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.990 
and then okay that's cool so we get
seven<00:02:52.319> messages<00:02:52.500> in<00:02:52.920> total<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.459> is<00:02:53.610> that's

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
seven messages in total it is that's

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.790 
seven messages in total it is that's
that<00:02:54.120> that's<00:02:54.450> number<00:02:54.570> 20<00:02:54.959> will<00:02:55.410> have<00:02:55.530> number

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
that that's number 20 will have number

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.430 
that that's number 20 will have number
21<00:02:56.220> for<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.750> probably<00:02:57.750> later<00:02:57.900> tonight<00:02:58.260> I
