can see that there's some pretty decent

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.249 
can see that there's some pretty decent
um<00:01:44.329> mountains<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.479> stuff<00:01:45.630> cool<00:01:45.840> spots<00:01:46.110> to

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
um mountains and stuff cool spots to

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.499 
um mountains and stuff cool spots to
build<00:01:46.500> stuff<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.100> really<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.149> trees<00:01:48.390> that

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
build stuff I really like the trees that

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.910

are<00:01:48.600> up<00:01:48.720> high<00:01:49.079> on<00:01:49.110> these<00:01:49.380> mountains<00:01:49.740> because

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
are up high on these mountains because

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.139 
are up high on these mountains because

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
it gives you a good chance to start

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.280 
it gives you a good chance to start
building<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.509> tree<00:01:51.750> house<00:01:51.930> it's<00:01:52.170> like

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
building a tree house it's like

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.109 
building a tree house it's like
extremely<00:01:52.770> high<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.220> air<00:01:53.369> which<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:53.970> gives

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
extremely high in the air which it gives

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.130 
extremely high in the air which it gives
you<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.329> know<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.630> mean<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.899> can<00:01:55.020> obviously

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
you you know I mean you can obviously

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.230 
you you know I mean you can obviously
build<00:01:55.619> them<00:01:55.829> higher<00:01:56.040> if<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.250> want<00:01:56.490> just

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
build them higher if you want just

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.630 
build them higher if you want just
manually<00:01:57.960> but<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.829> really<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.159> giant

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
manually but this is really a giant

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.340 
manually but this is really a giant
jungle<00:01:59.880> honestly<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.840> hard<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.229> show

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
jungle honestly it is hard to show

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.889 
jungle honestly it is hard to show
jungles<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.369> these<00:02:02.969> type<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.210> videos<00:02:03.360> because

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
jungles in these type of videos because

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.560 
jungles in these type of videos because
did<00:02:04.560> loading<00:02:04.950> problem<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.549> Minecraft<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.299> so

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
did loading problem in Minecraft is so

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.199 
did loading problem in Minecraft is so
poor<00:02:07.049> at<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.469> moment<00:02:07.979> hopefully<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:08.910> will

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
poor at the moment hopefully this will

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.999 
poor at the moment hopefully this will
get<00:02:09.360> fixed<00:02:09.569> at<00:02:09.750> some<00:02:09.780> point<00:02:10.140> but<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.920> can

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
get fixed at some point but as you can

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.190 
get fixed at some point but as you can
see<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.430> large<00:02:11.700> jungle<00:02:12.330> it's<00:02:12.540> not<00:02:12.959> that

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
see this is a large jungle it's not that

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.970 
see this is a large jungle it's not that
easy<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.560> show<00:02:13.770> it

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
easy to show it

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.460 
easy to show it
because<00:02:14.250> it's<00:02:14.430> loading<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.150> horribly<00:02:15.599> but<00:02:16.349> it

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
because it's loading so horribly but it

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.100 
because it's loading so horribly but it
really<00:02:16.680> does<00:02:17.010> seem<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.280> span<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:17.849> for<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.480> very

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
really does seem to span on for a very

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.690 
really does seem to span on for a very
long<00:02:19.319> time<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:19.799> if<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:19.980> want<00:02:20.129> to<00:02:20.190> have<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.370> you

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
long time so if you want to have a you

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.759 
long time so if you want to have a you
know<00:02:20.790> survival<00:02:21.420> adventure<00:02:21.750> in<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.260> jungle<00:02:22.560> this

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
know survival adventure in a jungle this

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.050 
know survival adventure in a jungle this
is<00:02:22.860> probably<00:02:23.069> gonna<00:02:23.220> be<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> really<00:02:23.549> good<00:02:23.760> seed

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
is probably gonna be a really good seed

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.210 
is probably gonna be a really good seed
because<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:24.810> can<00:02:24.959> really<00:02:25.260> keep<00:02:25.409> going<00:02:25.799> on<00:02:25.980> and

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220

things<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.470> really<00:03:07.650> gives<00:03:07.799> you<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:07.950> good<00:03:08.129> start

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
things it really gives you a good start

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.130 
things it really gives you a good start
to<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:08.640> game<00:03:08.879> I<00:03:08.910> mean<00:03:09.180> it's<00:03:09.359> not<00:03:09.480> sometimes<00:03:09.989> it

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
to the game I mean it's not sometimes it

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.720 
to the game I mean it's not sometimes it
is<00:03:10.260> difficult<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.769> find<00:03:11.010> diamonds<00:03:11.370> and

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
is difficult to find diamonds and

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.460 
is difficult to find diamonds and
emeralds<00:03:11.879> and<00:03:12.209> stuff<00:03:12.359> like<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.319> gives

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
emeralds and stuff like that so it gives

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.720 
emeralds and stuff like that so it gives
you<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.590> good<00:03:13.709> start<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.129> way<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.430> know

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
you a good start so that way you know

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.400 
you a good start so that way you know
you<00:03:15.000> get<00:03:15.150> some<00:03:15.269> nice<00:03:15.420> stuff<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.900> get<00:03:16.049> yourself

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
you get some nice stuff to get yourself

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.520 
you get some nice stuff to get yourself
started<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:18.180> um<00:03:18.450> this<00:03:18.750> isn't<00:03:18.989> through<00:03:19.380> the

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
started and um this isn't through the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.920 
started and um this isn't through the
whole<00:03:19.709> desert<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:20.220> mean<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.489> whole<00:03:20.639> jungle<00:03:21.269> it

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.420 
whole desert I mean the whole jungle it
does<00:03:22.139> span<00:03:22.410> on<00:03:22.620> if<00:03:22.769> you<00:03:22.859> go<00:03:23.040> in<00:03:23.160> different

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
mountains in this desert I kind of like

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.089 
mountains in this desert I kind of like
it<00:03:55.260> because<00:03:55.319> it<00:03:55.530> kind<00:03:55.620> of<00:03:55.739> gives<00:03:55.889> you<00:03:55.919> that

it because it kind of gives you that

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.990 
it because it kind of gives you that
feel<00:03:56.430> of<00:03:56.669> um<00:03:57.500> of<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.980> mountain<00:03:59.310> biome<00:03:59.639> and<00:03:59.819> a

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
feel of um of a mountain biome and a

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.729 
feel of um of a mountain biome and a
desert<00:04:00.269> biome<00:04:00.540> at<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.900> same<00:04:01.109> time<00:04:01.379> there's

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
desert biome at the same time there's

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.349 
desert biome at the same time there's
some<00:04:01.859> pretty<00:04:01.980> good<00:04:02.160> mounted<00:04:02.579> school<00:04:02.910> spots<00:04:03.180> to

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
some pretty good mounted school spots to

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:04.670 
some pretty good mounted school spots to
build<00:04:03.599> I<00:04:03.810> think<00:04:03.840> it<00:04:04.079> would<00:04:04.169> be<00:04:04.260> cool<00:04:04.379> to<00:04:04.560> build

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
build I think it would be cool to build

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.759 
build I think it would be cool to build
on<00:04:04.889> top<00:04:05.040> of<00:04:05.250> a<00:04:05.840> mountain<00:04:06.840> in<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.019> desert<00:04:07.410> and

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
on top of a mountain in the desert and

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.589 
on top of a mountain in the desert and
then<00:04:08.220> and<00:04:08.370> of<00:04:08.730> course<00:04:08.970> in<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.180> desert<00:04:09.450> there's

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
then and of course in the desert there's

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.150 
then and of course in the desert there's
always<00:04:09.720> lots<00:04:10.109> of<00:04:10.260> good<00:04:10.379> places<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.769> build<00:04:10.980> if

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
always lots of good places to build if

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.470 
always lots of good places to build if
you<00:04:11.250> really<00:04:11.430> like<00:04:11.549> deserts<00:04:11.910> because<00:04:12.090> a<00:04:12.299> lot<00:04:12.449> of

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
you really like deserts because a lot of

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.729 
you really like deserts because a lot of
flat<00:04:12.780> lands<00:04:13.109> you<00:04:13.230> can<00:04:13.349> really<00:04:13.560> build

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
flat lands you can really build

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.520 
flat lands you can really build
something<00:04:14.160> of<00:04:14.280> like<00:04:14.430> epic<00:04:14.760> proportions<00:04:15.530> yeah

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
something of like epic proportions yeah

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.560 
something of like epic proportions yeah
we<00:04:16.650> have<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.829> keep<00:04:17.010> heading<00:04:17.310> this<00:04:17.549> way<00:04:17.609> and<00:04:18.120> as

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
we have to keep heading this way and as

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.089 
we have to keep heading this way and as
you<00:04:18.690> can<00:04:18.810> see<00:04:18.959> there<00:04:19.109> are<00:04:19.260> more<00:04:19.470> jungles<00:04:19.979> this

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
you can see there are more jungles this

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.500 
you can see there are more jungles this
isn't<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.430> same<00:04:20.639> jungle<00:04:21.120> there's<00:04:21.269> so<00:04:21.419> many

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
isn't the same jungle there's so many

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.589 
isn't the same jungle there's so many
jungles<00:04:22.049> in<00:04:22.140> this<00:04:22.260> seed<00:04:22.940> and<00:04:23.940> guys<00:04:24.240> this<00:04:24.390> is<00:04:24.570> a

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
jungles in this seed and guys this is a

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.560 
jungles in this seed and guys this is a
decent<00:04:25.050> walk<00:04:25.530> to<00:04:25.830> this<00:04:25.979> one<00:04:26.250> but<00:04:26.820> it<00:04:26.969> really

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
decent walk to this one but it really

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.150 
decent walk to this one but it really
worth<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:28.020> and<00:04:28.170> there<00:04:28.410> are<00:04:28.650> there<00:04:28.980> it<00:04:29.070> is

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
for a desert right here which really

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.350 
for a desert right here which really
adds<00:06:21.480> to<00:06:21.660> the<00:06:21.810> scenery<00:06:22.140> in<00:06:22.320> this<00:06:22.500> desert<00:06:23.360> and

adds to the scenery in this desert and

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.120 
adds to the scenery in this desert and
here<00:06:24.570> we<00:06:24.690> finally<00:06:25.020> come<00:06:25.170> across<00:06:25.290> the<00:06:25.650> last<00:06:25.860> one

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
here we finally come across the last one

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.980 
here we finally come across the last one
which<00:06:26.340> is<00:06:26.370> also<00:06:26.790> pretty<00:06:27.270> much<00:06:27.390> on<00:06:27.510> the<00:06:27.600> border

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
which is also pretty much on the border

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.980

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.420 
of the des are in another jungle these
jump<00:06:31.230> and<00:06:31.380> it<00:06:31.440> probably<00:06:31.650> is<00:06:31.890> all<00:06:32.070> the<00:06:32.220> same

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430
