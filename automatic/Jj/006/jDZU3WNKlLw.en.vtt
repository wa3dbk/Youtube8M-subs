00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
everything was written too small for me

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.420 
everything was written too small for me
to<00:01:15.330> read<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.869> was<00:01:16.320> too<00:01:16.500> bulky<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.950> wasn't<00:01:17.310> able

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
to read it was too bulky I wasn't able

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.149 
to read it was too bulky I wasn't able
to<00:01:17.670> join<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:18.060> any<00:01:18.299> raids<00:01:18.810> very<00:01:19.110> well<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.770> just<00:01:20.070> I

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.140 
it's a different experience with with
with<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> pc<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:37.770> easy<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.430> just<00:01:38.640> have<00:01:38.850> a

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
with the pc it's easy to just have a

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.819 
with the pc it's easy to just have a
headset<00:01:39.509> right<00:01:39.900> there<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.259> have<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> mouse<00:01:40.650> and

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
headset right there to have a mouse and

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.950 
headset right there to have a mouse and
keyboard<00:01:40.979> for<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.549> full<00:01:41.820> control<00:01:42.659> but

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
keyboard for that full control but

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.600 
keyboard for that full control but
you're<00:01:43.110> limited<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> console<00:01:44.369> which

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
you're limited on the console which

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.280 
you're limited on the console which
means<00:01:45.000> you're<00:01:45.329> always<00:01:45.360> going<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.930> be<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.049> step

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
means you're always going to be a step

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.889 
means you're always going to be a step
behind<00:01:46.470> now<00:01:47.070> some<00:01:47.369> games<00:01:47.670> coming<00:01:48.240> out<00:01:48.420> or<00:01:48.630> will

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
behind now some games coming out or will

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.190 
behind now some games coming out or will
be<00:01:49.020> designed<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.270> expect<00:01:51.270> destiny<00:01:51.899> to

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
be designed for that I expect destiny to

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.319 
be designed for that I expect destiny to
be<00:01:52.350> awesome<00:01:52.560> because<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.220> designed<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.060> work

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
be awesome because it's designed to work

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.840 
be awesome because it's designed to work
on<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> console<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.170> don't<00:01:55.740> can<00:01:56.460> we<00:01:56.549> consider

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
on a console I don't can we consider

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.760 
on a console I don't can we consider
them<00:01:57.090> away<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.780> guess<00:01:58.079> it's<00:01:58.259> all<00:01:58.380> yeah<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.619> mean

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
them away I guess it's all yeah I mean

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.080 
them away I guess it's all yeah I mean
it's<00:01:58.829> on<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.130> left<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.520> so<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.759> just

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
it's on the left on the so I just

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.600 
it's on the left on the so I just
considered<00:02:00.600> some<00:02:00.780> very<00:02:01.290> typical<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.159> what

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
considered some very typical of and what

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.810 
considered some very typical of and what
we<00:02:02.729> refer<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.719> as<00:02:03.869> an<00:02:03.960> MMORPG<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.369> guess

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
we refer to as an MMORPG but I guess

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.580 
we refer to as an MMORPG but I guess
technically<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.450> has<00:02:06.600> those<00:02:06.840> elements<00:02:07.140> no

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
technically it has those elements no

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.040 
technically it has those elements no
sure<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.250> expect<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.270> Elder<00:02:09.599> Scrolls<00:02:09.899> online

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
sure I expect the Elder Scrolls online

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.350 
sure I expect the Elder Scrolls online
to<00:02:10.530> work<00:02:10.709> well<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.190> console<00:02:11.640> because

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
to work well in a console because

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.060 
to work well in a console because
the<00:02:12.420> elders<00:02:12.720> came<00:02:12.900> games<00:02:13.290> work<00:02:13.650> well<00:02:13.890> on<00:02:13.920> a

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
the elders came games work well on a

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.090 
the elders came games work well on a
console<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.730> if<00:02:15.240> they<00:02:15.420> control<00:02:16.140> similarly<00:02:16.920> to

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
console and if they control similarly to

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.560 
console and if they control similarly to
that<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.460> don't<00:02:17.820> see<00:02:17.880> any<00:02:18.120> reason<00:02:18.150> why<00:02:18.390> they

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
that I don't see any reason why they

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.480 
that I don't see any reason why they
wouldn't<00:02:18.930> we<00:02:19.470> actually<00:02:19.860> talked<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.310> guy

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
could think would work the best which is

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.259 
could think would work the best which is
the<00:03:22.320> crew<00:03:22.560> from<00:03:22.769> ubisoft<00:03:23.340> but<00:03:23.670> it's<00:03:23.790> mainly<00:03:23.940> a

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
the crew from ubisoft but it's mainly a

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.270 
the crew from ubisoft but it's mainly a
racing<00:03:24.750> game<00:03:24.780> right<00:03:25.380> so<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:25.709> doesn't<00:03:26.040> have

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
racing game right so it doesn't have

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.830 
racing game right so it doesn't have
those<00:03:26.459> elements<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:27.060> we<00:03:27.209> would<00:03:27.390> associate

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
those elements that we would associate

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.750 
those elements that we would associate
quickly<00:03:28.500> in<00:03:28.560> our<00:03:28.650> minds<00:03:28.950> what<00:03:29.130> that's<00:03:29.340> an<00:03:29.459> MMO

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
quickly in our minds what that's an MMO

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.789 
quickly in our minds what that's an MMO
who's<00:03:30.030> been<00:03:30.180> hit<00:03:30.390> it's<00:03:30.720> uh<00:03:31.019> it<00:03:31.290> looks<00:03:31.350> very

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
who's been hit it's uh it looks very

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.680 
who's been hit it's uh it looks very
cool<00:03:32.070> but<00:03:32.340> it's<00:03:32.400> also<00:03:32.610> very<00:03:32.880> different<00:03:33.299> across

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
cool but it's also very different across

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.420 
cool but it's also very different across
the<00:03:33.900> one<00:03:34.049> I'm<00:03:34.230> most<00:03:34.290> excited<00:03:34.680> for<00:03:34.980> is<00:03:35.130> the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
the one I'm most excited for is the

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.850 
the one I'm most excited for is the

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
division now why is that because it

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.509
