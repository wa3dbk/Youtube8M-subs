00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.490
 hello together the thermostats sleep 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.090
 from the boss compressor of danfoss today 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:16.470
 also sector b d 35 we have again 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:20.880
 our open model of the thermostat goes 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:28.380
 of c so the thermostats sleep of c 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:31.830
 via a main switch over the speed 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.739
 increase example resistance high power 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.300
 switch together over the thermostat 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.050
 back to the t 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.710
 the order of main switch the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.190
 Resistance package and the thermostat 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:51.270
 check if we switch now in the main 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.470
 Turn it on and we'll see this 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.070
 switch is off 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.860
 the stream is flowing here 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.920
 Over the switch over this resistance 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.050
 back over Kerner's Day 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:08.940
 we see the completely runs on 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.660
 maximum speed we turn here 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.930
 switch to 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.680
 then the current flows through the main switch 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.860
 here about this switch thermostat 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.280
 back so we have on this bend 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.380
 no resistance 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.050
 Thus, the compressor runs to 2,000 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.869
 turns we turn the switch 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.200
 The stream has to be over here again 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.350
 this 1500 um resistance and thus 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.400
 the greta increases again we see 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.120
 Also the power consumption of compressor 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.450
 here we have 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:52.940
 at maximum power a current consumption 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.920
 from about 3 ampere if we are here again 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:00.439
 drive to the minimum 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:07.070
 Let's go back to about halfway up 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:11.060
 1 5 to 16 amps if we are in thermostat 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.340
 switch off here to zero or rather the 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.010
 temperature reaches what is here in this 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.270
 year model is not possible falls the 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:23.390
 voltage turns off the compress we 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.769
 turn it back on and the congress 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.769
 starts to run again 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.230
 this applies 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.489
 on all compressors from danfoss this 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:45.370
 control here from the b35 over the 50s 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:49.720
 60s 80s 100 and 120 and even 150 cl 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:54.239
 but it is not officially available 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.239
 I was happy and listening again
