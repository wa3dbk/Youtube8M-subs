00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hi all seduced and hugh jackman good 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.690
 I do not know if you are on twitter 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.420
 but otherwise you've probably seen this 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.849
 it even happened on france2 at jt 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.610
 at 8 pm it was a shame 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.350
 total and so the idea is what is 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.940
 the color of this dress haskell and blue 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.770
 and black or is it white and 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.119
 golden then personally I have 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.080
 started with having it blue and black and and 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.599
 then suddenly I decided to put it 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:33.329
 in photoshop and use it so the 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.530
 here is the pipette to click on the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.719
 berry dress so find out what is 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.290
 truly the true color of 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.770
 this dress 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.370
 attention I clicked it's blue 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.840
 so here is the dress and blue so blue and 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.660
 black theoretically but know that if they 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.460
 generate lhc budding 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.809
 abbas and golden goodbye to the fao 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.100
 so in fact no the dress is not blue 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.410
 and black she is not white either 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.780
 and golden in fact she is blue and golden 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.210
 that's actually this optical illusion 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.129
 is very similar to this one or actually 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.040
 here the square to and the bus and b have 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.900
 exactly the same color as one can 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.430
 see it attention hop here that's it 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.000
 this color here and there high 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.360
 abbas is the same finally in Russian is the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.299
 even 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.979
 here except that here as the square in 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.390
 the shadow while waiting for the one to lighten it 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.070
 a little bit and here as he is at 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.119
 sun while waiting for it to darken it and 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.130
 well here it's the same 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.750
 so me for example I saw this dress 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.360
 surrounded by white so by contrast the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.650
 I saw the blue dress while by 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.509
 example of people may have seen in 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.920
 a context where the outline was more 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.500
 dark and at that moment they saw it 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.700
 white or or so they have eyes 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.829
 much less sensitive to light 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.000
 that me and so by contrast well they 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.740
 have not and finally their eyes do not have 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.850
 does the contrast properly and so 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.189
 they thought the dress was white 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.649
 when in fact it is blue 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.149
 after against the cost of black and gold 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.680
 I guess it must be crap 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.920
 same style but here I'm not 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.259
 absolutely not competent to say 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.299
 why it's as if you why 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.409
 it's like that so nobody actually has 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.430
 the reasons and people to go wrong 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.540
 since europe has neither blue nor black 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.430
 neither white nor golden 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.290
 and blue and golden so now twitter 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.130
 if you could stop making me lose 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.070
 faith in humanity 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.070
 that would be nice thank you goodbye goodbye
