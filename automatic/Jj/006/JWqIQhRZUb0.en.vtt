the console again and has a few commands
that<00:01:06.260> I<00:01:06.410> think<00:01:07.570> you<00:01:08.570> should<00:01:08.780> you<00:01:08.810> should<00:01:08.960> do

that I think you should you should do

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.950 
that I think you should you should do
first<00:01:09.950> is<00:01:10.220> set<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.550> round<00:01:10.790> time<00:01:11.120> to<00:01:11.150> 60

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
first is set the round time to 60

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.460 
first is set the round time to 60
minutes<00:01:12.140> so<00:01:12.560> you<00:01:12.650> don't<00:01:12.830> get<00:01:12.920> interrupted

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
minutes so you don't get interrupted

minutes so you don't get interrupted
during<00:01:15.470> your<00:01:15.760> training<00:01:16.760> however<00:01:18.190> because<00:01:19.190> the

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
during your training however because the

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.370 
during your training however because the
round<00:01:19.910> time<00:01:20.150> would<00:01:20.420> would<00:01:20.720> be<00:01:20.840> default<00:01:21.170> and

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
round time would would be default and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.870 
round time would would be default and
join<00:01:21.740> you<00:01:22.100> know<00:01:22.220> you<00:01:22.280> might<00:01:22.490> be<00:01:22.520> doing<00:01:22.670> these

commanders<00:01:41.690> my<00:01:41.950> last<00:01:42.950> tutorial<00:01:43.100> if<00:01:43.759> you<00:01:43.820> if

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
commanders my last tutorial if you if

commanders my last tutorial if you if
you<00:01:44.509> don't<00:01:44.660> member<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:45.110> that's<00:01:46.810> that's<00:01:47.810> so

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
you don't member and that's that's so

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.170 
you don't member and that's that's so
you<00:01:48.800> know<00:01:48.920> when<00:01:49.070> you<00:01:49.160> shoot<00:01:49.340> again<00:01:49.670> you<00:01:50.030> get

you know when you shoot again you get

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.700 
you know when you shoot again you get
these<00:01:50.300> things<00:01:50.570> and<00:01:52.149> the<00:01:53.149> the<00:01:53.600> red<00:01:54.410> bullet

flick<00:02:07.549> shots<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:08.149> aiming<00:02:08.899> things<00:02:09.170> like<00:02:09.350> that

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
flick shots and aiming things like that

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.810 
flick shots and aiming things like that
and<00:02:10.810> reaction<00:02:11.810> time<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:12.290> far<00:02:12.610> so<00:02:13.610> I'll<00:02:13.790> show

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
and reaction time so far so I'll show

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.180 
and reaction time so far so I'll show
you<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.120> settings<00:02:14.390> i<00:02:14.510> use<00:02:14.720> i<00:02:14.959> set<00:02:15.680> first<00:02:16.010> off

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
you the settings i use i set first off

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.490 
you the settings i use i set first off
set<00:02:16.370> size<00:02:16.640> 25<00:02:17.390> that's<00:02:17.870> roughly<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.920> size<00:02:19.220> of<00:02:20.500> a

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
set size 25 that's roughly the size of a

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.620

head of an enemy head because it's all

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.970 
head of an enemy head because it's all
about<00:02:23.810> aim<00:02:24.049> train<00:02:24.320> so<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.560> want<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.739> be<00:02:24.769> going

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
about aim train so you want to be going

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.860 
about aim train so you want to be going
for<00:02:25.130> headshots<00:02:25.280> color<00:02:26.209> really<00:02:26.600> doesn't

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
for headshots color really doesn't

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.539 
for headshots color really doesn't
matter<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.140> have<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.440> 1<00:02:27.650> i'm<00:02:27.980> gonna<00:02:28.160> go<00:02:28.280> green

matter you have a 1 i'm gonna go green

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.490 
matter you have a 1 i'm gonna go green
because<00:02:28.910> some<00:02:29.230> it's<00:02:30.230> just<00:02:30.410> easiest<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.890> see

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
because some it's just easiest to see

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.440 
because some it's just easiest to see
static<00:02:33.500> can<00:02:33.739> leave<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.040> on<00:02:34.100> that<00:02:34.280> odelay<00:02:35.000> put

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
static can leave it on that odelay put

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.259 
static can leave it on that odelay put
onto<00:02:35.600> one<00:02:36.110> second<00:02:36.790> okay<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:37.940> these<00:02:38.060> are

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
onto one second okay and these are

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.180 
onto one second okay and these are
settings<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.660> really<00:02:38.870> matter<00:02:39.049> that's<00:02:39.950> just

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
settings it really matter that's just

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.530 
settings it really matter that's just
sort<00:02:40.310> of<00:02:40.370> basic<00:02:40.730> stuff<00:02:40.970> but<00:02:41.239> these<00:02:41.360> are

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
sort of basic stuff but these are

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.530 
sort of basic stuff but these are
settings<00:02:41.780> that<00:02:41.870> really<00:02:42.049> matter<00:02:42.230> um<00:02:43.540> well

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
settings that really matter um well

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.580 
settings that really matter um well
really<00:02:45.440> just<00:02:45.620> this<00:02:45.799> one<00:02:45.980> this<00:02:46.760> is<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.590> speed

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
really just this one this is the speed

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.039 
really just this one this is the speed
or<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.190> length<00:02:49.549> of<00:02:49.730> how<00:02:49.880> long<00:02:50.150> your<00:02:50.420> target<00:02:50.930> is

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
or the length of how long your target is

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.660 
or the length of how long your target is
going<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.470> stay<00:02:51.769> out<00:02:51.950> before<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:54.459> before<00:02:55.459> you

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
going to stay out before and before you

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.850 
going to stay out before and before you
shoot<00:02:55.970> it<00:02:56.150> before<00:02:56.989> before<00:02:57.200> it<00:02:57.410> disappears

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
shoot it before before it disappears

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.860 
shoot it before before it disappears
basically<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.489> you<00:02:58.549> have<00:02:58.670> time<00:02:58.910> to<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.420> flick

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
basically and you have time to to flick

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.509 
basically and you have time to to flick
to<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.019> shoot<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:01.010> obviously<00:03:01.280> if<00:03:01.400> you

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
to and shoot so obviously if you

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.670 
to and shoot so obviously if you
starting<00:03:01.910> out<00:03:02.030> just<00:03:02.239> going<00:03:02.510> infinity<00:03:03.380> you

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
starting out just going infinity you

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.059 
starting out just going infinity you
know

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
know

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.130 
know
and<00:03:04.489> then<00:03:05.030> by<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.299> way<00:03:05.420> these<00:03:05.569> if<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:05.930> shoot

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
and then by the way these if you shoot

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.020 
and then by the way these if you shoot
these<00:03:06.319> it<00:03:06.620> moves<00:03:06.950> me<00:03:07.040> back<00:03:07.280> as<00:03:07.430> you<00:03:07.549> can<00:03:07.700> see<00:03:07.849> if

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
these it moves me back as you can see if

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.250 
these it moves me back as you can see if
you<00:03:08.120> never<00:03:08.299> been<00:03:08.480> on<00:03:08.629> this<00:03:08.689> map<00:03:08.870> before<00:03:09.019> and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
you never been on this map before and

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.679 
you never been on this map before and
summit<00:03:12.260> level<00:03:12.439> 2<00:03:12.849> /<00:03:13.849> 3<00:03:14.829> level<00:03:15.829> 4<00:03:16.069> ok<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:16.849> we're

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:17.689 
summit level 2 / 3 level 4 ok so we're

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.649 
summit level 2 / 3 level 4 ok so we're
going<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:17.930> be<00:03:17.989> on<00:03:18.109> level<00:03:18.349> 3<00:03:18.980> for<00:03:19.159> this<00:03:19.420> ok<00:03:20.420> and

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:20.659 
going to be on level 3 for this ok and

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.470 
going to be on level 3 for this ok and
as<00:03:21.079> you<00:03:21.139> can<00:03:21.260> see<00:03:21.670> when<00:03:22.670> I<00:03:22.700> press<00:03:22.939> start<00:03:23.239> this

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
as you can see when I press start this

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.379 
as you can see when I press start this
is<00:03:23.569> what<00:03:23.689> happens<00:03:24.790> these<00:03:25.790> little<00:03:25.939> green<00:03:26.180> dots

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
is what happens these little green dots

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.929 
is what happens these little green dots
appear<00:03:26.689> and<00:03:26.930> because<00:03:27.799> our<00:03:27.950> time<00:03:28.189> was<00:03:28.730> on

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:28.939 
appear and because our time was on

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.690 
appear and because our time was on
infinity<00:03:29.540> we<00:03:30.439> can<00:03:30.590> take<00:03:30.769> forever<00:03:30.980> you<00:03:31.400> know<00:03:31.430> it

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
infinity we can take forever you know it

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.069 
infinity we can take forever you know it
doesn't<00:03:31.939> doesn't<00:03:32.269> disappear<00:03:32.689> we<00:03:32.810> take

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
doesn't doesn't disappear we take

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.080 
doesn't doesn't disappear we take
forever<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:33.469> shoot<00:03:33.680> it<00:03:33.829> and<00:03:34.549> it<00:03:34.700> pops<00:03:34.909> up<00:03:34.999> again

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
forever to shoot it and it pops up again

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.459 
forever to shoot it and it pops up again
somewhere<00:03:35.450> else<00:03:35.689> and<00:03:35.930> it<00:03:36.169> will<00:03:36.260> stay<00:03:36.319> there

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:36.469 
somewhere else and it will stay there

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:42.250 
somewhere else and it will stay there
forever<00:03:36.939> so<00:03:37.939> we<00:03:38.000> can<00:03:38.120> shoot<00:03:38.299> that<00:03:41.019> Yeah<00:03:42.019> right

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
forever so we can shoot that Yeah right

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.399 
forever so we can shoot that Yeah right
so<00:03:43.030> i<00:03:46.540> recommend<00:03:47.540> infinity<00:03:48.109> when<00:03:48.290> you

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:48.409 
so i recommend infinity when you

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.709 
so i recommend infinity when you
starting<00:03:48.799> out<00:03:48.889> it'll<00:03:49.099> do<00:03:49.280> it<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.549> 25<00:03:50.269> bullets

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:50.719 
starting out it'll do it to 25 bullets

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:55.050 
starting out it'll do it to 25 bullets
the<00:03:51.489> thing<00:03:52.489> substance<00:03:53.030> it<00:03:53.120> goes<00:03:53.329> up<00:03:53.480> there<00:03:53.689> and

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
the thing substance it goes up there and

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.300 
the thing substance it goes up there and
every<00:03:56.060> time<00:03:56.209> I<00:03:56.359> get<00:03:56.540> a<00:03:56.569> shot<00:03:56.629> right<00:03:57.819> so<00:04:00.310> you

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
every time I get a shot right so you

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.800 
every time I get a shot right so you
want<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.579> start<00:04:01.790> after<00:04:02.120> you<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.299> infinity<00:04:02.540> you

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
want to start after you to infinity you

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.390 
want to start after you to infinity you
might<00:04:02.959> want<00:04:03.109> to<00:04:03.169> get<00:04:03.230> 22<00:04:03.560> seconds<00:04:04.010> and<00:04:04.250> this

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
might want to get 22 seconds and this

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.750 
might want to get 22 seconds and this
way<00:04:04.549> as<00:04:04.819> you<00:04:04.939> can<00:04:05.000> see<00:04:05.239> I<00:04:06.250> only<00:04:07.250> stays<00:04:07.549> there

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
way as you can see I only stays there

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.339 
way as you can see I only stays there
for<00:04:07.909> two<00:04:08.030> seconds<00:04:08.449> and<00:04:08.629> disappears<00:04:09.169> and

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
for two seconds and disappears and

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.719 
for two seconds and disappears and
reappears<00:04:09.409> somewhere<00:04:10.009> else<00:04:10.189> so<00:04:10.519> you<00:04:10.579> only

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:10.729 
reappears somewhere else so you only

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.070 

you<00:04:59.460> know<00:04:59.580> then<00:05:00.330> after<00:05:00.540> you're<00:05:00.660> comfortable

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
you know then after you're comfortable

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.860 
you know then after you're comfortable
at<00:05:01.200> that<00:05:01.320> go<00:05:01.830> to<00:05:01.890> the<00:05:02.100> 1.25<00:05:02.820> then<00:05:03.240> one<00:05:03.420> then<00:05:03.450> and

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
at that go to the 1.25 then one then and

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.900 
at that go to the 1.25 then one then and
then<00:05:03.930> when<00:05:04.740> you're<00:05:04.860> you<00:05:05.160> know<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.460> best<00:05:05.640> air

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
then when you're you know the best air

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.880 
then when you're you know the best air
shot<00:05:06.210> in<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.390> world<00:05:06.540> you<00:05:07.170> can<00:05:07.320> come<00:05:07.500> to<00:05:07.680> these

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
shot in the world you can come to these

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.460 
shot in the world you can come to these
and<00:05:08.520> look<00:05:08.940> how<00:05:09.060> fast<00:05:09.300> this<00:05:09.450> is

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.530 

I<00:05:12.560> don't<00:05:13.370> think<00:05:13.430> that's<00:05:13.610> even<00:05:13.760> possible<00:05:13.910> well

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
I don't think that's even possible well

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.090 
I don't think that's even possible well
I'm<00:05:14.810> pretty<00:05:14.960> I'm<00:05:15.080> sure<00:05:15.260> it<00:05:15.350> isn't<00:05:15.620> real<00:05:15.770> pearls

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
I'm pretty I'm sure it isn't real pearls

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.050 
I'm pretty I'm sure it isn't real pearls
good<00:05:16.250> dinner<00:05:16.430> but<00:05:16.720> you<00:05:17.720> get<00:05:17.840> the<00:05:17.900> point<00:05:18.280> so<00:05:19.280> you

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
good dinner but you get the point so you

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.420 
good dinner but you get the point so you
start<00:05:20.360> off<00:05:20.390> at<00:05:20.570> like<00:05:20.930> to<00:05:21.200> go<00:05:21.830> to<00:05:21.890> level<00:05:22.160> three

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
start off at like to go to level three

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.640 
start off at like to go to level three
and<00:05:22.550> just<00:05:23.140> literally<00:05:24.140> just<00:05:24.320> shoot<00:05:24.530> the

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
and just literally just shoot the

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.070 
and just literally just shoot the
targets

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.390 

you<00:05:27.259> can<00:05:27.349> go<00:05:27.470> move<00:05:27.710> quite<00:05:27.919> so<00:05:28.129> I<00:05:28.159> recommend

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
you can go move quite so I recommend

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.339 
you can go move quite so I recommend
when<00:05:28.789> you<00:05:28.879> start<00:05:29.150> enough<00:05:29.360> moving<00:05:29.840> quite<00:05:30.050> slow

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
when you start enough moving quite slow

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:34.450 
when you start enough moving quite slow
seats<00:05:32.740> because<00:05:33.740> you've<00:05:33.919> got<00:05:34.009> you've<00:05:34.159> got<00:05:34.189> two

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
seats because you've got you've got two

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.219 
seats because you've got you've got two
whole<00:05:34.669> seconds<00:05:35.270> so<00:05:35.479> and<00:05:37.870> it<00:05:38.870> doesn't<00:05:39.169> really

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
whole seconds so and it doesn't really

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:40.809 
whole seconds so and it doesn't really
matter<00:05:39.439> how<00:05:39.680> long<00:05:39.830> you<00:05:40.009> take<00:05:40.189> what<00:05:40.370> it<00:05:40.460> does<00:05:40.639> it

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:40.819 
matter how long you take what it does it

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:42.969 
matter how long you take what it does it
kids<00:05:41.270> two<00:05:41.479> seconds<00:05:41.900> but<00:05:42.020> you<00:05:42.500> have<00:05:42.620> plenty<00:05:42.830> of

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
kids two seconds but you have plenty of

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:44.140 
kids two seconds but you have plenty of
time<00:05:43.039> to<00:05:43.189> actually<00:05:43.370> get<00:05:43.729> to<00:05:43.759> the<00:05:43.939> target

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
time to actually get to the target

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.159 
time to actually get to the target
before<00:05:45.280> before<00:05:46.280> shooting<00:05:46.610> so<00:05:47.180> that's<00:05:47.960> pretty

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
before before shooting so that's pretty

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.980 
before before shooting so that's pretty
much<00:05:48.259> it<00:05:48.379> and<00:05:48.740> just<00:05:49.669> keep<00:05:49.789> keep<00:05:50.150> keep<00:05:50.449> her

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
much it and just keep keep keep her

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.619 
much it and just keep keep keep her

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
you know really don't like five I need

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:04.180 
you know really don't like five I need
to<00:06:02.479> close<00:06:02.659> up<00:06:02.870> if<00:06:03.650> you<00:06:03.770> really<00:06:03.889> don't<00:06:04.069> like

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
to close up if you really don't like

to close up if you really don't like
size<00:06:04.490> five<00:06:04.789> you<00:06:05.000> can<00:06:05.120> get<00:06:05.300> maybe<00:06:05.449> go<00:06:05.629> up<00:06:05.659> to

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
size five you can get maybe go up to

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.059 
size five you can get maybe go up to
eight<00:06:05.960> and<00:06:06.199> you<00:06:06.919> can<00:06:07.280> see<00:06:07.490> it's<00:06:08.330> bigger<00:06:08.680> but<00:06:09.680> i

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:10.069 
eight and you can see it's bigger but i

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:12.249 
eight and you can see it's bigger but i
recommend<00:06:10.879> sitting<00:06:11.270> on<00:06:11.360> 5<00:06:11.599> because<00:06:12.080> it's

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:12.259 
recommend sitting on 5 because it's

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:14.369 
recommend sitting on 5 because it's
better<00:06:12.440> that<00:06:12.500> you<00:06:12.620> learn<00:06:12.860> at<00:06:13.039> five<00:06:13.250> because

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:14.379 
better that you learn at five because

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:17.890
