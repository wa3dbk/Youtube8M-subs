00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:09.740
 hello with you sergey city omsk we 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.849
 continue with you video dedicated 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:17.670
 construction of apartment houses and insulation 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:20.310
 frame walls now you are watching 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.250
 technological process which 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.670
 allows while maintaining the temperature in 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.310
 home 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.769
 with a little small 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.929
 the number of rivers 3 devices and 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.300
 additionally heating furnace about 25 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.930
 degrees with not warmed walls 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.079
 there is such a way they are temporarily on 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.840
 patched up 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.710
 on top of the moss gap too moss pro Konopa 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.850
 ranks and allows you to catch up with temperature 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.460
 support which is already voiced higher 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.829
 drying technology process and so let's say 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.030
 peeping x out practically 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.719
 fully frozen state consists 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:07.159
 by making such a rack 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:10.320
 which from two sides envelops the furnace and 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:14.970
 allows for shelving 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:20.659
 which are on data structures 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:24.840
 are present decompose 4 5 tiers could 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:27.509
 could chopped into small pieces we just 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.030
 late you have prepared 8 rainy if you 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.710
 start cooking in the summer he is already on 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.220
 normal sunny weather you will have 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.979
 ready dried us so slightly wet 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.240
 condition but if you get into a situation like 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.240
 and we practically in the rain 8 was over 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.040
 four days about 30 cubes are prepared 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.439
 fly 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.689
 which will be required for insulation 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:55.110
 This building is such a racks 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.200
 we made on the lower tier we put 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.930
 only in the presence of completely frozen 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.990
 big heads can just be on top 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.850
 tier to lay down quite safely 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.009
 tensioned mesh construction 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.480
 so that small things do not fall 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.040
 it did not ignite the bottom of a millimeter 2 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.189
 Vermiculite is laid to 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:23.340
 ignition was not about regards 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:26.220
 rack what about the styling process 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.890
 here, in principle, everything is quite simple 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.360
 boards are stitched with clamps 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.430
 leaning frame protruding parts 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:41.769
 these extended sidewalls allow 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.260
 wall thickness x 33 centimeters 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.170
 or three with 300s 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.629
 330 millimeters quite neatly 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.760
 about water and now will be a separate 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:56.470
 additional video posted 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.420
 8 infrared heaters 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:04.540
 in my opinion 6 6 pieces that's what else allows 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.980
 very intense evaporation 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.079
 fluid it 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.900
 air convection ie ordinary 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:15.010
 fan at first speed he 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.060
 blows the oven enough for 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.370
 in addition to 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.030
 infrared heat that comes from the oven 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.859
 there was a flow of convection and we 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:29.590
 accordingly, the moisture will be more 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:31.930
 intensively evaporate so top size 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.169
 Zaid we have a boiler that was on 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.690
 a street with little liquid but 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:40.239
 what about moss drying it and 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.310
 making walls I think more than 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.079
 understandably 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.849
 Sergei himself was an additional formation 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.849
 on youtube bye
