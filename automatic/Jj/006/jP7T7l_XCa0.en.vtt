00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
little 6-inch coil and the no motion is

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.370 
little 6-inch coil and the no motion is
awesome<00:00:40.610> because<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:42.149> can<00:00:42.390> get<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.630> signal<00:00:43.200> way

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
had the sensitivity I can bury the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.080 
had the sensitivity I can bury the
sensitivity<00:01:03.360> and<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.600> can<00:01:03.780> hunt<00:01:04.019> no<00:01:04.409> motion

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.870 
I'll be about probably about four inches
deep<00:02:41.540> but<00:02:42.710> the<00:02:43.710> outlaw<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.640> doing<00:02:45.240> amazing<00:02:46.880> I

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
deep but the outlaw is doing amazing I

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.000 
deep but the outlaw is doing amazing I
just<00:02:48.120> love<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.690> machine<00:02:48.900> now<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.709> think

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
just love this machine now and I think

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.699 
just love this machine now and I think
it's<00:02:50.220> gonna<00:02:50.430> be<00:02:50.610> my<00:02:50.820> relic<00:02:51.270> machine<00:02:51.660> I<00:02:51.990> really

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
it's gonna be my relic machine I really

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.699 
it's gonna be my relic machine I really
do<00:02:53.209> but<00:02:54.209> what<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.480> tried<00:02:54.900> today<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.470> new

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
do but what I tried today is a new

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.970 
do but what I tried today is a new
strategy<00:02:56.360> instead<00:02:57.360> of<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.600> big<00:02:57.840> coil<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.709> put

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
strategy instead of a big coil and put

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.390 
strategy instead of a big coil and put
this<00:02:59.130> button<00:02:59.550> up<00:03:01.700> found<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.850> nice<00:03:03.060> horseshoe<00:03:03.750> I

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
this button up found a nice horseshoe I

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.770 
this button up found a nice horseshoe I
found<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.550> two<00:03:05.940> ring<00:03:06.270> bullet<00:03:08.300> so<00:03:09.300> I<00:03:09.330> don't<00:03:09.630> know

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
found a two ring bullet so I don't know

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.640 
found a two ring bullet so I don't know
how<00:03:09.930> old<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.260> two<00:03:10.470> rings<00:03:10.800> are<00:03:11.720> but<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:13.080> got

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
how old the two rings are but I got

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.710 
how old the two rings are but I got
after<00:03:13.860> right<00:03:14.220> after<00:03:14.520> I<00:03:14.580> got<00:03:14.760> off<00:03:14.880> my<00:03:15.030> bicycle<00:03:15.270> I

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
after right after I got off my bicycle I

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.040 
after right after I got off my bicycle I
found<00:03:16.020> that<00:03:16.260> one<00:03:17.209> but<00:03:18.209> I'm<00:03:18.330> happy<00:03:18.690> with<00:03:18.840> that

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
found that one but I'm happy with that

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.229 
found that one but I'm happy with that
button<00:03:19.320> that<00:03:19.530> just<00:03:19.739> tells<00:03:19.980> me<00:03:20.160> I'm<00:03:20.459> I'm<00:03:20.880> one

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
button that just tells me I'm I'm one

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:32.500 
button that just tells me I'm I'm one
location<00:03:22.250> so<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.280> tried<00:03:23.670> a<00:03:23.700> different<00:03:24.000> strategy

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.670 

and<00:03:34.100> hope<00:03:35.100> I'm<00:03:35.250> still<00:03:35.519> recording<00:03:35.880> this<00:03:36.180> phone

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
and hope I'm still recording this phone

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.170 
and hope I'm still recording this phone
all<00:03:37.680> right<00:03:37.739> but<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.190> tried<00:03:38.519> a<00:03:38.550> new<00:03:38.820> strategy

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
all right but I tried a new strategy

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:47.150 
all right but I tried a new strategy
here<00:03:39.780> I<00:03:41.209> instead<00:03:42.209> of<00:03:42.330> a<00:03:42.420> big<00:03:42.660> coil<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:44.030> said<00:03:46.160> you

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
here I instead of a big coil I said you

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.900 
here I instead of a big coil I said you
know<00:03:47.310> why<00:03:47.519> don't<00:03:47.580> I<00:03:47.790> try<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.120> little<00:03:48.600> coil

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
know why don't I try the little coil

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.910 
know why don't I try the little coil
where<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:50.940> could<00:03:51.239> get<00:03:51.480> up<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:52.560> know<00:03:52.590> it's

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
where I could get up you know it's

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.120 
where I could get up you know it's
fairly<00:03:53.130> open<00:03:53.730> out<00:03:53.910> here<00:03:54.440> but<00:03:55.440> like<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:55.799> tree

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
fairly open out here but like that tree

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.220 
fairly open out here but like that tree
laying<00:03:56.370> down<00:03:56.700> there<00:03:56.970> that<00:03:57.090> limb<00:03:57.360> you<00:03:57.900> can't

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
laying down there that limb you can't

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.490 
laying down there that limb you can't
get<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.530> big<00:03:58.830> hole<00:03:59.130> up<00:03:59.400> in<00:03:59.519> there<00:03:59.790> and<00:04:00.500> this

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
get a big hole up in there and this

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.400 
get a big hole up in there and this
little<00:04:01.560> coil<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.549> doing<00:04:03.030> absolutely

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
little coil is doing absolutely

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.810 
little coil is doing absolutely
beautiful<00:04:04.410> you<00:04:04.440> can<00:04:04.769> maneuver<00:04:05.160> this<00:04:05.519> thing

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
beautiful you can maneuver this thing

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.360 
beautiful you can maneuver this thing
you<00:04:06.030> can<00:04:06.239> get<00:04:06.480> down<00:04:06.690> in<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.049> lead<00:04:07.340> you<00:04:08.340> can't

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
you can get down in the lead you can't

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.610 
you can get down in the lead you can't
do<00:04:08.880> that<00:04:09.090> with<00:04:09.360> a<00:04:09.390> big<00:04:09.720> coil

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
do that with a big coil

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.569 
do that with a big coil
can<00:04:13.349> you<00:04:14.349> can't<00:04:14.680> do<00:04:15.010> this<00:04:15.250> with<00:04:15.549> a<00:04:15.580> big<00:04:15.879> horse

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
can you can't do this with a big horse

you can't be wall this time except with
a<00:04:20.530> big<00:04:20.829> pole<00:04:21.130> so<00:04:22.120> I'm<00:04:22.210> changing<00:04:22.510> techniques

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
a big pole so I'm changing techniques

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.659 
a big pole so I'm changing techniques
here<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:25.000> I'm<00:04:25.150> getting<00:04:25.449> ready<00:04:25.660> to<00:04:26.370> turn<00:04:27.370> this
