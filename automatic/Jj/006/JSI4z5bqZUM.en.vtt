I've<00:03:05.470> gotta<00:03:05.739> run<00:03:05.769> around<00:03:06.129> first

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
what happens with my team on the

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.699 
what happens with my team on the
offensive<00:03:30.540> side<00:03:30.749> see<00:03:31.139> if<00:03:31.260> they<00:03:31.349> can<00:03:31.469> get<00:03:31.560> the

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709

lead<00:03:31.859> back<00:03:31.889> which<00:03:32.819> we<00:03:33.120> did<00:03:33.359> and<00:03:33.709> that<00:03:34.709> will

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
lead back which we did and that will

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:42.480 
lead back which we did and that will
probably<00:03:35.760> end<00:03:35.959> my<00:03:36.959> debut

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490
