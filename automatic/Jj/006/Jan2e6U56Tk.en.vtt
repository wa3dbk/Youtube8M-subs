00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.170
 welcome to a more biochemistry video 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.679
 today we will learn about the functions of 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.599
 the proteins first let's see what are the 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.870
 proteins are molecules formed by 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.210
 linear amino acid chains ' we have 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.670
 that are indispensable for life and 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.640
 they play a key role since 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.340
 are found in all cells are 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.360
 they make up especially of nitrogen 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:36.700
 oxygen hydrogen and carbon in some 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.110
 there is sulfur phosphorus and iron well 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.480
 the functions of proteins are 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.270
 varied and specific as they determine 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.660
 the shape and structure of the cells and 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:51.830
 are part of the vital processes we 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.170
 they help the body and defend us 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.840
 defend from external agents control 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.870
 and maintains the functions besides that 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.520
 repair damages and it should be noted that 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.110
 perform their functions by union 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.110
 selective or molecular 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.850
 ok let's start with the regulatory function 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.700
 this intervenes to form compounds 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.280
 as the hemoglobin hormones enzymes and 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.100
 some other vitamins that cause the 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.039
 chemical reactions of the organism 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.569
 also adhere to the DNA and so 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.569
 control genetic transcription 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.630
 after 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.909
 the proteins also work like 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.490
 shock absorbers keeping in various 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.580
 parts of the body a balance 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.640
 osmotic to this we are also going to 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.890
 call homeostatic function of 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.170
 proteins help cells to 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.140
 survive in the abrupt changes of 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.340
 external and internal environment as 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.580
 we have in the image 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.580
 We have the internal ph and the external ph 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.930
 then we have the defensive function in 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.850
 this function has the ability to create 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.509
 antibodies and protect the body from 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.760
 strange organisms 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.700
 they destroy those that they consider 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.280
 alien to our body some areas 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.010
 thrombin and the book or gene that help 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.110
 blood coagulation in addition 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.090
 intervene in the inactivation of the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.709
 infectious virus 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.810
 now we have the enzymatic function are 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.420
 the most specialized proteins and 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.700
 numerous have participation as a bio 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.590
 catalysts to accelerate the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.590
 chemical reactions of our organism 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.540
 we also have hormonal function the 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.870
 hormones are produced by cells 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.510
 some are protein like leucine the 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.700
 growth hormone or glucagon 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.370
 which regulates glucose levels in the 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.230
 blood help in fixing the 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.990
 hormone receptor network 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.320
 specific as shown in our 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.320
 image 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.910
 there is also the contract function 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.460
 which is also called the function of 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.050
 movement is as we show here 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.760
 in the images, the 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.520
 contraction of the muscles by the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.290
 myosin and actin those functions are 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.750
 related in all living beings 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.750
 for the happy proteins 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.920
 we now have the function of structural 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.990
 some proteins form structures 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.180
 cell phones like 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.050
 glÃ¼ck or proteins that make up the 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.180
 cell membrane and participate as 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.280
 receptors or facilitate the transport of 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.460
 some substances other proteins 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:53.360
 they give elasticity like that of 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.190
 corner and the collagen or the histones that 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.680
 they are part of the chromosomes that 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.680
 regulate the expression of genes 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.320
 there is also the so-called function of 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.870
 reserve where the proteins also 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.170
 they influence the tree organism contributing 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.470
 more energy usually 4 kilocalories 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.380
 to the program some examples are the the 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.489
 current payroll of milk and albumin 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.489
 of the egg white 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.290
 now comes the conveyor function 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.530
 it says that it helps living beings in 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:35.050
 the transport phenomena regulates the 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.360
 movement of soluble molecules in 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.880
 water through the protein channels so that 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.190
 penetrate the cell membrane a 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.520
 example that we have that we have of it 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.260
 are hemoglobin and hemoglobin 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.300
 oxygen transport proteins in 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.630
 blood in vertebrate organisms 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.750
 and in the molecules respectively and so 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.630
 we have in the image a red globule with 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.140
 the blood capillary where a 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:05.140
 little more how it takes place in back 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:08.139
 the transport finally we have the 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.759
 Signal translation function 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.770
 this function consists of the 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.509
 recognition of information from 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.849
 the outside to the inside of our 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:19.650
 cell like here we see it so 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.650
 generate an answer in it 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.040
 and good is this in this video I wish them 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.150
 have liked and have understood us 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.360
 we see until the next 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.360
 goodbye
