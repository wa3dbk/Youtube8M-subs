comparing the difference between the

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.280 
comparing the difference between the
Switchblade<00:00:08.870> versus<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.170> nine-to-five<00:00:11.059> now

Switchblade versus the nine-to-five now
the<00:00:13.290> Switchblade

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
the Switchblade

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.519 
the Switchblade
look<00:00:15.900> at<00:00:16.109> all<00:00:16.770> its<00:00:17.070> details<00:00:17.550> right<00:00:17.789> here

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
look at all its details right here

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.929 
look at all its details right here
as<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.619> can<00:00:19.740> see<00:00:19.920> it's<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.160> pretty<00:00:20.400> nice<00:00:20.640> board

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
as you can see it's a pretty nice board

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.439 
as you can see it's a pretty nice board
in<00:00:21.060> length<00:00:21.890> got<00:00:22.890> some<00:00:23.130> good<00:00:23.340> drop<00:00:23.760> right<00:00:24.300> now<00:00:24.420> I

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
in length got some good drop right now I

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.550 
in length got some good drop right now I
think<00:00:24.600> it's<00:00:24.810> like<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.960> point<00:00:25.320> eight<00:00:25.529> eight

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
think it's like a point eight eight

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.790 
think it's like a point eight eight
around<00:00:25.980> one<00:00:26.250> inch<00:00:26.460> drop<00:00:26.820> nice<00:00:27.210> place<00:00:28.109> put<00:00:28.650> your

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
around one inch drop nice place put your

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.240 
around one inch drop nice place put your
feet<00:00:29.039> right<00:00:29.420> here<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.929> here<00:00:31.470> let's<00:00:31.859> see<00:00:32.070> it's

feet right here and here let's see it's

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.310 
feet right here and here let's see it's
got<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> drop<00:00:32.730> through<00:00:33.030> mount<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.540> great<00:00:34.079> place

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
got a drop through mount a great place

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.680 
got a drop through mount a great place
for<00:00:34.350> your<00:00:34.649> trucks<00:00:35.100> keep<00:00:35.969> some<00:00:36.149> steady<00:00:36.450> as<00:00:36.660> you

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
that's the land yacht switchblade now

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.840 
that's the land yacht switchblade now
let's<00:01:03.510> go<00:01:03.660> over<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> 9<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.350> 5<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.010> 9<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.820> 5

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
let's go over to the 9 to 5 the 9 to 5

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.920 
let's go over to the 9 to 5 the 9 to 5
is<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> nice<00:01:06.689> board<00:01:07.140> around<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> same<00:01:08.040> length

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
is a nice board around the same length

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.710 
is a nice board around the same length
it<00:01:10.380> has<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> nice<00:01:10.860> W<00:01:11.400> concave<00:01:11.939> going<00:01:12.299> straight

it has a nice W concave going straight

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.950 
it has a nice W concave going straight
through<00:01:13.670> great<00:01:14.670> lock<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.210> your<00:01:15.299> feets<00:01:15.659> got

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
through great lock for your feets got

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.990 
through great lock for your feets got
gas<00:01:16.259> pedals<00:01:16.830> unlike<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> Switchblade<00:01:17.759> that

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
gas pedals unlike the Switchblade that

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.580 
gas pedals unlike the Switchblade that
doesn't<00:01:18.299> have<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> gas<00:01:18.689> pedals<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.200> has<00:01:19.350> gas

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
doesn't have the gas pedals and has gas

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.910 
doesn't have the gas pedals and has gas
pedals<00:01:20.009> on<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> front<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.700> back<00:01:21.439> it<00:01:22.439> also<00:01:22.650> has

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
pedals on the front and back it also has

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.880 
pedals on the front and back it also has
a<00:01:22.950> drop<00:01:23.250> through<00:01:23.580> mount<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.750> really<00:01:25.650> when<00:01:25.799> it

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
a drop through mount so really when it

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.679 
a drop through mount so really when it
comes<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.280> truck<00:01:26.549> stability<00:01:27.090> between<00:01:27.390> these

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
comes to truck stability between these

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.890 
comes to truck stability between these
two<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:28.110> not<00:01:28.320> any<00:01:28.619> different<00:01:29.270> there's<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.420> 52

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
two it's not any different there's a 52

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.690 
two it's not any different there's a 52
trucks<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.040> trucks<00:01:32.310> aren't<00:01:32.549> different

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
trucks so the trucks aren't different

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.130 
trucks so the trucks aren't different
the<00:01:32.909> only<00:01:33.000> difference<00:01:33.509> between<00:01:33.630> these<00:01:33.960> two

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
the only difference between these two

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.289 
the only difference between these two
boards<00:01:34.470> are<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.770> wheels<00:01:35.070> these<00:01:35.759> are<00:01:35.970> mini

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
boards are the wheels these are mini

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:36.890 
boards are the wheels these are mini
hogs

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
hogs

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.660 
hogs
nizami<00:01:37.470> hogs<00:01:38.210> yeah<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.720> board<00:01:40.670> also

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
nizami hogs yeah so this board also

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.210 
nizami hogs yeah so this board also
great<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.299> downhill<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:43.470> know<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.680> got<00:01:44.009> some

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
great for downhill you know you got some

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.830 
great for downhill you know you got some
tricks<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.670> may<00:01:44.909> not<00:01:45.060> have<00:01:45.210> much<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.600> kick

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
tricks you may not have much of a kick

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.300 
tricks you may not have much of a kick
but<00:01:46.049> if<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.229> put<00:01:46.439> your<00:01:46.560> feet<00:01:46.710> around<00:01:46.829> right
