00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
whatever so let's get started

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.970 
whatever so let's get started
this<00:00:53.980> one<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.399> reason<00:00:54.699> why<00:00:54.999> I<00:00:55.030> bought<00:00:55.390> this

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
this one the reason why I bought this

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.560 
this one the reason why I bought this
instead<00:00:56.980> of<00:00:57.039> this<00:00:57.339> ones<00:00:57.699> to<00:00:57.969> try<00:00:58.210> something

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
instead of this ones to try something

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.660 
instead of this ones to try something
new<00:00:58.780> so<00:00:59.649> the<00:00:59.829> reason<00:01:00.070> I<00:01:00.129> like<00:01:00.280> this<00:01:00.399> one<00:01:00.579> is

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
new so the reason I like this one is

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.489 
new so the reason I like this one is
because<00:01:00.850> it<00:01:01.269> has<00:01:01.449> a<00:01:01.780> little<00:01:01.960> spooley<00:01:02.409> brush

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:02.499 
because it has a little spooley brush

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:04.470 
because it has a little spooley brush
and<00:01:03.129> I<00:01:03.159> really<00:01:03.429> like<00:01:03.640> that<00:01:03.879> you<00:01:04.150> can<00:01:04.300> like

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:04.480 
and I really like that you can like

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.610 
and I really like that you can like
brush<00:01:04.930> your<00:01:05.170> eyebrows<00:01:05.590> with<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.930> color<00:01:08.350> is

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
brush your eyebrows with this color is
