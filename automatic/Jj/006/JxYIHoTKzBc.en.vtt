it everyone's always smiling and just a

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.999 
it everyone's always smiling and just a
lot<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.140> fun<00:01:49.259> it's<00:01:49.439> really<00:01:49.500> different<00:01:49.920> from

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
lot of fun it's really different from

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.230 
lot of fun it's really different from
Abby's<00:01:50.369> like<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.670> training<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.119> different

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
Abby's like the training is different

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.660 
Abby's like the training is different
the<00:01:52.020> energy<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.649> different<00:01:52.920> but<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.520> awesome

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
the energy is different but it's awesome

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.039 
the energy is different but it's awesome
and<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.180> respond<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.689> feel<00:01:54.840> like<00:01:54.990> you

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
and you respond you feel like you

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.690 
and you respond you feel like you
respond<00:01:55.350> better<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.770> positive<00:01:56.189> energy<00:01:56.310> I

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
respond better to the positive energy I

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.580 
respond better to the positive energy I
think<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.600> could<00:01:57.810> give<00:01:57.930> guidance<00:01:58.200> to

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
think so you could give guidance to

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.530 
think so you could give guidance to
dance<00:01:58.829> teachers<00:01:59.310> out<00:01:59.520> there<00:01:59.759> what<00:02:00.329> what

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
dance teachers out there what what

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.359 
dance teachers out there what what
advice<00:02:00.840> would<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.049> give<00:02:01.170> them<00:02:01.320> from<00:02:01.860> from<00:02:02.280> a

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
advice would you give them from from a

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.580 
advice would you give them from from a
national<00:02:03.210> champion<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.930> don't<00:02:04.350> know<00:02:04.439> it's

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
national champion I don't know it's

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.289 
national champion I don't know it's
always<00:02:04.710> fun<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.130> be<00:02:05.310> nicer<00:02:05.729> because<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.240> think

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
always fun to be nicer because I think

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.789 
always fun to be nicer because I think
it<00:02:06.600> gets<00:02:06.659> across<00:02:06.960> better<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.469> us<00:02:07.590> because

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
it gets across better to us because

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.770 
it gets across better to us because
whenever<00:02:08.160> they're<00:02:08.489> mean<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:09.479> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
whenever they're mean to like the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.990 
whenever they're mean to like the
dancers<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.619> we<00:02:10.950> just<00:02:11.099> get<00:02:11.250> sad<00:02:11.459> about<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.849> but

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
dancers and we just get sad about it but

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.309 
dancers and we just get sad about it but
if<00:02:12.090> it's<00:02:12.390> nice<00:02:12.660> then<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:12.989> think<00:02:13.140> we'd<00:02:13.290> actually

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
if it's nice then I think we'd actually

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.970 
if it's nice then I think we'd actually
take<00:02:13.770> the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
take the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.500 
take the
correction<00:02:14.550> what's<00:02:14.970> your<00:02:15.090> favorite<00:02:15.300> kind<00:02:15.390> of

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
correction what's your favorite kind of

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.930
