00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.649
 no doubt the news today is that it has 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:09.310
 The last book by Harry Potter came out 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:11.200
 the book is called harry potter and the 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.100
 relics of death 'I think he dies 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.570
 the boy 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.570
 but old and 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.580
 years the child has been 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.670
 and he's still sleeping under the stairs 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.090
 but they have but want to squeeze botero 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.090
 cascorro 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.720
 Harry Potter books are very 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.910
 well it's very good because children read 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.470
 but who are reading 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.350
 to begin with, it's supposed to be harry 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.019
 potter is the best magician in the world without 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.089
 But this cat is worth not see anything to the uncle 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.659
 you can not make a spell to see well 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:52.150
 you already talk to the snakes but not 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:53.500
 you can see them or you do not know if 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.370
 are you talking to a snake with a 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.379
 sausage 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.600
 that's not to mention the brooms 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:04.680
 Flying is one of the smaller media 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.510
 for a saddle 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.140
 what are you going to leave the sting of the ass like 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.140
 the neckline of ana obregÃ³n 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.079
 and that hurts 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.079
 It was not 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.220
 that you do not care how you see it 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.600
 last time they saw him fly I have 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.240
 said that I was taking cleaner from 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.940
 a pool I do not say more 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.190
 an important thing are already rolling the 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.380
 movie of Harry Potter's new book 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.960
 and they are already doing the Spanish version 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:40.290
 we have the castle trailer of hogwarts 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.850
 a young magician who buried a city and 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.159
 a witch who could not fly 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.400
 in the greatest combat of all 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.400
 time 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.110
 the young magician will die 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.880
 and the electoral list
