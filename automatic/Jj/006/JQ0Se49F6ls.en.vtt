00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.920
 congratulations all replays 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.000
 now international that does not feel 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.000
 how the match ends 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:26.470
 that the red one I see a bit dazed 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.730
 I have not seen it on TV the truth 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.260
 but I did not think he was going to get the red 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.929
 I hit the same 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.019
 of innocent I'm not any skinned myself 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:42.269
 I am a player already with travel I knew 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:45.120
 that some was going to start so there 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:48.579
 there he makes a mistake and I really suffered 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.730
 much the 25 minutes 30 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:56.699
 it was horrible horrible because a goal we 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:01:00.190
 but happy that the team struggled 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.140
 as sorry for my tweet I ask for forgiveness 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.570
 back to the fans 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.580
 the group already told them 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.810
 personally and grateful that they 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.070
 they could run and take the game 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.420
 go ahead but I'll tell you how the 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.289
 players are going I'm no longer like the time 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.720
 how he felt that happened, I do not ever go 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:19.630
 with bad intention in almost never played 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.049
 in almost no water first because it's not 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.590
 my nature and second because I never 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.840
 continue like this 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.149
 I put the foot and right there you make them know 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.520
 and on TV you see that image that 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.810
 He tried to pull me back 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.850
 I do everything that obviously touches it is a 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.490
 missing but the final of football a 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.039
 contact sport and it seems that it was a 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.780
 yellow what happens is that good in 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.780
 this we know how is the theme of the 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.950
 classifies happily and you have to think about 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:53.000
 the rivals that come as you as 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.759
 generation students from Paraguay who 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.489
 maybe those themes that is love is the 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.700
 champion of venezuela surely has 

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:00.700
 friends 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.070
 all the equipment that are in the cup are 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.800
 great teams that's clear 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.229
 obviously in the group there is a team that 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.230
 stands out for being the last champion 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.620
 how is my black 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.560
 but the first game against national 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.260
 here you have to respect the house as 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.610
 was done today as it is going to be done with whom 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.770
 come on 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.000
 today we show that we have arguments and 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.640
 we have players in all the lines 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.390
 how to go and find matches 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.850
 and look for the classification that's what 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.260
 already the goal was to move now the 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.390
 next goal obviously is to pass 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.310
 this phase and already there can happen 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.980
 many things very well personally and 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.420
 is still playing by marking it down 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.760
 I do not understand the truth what is the whole 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.330
 the subject of the debate and that if I'm like 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.709
 that if not me if I'm like no 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.870
 believe me to be the first one 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.940
 tell the professor teacher there is not going to 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.660
 play and points if I'm there is because I 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.330
 I feel trained 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.460
 I think I have complied, I do not think there 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.850
 past too much trouble and that there 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.190
 remained so very obvious or is not lateral 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.070
 the truth that my colleagues support me 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.350
 they have shaken my hand so I'm going to 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.960
 keep contributing from where I am 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:20.880
 want to put then no there is no 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:23.550
 kind of inconvenience with that no 4 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.530
 elimination match and sub-20 I played there 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.850
 also so it's not something 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.850
 completely new
