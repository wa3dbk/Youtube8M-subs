00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.189
 finished the closing season 2014 for 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.889
 chivas and thus a failure more 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.300
 It was done at the Rojiblanca institution 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.540
 accept it the front aldo of nigris 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.450
 who did not think about the matter is a 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.340
 failure in the clear labor and so I see it 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.890
 as I have mentioned some other things 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.780
 that I had to fail as well as a 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.270
 touched succeed in many things 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.060
 it's a failure that after you have to 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.349
 help to obtain the objective of 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.600
 success and good 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.000
 and that always 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.059
 for the magnitude that this represents in 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.129
 this team despite being many things 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.320
 if there are many young people is that if the 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.010
 team is putting together many things but 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.230
 really for what it represents to 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.239
 chivas is a failure they are not in the 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.549
 line and in the first places and that is 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.199
 by adding only 21 points and stay 

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:58.600
 the shore without managing to classify the 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.909
 liguilla something accepts the team is still in 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.010
 debt but also the after getting so 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.830
 only three goals along this 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.340
 tournament with the fans of chivas I have 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.369
 said and if I feel in debt because 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.399
 because it's not easy it's not easy but 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.520
 I know that I can give you more good 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:21.880
 I will try but more more than anything 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.640
 the love that they have shown me and how 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.420
 I tell you sometimes I'm very demanding in 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.310
 my person and well that helps 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.140
 and I also think that sometimes people get 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.979
 realize that as you said it does 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.409
 a little while that realizes that one is 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.630
 breaks the soul for the team and that 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.380
 Sometimes it is not enough but hey that 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.079
 is what 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.360
 the least that one can do for the 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.520
 institution that pays the truth that you 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.890
 he feeds that he feeds one his 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.470
 family and good after all the support 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.630
 what people give you is also very 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.490
 important however and despite everything 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.929
 the regiomontan striker does not 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.539
 regretting having left the striped 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.520
 a year ago and reach the sacred flock '' 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.509
 everything I think was a decision that 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.830
 take me it was not even that monterrey me 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.140
 gives 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.569
 I had to put transferable 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.000
 connection that I take that I thought a lot 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.580
 If I thought about it a lot because 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.160
 I had the illusion to continue riding a lot 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.810
 more time to earn more titles but when 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.620
 I heard the name of chivas called me 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.530
 a lot of attention 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.209
 and good and when I had that opportunity 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.250
 I also knew that the team was not 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.709
 well it was going to be difficult and it has been 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.870
 difficult but I think I'm going step by step 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.060
 improving and that is important no no 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.040
 there's a setback but we 're going to go 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.329
 better and maybe it has to be more 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.819
 fast because the next tournament 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.170
 we know what is important but I think that 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.660
 in all aspects to improve the 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.910
 team so much in football 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.130
 also in the top part in the 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.430
 directive that they are doing their job of 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.920
 bring important people to reinforce 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.900
 now the rumors about departures from 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.090
 players come and go but the attacker 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.710
 de las chivas prefers to wait and not 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.170
 anticipate what could be your 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.480
 future with the Guadalajara can happen 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.720
 many things I have two more years of 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.910
 contract here will be my decision to be 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.020
 here for more than if they put me transferred 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.380
 It's not my decision 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.870
 but to me obviously we will never be 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.060
 in a place to force 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.720
 if they get me to put transferable in 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.120
 this case or there is one more option because no 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.819
 is taken into account here by the I will analyze 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.519
 in a good way and obviously looking 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.769
 always be where you really where 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.060
 they want and you value not then first 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.819
 that nothing here I have felt very valued 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.709
 even though the team have not given 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.430
 also that maybe I have not done 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.349
 so many goals 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.810
 but I have felt very valued by all 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:55.450
 the people for my colleagues for all the 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.359
 people who involve the institution in 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.780
 general and by the fans that's something that 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:03.939
 baby the truth has me very surprised 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.099
 I also think that they realize that 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:08.680
 I out there sometimes things do not come out 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:11.709
 but from so much to split the soul for the 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.609
 team inside the court and well then 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.609
 we'll see no obviously 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.329
 if that option is given as you say they are 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.090
 rumors obviously if you give that good already 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.220
 We will see what is the best option for 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.220
 me for the club but I'm very calm 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.260
 here I am very happy and I know that this 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.510
 which is going to be very good for this 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.690
 team to sound chivas informed karina
