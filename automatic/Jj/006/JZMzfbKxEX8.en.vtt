 good appreciated college students 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:25.220
 charles dickens grade 3 today we are going to 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.560
 do a review of guide number 2 of the 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.570
 theme the keyboard 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.090
 remember that the keyboard is a 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.760
 very common input device of the 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.980
 computers and its main function is 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.610
 allow people to enter 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.430
 information through the keys 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:46.309
 here I have a keyboard graphic 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.760
 with each of its parts each part 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.470
 is identified by a different color 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.240
 well let's start going over the 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.880
 the keyboard is composed of 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.160
 next keys first the keyboard 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.940
 main thing that you can notice is 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.770
 framed by a red line the keyboard 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.470
 main contains the keys that have 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.940
 numbers letters and symbols here we can 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.880
 note that on top of each number 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.330
 we found a symbol that we found 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.110
 the alphabet of the aa the z and we find 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.740
 the space bar 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.760
 we see on the right the numeric keypad 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.350
 framed by a magenta line 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.690
 is numeric keypad in addition to the 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.480
 numbers contains signs of operations 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.630
 how are multiplication division subtraction 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.820
 sum 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.659
 It is used many times as a 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.450
 calculator 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.330
 Function keys are the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.200
 Function keys are identified because 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.900
 they have a letter f uppercase and to the side 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:57.600
 a number here are framed within 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:59.880
 of a blue line these keys are 12 and 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.130
 allow to perform different functions 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.409
 according to the active or open program 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.770
 example if I have the word program 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.610
 open with pressing the f1 key can I 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.420
 enter or exit the program we find 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.430
 the arrow keys or scroll 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.190
 these move the cursor up 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.600
 down to the left or 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.030
 right in one position at a time 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.730
 we found the special keys some 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.500
 on the left side and others on the side 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.990
 right inside the hand area 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.480
 right 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.110
 These special keys are used to 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.480
 printing locks pauses in 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.680
 operations will give orders how to save 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.780
 uppercase and lowercase erase and 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.820
 screen display within these 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.640
 special special keys we find 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.590
 the tab key uppercase lock for 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.170
 when we want to write all the 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.060
 letters of a capital shift 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.890
 for when we want to suppress this key 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.620
 and write a word in initial 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.080
 uppercase control to oppress this 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.990
 key along with the letter s that we 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.160
 allows to save a file we find 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.070
 inside these special keys 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.920
 also insert screen print 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:20.450
 Pause scroll lock 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.470
 interrupt start end return us a 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:27.470
 page forward a page and the key 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.030
 delete and we found the indicators 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.250
 activation 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.810
 The key indicator indicates whether the 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:39.140
 lock keys uppercase lock 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.630
 numerical and blocking displacement is 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.930
 are active or inactive when 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:48.380
 their little lights are active or 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:52.720
 indicators will be on and when 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:56.890
 they are inactive because they will be turned off 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.680
 ok now let's see in this part in 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.080
 this drawing what should be the position 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.220
 correct of each of the fingers in the 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:09.550
 keyboard here I have divided the keyboard in 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.950
 two areas an area for the left hand 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.500
 and the other for the right hand as 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.230
 you can observe here each one of 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.390
 Keys will both in the area 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.840
 left as in the right area a 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.820
 specific color to be used with each 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.760
 one of the fingers of the hand for example 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.590
 with the little finger I will handle the 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.110
 keys that you observe here in 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.510
 yellow color with the ring finger 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.810
 keys that look in blue with the 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:41.110
 middle finger heart color keys 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.590
 light green with the index finger the 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.900
 keys and with red color that in each area 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.419
 the index finger handles two keys 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.970
 with the thumb handle the bar 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:58.130
 spacer in the lower right 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:05:00.289
 you can see an indicator of 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.630
 yellow color that indicates that that will be 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:05.030
 used with the little finger the blue with the 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:08.120
 from ring light green with finger 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:12.919
 heart and red with the index finger the 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:18.020
 green with your thumb okay now and 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:19.669
 Knowing this we will study how 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.720
 make up each of the parts of the 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.539
 keyboard 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.030
 we have upper central keyboard e 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.860
 lower the upper keyboard is 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:33.480
 composed of the keys that go from 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:37.560
 the 1 to the 0 and the one of the letter q we7 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:40.080
 i ii and iii that make up the keyboard 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:46.500
 top of the lower keyboard what 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:49.590
 make up the letters zx vvy script two 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.530
 dots and dot semicolons 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:58.410
 myn for the lower keyboard the 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:59.930
 central keyboard to that of fg in the heca j 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.050
 yh 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.580
 we are doing for now a review of the 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.139
 central keyboard 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.410
 let's observe that the letter to the 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:12.440
 we will handle with the little finger the s with 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:15.770
 the ring finger the d with the middle finger 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.979

 the thumb of both hands the bar 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:42.680
 spacer this in what corresponds 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.660
 for now already to guide number two this 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.030
 it's been a very short very short topic that 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:50.270
 I hope you make the most of it. 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.680
 exercises with the central keyboard in the 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.689
 central keyboard you know we can 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:07:01.259
 write for example handle 

00:06:54.689 --> 00:07:05.610
 daza to the damage gala and other words that 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:08.629
 we can exercise with the central keyboard 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:12.329
 do also for example what can we 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:14.369
 type with the good central keyboard 

00:07:12.329 --> 00:07:17.999
 appreciated students this is all for 

00:07:14.369 --> 00:07:20.039
 today in the review of the keyboard I hope that 

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:22.829
 be of your liking and take advantage of it 

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:25.889
 maximum you know that practicing is 

00:07:22.829 --> 00:07:28.319
