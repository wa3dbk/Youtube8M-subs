for the classes role I'd say that the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
friendly I guess would be the term

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.430 
friendly I guess would be the term
weapon<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.310> use<00:02:29.340> mostly<00:02:30.120> because<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:31.320> know

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
weapon to use mostly because you know

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.960 
weapon to use mostly because you know
you<00:02:31.500> capitalize<00:02:32.040> on<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.220> one<00:02:32.460> mistake<00:02:32.640> they

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
you capitalize on that one mistake they

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.300 
you capitalize on that one mistake they
make<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.360> bam<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.930> was<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.050> damaged<00:02:34.470> or<00:02:34.620> 750

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
make and bam that was a damaged or 750

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.640 
make and bam that was a damaged or 750
or<00:02:35.400> whatever<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.730> splash<00:02:35.970> happens<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.450> be

or whatever the splash happens to be

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.160 
or whatever the splash happens to be
overall<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.860> would<00:02:38.640> suggest<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:39.780> get<00:02:39.990> the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
overall I would suggest that you get the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.440 
overall I would suggest that you get the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
heavy bolt launcher right away it's an

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.410 
heavy bolt launcher right away it's an
option<00:02:42.660> but<00:02:43.320> it's<00:02:43.590> not<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:44.130> like<00:02:45.090> oh<00:02:45.240> my

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420
