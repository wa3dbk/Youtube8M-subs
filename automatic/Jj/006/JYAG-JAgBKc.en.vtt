protein that you're going to take you

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.460 
protein that you're going to take you
know<00:04:44.070> right<00:04:44.490> after<00:04:44.790> your<00:04:45.330> breakfast<00:04:45.750> this<00:04:46.260> has

about<00:04:46.710> 50<00:04:47.100> grams<00:04:47.310> of<00:04:47.490> protein<00:04:47.640> per<00:04:47.970> two<00:04:48.360> scoops

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
about 50 grams of protein per two scoops

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.050 
about 50 grams of protein per two scoops
it's<00:04:48.990> isopure<00:04:49.740> so<00:04:50.310> if<00:04:50.580> you're<00:04:50.700> lactose

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
it's isopure so if you're lactose

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.970 
it's isopure so if you're lactose
intolerant<00:04:51.330> this<00:04:52.050> is<00:04:52.230> the<00:04:52.320> good<00:04:52.440> stuff<00:04:52.500> I'm

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
intolerant this is the good stuff I'm

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.680 
intolerant this is the good stuff I'm
not<00:04:53.250> lactose<00:04:53.580> intolerant<00:04:54.090> I<00:04:54.150> just<00:04:54.420> happen<00:04:54.660> to

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
not lactose intolerant I just happen to

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.060 
not lactose intolerant I just happen to
think<00:04:54.870> this<00:04:55.020> is<00:04:55.170> a<00:04:55.200> great<00:04:55.410> bang<00:04:55.680> for<00:04:55.710> your<00:04:56.010> buck

now<00:04:56.820> 50<00:04:57.300> it's<00:04:57.420> a<00:04:57.480> little<00:04:57.660> words<00:04:57.840> then<00:04:58.080> said<00:04:58.350> but

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
now 50 it's a little words then said but

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.910 
now 50 it's a little words then said but
here's<00:04:58.950> the<00:04:59.010> catch<00:04:59.280> you<00:04:59.940> get<00:05:00.180> 50<00:05:01.050> grams<00:05:01.410> per

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
here's the catch you get 50 grams per

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.190 
here's the catch you get 50 grams per
two<00:05:02.130> scoops<00:05:02.460> whereas<00:05:02.850> more<00:05:03.120> believe<00:05:03.420> the

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
two scoops whereas more believe the

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.580 
two scoops whereas more believe the
standard<00:05:04.800> tends<00:05:05.040> to<00:05:05.220> be<00:05:05.450> four<00:05:06.450> scoops<00:05:06.900> for<00:05:07.230> 50

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
standard tends to be four scoops for 50

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.770 
standard tends to be four scoops for 50
