00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.060
 Halo has 10 professionals in 10 and that's such a video on that one 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.770
 actually not prepared at all 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.889
 I've been idle and have 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.379
 No the news pissed so that messed up e-mail center at the eleventh 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.709
 our moments saw it all 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.060
 under this then only so much love 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.159
 Steve Jobs death 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:22.800
 but not yet reasonable Viersen - here joker 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.119
 and but with him a clutch despots official statement and there 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.489
 I already knew that 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:29.579
 bullshit 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.419
 what to trust London 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.300
 Kate too, of course 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.520
 This is how the app in the Robert Schumann House sees the homepage 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.540
 and so it has to be on top 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.540
 as can be seen on the biography 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.010
 19 5 50 pence 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.010
 2000 11 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.410
 that is now 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.510
 his last year has been parquet floors 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.090
 and also change in my life 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.090
 we can click on it art to look exactly 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.360
 so 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.680
 around 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.680
 it is his duty to hear him again 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.290
 Recognition for what we have done for Apple 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.450
 and that are all very sad and that he is definitely his spirit at 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.650
 is operated 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.750
 hopefully 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.500
 I have not even arrived at the stock I do not trust me 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.010
 Bader Barbara um 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.240
 I think they fell well too 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.570
 Steve Jobs 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.080
 now finally gone 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.590
 not even as a consultant to involve that is 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.590
 definitely pretty tough APA 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.470
 um bandleader 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.020
 for sympathy wishes or and something 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.300
 Wolter could do that, too, boy does Apple have one 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.320
 email address set up 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.320
 Wittmann low stief double come 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.110
 and similarly could comment in the comments whether action 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.100
 how he thinks that is a bit sad for us 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.049
 have that now 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.030
 through our hobby because he pursues less intense and 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.939
 it is a pity 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.529
 but it is probably the best for him 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:24.989
 When you see him, Brunner realized that he wants to score points in the market 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.760
 in the end m two people the son only suffers sets 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:33.689
 the most beautiful death too 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.689
 but the best option 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:40.609
 that is a different video and 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.609
 I hope so 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.769
 Vettel sometimes beat a bit of water 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.739
 until then, of course, I have to be professionals and use show
