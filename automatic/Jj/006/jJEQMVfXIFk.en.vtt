little<00:02:08.160> area<00:02:08.429> right<00:02:08.640> there<00:02:08.819> would<00:02:09.300> be

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
little area right there would be

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.130 
little area right there would be
unlocked<00:02:09.989> they<00:02:10.319> do<00:02:10.379> warn<00:02:10.709> that

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
there so sometimes it works great other

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.630 
there so sometimes it works great other
times<00:02:17.230> it<00:02:17.410> doesn't<00:02:17.650> trust<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.220> devices

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
times it doesn't trust the devices

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.360
