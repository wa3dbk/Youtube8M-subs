00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:04.600
 breakfast and the most important meal of the day 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.640
 what is the ideal breakfast it is especially when doing the 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.349
 sport 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:09.139
 olivia 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.139
 show it the good reflexes to adopt 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.619
 then the breakfast is really not the moment super important of the 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:21.349
 newspaper 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.270
 to actually reload a dinner when italy 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.649
 and minerals especially among athletes who needed it 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:32.279
 quite important the mistake would be to botch this moment of the soil I do not have the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.630
 time it does not matter 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.530
 I'm taking a little peach cake go to 'buy' 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.070
 or at the bakery a cubic capacity 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.070
 it's really not suitable 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.100
 and especially when we play sports 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.980
 for a really good breakfast 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.950
 we're going to have a sustainable energy source in quotation marks 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.930
 who can be 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.900
 with wholegrain cereals like messiah for example oatmeal 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.900
 we could use buckwheat pancakes 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.410
 slices of wholemeal bread 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.880
 in addition to that we will complete with fruits a series of frustrations 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.730
 to have a source of vitamins 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.870
 of minerals and fibers 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.920
 we could use also possibly the place if sometimes a 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.860
 little more fresh dried fruits 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.860
 like the dried apricots the grapes the bananas if the banks 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.790
 what is interesting is to supplement also with what is called 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.510
 the sectoral crisis china 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.240
 that's all that has a mandate - 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.610
 1-7 however last August 6 point there what interests us is the 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.570
 good fats 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.910
 Omega-3 and Omega-6 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.000
 magnesium very important 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.570
 for sport and family life 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.460
 breakfast is a moment as important as the prince was a 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.750
 source of protein 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.250
 especially if we are rather salty and it could be 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.430
 ham of strangeness blandin 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.570
 eggs 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.610
 or in a sweeter version 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.060
 in dairy products like cottage cheese I have so much protein 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.180
 or version here 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.210
 can we tolerate well for possibly the versions 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.210
 falcon jets is under the spell where member states 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.519
 so here we will prepare balanced breakfasts 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:11.930
 a version 2 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.419
 white cheese 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:16.629
 muscled with fries banana clp 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.779
 some quarters of oran and a hot drink in the classification c 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:22.499
 first version breakfast 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:24.519
 the second a little more salty 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.769
 with buckwheat pancake slices of white ham 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.179
 The kiwi 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:35.159
 we also made red berries and a coffee 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.610
 so here are two examples of balanced breakfast of course 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.260
 which are interesting if you have less than an hour and a half or two 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.379
 hours between them the moment of breakfast and the beginning of 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:46.399
 training 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.819
 this is compared to digestion now if we train very early 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:50.739
 the morning 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.189
 to go to see it would be to leave anyway fully dependent we have 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:54.819
 need 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.599
 a little energy 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.900
 what can be interesting is things that neither knows nor easily manages to 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.159
 carpentras world 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.669
 energy we can use fresh this expensive like here apricots death in 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:09.799
 league europa the cuttlefish the compote too it's not smart 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.229
 it's very digestible 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:14.519
 There are others who will be well tolerated before the training 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.629
 before training the mom 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.099
 so what we can remember is that breakfast is really a moment 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.129
 that his 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:24.879
 whether you are sporty or not 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.609
 there what will change also it is maybe that the quantities which one goes 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.059
 adapt according to our defense 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:33.790
 so I hope it will have made you want to evolve a little earlier 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:35.339
 to prepare a good breakfast
