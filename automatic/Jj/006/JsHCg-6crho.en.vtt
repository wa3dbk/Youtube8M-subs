00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.399 
guess at what kind of flat ride we are
beginning<00:04:59.389> honestly<00:05:00.389> I'm<00:05:00.509> not<00:05:00.599> to<00:05:00.900> burst<00:05:01.169> with

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.409 
beginning honestly I'm not to burst with

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:04.760 
beginning honestly I'm not to burst with
that<00:05:01.740> I<00:05:02.009> I<00:05:02.389> mean<00:05:03.389> have<00:05:03.539> carnivals<00:05:04.169> and<00:05:04.349> theme

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
that I I mean have carnivals and theme

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.129 
that I I mean have carnivals and theme
parks<00:05:05.150> it's<00:05:06.150> hard<00:05:06.330> to<00:05:06.389> keep<00:05:06.630> up<00:05:06.810> with<00:05:06.870> that

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
parks it's hard to keep up with that

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.850 
parks it's hard to keep up with that
kind<00:05:07.349> of<00:05:07.470> stuff<00:05:08.060> but<00:05:09.060> with<00:05:09.810> coasters<00:05:10.440> it's<00:05:10.680> a

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
kind of stuff but with coasters it's a

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.749 
kind of stuff but with coasters it's a
little<00:05:11.130> bit<00:05:11.280> easier<00:05:11.430> and<00:05:11.970> if<00:05:13.370> if<00:05:14.370> what<00:05:14.639> I'm

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
little bit easier and if if what I'm

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.700 
little bit easier and if if what I'm
thinking<00:05:15.150> is<00:05:15.300> correct<00:05:15.569> I'm<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.500> calmest

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
thinking is correct I'm the calmest

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.939 
thinking is correct I'm the calmest
stingray<00:05:17.750> 103<00:05:18.750> feet<00:05:19.020> it's<00:05:19.289> one<00:05:19.650> foot

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
stingray 103 feet it's one foot

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:27.560 
stingray 103 feet it's one foot
difference<00:05:20.159> but<00:05:21.120> it<00:05:22.729> comes<00:05:23.729> very<00:05:24.000> close<00:05:25.729> so<00:05:26.729> as

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
difference but it comes very close so as

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.230 
difference but it comes very close so as
of<00:05:27.840> today<00:05:27.900> January<00:05:28.830> 10<00:05:29.039> 2013<00:05:29.849> that's<00:05:30.060> my

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
of today January 10 2013 that's my

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.689 
of today January 10 2013 that's my
prediction<00:05:30.479> right<00:05:31.320> now<00:05:31.500> is<00:05:31.770> a<00:05:32.310> become

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
prediction right now is a become

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.510 
prediction right now is a become
stingray<00:05:33.320> whether<00:05:34.320> or<00:05:34.409> not<00:05:34.560> it's<00:05:34.830> a<00:05:35.009> one<00:05:35.250> foot

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
stingray whether or not it's a one foot

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.909 
stingray whether or not it's a one foot
difference<00:05:35.699> or<00:05:36.090> not<00:05:36.169> who<00:05:37.169> knows<00:05:37.199> they<00:05:37.680> may<00:05:37.860> be

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
difference or not who knows they may be

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:39.890 
difference or not who knows they may be
making<00:05:38.250> a<00:05:38.490> different<00:05:38.880> kind<00:05:39.090> of<00:05:39.150> model<00:05:39.509> it<00:05:39.659> may

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
making a different kind of model it may

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.379 
making a different kind of model it may
be<00:05:39.960> a<00:05:40.110> clone<00:05:40.530> of<00:05:40.770> the<00:05:41.280> one<00:05:41.430> in<00:05:41.550> South<00:05:41.820> in<00:05:42.090> China

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
be a clone of the one in South in China

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.980 
be a clone of the one in South in China
but<00:05:42.780> who<00:05:43.050> knows<00:05:43.639> either<00:05:44.639> way<00:05:45.000> it's<00:05:45.569> gonna<00:05:45.750> be<00:05:45.900> a

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
but who knows either way it's gonna be a

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.490 
but who knows either way it's gonna be a
great<00:05:46.319> hopefully<00:05:47.250> I<00:05:47.789> mean<00:05:48.719> there<00:05:49.169> will<00:05:49.289> be<00:05:49.469> a

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
great hopefully I mean there will be a

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.830 
great hopefully I mean there will be a
great<00:05:49.770> addition<00:05:50.099> the<00:05:50.400> only<00:05:50.610> problem<00:05:51.060> is<00:05:51.180> this

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
great addition the only problem is this

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.529 
great addition the only problem is this
coaster<00:05:52.380> has<00:05:52.860> one<00:05:53.250> train<00:05:53.610> there's<00:05:54.060> only<00:05:54.240> eight

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
coaster has one train there's only eight

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:59.870 
coaster has one train there's only eight
eight<00:05:55.110> seats<00:05:55.710> per<00:05:56.219> train<00:05:56.750> so<00:05:58.159> it<00:05:59.159> would<00:05:59.430> be<00:05:59.580> a

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
eight seats per train so it would be a

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.779 
eight seats per train so it would be a
capacity<00:06:00.780> nightmare<00:06:01.409> to<00:06:01.889> say<00:06:02.069> a<00:06:02.099> lease<00:06:02.400> it

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
capacity nightmare to say a lease it

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:05.480 
capacity nightmare to say a lease it
maybe<00:06:03.240> if<00:06:03.419> they<00:06:03.569> had<00:06:03.719> two<00:06:03.930> trains<00:06:04.259> on<00:06:04.500> it<00:06:04.680> it

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
maybe if they had two trains on it it

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.950 
maybe if they had two trains on it it
could<00:06:05.729> work<00:06:05.940> but<00:06:06.919> as<00:06:07.919> it<00:06:08.310> stands<00:06:08.580> right<00:06:08.699> now

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
could work but as it stands right now

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.339 
could work but as it stands right now
capacity<00:06:09.960> nightmare<00:06:10.440> long<00:06:11.009> lines<00:06:11.990> it'd<00:06:12.990> be<00:06:13.319> a

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:13.349 
capacity nightmare long lines it'd be a

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:15.469 
capacity nightmare long lines it'd be a
headache<00:06:13.530> and<00:06:13.800> knowing<00:06:14.490> it's<00:06:14.639> in<00:06:14.789> the<00:06:14.880> coma<00:06:15.120> it

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
headache and knowing it's in the coma it

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.749 
headache and knowing it's in the coma it
will<00:06:15.900> probably<00:06:16.349> have<00:06:16.680> some<00:06:17.130> its<00:06:17.520> share<00:06:17.729> of

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 
will probably have some its share of

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:21.170 
will probably have some its share of
downtime<00:06:18.270> as<00:06:18.569> I've<00:06:19.229> heard<00:06:19.500> that<00:06:20.069> the<00:06:20.370> Stingray

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
downtime as I've heard that the Stingray

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.930 
downtime as I've heard that the Stingray
