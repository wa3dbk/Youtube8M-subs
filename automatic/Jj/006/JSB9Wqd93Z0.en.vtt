 musicians like art people are 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.290
 subjects of new phenomena 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.860
 and also in art lies an important one 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.360
 mission interrupts spiritual 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.180

 nice great honor wonderful 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.420
 hall good acoustics us program 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.890
 so selected so that we 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.210
 not only played 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.700
 new law but certain 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.920
 directions 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.189
 but rather it is the music that carries 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.270
 two of which 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.869
 and it helps people through the classic 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:50.840
 music touch 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.450
 nice to hear now 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.600
 we have astronauts 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.650
 clarinet 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.420
 and so when we played historically 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.440
 writing 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.000
 we need it and khatainskom this for 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.650
 our composition but in this way 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.610
 it turns out 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.200
 daughter if some new sound 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.580
 historically considered and when we play bach 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.959
 spruce 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.959
 to other composers in earlier loaves 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:15.299
 but this is presented only 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.379
 how our sounding this music sounds 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:17.969
 new 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:19.399
 because the student is relatively 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:22.719
 modern here and so may 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.099
 we bring some of our own 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.099
 its contribution to the fund in the heritage 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.359
 did not have 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.109
 R 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.289
 at 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:52.519
 percent 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.519
 process for quite some time 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.179
 free line of talent gives 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:06.859
 wisdom in use with 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.949
 Sergey and Slovaks at today's concert 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:11.649
 musicians replaced by desire in the spirit 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:14.399
 worship and this is the real times 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:15.070
 countries 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.980
 such a mechanism that composers write 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.859
 music at least give the bay will 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.499
 but what he does not see feels and 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:23.519
 offer cis 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.319
 these days does not depend on wisdom 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.239
 our task is to remember 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.799
 in these waters read about what 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.659
 mister was a composer 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.149

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:38.359
 newspaper times the sun 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.259
 only god can open 

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:42.299
 because the cause of the kill 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.930
 music is the greatest good unknown 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.439
 mortal only 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.269
 echo heaven on earth 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.959
