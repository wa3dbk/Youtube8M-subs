00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.889
 good morning this is going to be the third 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.770
 video in spanish I'm going to put the 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:09.140
 Saturday on YouTube but now it's Friday 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.570
 the night about six in the afternoon I go to 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:15.710
 go to put something and I will explain a 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.920
 little of my diet that I already put as I earn 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.110
 like 15 pounds in a month after me 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.570
 competition then what I want to do 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.830
 is in the next four weeks to come down 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.490
 like five pounds of body fat 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:32.060
 then I will start to eat more or 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:36.829
 minus 250 grams of protein 80 grams 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:39.079
 of fat and less than 100 grams of 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.450
 carbohydrates every day then we go to 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.870
 eat something medium light but I'm going to 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.870
 help let's go 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.960
 ah 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.370
 good morning and let's start this work 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.200
 when it was chest and abs I started with the 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.980
 machine closing arms like this 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.440
 working the chest is less muscles 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.709
 they work but you can focus more 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.450
 in the exact chest then I did more 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.060
 or less I will write the kilos here 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.459
 but more or less 35 kilos something like that for 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.550
 five sets of 20 reps is 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.860
 quite and it does not weigh much but I made myself a 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.070
 little of common train give me and here a 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.110
 little then I'm trying to still 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.170
 working the breast without doing cancer is 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.590
 because that's what I did, I do not know a bit but 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.840
 it's better and I'm going to start 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.080
 those movements like on their faces and 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.690
 things like that later but now this is 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.870
 running is not enough weight again 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.540
 but it's something I can do without doing 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.840
 hurt more here and I want this to heal 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.170
 quite completely afterwards in that 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.629
 link shopping how are we like this 56 other 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.560
 time enough repetitions not enough 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:25.299
 weight but I do not recommend it so many 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.069
 repetitions and sets but if they want it 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.260
 try I love how it feels to feel 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.200
 my chest and my elbows do not hurt 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.610
 shoulders nothing hurts the bones just what 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.690
 I feel in the muscles then what 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.920
 I planted is very good after 56 after 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.790
 jobs 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.110
 12 to 15 depends on whether it takes like 30 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.290
 seconds of rest 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.510
 or one minute but more or less 12 to 15 that 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.790
 is training almost a movement of 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.590
 23 but with less weight and more balance 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.680
 then it 's a little easier and I 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.260
 hurts and then through the end 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.900
 it's a little doing guanches with the 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.490
 cable so I love that if you see how 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.410
 my back 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.360
 it gets like a curve and then I 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.830
 I put it in front you can see that I'm 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.740
 activating the abs you do not want 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.410
 throw yourself like that in front you want to focus 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.169
 which the back is made like that then 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.910
 after that, lifting the legs 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.829
 the gray light that works in the part 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.650
 more work from the authorities the 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.350
 morgan and that I like quite a lot even with 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.870
 control and do what you can for me 2 is 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.490
 pretty if I start doing it fast 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.440
 I can do more but I like to do it 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.690
 controlled and just focus on the 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.270
 muscles of the authors and not use 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.790
 legs 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.160
 and that was all for sit-ups not much 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.620
 but later I wanted to work the chest a 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.840
 little more then I put in the machine 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.860
 to do all 10 so they're watching 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.290
 now and I put in the machine like 212 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.050
 plates in the middle of the weight machine and 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.169
 that then helps you with pizzas in those 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.669
 that and it lifts you up a bit then 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.219
 it makes it easier because 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.289
 through the chest enough but that's 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:07.659
 how am I training the chest with a 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:10.749
 little about 30 here because I do not want 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:12.819
 start with enough weight in the pÃ©rez 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:16.889
 because it has been in cell and again but 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:16.889
 that was video and we're going to eat something 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:58.420
 in the change after working the weight 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:01.460
 to a favorite 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.509
 to almost what I did 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.509
 I think he is dying 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.160
 Y
