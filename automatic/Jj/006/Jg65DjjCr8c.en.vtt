00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.080
 customize features now 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.210
 The more I drew the attention you made or 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.430
 upgrade to the preview version that does not 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.930
 it is still official this division of 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.420
 volume that I have now touch the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.220
 notifications and volume for media and 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.840
 applications efforts and fought quite 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.300
 because whenever I watched a video 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.070
 and for example the sound of the video was very 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.200
 high and had to lower the volume is 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.120
 receiving the so-called volume was low and 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.890
 not executed then is this is a resource 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.070
 that annoying enough 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.620
 in the old windows phone 8 now the 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.600
 recent windows phone 8.1 release the 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.760
 preview version and made it easier 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.430
 enough to receive calls and 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.260
 We watched 101 videos at work the other 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.660
 we also have a keyboard with floor you 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.110
 here and already show you a new 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.410
 internet explorer 11 here changed here 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.230
 the one for me to load also has a menu 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.580
 that of tabs and by new soft keyboard us 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:12.120
 October 3 youtube pronto wrote in 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.590
 suggest a point with slash now we have the 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.900
 feature of the data sensor by accessing 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.770
 settings on a 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.890
 data 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.020
 you can have limit to use the network 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.370
 your smartphone from the internet 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.420
 example you can select here a 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:31.200
 monthly consumption of 500 denied 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:35.970
 You'll select the day of the month, right? 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.220
 john start count ok then chose 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.430
 the day that will reward you with monthly 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.900
 500 mega in the unit as averages and 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.760
 bought it 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.310
 ready now I have 500 black when 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.280
 reach its limit and will deactivate in 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.240
 mobile data network on my smartphone is 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.280
 This I understood 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.990
 on this screen here but may be different 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.260
 so I'm going to turn this limit off now 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.820
 we have the new windows phone store 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.980
 right away you already see the difference 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.830
 in the presentation of the applications in 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.980
 is already different, we have here a 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.200
 more intuitive menu let us say with 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.640
 more apps on testing this will 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.790
 facilitate you find the 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.769
 useful application for you has been added 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.870
 bpn which is a very private virtual network 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.479
 interesting for companies in this new 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.389
 update has changed the options for cane 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.729
 button to take picture mode. 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.699
 and also the continuous shooting mode 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.590
 record video here you can not customize 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.889
 these shortcuts that stay up here 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.590
 accessing options and pressing these 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.900
 here I can put pictures of the 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.720
 camera in that corner over there so this 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.819
 gives you more freedom between the 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.940
 camera accessing now 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:52.360
 battery in settings by dragging here 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:55.240
 to the side in use you see you realize 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.159
 the applications that spend the most battery 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.770
 your smartphone, such as the 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:01.479
 my case here is internet explorer is the 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.419
 facebook are the first two that most 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.440
 consumes the battery power of my 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.240
 smartphone 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.099
 this is also a very long-awaited feature 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.530
 it is not that android already have this option 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:13.360
 which already shows the most 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.169
 consumes the battery and now it 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.159
 windows phone 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:20.919
 8.1 also now andrade has changed 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:22.750
 Once upon a time it was another crash voice and 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.650
 out for you have a sense of how 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.539
 is the application 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.460
 ready now the games appears in the menu 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.949
 applications and left a lot of 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.509
 easier to access the most 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.520
 Preferred by the galley 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:39.219
 the email application has been updated 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:42.490
 but it did not have great improvements like this 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:45.099
 you notice a small difference in it 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.779
 the calendar has been updated there have been many 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:47.800
 criticisms not with that old 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:50.610
 calendar 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.710
 I'll open it just for you to see what it's like. 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.990
 ready this is a new calendar 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.569
 good at first are these resources in the 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.310
 version preview and if you liked video 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:03.400

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.830
 here in the middle of my hand to you 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.800
 subscribe to a channel 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.560
 I'm here I'll buy a doubt for 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.060
 record more focus because I believe 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.580
 It will get a bit foggy. 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.380
 the letters but if you did not bother until 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.680
 This end of the video you sang with me 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.139

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.599
