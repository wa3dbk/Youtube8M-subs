00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
that's universal for both the classic

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.380 
that's universal for both the classic
cases<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.440> low<00:00:37.590> energy<00:00:38.010> or<00:00:38.219> just<00:00:39.180> what<00:00:39.300> the

cases of low energy or just what the

in the proper nutrition that's the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.350 
in the proper nutrition that's the
obvious<00:00:42.870> one<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:44.040> they're<00:00:44.280> deficient<00:00:44.640> even<00:00:45.270> if

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
obvious one if they're deficient even if

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.670 
obvious one if they're deficient even if
they're<00:00:45.510> eating<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.899> right<00:00:46.050> foods<00:00:46.320> but<00:00:46.500> their

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
they're eating the right foods but their

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.799 
they're eating the right foods but their
demands<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.250> their<00:00:47.370> life<00:00:47.610> or<00:00:48.000> excessive<00:00:48.690> then

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
demands of their life or excessive then

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:49.880 
demands of their life or excessive then
they'll<00:00:48.960> be<00:00:49.050> deficient<00:00:49.410> maybe<00:00:49.710> they're<00:00:49.800> not

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
they'll be deficient maybe they're not

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.020 
they'll be deficient maybe they're not
taking<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.190> right<00:00:50.309> kind<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.489> supplementation

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
taking the right kind of supplementation

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.170 
taking the right kind of supplementation
that's<00:00:51.390> serving<00:00:52.140> into<00:00:52.320> them<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.890> any

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
that's serving into them so any

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.299 
that's serving into them so any
deficiencies<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.210> nutrient<00:00:54.989> wise<00:00:55.379> whether

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
deficiencies of nutrient wise whether

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.950 
deficiencies of nutrient wise whether
again<00:00:56.579> they're<00:00:57.210> not<00:00:57.239> getting<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.750> from<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
again they're not getting it from the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.540 
again they're not getting it from the
diet<00:00:58.170> or<00:00:58.440> they're<00:00:58.800> getting<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.129> from<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.340> diet

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
diet or they're getting it from the diet

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.209 
diet or they're getting it from the diet
but<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.059> demands<00:01:00.600> are<00:01:00.840> causing<00:01:01.350> too<00:01:01.890> much<00:01:02.070> to

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
but the demands are causing too much to

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.709 
but the demands are causing too much to
be<00:01:02.309> taken<00:01:02.609> from<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.000> they're<00:01:03.090> not<00:01:03.180> getting<00:01:03.329> a

be taken from and they're not getting a
nutrient<00:01:04.379> or<00:01:04.530> neutral<00:01:05.430> vitamin<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.659> offset

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.560 
nutrient or neutral vitamin to offset
that<00:01:07.380> you'll<00:01:07.920> be<00:01:08.159> deficient<00:01:08.490> you'll<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:09.240> low

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
that you'll be deficient you'll have low

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.179 
that you'll be deficient you'll have low
energy<00:01:09.689> if<00:01:10.409> you're<00:01:10.650> eating<00:01:10.710> certain<00:01:11.040> foods

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
energy if you're eating certain foods

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.070 
energy if you're eating certain foods
that<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:11.850> be<00:01:12.030> allergic<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.840> lot<00:01:13.049> of

that you can be allergic to a lot of

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.620 
that you can be allergic to a lot of
food<00:01:13.350> allergies<00:01:13.470> like<00:01:13.920> dairy<00:01:14.250> wheat<00:01:15.000> eggs

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
food allergies like dairy wheat eggs

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.420 
food allergies like dairy wheat eggs
they<00:01:16.380> won't<00:01:16.560> give<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.860> runny<00:01:17.250> egg

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
they won't give you that runny egg

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.490 
they won't give you that runny egg
running<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> favorite<00:01:18.869> type<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.170> allergy

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
running on a favorite type of allergy

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.560 
running on a favorite type of allergy
but<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.280> cause<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.729> delayed<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
but the cause of delayed in the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.170 
but the cause of delayed in the
interaction<00:01:22.080> which<00:01:22.490> expands<00:01:23.490> energy<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.970> try

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
interaction which expands energy to try

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.480 
interaction which expands energy to try
to<00:01:24.210> action<00:01:24.540> though<00:01:24.960> afterwards<00:01:25.470> food<00:01:26.189> becomes

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
to action though afterwards food becomes

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.030 
to action though afterwards food becomes
an<00:01:26.610> enemy<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.229> that's<00:01:28.229> takes<00:01:28.710> up<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.890> lot<00:01:29.009> of

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
an enemy and that's takes up a lot of

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.340 
an enemy and that's takes up a lot of
energy<00:01:29.180> low<00:01:30.180> thyroid<00:01:30.540> now<00:01:30.900> moving<00:01:31.229> into

energy low thyroid now moving into

females<00:01:31.799> iron<00:01:32.460> low<00:01:32.880> iron<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.479> then<00:01:34.079> also

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
females iron low iron and then also

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.800 
females iron low iron and then also
something<00:01:34.680> called<00:01:34.829> adrenal<00:01:35.579> function<00:01:35.759> -<00:01:36.570> many

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
something called adrenal function - many

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.999 
something called adrenal function - many
of<00:01:36.869> us<00:01:37.079> are<00:01:37.200> taking<00:01:37.290> too<00:01:37.560> many<00:01:37.650> cups<00:01:37.890> of

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
of us are taking too many cups of

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.130 
of us are taking too many cups of
coffees<00:01:38.369> too<00:01:38.610> many<00:01:38.759> pops<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.270> make<00:01:39.420> sure<00:01:39.689> and

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
coffees too many pops to make sure and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.319 
coffees too many pops to make sure and
it's<00:01:40.500> over<00:01:40.920> stimulating<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.640> hormone<00:01:42.030> system

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
it's over stimulating a hormone system

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.700 
it's over stimulating a hormone system
called<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> adrenal<00:01:42.810> system<00:01:43.170> which<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.590> our

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
called the adrenal system which is our

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.950 
called the adrenal system which is our
stress<00:01:43.950> system<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.640> eventually<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.689> starts

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
stress system and eventually it starts

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.109 
stress system and eventually it starts
crashing<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.130> don't<00:01:47.280> sleep<00:01:47.549> well<00:01:47.880> we

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
crashing and we don't sleep well we

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.670 
crashing and we don't sleep well we

RINO's<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.440> number<00:01:52.650> one<00:01:52.800> organ<00:01:53.130> system

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
RINO's so the number one organ system

that's related to low energy is the

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.690 
that's related to low energy is the
adrenals<00:01:55.410> but<00:01:56.010> the<00:01:56.130> adrenals<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:56.610> be
