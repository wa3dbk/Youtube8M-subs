Hey everyone a huge welcome to Steve's Kitchen.
Now in the live show the other day when we

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.350
were doing the peanut butter Fluffernutter
I was running out of the fluff and I promised

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.510
everybody I would show you how to make it.
It's very simple not everybody can buy this

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.820
all you're going to need is a couple of eggs
a little bit of sugar some patience. This

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.400
is a very easy recipe come on let me show
you how.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.029
Now we will start by making an sugar syrup.
Down here I am going to put half a cup of

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.350
just regular white sugar into a bowl and 1/4
of a cup of water you will want a thermometer

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.690
for this. Let's take this now over to the
stove. So we are just going to pop this on

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.059
a medium heat on the stove and we're going
to bring this sugar and water up to a little

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.469
rolling boil and we want to get it to 120C
thats 240F you don't need to stir it. You

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.729
will need a candy thermometer of some sort
and wait till it gets to that soft ball temperature.

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:01.469
Now whilst the sugar comes up to temperature
I just want to take two eggs and we're going

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.280
to separate the whites out into a bowl. I
don't want the yolks and keep those egg yolks

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.790
you might want to use them for an omelette
or something later on. Now we are going to

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.790
want a hand whisk like this and start to whisk
these until the are soft peaks, not too much.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.390
So you see what I'm looking for there they
are still a little translucency in the egg

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.800
whites and thats good enough now we're going
to get over and get our syrup up to temperature.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.070
Now the sugars are boiling away in there and
we are looking for that 120C 240F you do need

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.300
a thermometer a candy thermometer a digital
thermometer when it comes to temperature we're

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.390
going to take that off the boil. Now look
in there the syrup is molten and that is soft

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.390
ball as I said the temperature should be 115
I think I might have said 120 115C thats 240F

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.390
now before we go in here just start to lightly
mix on a low speed mix those eggs up Now we

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.100
are going to add this syrup in very slowly
to start with just to temper the eggs so nice

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.100
and slow add about a tablespoon teaspoon in
there start to bring it into the egg whites

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:20.790
little bit more and we started to temper those
egg whites now so we're going to start adding

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:29.940
a little bit quicker and speeding up our mixer.
So we'll put the last of the sugars in there

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.900
now and we're just going to continue mix this
up on a fast speed until it's cooled down

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.320
a little bit. That is what we are looking
for lovely stiff meringues like that and you

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.560
can see if I turn that upside down I could
keep that upside down for ever That is Fluff

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.650
Now you can store this you can pop it back
in your fluff jar and store it I've not really

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.810
stored it for a long time maybe a week or
so just keep an eye on it With all the sugars

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.189
in there it should last sometime but get and
enjoy it Thats how to make fluff at home I

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:07.560
hope you've enjoyed it Be good I'll see you
next time Take care.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.650
Now look at those pretty pretty little peaks
there don't they look great I might use those

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.430
as a photograph for this particular video

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.359
