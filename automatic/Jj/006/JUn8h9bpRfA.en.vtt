in<00:00:44.410> a<00:00:44.470> second<00:00:44.740> it<00:00:44.800> actually<00:00:45.100> hits<00:00:45.310> an<00:00:45.520> object

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
in a second it actually hits an object

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.490 
in a second it actually hits an object
that's<00:00:46.300> when<00:00:46.480> we<00:00:46.630> turn<00:00:46.810> into<00:00:47.020> the<00:00:47.140> physics

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
that's when we turn into the physics

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.170 
that's when we turn into the physics
object<00:00:47.860> so<00:00:48.010> that<00:00:48.040> since<00:00:48.610> it's<00:00:48.730> such<00:00:48.850> a<00:00:48.880> it's

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
object so that since it's such a it's

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.480 
object so that since it's such a it's
going<00:00:49.300> to<00:00:49.420> be<00:00:49.510> such<00:00:49.690> an<00:00:49.810> abrupt<00:00:50.170> change<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:51.430> a

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.490 
going to be such an abrupt change it's a

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.050 
going to be such an abrupt change it's a
great<00:00:51.700> place<00:00:51.880> to<00:00:52.090> do<00:00:52.210> the<00:00:52.329> little

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
great place to do the little

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.260 
great place to do the little
and<00:00:53.210> you<00:00:53.540> don't<00:00:53.720> notice<00:00:53.900> it<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:54.290> much<00:00:54.440> we<00:00:54.920> have

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
and you don't notice it so much we have

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.170 
and you don't notice it so much we have
keyframe<00:00:56.270> animation<00:00:57.080> so<00:00:57.410> our<00:00:57.800> animators<00:00:58.490> hand

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
keyframe animation so our animators hand

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.240 
keyframe animation so our animators hand
and<00:00:59.420> animate<00:00:59.750> everything<00:01:00.260> one<00:01:00.950> of<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:01.100> things

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
and animate everything one of the things

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.680 
and animate everything one of the things
that<00:01:01.310> keyframe<00:01:01.700> animation<00:01:02.270> gives<00:01:02.450> us<00:01:02.570> as

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
that keyframe animation gives us as

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.299 
that keyframe animation gives us as

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
controlling the Hulk we can animate to

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.510 
controlling the Hulk we can animate to
the<00:01:09.170> feel<00:01:09.410> of<00:01:09.440> the<00:01:09.650> controller<00:01:10.010> and<00:01:10.250> make<00:01:10.400> sure

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
the feel of the controller and make sure

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.330 
the feel of the controller and make sure
that<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.790> feel<00:01:11.000> is<00:01:11.180> really<00:01:11.450> good<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.320> a<00:01:12.740> guy<00:01:13.250> in

the<00:01:52.700> artists<00:01:53.240> more<00:01:53.509> power<00:01:53.780> when<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.200> came<00:01:54.440> to

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
the artists more power when it came to

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.740 
the artists more power when it came to
creating<00:01:54.920> their<00:01:55.070> characters<00:01:55.600> one<00:01:56.600> of<00:01:56.660> the

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
creating their characters one of the

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.120 
creating their characters one of the
biggest<00:01:56.900> benefits<00:01:57.410> that<00:01:57.560> we<00:01:57.649> get<00:01:57.830> and<00:01:58.039> the

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
biggest benefits that we get and the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.770 
biggest benefits that we get and the
next<00:01:58.310> gen<00:01:58.460> technology<00:01:58.640> is<00:01:59.210> normal<00:01:59.570> mapping

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
next gen technology is normal mapping

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.020 
next gen technology is normal mapping
and<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:00.500> gives<00:02:00.710> us<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:01.009> ability<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.610> show<00:02:01.820> the

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
and it gives us the ability to show the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.850 
and it gives us the ability to show the
muscles<00:02:02.420> when<00:02:03.140> i<00:02:03.170> first<00:02:03.410> started<00:02:03.590> building

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
muscles when i first started building

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.770 
muscles when i first started building
the<00:02:03.950> rig<00:02:04.130> on<00:02:04.280> this<00:02:04.429> character<00:02:04.700> one<00:02:05.660> of<00:02:05.720> the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
the rig on this character one of the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.690 
the rig on this character one of the
things<00:02:05.840> we<00:02:06.050> wanted<00:02:06.289> to<00:02:06.350> add<00:02:06.560> is<00:02:06.830> since<00:02:07.340> he's<00:02:07.460> so

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
things we wanted to add is since he's so

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.340 
things we wanted to add is since he's so
big<00:02:08.000> it's<00:02:08.240> got<00:02:08.300> all<00:02:08.479> these<00:02:08.569> huge<00:02:08.840> muscles<00:02:09.259> who

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
big it's got all these huge muscles who

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.809 
big it's got all these huge muscles who
wanted<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:09.619> make<00:02:09.770> sure<00:02:09.830> that<00:02:09.979> all<00:02:10.429> those

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
wanted to make sure that all those

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.120 
wanted to make sure that all those
things<00:02:11.000> look<00:02:11.180> really<00:02:11.390> realistic<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.290> so<00:02:12.770> we

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
things look really realistic and so we

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.070 
things look really realistic and so we
not<00:02:13.940> only<00:02:14.000> are<00:02:14.240> we<00:02:14.270> able<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.510> stretch<00:02:14.840> the

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
not only are we able to stretch the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.390 
not only are we able to stretch the
limbs<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.440> everything<00:02:15.740> but<00:02:15.860> we're<00:02:16.040> also<00:02:16.130> able

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
limbs and everything but we're also able

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.130 
limbs and everything but we're also able
to<00:02:16.550> animate<00:02:16.850> all<00:02:17.060> those<00:02:17.210> muscles<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:17.990> make

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
to animate all those muscles and make

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.140 
to animate all those muscles and make
them<00:02:18.290> shake<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.830> make<00:02:18.950> them<00:02:19.100> flex<00:02:19.460> and<00:02:19.970> you'll

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
them shake and make them flex and you'll

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.500 
them shake and make them flex and you'll
see<00:02:20.300> that<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.690> come<00:02:20.870> through

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
see that and come through

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.270 
see that and come through
and<00:02:21.780> how<00:02:21.930> realistic<00:02:22.409> is<00:02:22.709> flesh<00:02:22.980> really

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
and how realistic is flesh really

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.710 
and how realistic is flesh really
Lexington's<00:02:23.790> animated<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.569> actually

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
Lexington's animated and it actually

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.259 
Lexington's animated and it actually
lights<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:25.739> deal<00:02:25.980> as<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:26.730> white<00:02:26.879> hits<00:02:27.120> if

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
lights and so deal as the white hits if

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.059 
lights and so deal as the white hits if
you<00:02:27.299> actually<00:02:27.540> see<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.500> lighting<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:28.980> the

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
you actually see the lighting in the

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.729 
you actually see the lighting in the
shadowing<00:02:29.519> roll<00:02:30.420> over<00:02:30.750> those<00:02:30.870> muscles<00:02:31.349> we

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
shadowing roll over those muscles we

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:32.920 
shadowing roll over those muscles we
never<00:02:31.890> used<00:02:32.099> to<00:02:32.159> be<00:02:32.250> able<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.459> do<00:02:32.519> that<00:02:32.670> before

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
never used to be able to do that before

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.390 
never used to be able to do that before
animating<00:02:33.930> can<00:02:34.049> have<00:02:34.200> its<00:02:34.349> limitations<00:02:34.739> so<00:02:35.280> in

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
animating can have its limitations so in

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.490 
animating can have its limitations so in
order<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.670> avoid<00:02:35.970> repetitive<00:02:36.360> scenes<00:02:36.900> the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
order to avoid repetitive scenes the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.170 
order to avoid repetitive scenes the
animators<00:02:37.980> blended<00:02:38.459> their<00:02:38.610> work<00:02:38.790> alongside

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
animators blended their work alongside

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.479 
animators blended their work alongside
the<00:02:39.659> physics<00:02:40.049> engine<00:02:40.260> one<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.370> great

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
the physics engine one of the great

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.920 
the physics engine one of the great
things<00:02:41.579> about<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:42.030> physics<00:02:42.360> in<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.569> game<00:02:42.750> is

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
things about the physics in the game is

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.660 
things about the physics in the game is
that<00:02:43.140> everything<00:02:43.560> kind<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.010> seems<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.370> bounce

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
that everything kind of seems to bounce

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.430 
that everything kind of seems to bounce
off<00:02:44.909> everything<00:02:45.090> naturally<00:02:45.989> if<00:02:46.110> we<00:02:46.260> were<00:02:46.319> to

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
off everything naturally if we were to

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.770 
off everything naturally if we were to
animate<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.069> that<00:02:47.400> one<00:02:47.700> thing<00:02:48.150> blowing<00:02:48.510> up

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
animate that that one thing blowing up

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.300 
animate that that one thing blowing up
you<00:02:48.900> see<00:02:49.079> the<00:02:49.200> same<00:02:49.379> animation<00:02:49.769> over<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.250> over

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
you see the same animation over and over

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.160 
you see the same animation over and over
again<00:02:50.519> things<00:02:51.120> will<00:02:51.329> bounce<00:02:51.480> off<00:02:51.720> each<00:02:51.780> other

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
again things will bounce off each other

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.660 
again things will bounce off each other
and<00:02:52.409> it'll<00:02:52.590> feel<00:02:52.829> different<00:02:53.280> every<00:02:53.430> time<00:02:53.609> and

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
and it'll feel different every time and

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.130 
and it'll feel different every time and
it<00:02:53.879> actually<00:02:54.060> makes<00:02:54.359> the<00:02:54.480> world<00:02:54.659> much<00:02:54.959> more

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
it actually makes the world much more

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.390 
it actually makes the world much more
interactive<00:02:55.409> and<00:02:55.799> you<00:02:55.950> feel<00:02:56.099> like<00:02:56.129> you're

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
interactive and you feel like you're

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.819 
interactive and you feel like you're
really<00:02:56.870> affecting<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.989> world<00:02:58.230> as<00:02:58.470> opposed<00:02:58.739> to

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
really affecting the world as opposed to

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.430 
really affecting the world as opposed to
just<00:02:58.890> playing<00:02:59.250> animations<00:02:59.790> over
