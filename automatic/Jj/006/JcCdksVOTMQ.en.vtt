you want me to try this me to grab this
ninja<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.369> I'm<00:02:02.490> like<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.700> don't<00:02:02.850> know<00:02:03.140> um<00:02:04.140> he's

a<00:02:04.409> target<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.040> want<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.369> say<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.909> don't<00:02:06.780> even<00:02:06.990> know

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
a target I want to say I don't even know

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.639 
a target I want to say I don't even know
I<00:02:07.259> think<00:02:07.380> maybe<00:02:07.619> was<00:02:07.860> evening

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
I think maybe was evening

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.539 
I think maybe was evening
so<00:02:09.250> very<00:02:09.849> similar<00:02:10.119> so<00:02:10.869> this<00:02:11.080> has<00:02:11.890> leaked<00:02:12.220> up<00:02:12.400> as

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
so very similar so this has leaked up as

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.530 
so very similar so this has leaked up as
well<00:02:12.849> the<00:02:13.409> things<00:02:14.409> need<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.099> screw<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:15.519> in<00:02:15.610> same

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
well the things need to screw it in same

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.660 
well the things need to screw it in same
thing<00:02:16.569> and<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.980> know<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.220> only<00:02:18.400> thing<00:02:18.489> I

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
thing and you know the only thing I

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.280 
thing and you know the only thing I
could<00:02:18.849> say<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:19.269> this<00:02:19.510> motor<00:02:19.810> on<00:02:19.989> this<00:02:20.110> is

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
could say is this motor on this is

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.110 
could say is this motor on this is
clearly<00:02:20.620> way<00:02:20.920> more<00:02:21.129> than<00:02:21.280> this<00:02:21.430> this<00:02:21.760> does<00:02:21.970> the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
clearly way more than this this does the

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.880 
clearly way more than this this does the
job<00:02:22.330> this<00:02:22.569> feels<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:23.019> little<00:02:23.440> bit<00:02:23.590> almost<00:02:23.739> like

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
job this feels a little bit almost like

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.960 
job this feels a little bit almost like
overkill<00:02:24.430> at<00:02:25.090> least<00:02:25.299> for<00:02:25.480> smoothies<00:02:25.840> however

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
overkill at least for smoothies however

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.330 
overkill at least for smoothies however
look<00:02:27.970> at<00:02:28.060> this<00:02:28.239> blade<00:02:28.540> this<00:02:29.530> was<00:02:30.010> all<00:02:30.190> the

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
look at this blade this was all the

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.699 
look at this blade this was all the
difference<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.819> me<00:02:30.940> because<00:02:31.090> now<00:02:32.079> you<00:02:32.140> can<00:02:32.500> see

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
difference to me because now you can see

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.460 
difference to me because now you can see
that<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:33.549> can<00:02:33.940> access<00:02:34.629> every<00:02:34.959> piece<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.200> it

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
that you can access every piece of it

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.069 
that you can access every piece of it
you<00:02:36.040> can<00:02:36.280> clean<00:02:36.489> it<00:02:36.519> out<00:02:36.730> everything<00:02:37.599> is<00:02:37.780> metal

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
you can clean it out everything is metal

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.940 
you can clean it out everything is metal
there's<00:02:38.829> one<00:02:39.159> little<00:02:39.519> plastic<00:02:40.799> washer<00:02:41.799> right

difference great idea but huge
difference<00:02:54.640> in<00:02:54.760> engineering<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.599> like<00:02:56.319> how

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
difference in engineering and like how

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.220
