to sort of draw a piece that kind of

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.289 
to sort of draw a piece that kind of
goes<00:02:01.929> like<00:02:02.049> that<00:02:03.270> like<00:02:04.270> that<00:02:04.299> like<00:02:04.840> that<00:02:06.299> maybe

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
goes like that like that like that maybe

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.150 
goes like that like that like that maybe
like<00:02:07.630> yeah<00:02:08.910> along<00:02:09.910> with<00:02:09.970> top<00:02:10.950> some<00:02:11.950> sort<00:02:12.130> of

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
like yeah along with top some sort of

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.979 
like yeah along with top some sort of
pattern<00:02:12.549> I<00:02:12.640> mean<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:12.880> can<00:02:13.030> I<00:02:13.269> mean<00:02:13.299> get<00:02:13.900> as

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
pattern I mean you can I mean get as

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.160 
pattern I mean you can I mean get as
creative<00:02:14.200> as<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.470> want<00:02:14.560> see<00:02:14.860> really<00:02:16.140> but<00:02:17.140> uh

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
creative as you want see really but uh

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.699 
creative as you want see really but uh
it's<00:02:18.010> as<00:02:18.130> long<00:02:18.280> as<00:02:18.370> you're<00:02:18.549> consistent<00:02:19.709> that

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
it's as long as you're consistent that

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.830 
it's as long as you're consistent that
really<00:02:20.890> won't<00:02:21.040> matter<00:02:21.190> with<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.700> armor<00:02:22.000> very

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
really won't matter with the armor very

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.650 
really won't matter with the armor very
much<00:02:23.049> come<00:02:23.860> in<00:02:23.980> here<00:02:25.140> will<00:02:26.140> drop<00:02:27.450> protect<00:02:28.450> your

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
much come in here will drop protect your

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:37.680 
much come in here will drop protect your
bits<00:02:28.930> along<00:02:29.230> front<00:02:30.010> for<00:02:30.220> his<00:02:30.310> feet<00:02:36.329> like<00:02:37.329> armor

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
bits along front for his feet like armor

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.479 
bits along front for his feet like armor
again<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:37.989> was<00:02:38.079> very<00:02:38.140> sort<00:02:38.920> of<00:02:38.950> unique<00:02:39.310> and

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
again it was very sort of unique and

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.069 
again it was very sort of unique and
strange<00:02:39.850> back<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:40.329> those<00:02:40.420> days<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.720> mean<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.959> was

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
strange back in those days I mean it was

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.620 
strange back in those days I mean it was
had<00:02:41.260> its<00:02:41.380> own<00:02:41.590> each<00:02:42.400> piece<00:02:42.760> had<00:02:42.940> its<00:02:43.060> own<00:02:43.180> point

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
had its own each piece had its own point

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.110 
had its own each piece had its own point
and<00:02:43.810> purpose<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:45.790> was<00:02:45.910> very<00:02:46.150> hard<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:48.120> sure

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
and purpose it was very hard to sure

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.690 
and purpose it was very hard to sure
maneuver<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:50.560> was<00:02:50.680> absolutely<00:02:51.040> necessary<00:02:51.579> if

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
maneuver it was absolutely necessary if

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.449 
maneuver it was absolutely necessary if
you<00:02:51.760> wanted<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:52.030> stay<00:02:52.209> alive<00:02:52.510> though<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.459> what

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
you wanted to stay alive though and what

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.569 
you wanted to stay alive though and what
we'll<00:02:54.579> do<00:02:54.790> here<00:02:55.209> is<00:02:55.890> we<00:02:56.890> were<00:02:56.980> roughly<00:02:57.250> got<00:02:57.459> the

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
we'll do here is we were roughly got the

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:58.890 
we'll do here is we were roughly got the
shape<00:02:57.790> we<00:02:57.910> won<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:58.209> now<00:02:58.329> we're<00:02:58.450> gonna<00:02:58.540> come<00:02:58.780> in

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
shape we won so now we're gonna come in

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.440 
shape we won so now we're gonna come in
and<00:02:58.989> we're<00:02:59.079> gonna<00:02:59.200> do<00:02:59.440> the<00:03:00.150> draw<00:03:01.150> this<00:03:01.299> little

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
and we're gonna do the draw this little

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.039 
and we're gonna do the draw this little
kneecap<00:03:01.930> over<00:03:02.200> here<00:03:03.420> we're<00:03:04.420> gonna<00:03:04.569> come<00:03:04.870> in

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
kneecap over here we're gonna come in

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.930 
kneecap over here we're gonna come in
and<00:03:05.200> we're<00:03:05.290> gonna<00:03:08.130> toss<00:03:09.130> little<00:03:09.430> foot<00:03:09.730> back

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
and we're gonna toss little foot back

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.040 
and we're gonna toss little foot back
there

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.890 

we<00:03:17.050> got<00:03:17.260> roughly<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.680> pose<00:03:17.860> we<00:03:18.130> want<00:03:18.630> we'll<00:03:19.630> do

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
we got roughly the pose we want we'll do

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.780 
we got roughly the pose we want we'll do
the<00:03:20.320> same<00:03:20.530> thing<00:03:20.590> we<00:03:20.920> did<00:03:21.040> before<00:03:21.100> with<00:03:21.670> the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
the same thing we did before with the

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.550 
the same thing we did before with the
chainmail<00:03:22.060> we're<00:03:22.720> gonna<00:03:22.810> come<00:03:23.080> through<00:03:23.290> here

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
chainmail we're gonna come through here

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.220 
chainmail we're gonna come through here
just<00:03:23.590> gonna<00:03:23.950> go<00:03:24.450> like<00:03:25.450> this<00:03:27.990> all<00:03:28.990> the<00:03:29.110> way

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
just gonna go like this all the way

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.840 
just gonna go like this all the way
through<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:29.590> try<00:03:29.710> and<00:03:29.830> stay<00:03:30.010> as<00:03:30.070> straight<00:03:30.430> in

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
through and try and stay as straight in

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.290 
through and try and stay as straight in
the<00:03:31.240> line<00:03:31.420> as<00:03:31.570> you<00:03:31.660> can<00:03:32.400> keep<00:03:33.400> with<00:03:33.580> like<00:03:34.270> a

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
the line as you can keep with like a

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.960 
the line as you can keep with like a
straight<00:03:34.660> line<00:03:34.870> going<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:36.640> then<00:03:36.760> come<00:03:36.940> right

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
straight line going and then come right

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.070 
straight line going and then come right
back<00:03:37.240> over<00:03:37.540> it<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.780> opposite<00:03:38.200> way<00:03:39.750> just<00:03:40.750> like

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
back over it the opposite way just like

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.590 
back over it the opposite way just like
that<00:03:41.440> I<00:03:41.470> mean<00:03:41.650> it's<00:03:41.800> not<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:42.600> prettiest

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
that I mean it's not the prettiest

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.120 
that I mean it's not the prettiest
chainmail<00:03:44.020> you<00:03:44.170> ever<00:03:44.320> saw<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.740> it's<00:03:44.830> not<00:03:44.980> the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
chainmail you ever saw and it's not the

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.490 
chainmail you ever saw and it's not the
cleanest<00:03:45.550> but<00:03:45.670> it<00:03:45.790> definitely<00:03:46.290> gives<00:03:47.290> it<00:03:47.440> that

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
cleanest but it definitely gives it that

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.970 
cleanest but it definitely gives it that
sort<00:03:47.650> of<00:03:47.980> a<00:03:48.160> square<00:03:49.050> chainmail<00:03:50.050> type<00:03:50.410> look<00:03:50.740> and

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
sort of a square chainmail type look and

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.800 
sort of a square chainmail type look and
first<00:03:51.190> early<00:03:51.550> sketch<00:03:51.790> which<00:03:51.970> is<00:03:52.120> mostly<00:03:52.450> what

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
first early sketch which is mostly what

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.210 
first early sketch which is mostly what
these<00:03:52.930> will<00:03:53.110> be<00:03:53.230> like<00:03:53.410> a<00:03:53.440> preliminary<00:03:53.800> type

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
these will be like a preliminary type

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.150 
these will be like a preliminary type
sketch<00:03:54.570> it's<00:03:55.570> exactly<00:03:56.050> it's<00:03:56.860> perfect<00:03:59.160> you

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
sketch it's exactly it's perfect you

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:14.140 
sketch it's exactly it's perfect you
same<00:04:00.460> thing<00:04:00.490> on<00:04:00.850> the<00:04:00.910> other<00:04:01.030> leg<00:04:06.390> like<00:04:07.390> so

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.340 

and<00:04:15.150> there<00:04:15.659> you<00:04:15.780> go<00:04:17.509> so<00:04:18.509> at<00:04:18.720> this<00:04:18.870> point<00:04:19.169> our

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
and there you go so at this point our

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.090 
and there you go so at this point our
night<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.739> very<00:04:19.979> nearly<00:04:20.820> fully<00:04:21.419> formed<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:22.289> so

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
night is very nearly fully formed and so

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.120 
night is very nearly fully formed and so
the<00:04:23.310> next<00:04:23.550> obvious<00:04:23.789> step<00:04:24.030> would<00:04:24.419> be<00:04:24.889> to<00:04:25.889> come

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
the next obvious step would be to come

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.800 
the next obvious step would be to come
in<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.460> sort<00:04:26.610> of<00:04:26.729> touch<00:04:27.030> everything<00:04:27.300> up<00:04:27.539> a<00:04:27.630> bit

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
in and sort of touch everything up a bit

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.300 
in and sort of touch everything up a bit
so<00:04:27.990> in<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.110> next<00:04:28.259> clip<00:04:28.500> we<00:04:28.650> come<00:04:28.979> in<00:04:29.100> and<00:04:29.250> I'll

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
so in the next clip we come in and I'll

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.310 
so in the next clip we come in and I'll
show<00:04:29.550> you<00:04:29.639> how<00:04:29.759> to<00:04:29.820> you<00:04:30.030> know<00:04:30.150> do<00:04:30.389> a<00:04:30.630> bit<00:04:31.289> of

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
show you how to you know do a bit of

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.620 
show you how to you know do a bit of
detailing<00:04:32.009> on<00:04:32.130> a<00:04:32.160> drawing<00:04:32.490> like<00:04:32.669> this<00:04:32.940> so<00:04:33.180> go
