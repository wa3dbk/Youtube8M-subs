00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
the the colors on it really pop out

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.610 
the the colors on it really pop out
really<00:03:00.400> great<00:03:00.610> and<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:02.140> can<00:03:02.290> see<00:03:02.470> that

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
really great and you can see that

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.020 
really great and you can see that
they've<00:03:02.739> really<00:03:03.069> put<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.310> lot<00:03:03.370> of<00:03:03.610> work<00:03:03.819> into

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
they've really put a lot of work into

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.880 
they've really put a lot of work into
these<00:03:04.300> maps<00:03:04.569> I<00:03:04.810> really<00:03:05.200> do<00:03:05.350> think<00:03:05.560> that<00:03:05.739> they

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
these maps I really do think that they

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.610 
these maps I really do think that they
are<00:03:06.040> first-class<00:03:06.910> maps<00:03:07.239> and<00:03:07.510> this<00:03:08.170> map<00:03:08.380> back

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
are first-class maps and this map back

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.740 
are first-class maps and this map back
is<00:03:08.800> probably<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.370> best<00:03:09.580> one<00:03:09.880> in<00:03:10.090> my<00:03:10.510> offer

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
is probably the best one in my offer

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.860 
is probably the best one in my offer
free<00:03:10.989> so<00:03:11.170> far<00:03:11.410> I<00:03:11.680> do<00:03:12.640> like<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.150> first<00:03:13.390> one<00:03:13.660> but

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
free so far I do like the first one but

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.020 
free so far I do like the first one but
this<00:03:14.050> one<00:03:14.260> in<00:03:14.350> my<00:03:14.470> opinion<00:03:14.650> is<00:03:14.890> much<00:03:15.850> better

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
this one in my opinion is much better

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.210 
this one in my opinion is much better
than<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.450> first<00:03:16.480> one<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.290> also<00:03:17.440> has<00:03:17.680> much<00:03:18.010> more

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
than the first one it also has much more

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.330 
than the first one it also has much more
of<00:03:18.430> a<00:03:18.579> variety<00:03:18.850> to<00:03:19.390> it<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.769> let<00:03:20.769> me<00:03:20.799> start<00:03:21.100> off

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
of a variety to it and let me start off

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.610 
of a variety to it and let me start off
by<00:03:21.400> saying<00:03:21.700> now<00:03:22.269> with<00:03:22.510> foundation<00:03:23.350> that<00:03:23.500> I'm

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
by saying now with foundation that I'm

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.310 
by saying now with foundation that I'm
kind<00:03:23.920> of<00:03:24.090> loving<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:25.510> hating<00:03:25.720> this<00:03:26.079> map

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
kind of loving and hating this map

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.430

pretty much a middle sized map mid sized
map<00:03:36.820> and<00:03:37.440> you<00:03:38.440> cannot<00:03:38.799> do<00:03:38.980> really<00:03:39.340> all<00:03:39.459> that

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.979 
map and you cannot do really all that
great<00:03:39.850> with<00:03:40.030> either<00:03:40.269> one<00:03:40.510> of<00:03:40.540> them<00:03:40.780> so<00:03:40.900> you

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
great with either one of them so you

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.140 
great with either one of them so you
need<00:03:41.170> to<00:03:41.709> pretty<00:03:41.890> much<00:03:42.070> you<00:03:42.700> know<00:03:42.820> play<00:03:43.120> around

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.950 
and then lookout is a base a military
base<00:05:08.919> I<00:05:09.159> think<00:05:09.430> in<00:05:09.550> Afghanistan<00:05:10.210> and<00:05:10.449> also

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
base I think in Afghanistan and also

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.839 
base I think in Afghanistan and also
this<00:05:11.289> one<00:05:11.470> in<00:05:11.620> my<00:05:11.770> opinion<00:05:11.949> is<00:05:12.250> just<00:05:12.520> great<00:05:12.789> for

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
this one in my opinion is just great for

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:14.850 
this one in my opinion is just great for
sniper<00:05:13.210> rifles<00:05:13.659> one<00:05:13.900> if<00:05:14.020> you<00:05:14.110> want<00:05:14.289> quick

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
sniper rifles one if you want quick

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.350 
sniper rifles one if you want quick
scoping<00:05:15.159> in<00:05:15.400> my<00:05:15.490> opinion<00:05:15.789> and<00:05:16.000> this<00:05:16.150> map<00:05:16.330> is

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
scoping in my opinion and this map is

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.659 
scoping in my opinion and this map is
just<00:05:16.630> great<00:05:16.960> because<00:05:17.620> one<00:05:18.069> side<00:05:18.280> of<00:05:18.400> the<00:05:18.520> map

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
just great because one side of the map

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:19.649 
just great because one side of the map
has<00:05:18.909> a<00:05:18.940> cliff

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:19.659 
has a cliff

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:21.089 
has a cliff
from<00:05:19.990> where<00:05:20.169> you<00:05:20.259> can<00:05:20.409> snipe<00:05:20.680> pretty<00:05:20.919> much

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
from where you can snipe pretty much

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:23.909 
from where you can snipe pretty much
really<00:05:21.729> good<00:05:21.940> anyone<00:05:22.449> on<00:05:22.599> the<00:05:22.690> map<00:05:22.840> and<00:05:23.080> also

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
really good anyone on the map and also

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.200 
really good anyone on the map and also
you<00:05:24.159> pretty<00:05:24.340> much<00:05:24.460> get<00:05:24.639> to<00:05:24.789> see<00:05:24.940> where<00:05:25.120> the

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
you pretty much get to see where the

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.290 
you pretty much get to see where the
enemies<00:05:25.569> spawn<00:05:25.840> really<00:05:26.229> fast<00:05:26.500> so<00:05:26.830> I<00:05:27.129> like<00:05:28.090> that

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300

and<00:05:28.509> this<00:05:28.719> probably<00:05:29.169> is<00:05:29.469> the<00:05:29.919> smallest<00:05:30.190> map<00:05:30.490> in

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
and this probably is the smallest map in

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:33.749 
and this probably is the smallest map in
these<00:05:31.090> faceoff<00:05:32.050> maps<00:05:32.289> out<00:05:32.590> of<00:05:33.039> these<00:05:33.250> face-off

the<00:07:09.939> spec<00:07:10.149> ops<00:07:10.330> missions<00:07:10.719> in<00:07:10.869> my<00:07:10.990> opinion<00:07:11.409> they

00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:11.589

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:13.439 
the spec ops missions in my opinion they
are<00:07:11.619> pretty<00:07:12.189> much<00:07:12.309> let<00:07:12.639> down<00:07:12.849> everything<00:07:13.330> else

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:13.449
