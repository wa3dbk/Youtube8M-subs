I've<00:01:33.840> read<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> game<00:01:34.530> didn't<00:01:34.829> work<00:01:34.979> well

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
I've read that the game didn't work well

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.649 
I've read that the game didn't work well
as<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.369> third-person<00:01:35.759> shooter<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.479> perhaps

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
as a third-person shooter so perhaps

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.539 
as a third-person shooter so perhaps
it's<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.170> best<00:01:37.229> they<00:01:37.710> did<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.070> it's

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
it's for the best they did this it's

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.310 
it's for the best they did this it's
also<00:01:38.759> worth<00:01:39.060> noting<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.689> original<00:01:40.079> halo

developed<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.560> find<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.040> pretty<00:02:02.250> interesting

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
developed I find this pretty interesting

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.530 
developed I find this pretty interesting
because<00:02:03.119> halo<00:02:03.630> has<00:02:03.750> influenced

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
because halo has influenced

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.420 
because halo has influenced
the<00:02:04.690> industry<00:02:05.110> quite<00:02:05.350> a<00:02:05.380> bit<00:02:05.620> I<00:02:05.830> can't<00:02:06.280> help

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
the industry quite a bit I can't help

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.740 
the industry quite a bit I can't help
but<00:02:06.610> wonder<00:02:06.820> what<00:02:07.090> it<00:02:07.180> would<00:02:07.270> all<00:02:07.360> be<00:02:07.390> like

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
but wonder what it would all be like

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.230 
but wonder what it would all be like
without<00:02:07.990> halo<00:02:08.410> in<00:02:08.619> its<00:02:08.740> present<00:02:09.100> form<00:02:09.130> I<00:02:09.670> guess

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
without halo in its present form I guess

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.640 
without halo in its present form I guess
we'll<00:02:10.390> never<00:02:10.479> know<00:02:10.630> but<00:02:11.080> maybe<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:11.530> doesn't

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
we'll never know but maybe it doesn't

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.560 
we'll never know but maybe it doesn't
