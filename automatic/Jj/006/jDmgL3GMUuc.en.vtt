00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.830
 [Music] 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.830
 [Applause] 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.360
 there is another posture is another but the 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.340
 People could but try to stay 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.020
 We're sorry, people. We're sorry. 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.420
 frustrated simply could work 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.730
 done something cool is like playing 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.500
 Wow, our jewelry, you get to some 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.540
 completion eg pro inter hotel 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.000
 It was very bad that at the end of the 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.680
 first time technically the whole game 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.740
 the government was very good, we improved 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.900
 after twenty of thirty the time of the 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.910
 better with physical and 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.590
 Also on Wednesday many then I believe 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.840
 which attempted general coordination of a 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.410
 kate domain physically trample the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.080
 Sometimes it's up to you to take a step 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.880
 that then everything afterwards we 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.380
 managed to reverse and even suddenly 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.110
 not make a match so good 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.490
 improving well after second time to 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.920
 people got to turn the game should flow 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.240
 waves hours and could have increased the 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.430
 scoreboard 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.050
 is a possibility that even with 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.640
 all that we could have won 2 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.160
 the street is what we are people 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.560
 feels but it is the beginning of the game that 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.020
 interests that result in fact I 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.550
 I think they were because that's the end of it. 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.890
 making it impossible for us to leave here today 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.200
 with a gaucho victory was looking at the 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.560
 second half is still only 2 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.910
 1 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.560
 look at the beginning until the second goal to 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.250
 people were managing to organize well 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.080
 as the opposition says that the voice was so 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.730
 expected to get us 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.220
 go inside we were there 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.720
 getting west ball and cooperated 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.250
 it was all I got my straight 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.780
 practically did not take a 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.790
 space is big 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.380
 they may have killed the move they have done 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.880
 something urgent so the 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.739
 people are wailing because suddenly 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.170
 the thing else I could have avoided 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.120
 Did you mention Alex's physical wear and tear? 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.120
 told them to continue for you 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.820
 able to follow through on this goal will 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.880
 become more alert in spite of me you're 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.570
 good for us to change 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.190
 we know if the mathematics of giving more 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.260
 It's good who's right there in front of us. 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.700
 it does not get too complicated they have lost 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.080
 We also have to bet on your 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.930
 very big advantage but what do we 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.660
 want to do is honor the inter 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.190
 until the end because we 're here 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.450
 It's not every day that we do not want to 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.040
 play and if we want to finish the year 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.810
 and looking for the biggest win 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.110
 possible number of points 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:50.040
 It is best to start at the time of the group 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:53.250
 not have had a very strong control over the 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.130
 Wednesday less than 72 hours 60 and 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.440
 few hours in turkey had about 30 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.220
 produced minutes of the athletic 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.400
 right difference a lot of old thing 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.760
 It is a bitter taste for the tie but 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.980
 is still studying the possibility and 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.380
 just because I had this paying so far 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.450
 come the impact had a draw in the 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.090
 pretensions of the inter that is to reach the g-4 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.820
 bad by the good points for performance and 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.980
 performance generates this 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.720
 perspective the possibility of a problem 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.400
 by playing the teams that are in the 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.900
 front with the old shape the other game 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.280
 that we are able to play in 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.750
 we have to play our part in 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.150
 orders that will run until the 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.830
 Poland 15 minutes final of the first 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.320
 The hardest team was to turn the 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.990
 international community has done what it 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.500
 keep a result do not take a goal that 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.880
 It looked like it could be avoided 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.660
 individual technical quality 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.520
 [Music] 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.620
 Pedro from the pit in chicken cut to 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.930
 inside it because four finalizations 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.060
 you have to know that you are known for your 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.740
 the opponent had in that move where 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.750
 I was better but technically too 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.330
 decides game and pedro paulo had the 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.330
 possibility of students personal and 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
 called
