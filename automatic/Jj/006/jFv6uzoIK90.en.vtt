00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 And then everyone will be well on the channel today. 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:11.280
 I want to talk about how to earn 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:15.929
 dragon 2 the movie versa dragon 2 him 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.699
 debuted in fact today June 19 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.070
 in the Brazilian cinemas 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.789
 but stars in the united states on the day 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.380
 13 is based on this series of books here 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.619
 of the child on his lap 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:35.100
 ax of which she writes and pleasing the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:37.290
 young adult public audience 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.180
 it affects all types of public, both 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.899
 that the film appeals to all types of audiences 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.790
 also 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.930
 but the film is very different from the book 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.570
 the dragons seen in the movie are great 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:54.390
 so much is that humans up to bulnes 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:57.300
 already in the book the humans or in dragons but 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.079
 They're dragons for me and I'm 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.750
 this is seen in the book as changing a 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.770
 story of the dragon a book dragons 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.750
 they are usually small and the banguela 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.610
 mainly is a dragon known by 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.330
 be too small 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.000
 I have a book to hear that in the case you have 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.100
 written by the own bang kv size 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.049
 What the heck is a movie? 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.390
 great a night hole 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.210
 mere comparisons that can be made between 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.720
 The book and a movie is to follow first. 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.150
 to the astrid character who in the movie is a 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.060
 secondary character but a lot 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.540
 explored, which is based on the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.180
 character that is presented 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.040
 year book dragon talk room 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.420
 Another comparison we can make is the 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.000
 hiccup he is much more like 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.149
 to imagine even in the movie he is a boy 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.920
 skinny little weak to another character 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.869
 which was very similar to the books 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.880
 was the character of the world and fifth 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.549
 we also have fish skin character 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.770
 that in the movie with a character a mere 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.390
 video and was not in the books is a he is the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.220
 best friend of sob 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.390
 the movie was very well done very well 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.310
 built 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.130
 as well as the first the second film 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.260
 continues a lot of money story 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.350
 sandy that pleases and internet the public in 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.390
 all the time when a movie is 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.060
 a strong point that I think is very 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.530
 important these days many parents 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.180
 and grandparents and brothers take children to the 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.550
 cinema to watch the movies is 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.440
 It is important that the film also please 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.420
 these public since from the moment 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.860
 that the film is a free adaptation 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.990
 for all audiences that he is to 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.580
 all audiences and do not have to please 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.950
 both children as young as 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.710
 adults against the elderly and the movie 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.110
 This is a very well-built movie. 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.780
 hotel is perfect so in your 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.730
 characters are very well involved in 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.340
 visual terms and also does not handle with 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.950
 excellent soundtrack the setting is a 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.690
 very well made choice of the stunning 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.640
 It's a movie that I highly recommend you. 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.010
 was 13 after every penny of the 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.990
 investment is a film well the 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.270
 characters in the book but in other 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.230
 adventures nothing to see almost with 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.090
 story 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.620
 even in the col research books 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.630
 I highly recommend you read the books and 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.970
 eating a lot you see today the first 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.790
 in case you have not seen and the second in 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.930
 a final note to the smoker 9.8 you 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.210

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.370
