00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the rocket launcher which is kind of

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.010 
the rocket launcher which is kind of
like<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.510> grenade<00:00:54.719> launcher<00:00:55.440> from<00:00:56.989> call<00:00:57.989> of

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
like a grenade launcher from call of

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.110 
like a grenade launcher from call of
duty<00:00:58.440> battlefield<00:00:59.340> sort<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.699> thing<00:00:59.820> it's<00:00:59.969> got

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
duty battlefield sort of thing it's got

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.380 
duty battlefield sort of thing it's got
the<00:01:00.239> same<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:01.079> reticle<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.890> acts<00:01:02.070> like<00:01:02.219> a

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
the same like reticle but it acts like a

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.700 
the same like reticle but it acts like a
rocket<00:01:03.390> launcher<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.960> then<00:01:04.439> we<00:01:04.530> have<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
rocket launcher and then we have the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.969 
rocket launcher and then we have the
right<00:01:04.830> gear<00:01:05.100> which<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> bat<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.979> ride

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
right gear which is a bat and a ride

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.550 
right gear which is a bat and a ride
shield<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.610> guess<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.180> buckler<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.930> what<00:01:10.470> they

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
shield I guess so a buckler is what they

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.920 
shield I guess so a buckler is what they
call<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.890> here<00:01:10.920> we<00:01:11.909> also<00:01:12.030> have<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> assassins

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
call it here we also have the assassins

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.780 
call it here we also have the assassins
it's<00:01:13.470> basically<00:01:13.830> just<00:01:13.920> how<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.250> sounds<00:01:14.610> high

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
it's basically just how it sounds high

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.210 
it's basically just how it sounds high
damage<00:01:15.030> low<00:01:15.360> defense<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.960> guess<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.530> has<00:01:16.619> pretty

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
damage low defense I guess it has pretty

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.520 
damage low defense I guess it has pretty
balanced<00:01:17.790> defense<00:01:18.270> it's<00:01:18.540> at<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> 3<00:01:19.049> stars<00:01:19.320> at

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
balanced defense it's at the 3 stars at

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.520 
balanced defense it's at the 3 stars at
a<00:01:19.560> five<00:01:20.299> this<00:01:21.299> one's<00:01:21.509> at<00:01:21.630> five<00:01:21.869> at<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> five<00:01:22.290> and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
a five this one's at five at a five and

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.320 
a five this one's at five at a five and
then<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.680> attack<00:01:22.979> for<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.549> gunner<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.090> two

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
then the attack for the gunner is two

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.880 
then the attack for the gunner is two
out<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.509> five<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.350> we're<00:01:25.530> not<00:01:25.619> going<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> talk

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
out of five but we're not going to talk

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.940 
out of five but we're not going to talk
about<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.159> anymore<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:27.200> assassin<00:01:28.200> they<00:01:28.710> use

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
about that anymore the assassin they use

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.260 
about that anymore the assassin they use
sniper<00:01:29.670> rifles<00:01:30.119> handguns<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.110> knives<00:01:32.270> okay

sniper rifles handguns and knives okay

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.109 
sniper rifles handguns and knives okay
that's<00:01:33.869> pretty<00:01:34.320> standard<00:01:34.680> right<00:01:35.189> assassin

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
that's pretty standard right assassin

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.960
