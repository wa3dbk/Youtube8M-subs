see<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.380> going<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.620> be<00:02:19.710> a<00:02:19.740> noisy

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
see that this is going to be a noisy

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.630 
see that this is going to be a noisy
helmet<00:02:20.460> there's<00:02:21.000> lots<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:22.020> little<00:02:22.640> places

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
helmet there's lots of little places

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.810 
helmet there's lots of little places
where<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.150> sticks<00:02:24.420> out<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.930> everything<00:02:25.410> I

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
where it sticks out and everything I

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.730 
where it sticks out and everything I
suspect<00:02:26.820> that<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.570> is<00:02:27.630> going<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.140> be<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.290> very

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
suspect that this is going to be a very

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.820 
suspect that this is going to be a very
very<00:02:28.980> noisy<00:02:29.220> helmet<00:02:29.760> compared<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.240> my<00:02:30.360> shop

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
very noisy helmet compared to my shop

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.850 
very noisy helmet compared to my shop
but<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:31.890> ride<00:02:32.280> around<00:02:32.400> with<00:02:32.640> no<00:02:33.420> noise<00:02:33.860> filters

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
but I ride around with no noise filters

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.910 
but I ride around with no noise filters
anyway<00:02:35.280> or<00:02:35.520> earplugs<00:02:35.760> anyway<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.600> some<00:02:37.560> music

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
anyway or earplugs anyway and some music

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.210 
anyway or earplugs anyway and some music
so<00:02:38.520> what<00:02:39.150> we<00:02:39.270> got<00:02:39.390> here<00:02:39.630> is<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.900> vent<00:02:40.620> which<00:02:41.040> is

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
so what we got here is a vent which is

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.210 
so what we got here is a vent which is
open<00:02:41.610> it's<00:02:42.540> quite<00:02:42.720> nice<00:02:42.900> because<00:02:43.290> on<00:02:43.860> my<00:02:43.980> shop

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
open it's quite nice because on my shop

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.460 
open it's quite nice because on my shop
I<00:02:44.400> never<00:02:44.580> know<00:02:44.790> when<00:02:45.330> my<00:02:45.480> Vince<00:02:45.870> are<00:02:46.140> actually

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
I never know when my Vince are actually

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.740 
I never know when my Vince are actually
open<00:02:46.800> because<00:02:46.950> they<00:02:47.190> are<00:02:47.340> so<00:02:47.550> so<00:02:48.240> closed<00:02:48.540> it's

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
open because they are so so closed it's

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.440 
open because they are so so closed it's
going<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.930> been<00:02:49.050> thin<00:02:49.350> there<00:02:50.120> it's<00:02:51.120> also<00:02:51.270> got

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
going to been thin there it's also got

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.180 
going to been thin there it's also got
event<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.960> year<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.800> help<00:02:52.950> with

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
event of the year to help with

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.790 
event of the year to help with
ventilation<00:02:53.610> in<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.060> front<00:02:54.650> there's<00:02:55.650> about

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
ventilation in the front there's about

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.920 
ventilation in the front there's about
two<00:02:55.980> exhaust<00:02:56.310> ports<00:02:56.700> at<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.880> back<00:02:57.450> here<00:02:57.690> and

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
two exhaust ports at the back here and

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.380 
two exhaust ports at the back here and
by<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.800> looks<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.250> some<00:02:59.790> exhaust<00:03:00.060> ports

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
by the looks of it some exhaust ports

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.260 
by the looks of it some exhaust ports
there<00:03:01.050> as<00:03:01.170> well<00:03:01.350> I'm<00:03:01.560> not<00:03:01.680> too<00:03:01.830> sure<00:03:02.270> whether

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
there as well I'm not too sure whether

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.530 
there as well I'm not too sure whether
they<00:03:03.480> are<00:03:03.630> in<00:03:03.840> fact<00:03:04.080> exhaust<00:03:04.800> ports<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:06.360> whole

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
they are in fact exhaust ports the whole

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.800 
they are in fact exhaust ports the whole
flip<00:03:07.100> mechanism<00:03:08.100> of<00:03:08.250> this<00:03:08.430> works<00:03:09.030> very<00:03:09.690> very

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
flip mechanism of this works very very

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.410 
flip mechanism of this works very very
nicely<00:03:10.170> I've<00:03:10.830> tried<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:11.790> out<00:03:11.910> in<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.210> in<00:03:12.360> the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
nicely I've tried it out in the in the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.780 
nicely I've tried it out in the in the
shop<00:03:12.770> it<00:03:13.770> lifts<00:03:14.160> up<00:03:15.440> lifts<00:03:16.440> up<00:03:16.620> like<00:03:17.130> this<00:03:17.280> and

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
shop it lifts up lifts up like this and

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.450 
shop it lifts up lifts up like this and
then<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:18.870> visor<00:03:19.410> slides<00:03:19.800> out<00:03:19.950> of<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.070> way<00:03:20.220> a

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
then the visor slides out of the way a

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.700 
then the visor slides out of the way a
nice<00:03:21.150> thing<00:03:21.330> about<00:03:21.360> this<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.050> this<00:03:22.260> goes

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
nice thing about this is that this goes

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.400 
nice thing about this is that this goes
all<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:22.980> way<00:03:23.040> back<00:03:23.280> in<00:03:23.780> very<00:03:24.780> much<00:03:24.990> like<00:03:25.260> the

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
all the way back in very much like the

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.340 
all the way back in very much like the
shark<00:03:25.740> evo<00:03:26.040> line<00:03:26.420> except<00:03:27.420> that<00:03:27.630> it's<00:03:27.870> about

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
shark evo line except that it's about

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.340 
shark evo line except that it's about
half<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.740> price<00:03:28.920> of<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.160> shark<00:03:29.460> Evo<00:03:29.730> line<00:03:29.910> and

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
half the price of the shark Evo line and

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.100 
half the price of the shark Evo line and
you<00:03:31.350> can<00:03:31.500> actually<00:03:31.800> see<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.100> in<00:03:32.250> the

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
you can actually see it in the

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.900 
you can actually see it in the
manufacturing<00:03:34.110> quality<00:03:34.320> this<00:03:35.310> is<00:03:35.550> not<00:03:35.700> quite

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
manufacturing quality this is not quite

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.760 
manufacturing quality this is not quite
up<00:03:35.970> there<00:03:36.090> but<00:03:36.660> like<00:03:36.960> I<00:03:37.110> said<00:03:37.320> this<00:03:37.470> is<00:03:37.620> not

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
up there but like I said this is not

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.250 
up there but like I said this is not
going<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:37.980> be<00:03:38.070> my<00:03:38.250> everyday<00:03:38.610> helmet<00:03:39.420> this<00:03:40.110> is

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
going to be my everyday helmet this is

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.930 
going to be my everyday helmet this is
going<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.470> be<00:03:40.560> just<00:03:40.770> when<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:41.070> am<00:03:41.459> going<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.850> be

going to be just when I am going to be

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.780 
going to be just when I am going to be
on<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.090> tour<00:03:42.360> where<00:03:42.959> I<00:03:42.990> want<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.500> be<00:03:43.790> riding

around and taking lots of photographs I

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.860 
around and taking lots of photographs I
don't<00:03:47.040> have<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:47.250> take<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.550> helmet<00:03:47.790> off<00:03:47.940> you

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
don't have to take the helmet off you

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.420 
don't have to take the helmet off you
can<00:03:49.020> write<00:03:49.200> it<00:03:49.320> on<00:03:49.410> with<00:03:49.590> that<00:03:49.709> that<00:03:49.920> locks<00:03:50.190> the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
can write it on with that that locks the

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.090 
can write it on with that that locks the
back<00:03:50.550> there<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:50.910> lock<00:03:51.300> it<00:03:51.420> down<00:03:51.600> but<00:03:51.959> that<00:03:52.200> is

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
back there and lock it down but that is

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.340 
back there and lock it down but that is
down<00:03:53.280> there<00:03:53.520> so<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.820> can<00:03:54.030> have<00:03:54.209> this<00:03:54.360> of<00:03:55.170> this

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
down there so you can have this of this

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.100 
down there so you can have this of this
I<00:03:55.500> find<00:03:55.770> always<00:03:56.130> amazing<00:03:56.690> warning<00:03:57.690> before

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
I find always amazing warning before

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.760 
I find always amazing warning before
this<00:03:58.310> remove<00:03:59.310> this<00:03:59.520> foam<00:03:59.790> before<00:04:00.240> use<00:04:00.770> clearly

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
this remove this foam before use clearly

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.890 
this remove this foam before use clearly
would<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.550> not<00:04:02.700> leave<00:04:02.970> this<00:04:03.209> up<00:04:03.450> there<00:04:03.720> and

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
would you not leave this up there and

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.130 
would you not leave this up there and
not<00:04:04.590> see<00:04:04.830> where<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.130> go<00:04:05.250> but<00:04:05.459> anyway

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
not see where you go but anyway

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.450 
not see where you go but anyway
it's<00:04:06.620> just<00:04:06.860> part<00:04:07.220> of<00:04:07.280> it<00:04:07.400> on<00:04:08.330> the<00:04:08.570> inside<00:04:09.460> looks

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
it's just part of it on the inside looks

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.330 
it's just part of it on the inside looks
quite<00:04:10.670> nice<00:04:10.850> when<00:04:11.840> I<00:04:11.900> find<00:04:12.230> very<00:04:12.590> nice<00:04:12.980> about

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
quite nice when I find very nice about
