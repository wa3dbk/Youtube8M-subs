00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.960
 hello everyone and welcome to kitchen 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.309
 and fast without doing today 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.990
 house pin you'll see the recipe 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.279
 is easy and fast to these parties so 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.250
 for the recipe for bonuses that it's going to us 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.519
 have 100 g of chocolate four 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.189
 slices of brioche a tablespoon 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.019
 of orange marmalade and a spoon 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.430
 raspberry jam soup 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.180
 so first operation I put my 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.180
 stove to heat 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.710
 so I take a slice of brioche 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.950
 and I'm going to come and make a round 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.940
 so here you go 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.180
 I press I turn my first round is 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.180
 ready 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.649
 that's if you could rest ornaments 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.960
 make small croutons to put 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.489
 in a salad or so realize 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.489
 directly a pudding with that 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.850
 here I put my hair on a medium fire 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.440
 and I test but brioche 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.970
 so be careful because it 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:21.380
 goes very very fast it's just 30 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.380
 seconds on each side 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.210
 here you can make the recipe 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.730
 with bread to his family so but 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.630
 buns are sufficiently toasts and I 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.630
 will see remove 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:48.280
 so here I am going to put some marmalade 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:55.860
 of orange so in the middle of my slice of 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.860
 brioche will share equitably 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.810
 here I do the same thing with my 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.810
 raspberry jam 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.980
 here we put it right in the middle 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.459
 here and now direction the 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.760
 freezer for about 30 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.760
 minutes 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.300
 so now I loved him 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.170
 finding chocolate to melt in the microphone 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:40.980
 waves about 40 seconds 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:45.000
 it's gone so that's my chocolate 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.650
 and well melted then here I'm going to take 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.610
 so a brioche 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.000
 I will spread my marmalade 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.200
 orange 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.690
 here and then I will come and do 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.870
 so sink the chocolate by starting 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.350
 by the center here it comes on 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:14.070
 the excess chocolate flows into the 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:16.250
 container not I want to spread a little 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.250
 all over 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.800
 here and I put my brioche on 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.800
 my plate 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.670
 go on it's still one that I spread 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:45.430
 my jam so on my trip here and 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:50.910
 then I come to put chocolate by 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:53.019
 on it I turn to distribute it well 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.390
 so when we do this operation we 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.870
 gets dirty a little bit fingers but 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.870
 well it does not matter 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.930
 here and then I will come to testify 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.780
 so my brioche on a plate on 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.240
 which is why I put a grid 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.840
 to recover in that excess of 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:33.990
 chocolate here I take bun 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:37.330
 I spread my jam it right here 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.640
 I just pour melted chocolate by 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.890
 on top of me I always start with the 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:50.890
 middle here and I turn to spread 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:53.260
 my chocolate on the brioche so when 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.670
 you do this counteraction 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.960
 every step dice you hands because 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:04.330
 that you will find yourself clement a 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:06.460
 full of chocolate the recipe is 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:11.110
 really easy to just barely three 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:15.270
 ingredients so the brioche the chocolate 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.270
 and the jam of your choice 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.530
 now I'll put this in 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.840
 cool so if you're in a hurry put 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.960
 the in the freezer 25 minutes pretty much 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.220
 otherwise put it in the refrigerator during 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.220
 about 40 minutes 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.810
 so here I went out so but pin's of 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.990
 fridge 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.370
 so for cutting I'm going to use 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.930
 so a blowtorch 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:49.930
 I'm just going to heat up Madam 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:52.220
 here to have a nice cuts a 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.760
 months cut it in half for a little bit 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.760
 what's going on inside 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.830
 that's wonderful 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:07.460
 there one sees in that the jam of 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.290
 raspberries one our buns and the 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.100

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.100
 great as a recipe 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.980
 so we're going to cut out a second so 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.980
 gently 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:30.950
 so here we see the 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.180
 orange marmalade see the magnificent 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:40.490
