00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.240
 Hello everyone, today we'll see how to reset 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:14.019
 the bios of your computer from yours 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.720
 motherboard in a few simple parsi is 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.270
 a fairly simple operation 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.090
 this system plans to disassemble 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.770
 because your computer then operate 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.840
 manually this reset 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.779
 then there are two ways to do it 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.720
 carry out this system on 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.489
 first even the simplest one is that 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.229
 to remove for about a hundred 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.420
 minutes 

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:43.299
 the buffer battery in your card 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.510
 mother who for instance 

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:47.890
 and this clip this battery that 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.320
 allows you to keep yours 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.409
 custom settings also a 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:58.510
 computer turned off where i'm running 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:01:02.460
 deactivated very simple you take advantage of it 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.460
 costs this block 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.780
 and you will see that the battery is removed 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.080
 this system is good that you leave the 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.100
 battery inserted however at least one 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.350
 thirty minutes and automatically on 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.509
 your bios will present you with 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.509
 settings provided by the parent company 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:32.990
 this is the first system otherwise if 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.750
 always look for this battery 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.700
 buffer is usually found a lot 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.149
 close 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:44.920
 you will see that there is a term jumper 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:47.920
 technician who is nothing but a 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.920
 jumper 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:55.270
 also in this case we proceed to the 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:58.220
 command removal you hear crates 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:05.420
 that you will see that the jumper is leaning 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:08.269
 on two pins you parade it like those two 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.930
 and there is a third now you will go to 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:14.870
 put back between the second and third in 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:22.090
 practice leave the first one free after 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.090
 that you are going to reposition the jumper 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:31.670
 in its original position and also 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.210
 here we have finished now because 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.760
 present the bios 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:41.910
 sometimes it happens that maybe by mistake or 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.420
 for we have problems in our 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.360
 pc 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.660
 we need to change the 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.220
 parameters within the bios but maybe 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.060
 we are really sure that we commit 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.860
 errors and then moving 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.980
 certain values our pc does not 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.940
 rekindles more and we can not even less 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.070
 reset it by entering the bios because at 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.040
 sometimes it doesn't even let us enter 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.560
 so we can't 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.830
 here is that this system is very useful 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.610
 because we can solve all of them 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.930
 these problems 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:21.960
 simply resetting it if it is 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.210
 motherboard in good condition and not 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.580
 there are other problems 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:30.680
 we 'll have them all new computer like 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:34.670
 like when we bought everything here 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.670
 thanks to the next video
