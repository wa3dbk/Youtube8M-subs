00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.429
 a greeting to all friends 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.710
 androidworld.it welcome to boxing 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.259
 of lg g4s some of you might 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.049
 wondering what this g4s is not 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.160
 already reviewed the smaller version e 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.880
 less powerful bg 4 or g4 ciba is yes but 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.000
 these g4s which is the European version of 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.820
 lg g4 at least Italian bit of lg 4 bit 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.840
 is also coming our country is 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.410
 decidedly more powerful than a c 4 c Ã¨ 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.180
 so it almost certainly deserves more 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.160
 attention of that other cult model 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.350
 model among others had not received 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.170
 on our part, in our review 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.770
 a great welcome for headphones 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:55.440
 stereo with remote control micro usb cable 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:58.980
 usb manual that power supply from 0 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.699
 85 amps this is precisely the variant 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.090
 Italian we bought it on rai.it a 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.729
 a price of around 450 euros 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:16.850
 we have already put the battery then 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.850
 we go to remove the plastic you succeed 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.930
 made here goes 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.000
 this is the glossy white version that 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.090
 has a nice effect I have to say look 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.430
 when we pass over it with the light of 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.930
 these artists prisms behind and between 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.549
 the other is also to the touch then 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.229
 it is not just an optical effect it conceals 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.380
 plastichina also on the balance of the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.290
 volume obviously kept the keys of the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.280
 volume and ignition on the back yes 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.270
 it's a smartphone that has 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.210
 snapdragon 615 processor opts core with 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.299
 a 5 body artex 53 from a jig and a half a 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.140
 giga hertz and a half and four cores always 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:58.079
 cortex the top 3 from a gb 1 gb of ram 8 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.540
 gb internal camera memory should 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.680
 be the 8 megapixel version and there 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.460
 are two versions of this smartphone 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.329
 in commerce however we will go then to 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.470
 understand well but should be the 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:13.730
 8 megapixel version 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.370
 with the laser autofocus and the led flash it 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.100
 see here next to each other there is also 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.170
 another space below that could do 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.790
 think of another component but not another 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.130
 I'm not sure we will go to 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.630
 also analyze this thing of course 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.250
 all these insecurities are because of it 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.380
 we haven't tried it yet 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.260
 three and a half second audio jack 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.880
 entirely clean profile microphone if 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.840
 not for the first microphone and the door 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.860
 micro usb 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.990
 the cover can obviously be removed 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.220
 here it leaves room for the micro sim 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:48.020
 was the micro sd let's close it here 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.340
 let's go to light it 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.950

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.200
 androidworld.it will only happen later 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.100
 having stressed the smartphone properly 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.010
