comfortable<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.810> play<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.260> but<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.920> most

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
comfortable to play and but the most

comfortable to play and but the most
important<00:02:56.610> thing<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.850> think<00:02:56.880> about<00:02:57.060> this

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
important thing I think about this

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.660 
important thing I think about this
guitar<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.930> is<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.710> the<00:02:58.800> pickup<00:02:59.130> system<00:02:59.520> is

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
guitar and is that the pickup system is

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.310 
guitar and is that the pickup system is
absolutely<00:02:59.850> fantastic<00:03:00.390> I've<00:03:00.900> got<00:03:01.080> on<00:03:01.200> this

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
absolutely fantastic I've got on this

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.810 
absolutely fantastic I've got on this
guitar<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:01.950> there<00:03:02.490> are<00:03:02.580> six<00:03:02.790> piezo<00:03:03.210> pickups

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
guitar and there are six piezo pickups

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.280 
guitar and there are six piezo pickups
underneath<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.000> saddle<00:03:06.690> here<00:03:07.020> and<00:03:07.170> there's

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
underneath the saddle here and there's

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.870 
underneath the saddle here and there's
also<00:03:07.410> condenser<00:03:07.980> microphone<00:03:08.460> inside<00:03:08.730> the

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
also condenser microphone inside the

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.300 
also condenser microphone inside the
guitar<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.390> that's<00:03:09.570> why<00:03:09.750> when<00:03:10.380> you're<00:03:10.530> when
