00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
I had to something that says it set the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.410 
I had to something that says it set the
sensitivity<00:00:37.100> really<00:00:38.100> low<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:38.790> at<00:00:38.969> like<00:00:39.149> 8

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
sensitivity really low it's at like 8

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.799 
sensitivity really low it's at like 8
percent<00:00:39.719> or<00:00:40.020> whatever<00:00:40.170> cuz<00:00:41.100> um<00:00:41.340> if<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.420> set<00:00:42.780> it

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
percent or whatever cuz um if I set it

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.200 
percent or whatever cuz um if I set it
to<00:00:42.989> like<00:00:43.140> well<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.649> normally<00:00:44.040> do<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.520> it's

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
to like well I normally do it it's

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.799 
to like well I normally do it it's
unusable<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.559> said<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.010> really<00:00:47.280> low<00:00:47.430> um

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
unusable so I said this really low um

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.690 
unusable so I said this really low um
it's<00:00:49.110> that's<00:00:49.620> kind<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.070> difficult<00:00:50.219> team<00:00:50.489> used

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
it's that's kind of difficult team used

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.130 
it's that's kind of difficult team used
to<00:00:52.520> be<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.629> like<00:00:54.780> punch

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
to be is to like punch

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.450 
to be is to like punch
why<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:57.680> is<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.980> equivalent<00:00:59.430> of

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
why is to like is the equivalent of

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.250 
why is to like is the equivalent of
right-click<00:00:59.899> whatever<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:00.960> want<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.170> use

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
right click for it and then a is to

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.149 
right click for it and then a is to
cycle<00:01:06.689> through<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.080> Pokemon<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.770> insistent

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
cycle through the Pokemon so insistent

cycle through the Pokemon so insistent
is<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.850> know<00:01:08.939> pixelmon<00:01:10.159> so<00:01:11.159> ace<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.549> cycle

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
is you know pixelmon so ace to cycle

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.890 
is you know pixelmon so ace to cycle
through<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.290> then<00:01:13.430> R<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.479> use<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
through that then R is to use the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.190 
through that then R is to use the
Pokemon<00:01:16.549> c31<00:01:17.689> called<00:01:18.689> back

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
Pokemon c31 called back
