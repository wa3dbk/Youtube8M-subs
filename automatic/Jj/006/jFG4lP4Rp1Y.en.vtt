00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.130
 have incredible luck follows today 

00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:05.839
 children from the district mistelbach had 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.210
 they could be on the a 5 between 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.100
 even into the valley and step in the last 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.590
 save moment from a burning bus 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.360
 the bus handlebar has mind present 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.129
 reacts and the smoking bus on 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.140
 Pannenstreifen packed the northern highway 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.320
 and everyone safely in safety 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.270
 brought on the tourist bus of the 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.700
 elementary school children from neudorf bei staatz 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.130
 is intended to bring had to skate 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.480
 nothing left the vehicle is 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.940
 completely burned out 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.800
 but the 51 children and three teachers 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.409
 could leave the bus in time 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.870
 because he reacted quickly before 

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:40.010
 has to be in my opinion 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.140
 pronounce or respect 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.629
 excellent solved but really disturbing 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.039
 that him difficult to see it the 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.739
 immediately drove on the emergency lane 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.670
 the child role out of the bus 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.679
 brought 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.449
 the files have been in the bus 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:55.159
 Children were cold we cover ourselves with 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.229
 supplies should even really job 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.679
 and then if your name is in 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:02.929
 Orttenburg really well out there where 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.930
 but it is very dreamy and then peters 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:08.869
 and then operates with fire extinguisher who 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.390
 on the side of oscar is but with 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.490
 high basement does it lead you very much 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.500
 that make a huge difference 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.539
 It probably would be a motor 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.649
 short of the fire 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.659
 has caused 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.609
 One of the firefighters was at the 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.189
 erasure he has injured himself 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:25.789
 Ankle break and a smoke poisoning 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.530
 suffered 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:31.909
 for the fire department that was not 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.979
 everyday use difficult if you 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.229
 against the wind actually for use 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.570
 Together we drive our vehicles with the 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.159
 Team in the well we allow 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.869
 have tried the emergency vehicles 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.609
 Unfortunately it is not possible to bring us over 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.109
 very successful at the place where very 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:45.710
 was difficult to delete who was in the 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:49.969
 fully brand 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.409
 and it was not easy and for the 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.109
 bus driver was the most important 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:58.490
 that all children are safe 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:02:02.060
 I'm firefighters myself and the gray 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.249
 Shah 44 years they will take care of you 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.640
 a question of whether there really no outside 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:09.110
 but more time we still 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.030
 how can that be ? 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.190
 the children were in elementary school 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.940
 supplied the north highway was because of 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.740
 build up 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.740
 work locked for several hours
