here's the pickup to the solo you heard
how<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.160> put<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.580> little<00:00:35.820> accent<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.420> first

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
how I put a little accent on the first

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:46.660 
how I put a little accent on the first
note<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.890> also<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.400> little<00:00:38.610> bit<00:00:38.730> broader

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.319 

your<00:00:47.480> turn<00:00:48.460> it's<00:00:49.460> a<00:00:49.550> good<00:00:49.700> idea<00:00:49.820> to<00:00:50.000> have<00:00:50.180> the

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
your turn it's a good idea to have the

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.690 
your turn it's a good idea to have the
Boeing's<00:00:50.720> in<00:00:51.050> for<00:00:51.470> every<00:00:51.800> section<00:00:52.309> this<00:00:52.520> one

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
Boeing's in for every section this one

00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:04.170 
Boeing's in for every section this one
starts<00:00:52.970> up<00:00:53.120> flow

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.400 

and<00:01:05.409> then<00:01:06.409> that's<00:01:06.979> exceptions<00:01:07.580> we'll<00:01:08.030> start

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
and then that's exceptions we'll start

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:23.200 
and then that's exceptions we'll start
it's<00:01:09.410> quiet<00:01:19.570> try<00:01:20.570> that<00:01:21.550> read<00:01:22.550> very<00:01:22.880> very

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
it's quiet try that read very very

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.880 
it's quiet try that read very very
carefully<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:23.900> be<00:01:24.110> sure<00:01:24.290> that<00:01:24.320> you<00:01:24.500> put<00:01:24.770> the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
carefully and be sure that you put the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.969 
carefully and be sure that you put the
slurs<00:01:25.250> in<00:01:25.580> where<00:01:25.790> they<00:01:25.910> belong

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
slurs in where they belong

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.450 
slurs in where they belong
and<00:01:27.979> especially<00:01:28.460> in<00:01:28.910> this<00:01:29.060> next<00:01:29.509> part<00:01:30.460> the

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
and especially in this next part the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:42.219 
and especially in this next part the
they've<00:01:31.940> all<00:01:32.090> these<00:01:32.270> very<00:01:32.509> tricky

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.190 

all<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.470> sudden<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:43.860> change<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.280> f-sharp<00:01:45.200> up

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
all of a sudden we change to f-sharp up

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.080 
all of a sudden we change to f-sharp up
till<00:01:46.440> there<00:01:46.650> it's<00:01:46.830> all<00:01:47.040> been<00:01:47.280> F<00:01:47.460> natural<00:01:47.670> on

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
till there it's all been F natural on

00:01:48.090 --> 00:02:18.880 
till there it's all been F natural on
the<00:01:48.120> last<00:01:48.420> notes<00:01:48.690> and<00:01:48.930> F<00:01:49.050> sharp<00:01:49.080> your<00:01:49.680> turn

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.690 

and<00:02:19.250> you're<00:02:20.680> okay<00:02:21.680> just<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:21.980> get<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.250> effect

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
and you're okay just to get the effect

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
sectionals right now so you can see what

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.920 
sectionals right now so you can see what
the<00:02:27.370> results<00:02:28.370> should<00:02:28.580> be<00:02:28.820> but<00:02:29.330> remember<00:02:29.780> the

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
the results should be but remember the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.860 
the results should be but remember the
trick<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:31.100> really<00:02:31.460> important<00:02:31.970> thing<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.210> to

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
trick the really important thing is to

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.250 
trick the really important thing is to
play<00:02:33.320> it<00:02:33.530> slowly<00:02:33.950> in<00:02:34.280> small<00:02:35.020> sections<00:02:36.020> and

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
play it slowly in small sections and

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.770 
play it slowly in small sections and
master<00:02:36.770> each<00:02:36.950> section<00:02:37.580> with<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.150> dynamics

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
master each section with the dynamics

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.060 
master each section with the dynamics
the<00:02:39.020> bowings

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
the bowings

00:02:40.070 --> 00:03:20.179 
the bowings
and<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.400> fingerings<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:42.290> here<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:42.710> is

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:20.189 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:24.000 

and<00:03:21.189> there<00:03:21.519> we<00:03:21.730> made<00:03:22.180> tremendous<00:03:22.859> pretend<00:03:23.859> oh

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
and there we made tremendous pretend oh

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.819 
and there we made tremendous pretend oh
very<00:03:24.459> exciting<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.870> we<00:03:25.989> can<00:03:26.170> go<00:03:26.470> right<00:03:26.500> into

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
very exciting and we can go right into

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:41.620 
very exciting and we can go right into
the<00:03:27.040> two<00:03:27.250> teeth<00:03:27.489> with

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.970 

and<00:03:42.630> then<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.930> last<00:03:43.110> solo

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
and then the last solo

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.950 
and then the last solo
I<00:03:44.010> think<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.550> Baldy<00:03:44.910> seems<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.330> be<00:03:45.450> winding

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
I think the Baldy seems to be winding

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.900 
I think the Baldy seems to be winding
down<00:03:46.140> a<00:03:46.200> little<00:03:46.530> bit<00:03:46.830> it's<00:03:47.160> not<00:03:47.340> quite<00:03:47.640> so

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
down a little bit it's not quite so

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.430 
down a little bit it's not quite so
dramatic<00:03:48.060> it's<00:03:48.600> very<00:03:48.810> pretty

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
dramatic it's very pretty

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.280 
dramatic it's very pretty
