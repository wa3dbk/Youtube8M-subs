unboxed so now this is just going to be

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.670 
unboxed so now this is just going to be
a<00:00:15.240> quick<00:00:15.480> view<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.719> what<00:00:16.049> it's<00:00:16.199> like<00:00:16.260> when<00:00:16.529> it's

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
a quick view of what it's like when it's

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.710 
a quick view of what it's like when it's
powered<00:00:16.949> on<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.640> basically<00:00:18.150> you've<00:00:18.449> got<00:00:18.690> a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
powered on so basically you've got a

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.269 
powered on so basically you've got a
blue<00:00:18.930> light<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.320> looks<00:00:19.529> like<00:00:19.680> purple<00:00:20.070> here

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
blue light it looks like purple here

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.269 
blue light it looks like purple here
because<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.600> intense<00:00:22.199> i<00:00:22.470> mean<00:00:22.980> that

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
because it is so intense i mean that

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.220 
because it is so intense i mean that
blue<00:00:23.550> light<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.210> intense<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.779> then<00:00:25.050> you've

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
blue light is so intense and then you've

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.560 
blue light is so intense and then you've
just<00:00:25.560> got<00:00:25.740> your<00:00:25.920> normal<00:00:26.400> like<00:00:27.060> Mokey's

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
found i was light switch so it turns off

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.959 
found i was light switch so it turns off
your<00:00:40.710> light<00:00:40.980> if<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.309> think<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.820> too

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
powerful but seriously look at that that

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.630 
powerful but seriously look at that that
is<00:00:44.460> humungous<00:00:45.420> amount<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.960> light<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.640> lights

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
is humungous amount of light up lights

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.930 
is humungous amount of light up lights
and<00:00:48.030> there's<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.629> notice<00:00:49.079> on<00:00:49.200> my<00:00:49.320> thing<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.340> so

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
and there's a notice on my thing and so

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.869 
and there's a notice on my thing and so
yep<00:00:51.239> that's<00:00:51.410> mainly<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.530> I'm<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.340> if<00:00:53.520> you

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
yep that's mainly it I'm just if you

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.270 
yep that's mainly it I'm just if you
would<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.239> see<00:00:54.449> also<00:00:55.140> hear<00:00:55.379> how<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.010> fits

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
would like to see also hear how it fits

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.520 
would like to see also hear how it fits
my<00:00:56.430> hand<00:00:56.460> if<00:00:57.090> it's<00:00:57.210> really<00:00:57.750> well<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.170> very

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
my hand if it's really well it very

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.740 
my hand if it's really well it very
contours<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.550> better<00:00:59.850> switch<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.449> get

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
contours and it's better switch to get

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.930 
contours and it's better switch to get
back<00:01:00.930> here<00:01:01.109> but<00:01:01.289> really<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.190> much<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.640> one<00:01:02.820> is

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
back here but really so much this one is

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.640 
back here but really so much this one is
a<00:01:02.969> bit<00:01:03.059> weird<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.840> especially<00:01:04.229> if<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.500> need

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
a bit weird like especially if you need

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.710 
a bit weird like especially if you need
a<00:01:04.680> jump<00:01:04.890> or<00:01:05.010> something<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:06.180> other<00:01:06.420> than<00:01:06.600> that

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
a jump or something but other than that

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.630 
a jump or something but other than that
we'll<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.530> cut<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:10.369> software<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.549> we'll

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
we'll just cut to the software and we'll

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.940 
we'll just cut to the software and we'll
do<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> view<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.450> but<00:01:13.170> I've<00:01:13.380> ruled<00:01:13.650> them

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
do a view on that but I've ruled them

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.280 
do a view on that but I've ruled them
stronger<00:01:14.430> as<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> hardware<00:01:15.240> or<00:01:15.540> as<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
stronger as a hardware or as I like a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.530 
stronger as a hardware or as I like a
gaming<00:01:16.740> peripheral<00:01:17.189> itself<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.119> great

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
gaming peripheral itself is a great

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.510 
gaming peripheral itself is a great
thing<00:01:18.780> I've<00:01:18.960> tried<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.409> at<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> bit<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:20.100> really

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
thing I've tried it at a bit it's really

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.490 
thing I've tried it at a bit it's really
awesome<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:21.390> really<00:01:21.479> improved<00:01:21.960> my<00:01:22.020> game<00:01:22.080> and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
awesome it's really improved my game and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.730 
awesome it's really improved my game and
we'll<00:01:22.799> see<00:01:23.009> how<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.729> set<00:01:24.000> macros<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.740> all

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
we'll see how you can set macros and all

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.200 
we'll see how you can set macros and all
that<00:01:25.950> right<00:01:26.460> now<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.000> yep<00:01:28.460> ok<00:01:29.460> guys<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:29.939> now

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
that right now so yep ok guys so now

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.620 
that right now so yep ok guys so now
we're<00:01:30.420> with<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.930> software<00:01:31.619> itself<00:01:31.680> here<00:01:32.130> and

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
we're with the software itself here and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.090 
we're with the software itself here and
i'll<00:01:33.630> start<00:01:34.020> off<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.350> actually<00:01:34.829> have<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
i'll start off to actually have the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.410 
i'll start off to actually have the
software<00:01:35.490> running<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.939> have<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
software running you have to have the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.740 
software running you have to have the
Nostromo<00:01:37.229> plugged<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.799> obviously<00:01:38.520> kind<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.909> um

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
Nostromo plugged in obviously kind of um

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.929 
Nostromo plugged in obviously kind of um
so<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.680> assigned<00:01:41.220> buttons<00:01:41.579> window

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
so this is the assigned buttons window

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.420 
so this is the assigned buttons window
so<00:01:42.270> basically<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.229> get<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.770> list<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.100> buttons

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
so basically you get the list of buttons

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.370 
so basically you get the list of buttons
all<00:01:44.610> up<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.000> 14<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.600> that's<00:01:45.780> all<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> buttons

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
all up to 14 and that's all the buttons

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.109 
all up to 14 and that's all the buttons
in<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.590> main<00:01:46.829> keypad<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.460> you've<00:01:47.909> got<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
in the main keypad and you've got the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.690 
in the main keypad and you've got the
special<00:01:48.299> buttons<00:01:48.720> like<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.530> one<00:01:49.770> here<00:01:50.189> the

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
spacebar and 48 directional areas of

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.770 
spacebar and 48 directional areas of
d-pad<00:01:57.390> as<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.200> see<00:01:58.439> it's<00:01:58.649> got<00:01:58.829> eight

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
d-pad as you can see it's got eight

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.530 
d-pad as you can see it's got eight
program<00:02:00.780> different<00:02:01.380> program<00:02:01.740> are<00:02:01.950> different

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
program different program are different

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.499 
program different program are different
they<00:02:03.540> say<00:02:03.689> they<00:02:03.840> are<00:02:03.930> programs<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.740> use<00:02:04.920> a

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
they say they are programs you can use a

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.779 
they say they are programs you can use a
little<00:02:06.509> customizable<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.350> that's<00:02:08.160> mainly<00:02:08.640> it

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
little customizable and that's mainly it

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.460 
little customizable and that's mainly it
here<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.209> got<00:02:09.450> your<00:02:09.479> different<00:02:09.989> profiles

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
here you got your different profiles

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.630 
here you got your different profiles
which<00:02:10.679> can<00:02:10.920> add<00:02:11.039> up<00:02:11.190> here<00:02:11.370> reset

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
which can add up here reset

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.730 
which can add up here reset
and<00:02:12.760> then<00:02:13.540> we're<00:02:13.690> going<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.930> manage<00:02:14.350> profile

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
and then we're going to manage profile

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.740 
and then we're going to manage profile
so<00:02:14.980> again<00:02:15.550> this<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:15.940> all<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.210> profiles<00:02:16.420> that

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
so again this is all the profiles that

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.350 
so again this is all the profiles that
you've<00:02:17.050> made<00:02:17.290> in<00:02:17.470> here<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:18.819> can<00:02:18.970> make<00:02:19.150> these

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
you've made in here you can make these

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.480 
you've made in here you can make these
like<00:02:19.660> launched<00:02:20.080> when<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.650> certain<00:02:20.890> application

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
like launched when a certain application

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.120 
like launched when a certain application
launch<00:02:21.720> launches<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:22.959> I've<00:02:23.230> got<00:02:23.530> my<00:02:23.560> minecraft

pvp one with rapid fire and all that
I'll<00:02:27.250> run<00:02:27.459> through<00:02:27.610> macros<00:02:28.060> in<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.390> bit<00:02:28.740> to

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
I'll run through macros in a bit to

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.430 
I'll run through macros in a bit to
launch<00:02:30.010> when<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.490> launch<00:02:30.820> minecraft<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:32.260> that's

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
launch when I launch minecraft so that's

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.510 
launch when I launch minecraft so that's
pretty<00:02:32.590> cool<00:02:33.240> um<00:02:34.240> um<00:02:34.720> we'll<00:02:35.560> go<00:02:35.740> i'll<00:02:36.190> skip

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
pretty cool um um we'll go i'll skip

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.070 
pretty cool um um we'll go i'll skip
macros<00:02:36.880> because<00:02:37.180> i'll<00:02:37.300> leave<00:02:37.570> that<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.870> last

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
macros because i'll leave that to last

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.380 
macros because i'll leave that to last
I'm<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.950> lighting<00:02:39.310> it's<00:02:39.610> nothing<00:02:39.910> much<00:02:40.150> here

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
I'm the lighting it's nothing much here

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.150 
I'm the lighting it's nothing much here
just<00:02:40.660> on<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.620> get<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.890> choose<00:02:42.130> your

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
just on the you get a choose your

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.740 
just on the you get a choose your
profile<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:42.850> how<00:02:43.030> about<00:02:43.239> you<00:02:43.390> want<00:02:43.540> it<00:02:43.630> to

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
profile and how about you want it to

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.990 
profile and how about you want it to
100%<00:02:44.170> attempts<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.860> there's<00:02:45.459> still<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.730> bit<00:02:45.970> of

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
100% attempts and there's still a bit of

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.270 
100% attempts and there's still a bit of
light<00:02:46.239> at<00:02:46.390> ten<00:02:46.570> percent<00:02:46.900> but<00:02:47.080> anyway<00:02:47.320> now<00:02:48.010> into

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
light at ten percent but anyway now into

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.949 
light at ten percent but anyway now into
the<00:02:48.370> main<00:02:48.520> bit<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.910> macros<00:02:49.330> so<00:02:49.660> if<00:02:49.810> you're

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
the main bit the macros so if you're

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.870 
the main bit the macros so if you're
unfamiliar<00:02:50.620> with<00:02:50.739> what<00:02:51.070> macros<00:02:51.489> are<00:02:51.670> they're

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
unfamiliar with what macros are they're

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.360 
unfamiliar with what macros are they're
basically<00:02:52.360> like<00:02:52.480> you've<00:02:53.320> a<00:02:53.470> called<00:02:53.800> keystroke

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
basically like you've a called keystroke

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.940 
basically like you've a called keystroke
so<00:02:54.640> let's<00:02:55.030> say<00:02:55.180> in<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.570> game<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:56.320> need<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.650> press

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
so let's say in a game you need to press

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.090 
so let's say in a game you need to press
I<00:02:57.370> know<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:59.700> space<00:03:00.700> g<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.600> do<00:03:01.720> something<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:02.860> can

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
I know I space g to do something you can

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.930 
I know I space g to do something you can
record<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:03.730> here<00:03:04.150> as<00:03:04.510> i'll<00:03:04.810> go<00:03:05.019> new<00:03:05.610> go<00:03:06.780> test

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
record that here as i'll go new go test

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.840 
record that here as i'll go new go test
so<00:03:09.940> let's<00:03:10.330> say<00:03:10.510> I<00:03:10.780> space<00:03:11.230> tree<00:03:11.500> so<00:03:11.860> now<00:03:12.550> if<00:03:12.730> you

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
so let's say I space tree so now if you

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.580 
so let's say I space tree so now if you
want<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.060> redo<00:03:13.330> that<00:03:13.480> really<00:03:13.720> quick<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.440> go

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
want to redo that really quick you go

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.949 
want to redo that really quick you go
insert<00:03:14.980> default<00:03:15.550> delay<00:03:15.850> and<00:03:16.480> we'll<00:03:16.570> go<00:03:16.720> 5

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
insert default delay and we'll go 5

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.620 
insert default delay and we'll go 5
millisecond<00:03:17.620> so<00:03:18.250> there<00:03:18.400> we<00:03:18.519> go<00:03:18.549> and<00:03:19.090> doesn't

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
millisecond so there we go and doesn't

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.300 
millisecond so there we go and doesn't
matter<00:03:19.870> how<00:03:20.049> quick<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:20.650> click<00:03:20.950> this<00:03:21.100> will

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
matter how quick you click this will

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.460 
matter how quick you click this will
always<00:03:21.549> have<00:03:21.700> a<00:03:21.730> 5<00:03:22.000> millisecond<00:03:22.510> delay<00:03:22.570> so<00:03:23.260> go

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
always have a 5 millisecond delay so go

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.259 
always have a 5 millisecond delay so go
I<00:03:23.910> space<00:03:24.910> G<00:03:25.890> then<00:03:26.890> you<00:03:27.010> stop<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.489> then<00:03:28.090> that's

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
I space G then you stop and then that's

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.110 
I space G then you stop and then that's
your<00:03:28.390> macro<00:03:29.170> right<00:03:29.380> there<00:03:29.560> so<00:03:30.430> it<00:03:30.790> will<00:03:30.940> have<00:03:31.060> a

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
your macro right there so it will have a

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.030 
your macro right there so it will have a
5<00:03:31.390> millisecond<00:03:31.989> delay<00:03:32.049> between<00:03:32.320> each<00:03:32.680> button

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
5 millisecond delay between each button

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.280 
5 millisecond delay between each button
and<00:03:33.220> it<00:03:33.820> will<00:03:33.850> execute<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:34.720> then<00:03:34.930> you<00:03:35.110> can<00:03:35.260> set

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
and it will execute and then you can set

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.350 
and it will execute and then you can set
go<00:03:35.769> back<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.130> sewing<00:03:36.310> buttons<00:03:36.670> here<00:03:37.000> and

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.180 

you<00:03:40.360> set<00:03:40.690> it<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.959> a<00:03:40.989> macro<00:03:41.380> or<00:03:41.410> which<00:03:41.890> button

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
you set it to a macro or which button

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.699 
you set it to a macro or which button
you<00:03:42.280> would<00:03:42.370> like<00:03:43.380> so<00:03:44.380> um<00:03:45.220> if<00:03:46.060> I<00:03:46.360> have<00:03:46.840> a<00:03:46.870> look<00:03:47.110> if

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
you would like so um if I have a look if

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.979 
you would like so um if I have a look if
we<00:03:47.920> take<00:03:48.070> a<00:03:48.130> look<00:03:48.220> at<00:03:48.370> my<00:03:48.430> rapid<00:03:48.910> fire<00:03:49.150> one<00:03:49.750> as

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
we take a look at my rapid fire one as

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.140 
we take a look at my rapid fire one as
you<00:03:50.260> can<00:03:50.410> see<00:03:50.620> this<00:03:50.860> is<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.070> 10<00:03:51.430> millisecond<00:03:52.060> 1

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
you can see this is the 10 millisecond 1

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.750 
you can see this is the 10 millisecond 1
i've<00:03:52.299> got<00:03:53.019> just<00:03:53.049> a<00:03:53.440> heap<00:03:53.739> of<00:03:53.920> clicks<00:03:54.220> with<00:03:54.640> the

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
i've got just a heap of clicks with the

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.210 
i've got just a heap of clicks with the
10<00:03:54.940> millisecond<00:03:55.450> delay<00:03:55.510> so<00:03:56.049> rapid<00:03:57.010> fire

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
10 millisecond delay so rapid fire

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.400 
10 millisecond delay so rapid fire
obviously<00:03:57.910> that's<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.390> lowest<00:03:58.840> i<00:03:59.110> think<00:03:59.320> you

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
obviously that's the lowest i think you

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.590 
obviously that's the lowest i think you
can<00:03:59.560> go<00:03:59.650> without<00:03:59.860> having<00:04:00.430> minecraft<00:04:00.880> crap<00:04:01.420> out

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
can go without having minecraft crap out

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.300 
can go without having minecraft crap out
on<00:04:01.630> you<00:04:02.430> here's<00:04:03.430> my<00:04:03.459> hg<00:04:03.850> join<00:04:05.280> 20-second<00:04:06.280> delay

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
on you here's my hg join 20-second delay

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.900 
on you here's my hg join 20-second delay
out<00:04:06.700> 20<00:04:07.030> millisecond<00:04:07.570> delay<00:04:07.630> otherwise<00:04:08.110> the

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
out 20 millisecond delay otherwise the

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.550 
out 20 millisecond delay otherwise the
typing<00:04:09.910> won't<00:04:10.060> beat<00:04:10.239> up<00:04:10.390> that's<00:04:11.170> mainly<00:04:11.350> what

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
typing won't beat up that's mainly what
