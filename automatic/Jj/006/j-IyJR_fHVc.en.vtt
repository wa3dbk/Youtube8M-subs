is going to be the whole time many how
is<00:01:04.880> it<00:01:05.880> possible<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.299> one<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.510> these<00:01:06.659> rogue

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
is it possible that one of these rogue

will<00:01:09.330> be<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.510> one<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:10.470> will<00:01:10.619> hit<00:01:10.770> Earth<00:01:10.950> I

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
will be the one that will hit Earth I

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.250 
will be the one that will hit Earth I
believe<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.270> very<00:01:12.479> possible<00:01:12.659> because<00:01:13.080> we

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
believe it's very possible because we

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.020 
believe it's very possible because we
are<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.890> last<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.400> last<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> last
