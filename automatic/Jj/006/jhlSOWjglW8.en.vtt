00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.190
 his little ones these little treats to 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.150
 honey base being prepared

 traditionally in the month of Ramadan 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.779
 a recipe that remains simple and 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.189
 economic 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.749
 so we start by putting all the 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.109
 ingredients to form the dough in the 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:26.570
 robot tank or in a container 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:32.540
 so I put some flour I put some 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:34.280
 melted butter of salt to scent these 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.190
 cupcakes I'm going to put some 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.489
 cardamom so powder that's what 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.090
 you see and cinnamon powder 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.760
 if we can replace them with 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.170
 vanilla for example but the rate 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.320
 their canines it marries perfectly 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.780
 with the end of the same game but also the 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.280
 baking powder 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.750
 we will start now pick up the 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.120
 paste by adding water as and when 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.969
 measure it will knead well by the 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.769
 following either to the robot or to the hand 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.100
 to have a dough that is flexible and 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.100
 homogeneous 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:23.340
 divide the dough into several balls 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.180
 alain rolling pin we will spread 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.049
 each ball of dough on a plane of 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.390
 floured work 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.509
 indeed it is the finest 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.509
 possible 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.140
 dropped on a frying pan 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.509
 nonstick 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.890
 preheat and you cook very 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.890
 quickly without being golden 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.280
 now it would take every 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.670
 can you or the road is she a 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.440
 cigar trying to tighten well and to 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.410
 the end it will stick with yellow 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.400
 of egg or a mixture of flour and water 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.400
 for well welded 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.629
 pairs of sugar diagonally in 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.629
 pieces about 2 cm 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.390
 we're going to fry them in a bath 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.370
 hot oil until it starts 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.930
 to gild and then we will remove them from 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.230
 the oil to dive them immediately 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.910
 in warm honey or syrup 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.560
 sugar 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.330
 afterwards it will have to be drained and 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.130
 decorate with sesame seeds 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.600
 roasted 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.950
