an inch to a quarter inch of plate
I<00:00:41.400> run<00:00:42.390> my<00:00:42.570> chain<00:00:42.930> tight<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:43.710> about<00:00:43.949> a

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:43.979 
I run my chain tight so it's about a

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:49.479 
I run my chain tight so it's about a
quarter<00:00:44.339> inch<00:00:44.370> here<00:00:45.920> all<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.280> way<00:00:47.400> around<00:00:47.699> so

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
quarter inch here all the way around so

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.880 
quarter inch here all the way around so
draw<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.640> back<00:00:50.850> using<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.360> set<00:00:51.629> screws<00:00:51.960> one

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
draw it back using the set screws one

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.710 
draw it back using the set screws one
two<00:00:53.159> one<00:00:53.610> two<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:54.089> two<00:00:54.510> one<00:00:55.019> two<00:00:55.049> each<00:00:55.739> side

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
two one two one two one two each side

two one two one two one two each side
this<00:00:57.720> left<00:00:58.080> side<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.619> not<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.100> only<00:00:59.460> side<00:00:59.760> that

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
this left side is not the only side that

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.240 
this left side is not the only side that
will<00:01:00.479> keep<00:01:00.839> the<00:01:01.049> chain<00:01:01.320> tight<00:01:01.710> or<00:01:01.920> draw<00:01:02.100> it

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
will keep the chain tight or draw it

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.119 
will keep the chain tight or draw it
back<00:01:02.400> in<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.699> position<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.150> like<00:01:03.830> this<00:01:04.830> side

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
back in the position you like this side

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.240 
back in the position you like this side
too<00:01:05.400> will<00:01:05.640> also<00:01:05.670> draw<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.150> chain<00:01:06.479> tighter<00:01:07.250> it

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
too will also draw the chain tighter it

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.219 
too will also draw the chain tighter it
does<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.729> because<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.240> straightens<00:01:09.840> up<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
does that because it straightens up the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.020 
does that because it straightens up the
freewheel<00:01:10.650> here<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.159> pulls<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.609> back<00:01:11.670> even

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
freewheel here and pulls it back even

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.550 
freewheel here and pulls it back even
though<00:01:12.180> it's<00:01:12.329> on<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.539> far<00:01:12.750> side<00:01:12.780> it'll<00:01:13.259> still

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
though it's on this far side it'll still

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.740 
though it's on this far side it'll still
put<00:01:13.770> pressure<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.280> if<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.390> think<00:01:15.539> your

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
put pressure here so if you think your

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.330 
put pressure here so if you think your
wheels<00:01:15.930> getting<00:01:16.289> too<00:01:16.439> crooked<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.070> left

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
wheels getting too crooked to the left

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.099 
wheels getting too crooked to the left
when<00:01:18.000> you're<00:01:18.119> looking<00:01:18.329> at<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.689> way<00:01:18.899> and

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:19.109 
when you're looking at it this way and

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:21.249 
when you're looking at it this way and
the<00:01:19.979> change<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.369> not<00:01:20.399> getting<00:01:20.789> tight<00:01:20.969> enough

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
the change is not getting tight enough

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.450 
the change is not getting tight enough
straighten<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.350> out<00:01:22.469> and<00:01:22.679> you're<00:01:22.979> also<00:01:23.189> going

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
straighten it out and you're also going

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.800 
straighten it out and you're also going
to<00:01:23.520> notice<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.359> chains<00:01:24.600> getting

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
to notice that the chains getting

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.889 
to notice that the chains getting
tighter<00:01:25.429> so<00:01:26.450> you're<00:01:27.450> trying<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.719> get<00:01:27.780> your

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
tighter so you're trying to get your

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.899 
tighter so you're trying to get your
wheel<00:01:28.079> straight<00:01:28.350> with<00:01:28.469> the<00:01:28.560> tensioners<00:01:29.039> keep

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
wheel straight with the tensioners keep

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.789 
wheel straight with the tensioners keep
in<00:01:30.060> mind<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.539> the<00:01:30.689> right<00:01:30.840> side<00:01:31.170> will<00:01:31.590> also

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
in mind that the right side will also

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.440 
in mind that the right side will also
tighten<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.250> chain<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.700> might<00:01:32.850> make<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.060> too

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
tighten the chain you might make it too

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.300 
tighten the chain you might make it too
tight<00:01:33.719> causing<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.590> snap<00:01:34.799> off<00:01:35.009> when<00:01:35.189> it's

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
tight causing it to snap off when it's

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.370 
tight causing it to snap off when it's
under<00:01:35.520> load<00:01:35.729> might<00:01:36.509> not<00:01:36.659> snap<00:01:36.899> the<00:01:37.049> first<00:01:37.259> or

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
under load might not snap the first or

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.200 
under load might not snap the first or
second<00:01:37.679> time<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.070> will<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.490> too<00:01:38.670> tight<00:01:38.909> so

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
second time but it will is too tight so

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.950 
second time but it will is too tight so
watch<00:01:39.630> out<00:01:39.840> for<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.109> as<00:01:40.259> well<00:01:41.450> after<00:01:42.450> you

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
watch out for that as well after you

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.739 
watch out for that as well after you
have<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:44.280> wheel<00:01:44.490> position<00:01:45.030> where<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.570> like

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:45.749 
have the wheel position where you like

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:48.620 
have the wheel position where you like
it<00:01:45.859> to<00:01:46.859> chain<00:01:47.130> tight<00:01:47.429> and<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.450> wheels
