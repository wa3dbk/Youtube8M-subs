Kart because you got three different

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.840 
Kart because you got three different
types<00:05:46.210> of<00:05:46.390> drifts<00:05:46.690> you<00:05:46.780> can<00:05:46.930> use<00:05:47.670> for<00:05:48.670> three

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
types of drifts you can use for three

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.490 
types of drifts you can use for three
different<00:05:49.030> levels<00:05:49.570> and<00:05:49.990> the<00:05:50.110> harder<00:05:50.440> the

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
different levels and the harder the

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.260 
different levels and the harder the
longer<00:05:50.830> you<00:05:51.250> hold<00:05:51.370> in<00:05:51.550> the<00:05:51.640> drift<00:05:51.910> and<00:05:52.120> bigger

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
longer you hold in the drift and bigger

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.090 
longer you hold in the drift and bigger
the<00:05:52.510> groups<00:05:52.690> to<00:05:52.870> get<00:05:53.050> I<00:05:53.320> really<00:05:53.560> do<00:05:53.710> like<00:05:53.830> that
