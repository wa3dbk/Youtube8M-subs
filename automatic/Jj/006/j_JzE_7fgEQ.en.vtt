00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 and you saw that hackers used a 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.940
 ness control to drive a car 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.700

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.139
 were you already guiding the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.000
 car does not know what I did 18 years of 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.529
 unlikely victory since the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.500
 joking you might think it's fake 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.619
 but it was not two hackers two guys who 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.160
 move safely they hacked c and c 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.050
 ú 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.929
 this is the electronic control unit 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.079
 they sacked a 2010 ford exhaust and 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.480
 also no toyota prius to control 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.460
 they through commands of a nerd 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.440
 connected and a notebook he can 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.960
 do this because it is a truth truth 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.680
 information system that controls 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.559
 various functions of the vehicle such as the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.879
 steering wheel brake plus some things then 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.640
 such controlled system 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.469
 computer can be hacked face then 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.149
 this can actually be a danger to 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.670
 the gifts vehicles 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.340
 charlie miller who wanted to talk sec 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.010
 they were funded by the institute 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.810
 called research is faith of the pentagon 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.880
 they have created a whole system that can 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.439
 connect your bare notebook to your 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.540
 vehicle he actually got 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.210
 control through the laptop 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.280
 using only left side buttons 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.770
 and right of the messi also in acceleration 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.340
 brakes with two neighboring buttons on the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.840
 east 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.250
 this is logical that it is not easy to control 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.860
 100 of him that the vascaíno steering wheel 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.170
 weird right for nothing 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.000
 did not take the camera but controls 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.460
 tapioca of known this was our 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.610
 sensational ever again behind the wheel or 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.810
 now take control of my baby or 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.340
 any other control that has a 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.930
 A little bit more I'll put my 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.110
 car and I'll drive you with the juveniles 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.790

 experiments event for what to show 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.829

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.110
 hacker control the car on the road 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.750
 conquering 300 per hour can be 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.299
 quiet time for more than 110 that 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.180
 there and 120 are also good for 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.000
 paulo that has a beautiful there well but neither 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.040
 very fast and can be easily 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.229
 of 20 against the white castle floor then 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.709
 That's it. Let's keep driving there. 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.360
 virtual cars in chic mark people 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.610
 It makes pedro ken send a lot 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.580
 we advise you to use the 27 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.320
 the same steering wheel to some 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.210
 to leave their racing game very 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.950
 closer to the real but of course it is 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.910
 interesting this news is of course 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.770
 interesting to know that you can 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.110
 control the giant car of many 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.030
 lucas kilos even using only one 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.460
 Simple control, bye, guys. 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.640
 will get control of the atari and speak 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.250
 so i 'm wrong now i 'm going there count 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.010
 regressive to cast a man his cell 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.200
 in space 5 4 3 2 1 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:51.090
 today, even if it is to see on the button of a 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:53.010
 extension only gives to all sides 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.950
 I could control the racing car, right? 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.130
 could control the robozinho de marx where 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.130
 found the stock exchange control 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.580

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.130
 from orkut to buy cake at the fair 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.650

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.600
 stirring the pan ends up not giving voice to 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.600
