00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
got this snappy and then like if I go

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.519 
got this snappy and then like if I go
here<00:00:23.340> I'm<00:00:23.760> not<00:00:24.029> gonna<00:00:24.180> open<00:00:24.449> up<00:00:24.689> my<00:00:24.840> joints<00:00:25.380> and

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
practice snapping it there and then this

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.080 
practice snapping it there and then this
one<00:00:37.829> when<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.340> have<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.610> thumb<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:38.969> go

down you want to snap it with the wrist
who<00:00:41.850> you're<00:00:42.030> not<00:00:42.120> gonna<00:00:42.270> use<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.660> joint

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
who you're not gonna use this joint

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.040 
who you're not gonna use this joint
angle<00:00:43.350> or<00:00:44.340> like<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.629> basically

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
angle or like this so you so basically

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.630 
angle or like this so you so basically
you're<00:00:46.289> gonna<00:00:46.410> go<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:47.190> this

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
you're gonna go like this

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.729 
you're gonna go like this
like<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.360> event<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:48.989> then<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.289> thumb<00:00:49.469> comes

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
like this event so then the thumb comes

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.979 
like this event so then the thumb comes
down<00:00:49.920> here<00:00:50.129> then<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.730> snap<00:00:51.149> back<00:00:51.180> up<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.870> then

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
down here then you snap back up and then

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.299 
down here then you snap back up and then
you<00:00:52.020> close<00:00:52.410> your<00:00:52.559> hand<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.010> you're<00:00:53.129> ready

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
you close your hand so you're ready

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.549 
you close your hand so you're ready
you're<00:00:53.850> caught<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.480> you're<00:00:54.870> ready<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.140> do

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
you're caught and you're ready to do

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.650 
you're caught and you're ready to do
that<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:56.100> kind<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.370> kind<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.300> keep<00:00:57.480> that

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
that to kind of kind of keep that

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:15.140 
that to kind of kind of keep that
roundness<00:00:58.590> mm-hmm<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.580> think<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.880> think<00:01:15.000> of

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
roundness mm-hmm so I think you think of

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:28.850 
roundness mm-hmm so I think you think of
like<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> drum<00:01:15.720> like<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> drum<00:01:27.259> and<00:01:28.259> just<00:01:28.619> keep

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
like a drum like a drum and just keep

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.859 
like a drum like a drum and just keep
practicing<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.329> can<00:01:30.450> do<00:01:30.540> as<00:01:30.630> many<00:01:30.810> as

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
practicing it and you can do as many as

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.010 
practicing it and you can do as many as
you<00:01:30.960> want<00:01:31.259> then<00:01:31.860> practising<00:01:32.790> where<00:01:33.450> each<00:01:33.689> one

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
you want then practising where each one

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.499 
you want then practising where each one
has<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> sink<00:01:35.729> though<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.060> know<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.390> you're

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
has a sink though you know so you're

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.740 
has a sink though you know so you're
going<00:01:37.400> image<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.549> three<00:01:38.820> over<00:01:38.970> four<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:39.659> you

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
going image is three over four so if you

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.899 
going image is three over four so if you
have<00:01:39.840> three<00:01:40.079> strokes<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.619> do<00:01:40.799> four<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.850> I

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
have three strokes and you do four so I

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.430 
have three strokes and you do four so I
go

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.040 

then<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.620> next<00:01:48.890> one<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:49.250> if<00:01:49.370> I<00:01:49.430> go<00:01:49.610> 1<00:01:49.940> 2<00:01:50.300> 3<00:01:50.330> or

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
then the next one so if I go 1 2 3 or

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.140 
then the next one so if I go 1 2 3 or
naturally<00:01:51.740> this<00:01:51.890> is<00:01:51.950> going<00:01:52.190> to<00:01:52.250> be<00:01:52.400> the<00:01:52.940> next

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
naturally this is going to be the next

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.590 
naturally this is going to be the next
one<00:01:53.420> if<00:01:53.600> I<00:01:53.750> go<00:01:53.960> 1<00:01:54.260> 2<00:01:54.979> 3<00:01:55.119> 4<00:01:56.119> &amp;<00:01:57.020> 1<00:01:57.650> 2<00:01:57.890> 3<00:01:58.220> or<00:01:58.580> so<00:01:58.909> how<00:01:59.060> it

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
one if I go 1 2 3 4 &amp; 1 2 3 or so how it

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.690 
one if I go 1 2 3 4 &amp; 1 2 3 or so how it
starts<00:02:00.050> and<00:02:00.170> finishes<00:02:00.350> on<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.800> same<00:02:01.070> one<00:02:01.310> the

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
starts and finishes on the same one the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.469 
starts and finishes on the same one the
1<00:02:01.880> 2<00:02:02.540> 3<00:02:03.200> 4<00:02:03.860> then<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.700> next<00:02:04.940> point<00:02:05.119> is<00:02:05.240> going<00:02:05.390> to

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
1 2 3 4 then the next point is going to

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:20.199 
1 2 3 4 then the next point is going to
be<00:02:18.010> you'll<00:02:19.010> just<00:02:19.160> work<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.489> out<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:19.790> each<00:02:19.940> one

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
be you'll just work it out and each one

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.850 
be you'll just work it out and each one
will<00:02:20.600> be<00:02:20.720> strong<00:02:21.050> because<00:02:21.260> it's<00:02:21.530> used<00:02:21.739> to

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
will be strong because it's used to

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:33.759 
will be strong because it's used to
being<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.550> starting<00:02:22.940> finger<00:02:23.270> if<00:02:23.360> I<00:02:23.450> go<00:02:32.769> and

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
being the starting finger if I go and

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.199 
being the starting finger if I go and
just<00:02:34.040> work<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.310> out<00:02:34.400> that's<00:02:34.610> on<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.820> wrist<00:02:35.030> and

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
just work it out that's on the wrist and

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.660 
just work it out that's on the wrist and
always<00:02:35.390> try<00:02:35.570> to<00:02:35.600> keep<00:02:35.780> this<00:02:35.930> horseshoe<00:02:36.470> and

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.850 

you<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:40.910> don't<00:02:41.060> want<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.239> come<00:02:41.360> when<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:41.570> go

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860
