00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.900
 or girls and boys welcome one day 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.450
 more and in today's video just as 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.560
 I had promised I will decorate my house 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.690
 for Christmas 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.670
 I'm going to teach the entry so that 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.480
 you see well you see the poinsettia 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.480
 what a gift 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.640
 I'm going to start decorating with these two 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.699
 Easter flowers as you see I'm going to 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.440
 put the zeal and decorum the door of the 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:38.000
 entrance both from the inside 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.000
 as for the outside 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.800
 the hall I decided to put the doll 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.180
 of snow that I had lain so much 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:51.010
 together with three little balls she also red 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.010
 I have put these little lights 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.890
 which as you can see changes color and gives a 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.530
 very nice touch 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.470
 along with the candle that I already had and this 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.720
 another portabella so well there you have 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.470
 to me 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.470
 Hello 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.710
 here you have the kitchen without decorations 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.909
 I'm going to focus mainly on the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.909
 office area 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.640
 for this as my red kitchen 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.710
 I'm going to use this tape that has 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.899
 bright reds and I've decorated the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.530
 four chairs for this I have used the 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.530
 safety pins 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.340
 and as you see that would be the result is a 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.259
 very simple detail and brings a touch 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.990
 Christmas and with the rest that I had 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.340
 I have decided to use it for 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.340
 make a table runner 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.690
 in the refrigerator I used these 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.440
 magnets as you see this kingdom and little doll 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.950
 of snow and in the other the sledge with the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.950
 Teddy 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.040
 I 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.120
 now let's go to the living room my decoration is 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.120
 very minimalist 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.190
 mainly I'm going to focus on the 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.350
 table that had decorate for dinner 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.230
 of Christmas 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.040
 and in that corner I'm just going to put the 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.710
 arch so let's see it we have 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.160
 the tree that as you see the one that I showed you 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.800
 in the hall is a white tree of the web 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.110
 vips you are going to leave the link below in the 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.830
 information box and to take care of 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.880
 the tree 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.140
 I used this kind of a tablecloth or 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.290
 I do not know what to call it is done 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.290
 specifically 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.760
 that has as detail a doll of 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.760
 snow with a mouse and good reasons 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.770
 I will decorate the tree with balls 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:31.110
 gold and silver a mixture of balls 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.110
 of different sizes as well as I'm 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.980
 I have also used apart from balls 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.980
 Other details such as this flower 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.569
 and how could the butterfly not miss 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.430
 you already know that I love them I think 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.430
 It gives a very nice and different touch 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.659
 I have also combined other balls that 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.659
 They look like pinecones 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.490
 I decided to mix the gold and the 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.310
 plated just by the quartzite wall 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:15.260
 that as you can see has both gray stones 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.260
 as well as gold 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.410
 and to finish the tree at the tip I've 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.410
 put this little star 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.139
 we add the sweets that I found these 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.800
 Super nice, they delivered super 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.800
 original 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.729
 and finally this kingdom with screams 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.470
 that would be the 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.930
 to the table 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.120
 I used a red tablecloth to give it 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.750
 the highlight that is let's say the center 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:06.000
 attention and the tablecloth has a ribbon 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.000
 silver also quite bright 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.349
 a good idea to decorate the chairs 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.889
 is to create some ties I followed my nya 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.889
 the silver 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.440
 and I'm going to make the centerpiece for 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.590
 he used a glass plate and 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.930
 I pour sand dam I put a candle 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.430
 as you see in the form of a ball that 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.000
 I add two more candles also in 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:41.069
 silver and finally that reason 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.069
 Christmas leaflets 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.660
 to put the dishes first I put 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.520
 these covers dishes I do not know how to call it 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:06:00.370
 I used a square crockery because 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.370
 I think it's more special for that night 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.310
 and apart from that presentation too 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.740
 You can use this other wrap 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:13.069
 as if it were a gift 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.080
 I leave these two options and I'm going to 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:17.900
 decanting to use the tableware 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.210
 normal and current the tablecloth has 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.460
 Christmas motifs added these 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:25.000
 of snow both in white and in 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.000
 silver 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:37.960
 and on the plates the napkins 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.270
 they are red to follow in the same line 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.979
 of the tablecloth and I used some 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.759
 white bouquets that give a touch 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:44.759
 very original 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:56.160
 as he had no candlestick and decides 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.320
 use the champagne glasses as 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.940
 to have turned it around and I've put a 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.940
 candle on top of each cup 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:17.270
 equal to that would be the final result at 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:20.030
 have the table ready for dinner 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:22.009
 Christmas at the bottom of the tree 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:25.659
 I hope you liked it I send you a 

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:25.659
 kiss and merry christmas
