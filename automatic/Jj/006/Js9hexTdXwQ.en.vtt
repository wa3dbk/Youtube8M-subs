00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.660
 Hi, I'm Adam 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.140
 and today we're gonna look at this great, rotary Cyclone remote control car. 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.900
 The car itself, besides having a great ride, 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.340
 so mainly shining, which makes great effects mainly at night 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.240
 or when the lighting is low. 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.520
 Controlling a Cyclone is really simple. 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.500
 Left Left Wheel Lever 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.820
 right lever for right wheel 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.166
 nastartujem 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.494
 and we can go. 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.240
 I can't show you here because the car is really fast and it would be off the table. 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.440
 I'll show you at least how fast he can spin. 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.680
 That wheel actually forward, backward. 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.360
 The same thing actually does the second round. 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.420
 When the two speeds connect against each other, the rotational speed of that car is really great. 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.540
 It can be used to make the car stand on the back. 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.600
 There is a special wheel for this. 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.780
 So the car rides on four wheels, both forward and backward, actually on the rear. 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.280
 Those of you who can drive a car really well can even build a car for just one lap. 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.280
 Well, why not listen to some nice music. 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.920
 (toy car plays music) 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.120
 Really as fun as fun. 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.220
 (toy car plays music) 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.080
 Well, if you get tired of it, you can turn the car off with the remote control again. 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.140
 Don't forget to turn off even here at the main voter. 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.440
 I think everyone can control the Cyclone car. 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.640
 For children over 3 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.080
 but it is certainly not to say that it is a toy for children only. I enjoyed great fun with him 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.120
 and enjoy the fun with it even bigger or smaller. Of course, adults. 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.960
 There are other remote control cars available in the Děkuji.cz offer - 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.400
 like a Buggy, 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.020
 such as the Chevrolet Silverado, 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.900
 or perhaps an exact copy of a Mustang F150. 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.420
 In this beautiful package we find a remote control for nine volts (that's the flat battery) 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.840
 which is inserted here like this from behind, only a small screwdriver is needed. 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.240
 Next there is the car itself, 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.460
 next to it is a battery that can be charged with the supplied charger. 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:59.720
 We'll use the charger to charge the battery, which actually connects 5 AA batteries into one 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.280
 and connects here with the cable. 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.020
 So the cable is simply unplugged, plugged into the charger, pushed into the socket, 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:15.320
 The 2 watches wait and the car is fully charged and you can start driving it again. 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.340
 It lasts quite a long time - about 20 to 30 minutes. 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:28.720
 Thank you for your attention and I will be looking forward to seeing you next video on Děkuji.cz next time.
