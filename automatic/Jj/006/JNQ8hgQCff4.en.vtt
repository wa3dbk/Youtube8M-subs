to be 60 degree regular than 30 degree
reverse<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:47.250> means<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.760> should<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:47.940> able<00:00:48.059> to

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
reverse this means it should be able to

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.420 
reverse this means it should be able to
cut<00:00:48.390> about<00:00:48.600> half<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:49.020> QB<00:00:49.379> oh<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.559> 45<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.370> a

can go past 45 degrees line to line and
it<00:00:57.329> could<00:00:57.420> go<00:00:57.570> no<00:00:57.809> problem<00:00:58.230> almost<00:00:58.620> effortless

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
it could go no problem almost effortless

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.310 
it could go no problem almost effortless
anything<00:01:00.000> past<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.660> will<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.020> wouldn't

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
anything past that it will it wouldn't

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.799 
anything past that it will it wouldn't
budge<00:01:01.469> as<00:01:01.920> for<00:01:02.820> reverse<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.480> actually

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
budge as for reverse that is actually

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.320 
budge as for reverse that is actually
very<00:01:03.840> close<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> full<00:01:04.830> piece<00:01:05.119> these<00:01:06.119> results

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
very close to a full piece these results

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.090 
very close to a full piece these results
may<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.080> cut<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.470> because<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.979> my

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
may just be cut be because of my

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.850 
may just be cut be because of my
tensions<00:01:08.780> so<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.990> puzzle<00:01:10.380> were<00:01:10.560> attention

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
tensions so the puzzle were attention

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.020 
tensions so the puzzle were attention
differently<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.549> might<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> slight

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
differently it might be a slight

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.510 
differently it might be a slight
improvement<00:01:12.540> corn<00:01:12.750> cutting<00:01:13.049> but<00:01:13.260> honestly<00:01:13.650> if

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
improvement corn cutting but honestly if

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.210 
improvement corn cutting but honestly if
you<00:01:14.700> need<00:01:14.880> 45<00:01:15.240> degrees<00:01:15.720> corner<00:01:16.110> cutting<00:01:16.320> you

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
you need 45 degrees corner cutting you

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.830 
you need 45 degrees corner cutting you
shouldn't<00:01:17.549> really<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.820> getting<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.509> cube

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
shouldn't really be getting this cube

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.300 
shouldn't really be getting this cube
since<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.259> need<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.500> work<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:19.830> your<00:01:19.890> returning

corner<00:01:29.880> twists<00:01:30.180> but<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.360> was<00:01:30.510> turning<00:01:30.690> pretty

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
corner twists but I was turning pretty

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.080 
corner twists but I was turning pretty

there's like these little gaps between
the<00:01:43.140> edges<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.619> corner<00:01:43.950> stocks<00:01:44.190> oh<00:01:44.780> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
the edges and corner stocks oh the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.540 
the edges and corner stocks oh the
corners<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.290> significantly<00:01:47.190> more

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
corners have significantly more

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.639 
corners have significantly more
resistance<00:01:48.180> when<00:01:48.390> trying<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.659> twist<00:01:49.409> them

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
resistance when trying to twist them

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.820 
resistance when trying to twist them
then<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.159> aolong<00:01:50.659> yeah<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.259> now<00:01:52.470> let's<00:01:52.680> go

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
then on the aolong yeah so now let's go

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.010 
then on the aolong yeah so now let's go
over<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> lockups<00:01:53.640> despite<00:01:54.570> their<00:01:54.750> showing

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
over the lockups despite their showing

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.389 
over the lockups despite their showing
corner<00:01:55.350> cutting<00:01:55.530> I'm<00:01:55.770> still<00:01:55.950> able<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.220> get

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
corner cutting I'm still able to get

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.130 
corner cutting I'm still able to get
lock<00:01:56.640> ups<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.119> cube<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.899> from<00:01:58.020> not

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
lock ups on this cube just from not

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.139 
lock ups on this cube just from not
being<00:01:58.200> able<00:01:58.440> to<00:01:58.619> control<00:01:58.800> it<00:01:59.039> that<00:01:59.160> well<00:01:59.369> like

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
being able to control it that well like

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:07.700 
being able to control it that well like
usually<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:01.170> being<00:02:01.440> extremely<00:02:01.950> fast

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.520 

so<00:02:08.710> this<00:02:09.130> cube<00:02:09.460> looks<00:02:09.970> like<00:02:10.600> it<00:02:10.780> basically<00:02:11.260> is

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
so this cube looks like it basically is

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.590 
so this cube looks like it basically is
a<00:02:11.860> combination<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.820> way<00:02:13.090> along<00:02:13.210> and<00:02:13.510> out

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
a combination the way along and out

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.720 
a combination the way along and out
along<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.500> edges<00:02:14.650> are<00:02:14.860> very<00:02:15.070> similar<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.610> an

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
along the edges are very similar to an

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.430 
along the edges are very similar to an
hour<00:02:15.850> long<00:02:16.090> where<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.600> corners<00:02:16.960> look<00:02:17.230> more

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
hour long where the corners look more

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.650 
hour long where the corners look more
like<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.620> way<00:02:17.830> long<00:02:18.040> but<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.850> pay<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.300> pieces

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
like a way long but the pay the pieces

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.720 
like a way long but the pay the pieces
fit<00:02:19.840> together<00:02:19.990> very<00:02:20.530> nicely<00:02:21.010> preventing

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
fit together very nicely preventing

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.270 
fit together very nicely preventing
corner<00:02:22.000> choice<00:02:22.210> and<00:02:22.390> pops<00:02:22.950> taking<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.010> look<00:02:24.160> at

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
corner choice and pops taking a look at

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.530 
corner choice and pops taking a look at
the<00:02:24.370> center's<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:25.000> can<00:02:25.120> tell<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.330> they

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
the center's you can tell that they

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.630 
the center's you can tell that they
aren't<00:02:25.690> as<00:02:25.840> rounded<00:02:26.380> as<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.680> outline<00:02:27.040> it

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
aren't as rounded as the outline it

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.250 
aren't as rounded as the outline it
looks<00:02:27.790> more<00:02:28.030> like<00:02:28.180> an<00:02:28.300> octagon<00:02:28.750> with<00:02:28.900> the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
looks more like an octagon with the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.200 
looks more like an octagon with the
slightly<00:02:29.710> rounded<00:02:30.220> corners<00:02:30.610> at<00:02:30.820> a<00:02:30.850> square

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
slightly rounded corners at a square

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.750 
slightly rounded corners at a square
with<00:02:31.420> very<00:02:31.720> rounded<00:02:32.140> corners<00:02:32.500> this<00:02:33.400> may<00:02:33.580> help

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
with very rounded corners this may help

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.699 
with very rounded corners this may help
with<00:02:33.850> corner<00:02:34.270> twisting<00:02:34.690> while<00:02:35.110> I'm<00:02:35.290> while
