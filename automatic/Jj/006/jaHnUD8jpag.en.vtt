totally forgot to cut it out when the
glue<00:04:30.960> wasn't<00:04:31.410> dry<00:04:31.560> that<00:04:31.740> would<00:04:31.860> have<00:04:31.950> been<00:04:32.040> a

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
glue wasn't dry that would have been a

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.620 
glue wasn't dry that would have been a
bit<00:04:32.520> smarter<00:04:32.970> but<00:04:33.150> uh<00:04:34.520> yeah<00:04:35.520> I<00:04:35.910> totally<00:04:36.270> forgot

about it so I had to wait till it a
dried<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.210> then<00:04:39.240> use<00:04:39.660> like<00:04:39.870> a<00:04:39.900> hacksaw<00:04:40.470> but

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
dried and then use like a hacksaw but

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.740 
dried and then use like a hacksaw but
yeah<00:04:41.669> this<00:04:41.880> is<00:04:42.060> a<00:04:42.950> the<00:04:43.950> modern<00:04:44.310> warfare<00:04:44.460> 2<00:04:45.389> &amp;<00:04:45.660> 3

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
yeah this is a the modern warfare 2 &amp; 3

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.159 
yeah this is a the modern warfare 2 &amp; 3
throwing<00:04:46.380> knife<00:04:47.389> looks<00:04:48.389> pretty<00:04:48.660> cool<00:04:48.870> this<00:04:49.110> is

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
throwing knife looks pretty cool this is

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.310 
throwing knife looks pretty cool this is
just<00:04:49.680> like<00:04:49.740> shoelace<00:04:50.639> I<00:04:51.030> just<00:04:51.870> wrapped<00:04:52.110> around

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
just like shoelace I just wrapped around

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.280 
just like shoelace I just wrapped around
so<00:04:52.889> you<00:04:52.919> can<00:04:53.250> hold<00:04:53.669> it<00:04:53.820> like<00:04:53.910> this<00:04:53.970> i<00:04:54.360> guess<00:04:54.570> but

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
so you can hold it like this i guess but

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:02.719 
so you can hold it like this i guess but
uh<00:04:56.780> this<00:04:57.780> feels<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.650> lot<00:04:59.130> better<00:05:01.220> but<00:05:02.220> yeah<00:05:02.400> I<00:05:02.430> I

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
uh this feels a lot better but yeah I I

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:04.400 
uh this feels a lot better but yeah I I
try<00:05:03.030> to<00:05:03.060> make<00:05:03.240> it<00:05:03.300> close<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:03.990> modern

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
try to make it close to the modern

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.010 
try to make it close to the modern
warfare<00:05:04.620> oh<00:05:05.040> my<00:05:05.790> i<00:05:05.820> added<00:05:06.360> that<00:05:06.510> hole<00:05:06.810> which

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
warfare oh my i added that hole which

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.800 
warfare oh my i added that hole which
was<00:05:07.169> a<00:05:07.200> very<00:05:07.590> hard<00:05:07.830> to<00:05:07.950> cut<00:05:08.190> um<00:05:08.510> you<00:05:09.510> can<00:05:09.630> see

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
was a very hard to cut um you can see

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.610 
was a very hard to cut um you can see
it's<00:05:09.960> still<00:05:10.169> not<00:05:10.320> perfect<00:05:11.960> but<00:05:13.160> whatever<00:05:14.160> I

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
it's still not perfect but whatever I

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.719 
it's still not perfect but whatever I
still<00:05:16.620> like<00:05:16.770> it<00:05:16.800> that<00:05:17.130> was<00:05:17.250> pretty<00:05:17.430> cool<00:05:19.729> so

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
still like it that was pretty cool so

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:27.290 
still like it that was pretty cool so
