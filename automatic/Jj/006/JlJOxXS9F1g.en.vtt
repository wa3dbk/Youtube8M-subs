I

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
I

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.129 
I
test<00:00:13.860> out<00:00:14.099> upon<00:00:14.519> reading<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.930> first

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
test out upon reading it and the first

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.019 
test out upon reading it and the first
thing<00:00:16.379> was<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.010> overpowered<00:00:17.610> behind<00:00:17.910> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
thing was the overpowered behind the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.540 
thing was the overpowered behind the
back<00:00:18.180> dribble<00:00:18.390> animation<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.369> it<00:00:20.369> was

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
back dribble animation and it was

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.640 
back dribble animation and it was
overpowered<00:00:21.180> mainly<00:00:21.599> because<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.990> got<00:00:22.380> a

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
overpowered mainly because you got a

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.429 
overpowered mainly because you got a
speed<00:00:23.310> boost<00:00:23.580> once<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.180> get<00:00:24.360> it<00:00:24.509> and<00:00:24.720> right

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
speed boost once you get it and right

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.140 
speed boost once you get it and right
here<00:00:25.470> you'll<00:00:25.860> notice<00:00:26.009> that<00:00:26.189> they<00:00:26.580> changed<00:00:26.820> it

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
here you'll notice that they changed it

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.830 
here you'll notice that they changed it
they<00:00:27.960> change<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.500> animation<00:00:28.680> upon<00:00:29.840> making

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
they change the animation upon making

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.630 
they change the animation upon making
contact<00:00:31.500> with<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.740> defender<00:00:32.220> and<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.460> looks

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
contact with the defender and it looks

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.670 
contact with the defender and it looks
bumble<00:00:33.239> now<00:00:33.390> actually<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.199> it<00:00:34.260> doesn't<00:00:34.559> look

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
bumble now actually so it doesn't look

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.680 
bumble now actually so it doesn't look
like<00:00:34.949> you<00:00:35.519> can't<00:00:35.760> bump<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.120> at<00:00:36.239> all<00:00:36.449> anymore

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
like you can't bump it at all anymore

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.520 
like you can't bump it at all anymore
because<00:00:37.500> prior<00:00:38.220> to<00:00:38.580> the<00:00:38.730> patch<00:00:39.410> northolt<00:00:40.410> is

because prior to the patch northolt is

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.780 
because prior to the patch northolt is
fell<00:00:40.710> over<00:00:40.890> because<00:00:41.129> play<00:00:41.370> he's<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.670> much

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
fell over because play he's so much

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.579 
fell over because play he's so much
bigger<00:00:41.940> than<00:00:42.089> them<00:00:42.269> by<00:00:42.839> prior<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.379> patch

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
bigger than them by prior to the patch
