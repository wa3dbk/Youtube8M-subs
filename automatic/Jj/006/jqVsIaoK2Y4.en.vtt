00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.200
 here again hello in this video I 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.390
 show you a wonderful beautiful mask 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.520
 aion 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.690
 someone probably remembers the mask that 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.920
 tried to do 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.930
 just before death , wtp 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.940
 intel oh my 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.560
 This is actually a product of the same 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.200
 designer himself who continued 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.530
 mask design 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.490
 what 's uninteresting 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.950
 excellent angle of view 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.800
 excellent angle of view 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.290
 huge glass that goes on and on 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.120
 side masks too 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:43.539
 double lenses on the outside will 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.949
 anti scratch and flax and coating here 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.719
 so glass will not be easy 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.070
 scratch is the first question which i 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.750
 asked because as you see she 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.570
 streamlined and glass if you put 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.470
 mask on face down will touch the table 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:01:00.220
 or something else then 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.220
 very large space 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.790
 inside 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.229
 points and accordingly people who 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.100
 playing with glasses for them will be very 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.820
 comfortable also 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.860
 here 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.350
 foam rubber here 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.870
 Velcro internal and can be removed 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.220
 and change dependencies here 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.740
 the relief of his face that is to someone 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.390
 such foam will be too small 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.760
 or too big ie you can 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.130
 will change the top foam rubber vary 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.289
 will not be 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.920
 plus these are the ones here 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.220
 extra pads 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.840
 that let you hear perfectly 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.370
 teammates because ear 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.710
 the sink is not closed 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.640
 ear protection so here it is to 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:47.970
 rests on the head behind the ears and there is a place 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.610
 for the passage of sounds let's say 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.830
 what else the lens changing system is very 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.830
 interesting that is enough to turn 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.400
 the strap is 90 degrees and 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.470
 the glass is removed 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.920
 there fix back to shoot completely 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.920
 I will not 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.340
 masks will go in different initially 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.970
 will be made in different colors and 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.120
 glasses will 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.820
 ordinary and also glass will be mirrored 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.200
 which kind of one is not mind because with 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.500
 they mask looks very, very 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.019
 cool here but design is enough 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.800
 interesting very similar to attack aircraft from 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.200
 star wars 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.910
 so those who as a child in their war 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.890
 star wars did not finish the game 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.430
 will finish playing using this here 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.019
 great product 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.019
 all bye bye
