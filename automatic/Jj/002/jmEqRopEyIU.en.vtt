 A balanced next-generation tourer concept 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.730
 As a sports wagon in the near future 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.000
 With the novel exterior design which there is no before 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.110
 SUBARU has cultivated for many years 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.060
 We made the functionality of the wagon compatible 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.190
 Horizontally-opposed 1.6-liter direct-injection turbocharged engine 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.340

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.789
 It can be used as an electric car 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:46.889
 On the other hand, during strong acceleration or high-speed driving 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.909
 The engine is also driven according to the driving situation 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.889
 I will control optimally 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.719
 Combined fuel consumption rate per liter 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:01.209
