00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
through it and that is the method i do

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.440 
through it and that is the method i do
after<00:04:16.799> i<00:04:17.010> take<00:04:17.190> out<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.459> weave<00:04:17.609> so<00:04:17.880> what<00:04:18.120> we<00:04:18.239> do

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
after i take out the weave so what we do

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.780 
after i take out the weave so what we do
as<00:04:18.750> well<00:04:19.049> if<00:04:19.230> i<00:04:19.380> was<00:04:19.530> going<00:04:19.739> to<00:04:19.859> be<00:04:20.220> washing<00:04:20.670> my

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.460 
as well if i was going to be washing my
hair<00:04:20.940> what<00:04:21.120> i<00:04:21.150> would<00:04:21.359> do<00:04:21.480> is<00:04:21.630> take<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.169> spray

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
hair what i would do is take the spray

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.100 
hair what i would do is take the spray
bottle<00:04:22.650> full<00:04:22.980> of<00:04:23.040> water<00:04:23.160> and<00:04:23.780> i<00:04:24.780> would<00:04:24.900> spray

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
bottle full of water and i would spray

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.840 
bottle full of water and i would spray
that<00:04:25.290> on<00:04:25.350> and<00:04:25.800> then<00:04:26.100> i<00:04:26.130> take<00:04:26.400> a<00:04:26.460> cheap

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
that on and then i take a cheap

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.060 
that on and then i take a cheap
conditioner<00:04:27.419> and<00:04:27.600> then<00:04:28.350> i<00:04:28.380> would<00:04:28.590> rub<00:04:28.800> it<00:04:28.919> on

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
conditioner and then i would rub it on

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.400 
conditioner and then i would rub it on
the<00:04:29.520> hair<00:04:30.150> cuz<00:04:30.570> if<00:04:30.720> when<00:04:30.870> you<00:04:31.020> take<00:04:31.169> out<00:04:31.260> your

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
the hair cuz if when you take out your

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.010 
the hair cuz if when you take out your
weave<00:04:31.590> it's<00:04:31.800> really<00:04:32.160> dry<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:32.460> its<00:04:32.790> really

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
weave it's really dry and its really

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.440 
weave it's really dry and its really
susceptible<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.410> breakage<00:04:34.800> so<00:04:35.610> what<00:04:36.150> we<00:04:36.240> do<00:04:36.419> is

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
susceptible to breakage so what we do is

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.870 
susceptible to breakage so what we do is
what<00:04:36.840> we're<00:04:36.960> doing<00:04:37.290> by<00:04:37.470> adding<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.370> water<00:04:38.550> and

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
what we're doing by adding the water and

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.060 
what we're doing by adding the water and
the<00:04:39.240> conditioner<00:04:39.870> is<00:04:40.020> infusing<00:04:40.530> moisture<00:04:40.980> on

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
the conditioner is infusing moisture on

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.890 
the conditioner is infusing moisture on
to<00:04:41.250> that<00:04:41.400> and<00:04:42.260> eliminating<00:04:43.260> breakage<00:04:44.190> and

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
to that and eliminating breakage and

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.780 
to that and eliminating breakage and
eliminating<00:04:45.900> dryness<00:04:46.230> so<00:04:47.100> we<00:04:47.340> put<00:04:47.550> that<00:04:47.580> on

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
eliminating dryness so we put that on

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.250 
eliminating dryness so we put that on
spray<00:04:48.090> that<00:04:48.240> on<00:04:48.300> and<00:04:48.540> rub<00:04:48.690> it<00:04:48.720> through<00:04:48.840> and

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
spray that on and rub it through and

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.650 
spray that on and rub it through and
then<00:04:49.380> you<00:04:49.560> comb<00:04:49.800> through<00:04:50.070> it<00:04:50.100> and<00:04:50.480> then<00:04:51.480> if<00:04:51.570> you

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
then you comb through it and then if you

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.120 
then you comb through it and then if you
want<00:04:51.900> you<00:04:52.020> can<00:04:52.230> use<00:04:52.290> an<00:04:52.530> oil<00:04:52.650> I<00:04:52.830> don't<00:04:53.010> usually

then<00:06:15.660> a<00:06:15.690> French<00:06:16.050> roll<00:06:16.490> kind<00:06:17.490> of<00:06:17.520> like<00:06:17.640> what<00:06:17.790> I

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
then a French roll kind of like what I

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.680 
then a French roll kind of like what I
was<00:06:17.970> wearing<00:06:19.700> this<00:06:20.700> ensures<00:06:21.120> that<00:06:21.120> your<00:06:21.360> ends

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
was wearing this ensures that your ends

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.810 
was wearing this ensures that your ends
are<00:06:21.750> protected<00:06:22.320> that's<00:06:23.130> the<00:06:23.340> French<00:06:23.550> roll

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
are protected that's the French roll

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.230 
are protected that's the French roll
method<00:06:24.620> you<00:06:25.620> do<00:06:25.800> that<00:06:25.950> all<00:06:26.100> the<00:06:26.130> way<00:06:26.250> around

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.180 

and<00:06:30.240> then<00:06:30.270> you<00:06:30.990> just<00:06:31.260> secure<00:06:31.650> that<00:06:31.770> with<00:06:31.890> a<00:06:31.950> pin

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
and then you just secure that with a pin

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.890 
and then you just secure that with a pin
so<00:06:32.730> that's<00:06:32.880> the<00:06:32.970> French<00:06:33.240> rule<00:06:33.480> that's<00:06:33.660> what<00:06:33.810> it

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
so that's the French rule that's what it

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.490 
so that's the French rule that's what it
would<00:06:33.990> look<00:06:34.140> like<00:06:35.900> that's<00:06:36.900> a<00:06:37.050> protective

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
would look like that's a protective

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.670 
would look like that's a protective
style<00:06:37.740> or<00:06:38.450> what<00:06:39.450> else<00:06:39.600> could<00:06:39.750> you<00:06:39.810> do<00:06:40.020> you<00:06:40.530> do<00:06:40.650> a
