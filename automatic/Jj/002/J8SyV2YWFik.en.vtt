hey what's up guys the computer drop

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.170 
hey what's up guys the computer drop
here<00:00:11.309> may<00:00:11.550> show<00:00:11.790> you<00:00:11.850> how<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:13.700> test<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:15.000> from

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:15.180 
here may show you how to test you from

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.760 
here may show you how to test you from
other<00:00:15.330> boards<00:00:15.600> working<00:00:15.840> and<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:16.440> one<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.619> had

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
other boards working and this one I had

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.680 
other boards working and this one I had
created<00:00:17.130> who<00:00:17.310> thought<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.789> wouldn't<00:00:18.060> work<00:00:18.270> but

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
created who thought it wouldn't work but

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.630 
created who thought it wouldn't work but
we'll<00:00:19.470> just<00:00:19.500> see<00:00:19.920> what<00:00:20.070> will<00:00:20.190> happen<00:00:20.220> this

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
we'll just see what will happen this

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
first off you're going to have to put

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.769 
first off you're going to have to put
your<00:00:26.189> processor<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.359> -<00:00:28.289> are<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.669> the<00:00:29.669> BAM

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
your processor and - are you the BAM

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.900 
your processor and - are you the BAM
next<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.529> want<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.800> take<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.040> battery<00:00:32.400> just

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
next you want to take the battery just

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.030 
next you want to take the battery just
slide<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.810> in<00:00:33.840> there<00:00:34.640> and<00:00:35.640> there<00:00:36.360> are<00:00:37.040> you

slide it in there and there are you
going<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.250> put<00:00:38.400> it

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
going to put it

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.660 
going to put it
ear<00:00:40.490> password<00:00:41.510> clear<00:00:42.510> password<00:00:43.040> and<00:00:44.040> your

clear CMOS - two and three with the be

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.710 
clear CMOS - two and three with the be
default<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:49.980> got<00:00:50.130> that<00:00:50.340> that's<00:00:50.610> good<00:00:50.970> right

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
default so we got that that's good right

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.650 
default so we got that that's good right

that particular thing then we got a plug
in<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> front<00:01:44.340> panel<00:01:44.729> here<00:01:45.149> because<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.840> is

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
in the front panel here because this is

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.789 
in the front panel here because this is
a<00:01:46.850> desktop<00:01:47.850> one<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.749> it's<00:01:48.929> differently<00:01:49.499> I<00:01:49.530> take

plug it in the back power source
green<00:02:03.119> light<00:02:03.359> indicator<00:02:03.869> here<00:02:04.429> and<00:02:05.429> then<00:02:06.209> with

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
green light indicator here and then with

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.910 
green light indicator here and then with
the<00:02:07.170> four<00:02:07.740> block<00:02:08.060> I'll<00:02:09.060> also<00:02:09.360> put<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
the four block I'll also put in the

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.640 
the four block I'll also put in the
processors<00:02:12.140> here<00:02:13.140> but<00:02:13.350> with<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.069> four<00:02:14.490> block

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.449 

nothing's<00:02:18.650> happening<00:02:19.540> pretty<00:02:20.540> sad<00:02:21.459> we've

nothing's happening pretty sad we've

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.550 
nothing's happening pretty sad we've
make<00:02:22.700> sure<00:02:22.879> that's<00:02:23.120> secure<00:02:23.360> in<00:02:23.930> nothing

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
make sure that's secure in nothing

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.830 
make sure that's secure in nothing
exactly<00:02:25.060> okay<00:02:26.060> let's<00:02:26.420> take<00:02:26.599> it<00:02:26.810> out<00:02:28.450> now<00:02:29.450> we'll

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
exactly okay let's take it out now we'll

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:46.700 
exactly okay let's take it out now we'll
turn<00:02:30.019> this<00:02:30.230> back<00:02:30.500> off<00:02:33.760> it<00:02:34.760> is

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.310 

actually<00:02:47.710> have<00:02:47.800> a<00:02:47.830> tilted<00:02:48.580> sport

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
actually have a tilted sport

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.860 
actually have a tilted sport
besides<00:02:50.320> the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.210 

coupling<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:56.140> back<00:02:56.290> handle<00:02:56.709> that<00:02:56.830> control

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
coupling it back handle that control

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.559 
coupling it back handle that control
circuit<00:02:57.730> pretty<00:02:58.299> bad<00:02:58.629> I<00:02:58.989> wouldn't<00:02:59.439> do<00:02:59.709> that

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
circuit pretty bad I wouldn't do that

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:10.600 
circuit pretty bad I wouldn't do that
but<00:03:01.569> you<00:03:01.720> asked<00:03:01.840> my<00:03:02.019> video<00:03:02.319> see<00:03:02.680> what<00:03:02.829> our<00:03:02.950> guys
