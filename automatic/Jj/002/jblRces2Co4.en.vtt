00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 be nice I remember the respons and in this 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.970
 short tutorial i will explain about how 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.660
 increase the fluidity of our huawei 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.210
 and come down y 300 we know this 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.750
 phone has a very low 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.730
 amount of ram and thanks to this 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:29.130
 tutorial we could try to increase 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:32.900
 little fluidity and then first 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.900
 what should we go in the settings 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.680
 and enable the savings mode 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.590
 energetic 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.410
 then I tell you to activate it not for 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.110
 save battery because the battery 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.940
 it has nothing to do with fluidity but more than that 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.960
 the savings mode is another 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.660
 energetic what it does besides lowering the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.760
 brightness and volume you also needed 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.370
 animations ie animations are 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.730
 all those gestures we have 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.899
 on the iphone or top of the range of 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.540
 samsung 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.670
 thanks to these animations by deactivating 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:16.670
 these animations and the telephone 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:20.130
 it will become faster and obviously and then 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.009
 what will happen you will find rightly the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.380
 lowered brightness is the volume lowers 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:31.439
 propose ok, then you can 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:34.049
 directly to raise you up now 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.240
 too much having enabled saving 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.130
 energy we always go to 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.310
 settings and let's go to the options 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:48.600
 developer let's go to the section 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.640
 drawing here drawing and fly the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.360
 animator duration calls them removal 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.420
 disabled then we always go down and 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.030
 let's go to limit processes and background 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.220
 we put only two processes to us 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.610
 then the latter option I noticed 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.160
 that when the phone turns off and you 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.970
 back on I noticed these options 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.940
 deactivates in the sense that it returns to 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.680
 factory settings 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.920
 then in your case you guys 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.320
 advice of if for example you are there 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.690
 downloading not to shut it down 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.450
 absolutely charge it immediately without it 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.110
 that you are out and you will not be able to load them 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.020
 in that case it will go out because one 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.540
 once you turn off, you will follow these 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.850
 options return as before 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.340
 so what do you have to do and turn it back on 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.310
 of the phone go to the options of the 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.700
 developer and put the tick back only 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:53.630
 two processes in this way you will have a 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:57.530
 phone faster because what he will do 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.180
 keeps active only while two processes if 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.400
 there are more processes open than those 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.400
 processes will close automatically 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:11.320
 so guys I hope I've been there 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.320
 help and see you at the next video
