discretion is the better part of valor
and<00:00:14.870> I<00:00:17.240> have<00:00:19.010> successfully<00:00:20.010> negotiated<00:00:20.670> a

maybe<00:00:26.760> they<00:00:26.939> are<00:00:27.029> stratocumulus<00:00:27.539> head<00:00:28.140> there

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
maybe they are stratocumulus head there

maybe they are stratocumulus head there
aren't<00:00:28.470> any<00:00:28.590> puddles<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.189> them<00:00:29.340> some

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
aren't any puddles on to them some

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.069 
aren't any puddles on to them some
pretty<00:00:30.269> sure<00:00:30.449> they're<00:00:30.660> safe<00:00:30.869> but<00:00:31.140> no<00:00:33.079> buts

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
pretty sure they're safe but no buts

good<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.600> know<00:00:37.640> you're<00:00:38.640> not<00:00:38.700> perfectly<00:00:39.270> sure

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
good you know you're not perfectly sure

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.440 
good you know you're not perfectly sure
then<00:00:39.950> why<00:00:40.950> not<00:00:41.100> do<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.640> right<00:00:41.910> thing<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.390> not

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
then why not do the right thing it's not

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.080 
then why not do the right thing it's not
going<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.750> cost<00:00:42.960> anything<00:00:43.879> but<00:00:44.879> we<00:00:44.969> are

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
going to cost anything but we are

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.900 
going to cost anything but we are
deviating<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.930> left<00:00:46.670> around<00:00:47.670> that

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910

build-up<00:00:48.390> 0<00:00:48.600> for<00:00:48.780> 2<00:00:48.930> 240<00:00:49.789> fingerpad<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.000> gonna

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
build-up 0 for 2 240 fingerpad you gonna

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.049 
build-up 0 for 2 240 fingerpad you gonna
get<00:00:51.570> out<00:00:51.690> we're<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:53.329> 220<00:00:54.329> climbing<00:00:54.930> 250<00:00:56.059> so

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
get out we're at 220 climbing 250 so

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.700 
get out we're at 220 climbing 250 so
will<00:00:58.309> will<00:00:59.309> more<00:00:59.520> than<00:00:59.579> likely<00:00:59.640> up<00:01:00.210> top<00:01:00.960> you

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
will will more than likely up top you

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.340 
will will more than likely up top you
know<00:01:01.829> most<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.340> Adam<00:01:03.199> you<00:01:04.199> don't

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
know most of this Adam you don't

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.440 
know most of this Adam you don't
evaluate<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.920> rest<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.220> go<00:01:05.339> along<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:06.240> one

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
evaluate the rest we go along this one

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.149 
evaluate the rest we go along this one
here<00:01:06.720> looks<00:01:07.049> like<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.439> would<00:01:07.590> be<00:01:07.650> worthy<00:01:08.010> of

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
here looks like it would be worthy of

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.380 
here looks like it would be worthy of
going<00:01:08.369> through<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.790> could<00:01:08.939> be<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
going through it could be just the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.929 
going through it could be just the
sunlight<00:01:10.200> still<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.770> i<00:01:10.860> don't<00:01:11.010> know<00:01:11.130> but

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
sunlight still on it i don't know but

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.450 
sunlight still on it i don't know but
this<00:01:12.150> over<00:01:12.420> here<00:01:12.630> looks<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.380> lot<00:01:14.220> less

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
this over here looks like a lot less

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.219 
this over here looks like a lot less
dense<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.000> therefore<00:01:15.420> less<00:01:15.720> likely<00:01:16.140> to

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
dense and therefore less likely to

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.230 
dense and therefore less likely to
produce<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.590> problem<00:01:17.009> i<00:01:17.189> suppose<00:01:17.759> i<00:01:17.909> could<00:01:17.970> have

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
produce a problem i suppose i could have

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.960 
produce a problem i suppose i could have
gone<00:01:18.360> through<00:01:18.689> their<00:01:19.369> fact<00:01:20.369> i'm<00:01:20.580> sure<00:01:20.820> it

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
gone through their fact i'm sure it

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.280 
gone through their fact i'm sure it
could<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.240> but<00:01:22.080> uh<00:01:22.140> we're<00:01:22.890> going<00:01:23.100> around<00:01:23.340> so

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
could have but uh we're going around so

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:32.490 
could have but uh we're going around so
then<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.350> get<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.590> see<00:01:25.770> what<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.040> looks<00:01:26.220> like

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.920 

though<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.340> thin<00:01:33.700> wispy<00:01:34.120> ones<00:01:34.240> with<00:01:34.900> a

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
though the thin wispy ones with a

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.830 
though the thin wispy ones with a
cumulus<00:01:35.470> practice<00:01:35.980> the<00:01:36.130> pool<00:01:36.340> cot<00:01:36.640> look<00:01:37.030> that

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
cumulus practice the pool cot look that

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.040 
cumulus practice the pool cot look that
they're<00:01:38.440> not<00:01:38.650> going<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:38.920> produce<00:01:39.100> any<00:01:40.050> there's

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
they're not going to produce any there's

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.840 
they're not going to produce any there's
not<00:01:41.170> an<00:01:41.260> ESL<00:01:41.620> be<00:01:41.770> there<00:01:42.010> but<00:01:42.460> there<00:01:42.610> could<00:01:42.790> be

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
not an ESL be there but there could be

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.290 
not an ESL be there but there could be
in<00:01:43.090> that<00:01:43.240> in<00:01:43.510> a<00:01:43.750> thicker<00:01:44.080> one<00:01:44.290> there<00:01:44.470> I<00:01:45.400> just<00:01:46.060> I

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
in that in a thicker one there I just I

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.260 
in that in a thicker one there I just I
do<00:01:46.570> see<00:01:47.020> some<00:01:47.800> puddles<00:01:48.010> on<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.460> ground<00:01:48.910> here

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
do see some puddles on the ground here

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.800 
do see some puddles on the ground here
in<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.600> area<00:01:49.900> and<00:01:50.680> if<00:01:51.580> this<00:01:51.610> close<00:01:52.240> quarters

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
in the area and if this close quarters

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.050 
in the area and if this close quarters
it's<00:01:53.110> really<00:01:53.530> hard<00:01:53.800> on<00:01:53.979> us<00:01:54.250> 42<00:01:54.640> who

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
it's really hard on us 42 who

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.340 
it's really hard on us 42 who
corroborate<00:01:55.690> which<00:01:56.050> 45<00:01:56.950> level<00:01:57.160> three<00:01:57.310> TC<00:01:57.880> is

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
corroborate which 45 level three TC is

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.990 
corroborate which 45 level three TC is
beautiful<00:01:59.350> thinner<00:01:59.590> producing<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.670> puddle

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
beautiful thinner producing the puddle

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.510 
beautiful thinner producing the puddle
so<00:02:01.330> rather<00:02:01.540> than<00:02:01.780> kind<00:02:02.770> of<00:02:02.950> NIT<00:02:03.070> pick<00:02:03.100> my<00:02:03.490> way

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
so rather than kind of NIT pick my way

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.999 
so rather than kind of NIT pick my way
through<00:02:03.640> we'll<00:02:04.600> just<00:02:04.750> go<00:02:04.899> to<00:02:05.350> a<00:02:05.380> clear<00:02:05.649> area

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.889 

all<00:02:09.009> that<00:02:09.040> problem<00:02:09.580> alright<00:02:10.450> so<00:02:10.720> there<00:02:10.840> you

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
all that problem alright so there you

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.240 
all that problem alright so there you
have<00:02:10.959> it<00:02:11.110> we're<00:02:12.070> deviating<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:13.180> Big<00:02:13.360> D<00:02:13.540> were

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
have it we're deviating the Big D were
