you will have to run a tight match goes
with<00:02:07.050> this<00:02:07.230> motor<00:02:07.530> gives<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.920> lot<00:02:08.100> of<00:02:08.130> power

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
with this motor gives a lot of power

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.680 
with this motor gives a lot of power
it's<00:02:09.150> a<00:02:09.270> full<00:02:09.540> pole<00:02:09.810> motor<00:02:11.180> so<00:02:12.180> full<00:02:12.420> pole

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
it's a full pole motor so full pole

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.650 
it's a full pole motor so full pole
motor<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:14.130> has<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.370> lot<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.640> ton<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.120> torque<00:02:15.510> and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
motor it has a lot of ton of torque and

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.870 
motor it has a lot of ton of torque and
power<00:02:15.750> will<00:02:16.080> tear<00:02:16.320> your<00:02:16.470> spirit<00:02:16.950> gear<00:02:17.130> up<00:02:17.340> if

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
power will tear your spirit gear up if
