every<00:01:38.350> game<00:01:38.500> being<00:01:38.680> an<00:01:38.950> internment

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
every game being an internment

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.950 
every game being an internment

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
our teeth and battled back and gave

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.110 
our teeth and battled back and gave
ourselves<00:01:50.950> a<00:01:51.220> chance<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:51.610> win<00:01:51.760> it

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.280 

they<00:01:57.120> could<00:01:57.330> have<00:01:57.420> changed<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.840> way<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.110> game

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
they could have changed the way the game

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.150 
they could have changed the way the game
was<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.800> terms<00:01:59.010> of<00:01:59.160> school<00:01:59.900> 11<00:02:00.900> for<00:02:01.050> 24<00:02:01.590> yeah<00:02:01.830> so

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
was in terms of school 11 for 24 yeah so

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.680 
was in terms of school 11 for 24 yeah so
we<00:02:02.280> missed<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.580> couple<00:02:02.790> opportunities<00:02:03.060> at<00:02:03.600> the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
we missed a couple opportunities at the

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.690 
we missed a couple opportunities at the
line<00:02:04.040> but<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.130> know<00:02:05.220> again<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:05.670> that

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
line but you know again it's that

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.580 
line but you know again it's that
resiliency<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.630> then<00:02:06.840> move<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.380> next

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
resiliency and then move on to the next

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.740 
resiliency and then move on to the next
play<00:02:07.800> move<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.820> next<00:02:09.000> play<00:02:09.240> move<00:02:09.480> on<00:02:09.630> to

play move on to the next play move on to
the<00:02:09.840> next<00:02:09.990> play<00:02:10.320> and<00:02:11.100> I<00:02:11.400> thought<00:02:11.550> we<00:02:11.670> did<00:02:11.820> a

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
the next play and I thought we did a

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.890 
the next play and I thought we did a
great<00:02:12.060> job<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.390> that

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
great job of that

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.400 
great job of that
where<00:02:13.380> did<00:02:13.560> hunters<00:02:13.890> give<00:02:14.100> you<00:02:14.190> guys<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:15.410> think

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
where did hunters give you guys I think

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.660 
where did hunters give you guys I think
obviously<00:02:16.950> inside<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.310> paint

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
obviously inside the paint

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.280 
obviously inside the paint
you<00:02:18.000> know<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.240> second-chance<00:02:18.810> points<00:02:18.960> they

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
you know the second-chance points they

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.270 
you know the second-chance points they
had<00:02:19.410> ten<00:02:19.590> more<00:02:19.770> points<00:02:20.010> in<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.220> paint

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
had ten more points in the paint

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.270 
had ten more points in the paint
thirty-six<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.090> twenty-two<00:02:21.570> so<00:02:22.320> obviously<00:02:23.160> in

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
thirty-six to twenty-two so obviously in

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.520 
thirty-six to twenty-two so obviously in
the<00:02:23.370> paint<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:24.600> where<00:02:24.810> they<00:02:24.960> bother<00:02:25.170> us<00:02:25.380> the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
the paint is where they bother us the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.900 
the paint is where they bother us the
most<00:02:25.680> but<00:02:25.860> we<00:02:25.950> knew<00:02:26.070> that<00:02:26.100> company<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.670> we

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
most but we knew that company and we

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.470 
most but we knew that company and we
knew<00:02:27.090> we<00:02:27.240> had<00:02:27.270> that<00:02:27.630> we<00:02:27.750> had<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:28.050> do<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.380> job

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
knew we had that we had to do the job

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.480 
knew we had that we had to do the job
from<00:02:30.480> Athene<00:02:30.780> rebounding<00:02:31.320> standpoint<00:02:31.770> we

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
from Athene rebounding standpoint we

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.070 
from Athene rebounding standpoint we
only<00:02:32.610> got<00:02:32.790> rear-ended<00:02:33.180> by<00:02:33.360> two<00:02:33.450> two<00:02:33.720> second

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
only got rear-ended by two two second

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.020 
only got rear-ended by two two second
half<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:34.470> we<00:02:35.070> did<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.250> much<00:02:35.400> better<00:02:35.430> job<00:02:35.670> the

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
half so we did a much better job the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.200 
half so we did a much better job the
second<00:02:36.330> half<00:02:36.480> there<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:37.650> guys<00:02:37.770> never<00:02:38.090> led<00:02:39.090> the

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
second half there you guys never led the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.540 
second half there you guys never led the
entire<00:02:39.330> game<00:02:39.510> until<00:02:39.930> late<00:02:40.200> its<00:02:41.160> wonder<00:02:41.370> if<00:02:41.460> you

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
entire game until late its wonder if you

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.640 
entire game until late its wonder if you
could<00:02:41.700> talk<00:02:42.450> about<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.720> resultant<00:02:43.260> question

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
could talk about the resultant question

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.410 
could talk about the resultant question
in<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.280> regional<00:02:44.610> semifinal<00:02:45.180> against
