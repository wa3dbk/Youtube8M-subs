smooth nevertheless the cut surface that
you<00:00:13.139> see<00:00:13.380> here<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:14.900> not<00:00:15.900> really<00:00:16.139> normal<00:00:16.710> either

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
you see here is not really normal either

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.700 
you see here is not really normal either
you<00:00:17.369> can<00:00:17.520> see<00:00:17.730> irregular<00:00:18.539> red<00:00:18.900> streaks<00:00:19.470> as

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
you can see irregular red streaks as

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.939 
you can see irregular red streaks as
though<00:00:20.039> there<00:00:20.279> was<00:00:20.430> congested<00:00:21.210> blood<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:22.080> you

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
though there was congested blood and you

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.759 
though there was congested blood and you
can<00:00:23.160> see<00:00:23.430> lighter<00:00:23.939> areas<00:00:24.600> as<00:00:24.900> well<00:00:25.080> as<00:00:25.140> darker

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
can see lighter areas as well as darker

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.830 
can see lighter areas as well as darker
areas<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> liver<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.150> for<00:00:27.630> some

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
areas this is a liver that for some

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.350 
areas this is a liver that for some
reason<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:29.119> congested<00:00:30.439> well<00:00:32.270> the<00:00:34.010> most

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
reason is congested well the most

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.799 
reason is congested well the most
overwhelmingly<00:00:37.280> common<00:00:38.280> reason<00:00:38.760> why<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.300> liver

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
overwhelmingly common reason why a liver

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.340 
overwhelmingly common reason why a liver
would<00:00:40.079> be<00:00:40.260> congested<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:41.510> that<00:00:42.510> there<00:00:43.200> is

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
would be congested is that there is

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.170 
would be congested is that there is
heart<00:00:43.649> failure<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.870> therefore<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:47.180> portal

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
heart failure and therefore the portal

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.279 
heart failure and therefore the portal
circulation<00:00:49.160> which<00:00:50.160> goes<00:00:50.460> from<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.289> portal

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
circulation which goes from the portal

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.930 
circulation which goes from the portal
areas<00:00:52.640> to<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.789> central<00:00:54.270> vein<00:00:54.510> areas<00:00:55.940> cannot

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
areas to the central vein areas cannot

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.330 
areas to the central vein areas cannot
drain<00:00:57.420> properly<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.320> therefore<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:59.160> gets

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
drain properly and therefore it gets

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.029 
drain properly and therefore it gets
backed<00:00:59.789> up<00:01:00.059> now<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.809> understand<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.590> lot<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.800> the

backed up now to understand a lot of the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.000 
backed up now to understand a lot of the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
disease processes that affect the liver

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.929 
disease processes that affect the liver
especially<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.880> circulatory<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:07.939> toxic

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
especially the circulatory and toxic

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.240 
especially the circulatory and toxic
ones<00:01:09.240> if<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.900> remember<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.740> general

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
ones if you remember that the general

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.210 
ones if you remember that the general
flow<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:12.000> blood<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.720> from<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.409> portal<00:01:13.770> area

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
flow of blood is from the portal area

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.179 
flow of blood is from the portal area
which<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.670> here<00:01:15.259> through<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.470> portal<00:01:16.920> veins

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
which is here through the portal veins

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.399 
which is here through the portal veins
and<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> panic<00:01:17.970> arteries<00:01:18.600> towards<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
and the panic arteries towards the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.890 
and the panic arteries towards the
central<00:01:19.830> veins<00:01:20.189> which<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.670> our<00:01:20.850> here<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.720> can

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
central veins which is our here you can

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.780 
central veins which is our here you can
see<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> first<00:01:22.920> area<00:01:23.310> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
see that this is the first area to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.660 
see that this is the first area to
receive<00:01:23.970> blood<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.860> last<00:01:26.100> area

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
receive blood and this is the last area

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.490 
receive blood and this is the last area
to<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.000> receive<00:01:27.390> blood<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.020> lab<00:01:28.229> you'll

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
to the receive blood in a lab you'll

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.940 
to the receive blood in a lab you'll
before<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.070> goes<00:01:29.579> through<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.180> hepatic<00:01:30.659> veins

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
before it goes through the hepatic veins

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.120 
before it goes through the hepatic veins
into<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> inferior<00:01:32.490> vena<00:01:32.939> cava<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.509> heart

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
into the inferior vena cava to the heart

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.640 
into the inferior vena cava to the heart
therefore<00:01:35.299> if<00:01:36.979> there<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.400> toxic<00:01:39.270> damage<00:01:40.200> to

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
therefore if there is a toxic damage to

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.730 
therefore if there is a toxic damage to
the<00:01:40.799> brain<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.790> areas<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.540> toxicity<00:01:43.110> would<00:01:43.590> be

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
the brain the areas of toxicity would be

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.730 
the brain the areas of toxicity would be
closest<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.610> portal<00:01:45.210> areas<00:01:45.750> are<00:01:46.079> closest

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
closest to the portal areas are closest

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.639 
closest to the portal areas are closest
to<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.890> portal<00:01:47.399> triangle<00:01:48.060> if<00:01:48.240> there<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.350> an

the<00:01:54.420> first<00:01:54.750> areas<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.619> involved<00:01:56.280> would<00:01:56.520> be

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
the first areas to be involved would be

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.959 
the first areas to be involved would be
the<00:01:56.880> central<00:01:57.360> vein<00:01:57.689> areas<00:01:58.320> we<00:01:59.070> see<00:01:59.340> here<00:01:59.640> that

the central vein areas we see here that

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.300 
the central vein areas we see here that
there<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.329> necrosis<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.619> hemorrhage<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.189> the
