 Well qualified too 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.250
 It is a place-

 Thats'll dawn night 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.310
 Four 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.310
 I went to Jean case 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.760
 bloom 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.530
 Is an accent 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:49.150
 It is something like this 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.490
 Yes the cable is attached. The main unit is in the folded condition . 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.420
 Barber shop 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:57.440
 From the folded state, 1 stage of books 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.990
 2 stages to 3 stages 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.350
 It is a mechanism to rotate this recent part 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:07.190
 If four things are extended, a place 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.420
 Headphones will be in the state, too 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.000
 Let's take a look at the appearance 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.710
 All defeats are also logo blue 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.190
 so 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.390
 This side 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:23.390
 It is the ear pads and had become on the inside Mon value ordering double 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.630
 Model number It is this blue 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.530
 The other part is 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:35.100
 Although it is a monotone coloring, still 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:38.400
 DJ monitor 4 headphones so a little calm design 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:43.320
 Now you have this Gademo is cool and quite astringent 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.979
 It is attached cable 3m straight cord and 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.610
 Made up to 1.5 m extending the 3 m 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.410
 Karl code that comes with two curled cord is still in use as a dj monitor 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.600
 Is a required cable 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:02:03.310
 Stereo 3 with 3.5mm player terminal 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:08.709
 This changing child 3.5mm stereo mini head button is Mr. 2.53 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:14.500
 As it is terminal of cable with lock mechanism to good terminal, while playing this 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:15.819
 Such as anti-3.5 of the cable's three points of the half past there is not work for this hd and tj 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.360
 Even though I'm sorry 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:23.330
 That the front table comes off home from the headphones at the lock mechanism comes with 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:28.860
 I'm missing I like connecting to equipment 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:33.500
 It is conversion plug to standard It is usable with both cables which comes with this, too 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:37.490
 Converting plug is part of this insulator of Plavo etc 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.440
 It is a part of this label later, yes Blue is being used 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:44.270
 It is quite easy to say this 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:47.500
 After all it is point that is hard to notice purchased item, but in fact of this hard case 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:51.550
 This part is here Spear 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:57.270
 It is said that spare part Kawamoto shop this spare 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:59.240
 But it was velor material and had become to a different type of pad 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:04.880
 So to 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:06.230
 Because it is a different pad of the material from what is originally attached to the main body with such feeling, I use properly 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.240
 can do 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:14.079
 The ear pad but I was is in fact a simple but do way exchange of pad 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.730
 I just remove it 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.020
 so 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.460
 this 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:23.030
 It's a new pad, I'm reducing this 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.530
 Along the autumn branch along 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.890
 Follow 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:32.340
 Yes 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:33.060
 Fixing is complete only by fitting It is very easy It is a terminal part to connect a cable 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.110
 But 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:40.350
 Provided on both right and left 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.890
 I swear that the right hitter left can choose 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:48.410
 Let's actually put on this hd 8 dj 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.890
 Wearing feeling is quite solid 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:56.000
 Pressing of the top portion Ya and we were 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:04:02.240
 I 'm foot pressure , which is also quite strong 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.980
 It's a size that just covers that ear and covers the a 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.400
 But even if I put it for a long time 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:12.390
 It seems that there is no pain in the earlobe, so this was solid 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:19.109
 It has a very high sound insulation from wearing feeling Noto 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:21.340
 Also, there is a characteristic that the sound leakage is quite difficult, so enjoy music at a large volume 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.639
 O It is recommended for those who want to 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:28.900
 Yes p hd 8 dj sound quality but this 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:34.720
 The degree of perfection as a monitor headphone is very high 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:36.729
 Consider as dj Monitors Headphones and a little more of that out there generally now 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.120
 If you have compared to the bj headphones 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.439
 Do you say that bulge or a massive bass 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:47.780
 In thickness 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:53.030
 A little stuffiness will remain. Just monitor the whole band firmly. 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:58.250
 Even if the amount of definition is not so much because the sound insulation is high 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:05:01.350
 The so around it has become a pretty noisy pretty also easy to Italy insect It is also to make 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:05.340
 This is why there is a lot of bass 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.750
 If you do not want to use headphones as much as possible, I would recommend it by all means 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.580
 It is a headphone 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:15.570
 The balance, such as support of this to go but I will flat balance 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:21.060
 You can hear the song meandering to a fairly high position with very little 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:22.170
 Because it is hard to take in volume, and it is better to use it when using it with a portable device or using an amplifier 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.740
 I think 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:31.419
 You can also use headphone amps and other equipment that can output well indoors . 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:34.360
 Let Itadako heard by connecting to these things I think I may by listening for 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.430
 I thought it was not a tuning balance 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.230
 Just 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:44.880
 Well I'm back with a headphone amplifier Well balanced and 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:46.230
 It may be high res sound source, and it may be recommended for those who want to hear well 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:52.800
 I think so 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:57.059
 Especially Well that low-frequency range is'll Toka treble has come out a lot come out to be very stuck come before 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:12.099
 It's not a balance of sounds like that 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:15.440
 If you now here was there the introduction of flowers open hda reference I hope 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:19.510
 Your viewing does not please consider all means pleasing to good chin 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.510
 Wait to Mars Baibai'
