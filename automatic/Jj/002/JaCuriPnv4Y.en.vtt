testing it the way we have I've come to
the<00:02:10.769> conclusion<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.450> how<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.870> m5

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the conclusion that this is how the m5

the conclusion that this is how the m5
should<00:02:13.890> have<00:02:14.010> been<00:02:14.190> out<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.299> game<00:02:15.860> power

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
should have been out of the game power

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.460 
should have been out of the game power
aside<00:02:17.340> we<00:02:17.549> have<00:02:17.580> more<00:02:17.879> power<00:02:18.120> we<00:02:18.390> have<00:02:18.629> torque

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
aside we have more power we have torque

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.780 
aside we have more power we have torque
for<00:02:19.739> longer<00:02:20.160> in<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.400> rpm<00:02:20.760> range<00:02:21.000> to

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.720 

it's<00:02:24.629> faster<00:02:24.989> that's<00:02:25.200> that's<00:02:25.620> great<00:02:25.800> but<00:02:26.580> the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
it's faster that's that's great but the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.839 
it's faster that's that's great but the
handling<00:02:27.300> balance<00:02:27.810> has<00:02:28.680> been<00:02:29.040> improved<00:02:29.489> I

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
handling balance has been improved I

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.059 
handling balance has been improved I
wasn't<00:02:30.629> disappointed<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.620> much<00:02:31.860> with<00:02:32.040> a

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
wasn't disappointed so much with a

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.890 
wasn't disappointed so much with a
standard<00:02:32.400> m5<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:33.000> just<00:02:33.209> kind<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:33.450> took<00:02:33.599> it<00:02:33.659> as

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
standard m5 I just kind of took it as

standard m5 I just kind of took it as
what<00:02:34.799> it<00:02:34.830> was<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.099> heavy<00:02:35.580> sedan<00:02:36.060> with<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.510> lot<00:02:36.780> of

a lot of fun on corner exit the nice

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.059 
a lot of fun on corner exit the nice
thing<00:03:45.269> is<00:03:45.299> that<00:03:45.569> this<00:03:45.780> is<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.049> turbocharged<00:03:46.769> v8

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
thing is that this is a turbocharged v8

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
but you don't get a big sense of turbo

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.770 
but you don't get a big sense of turbo
lag<00:03:49.889> you<00:03:50.099> don't<00:03:50.280> feel<00:03:50.880> like<00:03:50.910> you're<00:03:51.450> waiting

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
figure eight this car was actually kind

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.120 
figure eight this car was actually kind
of<00:04:26.480> frustrating<00:04:27.050> because<00:04:27.080> of<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.680> mid<00:04:27.830> corner

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
of frustrating because of the mid corner

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.100 
of frustrating because of the mid corner
understeer<00:04:28.730> and<00:04:28.940> that's<00:04:29.510> a<00:04:29.750> handling

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
understeer and that's a handling

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.750 
understeer and that's a handling
situation<00:04:30.710> and<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:30.920> mid<00:04:31.070> corner<00:04:31.310> speeds<00:04:31.640> are

situation and the mid corner speeds are

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.460 
situation and the mid corner speeds are
about<00:04:31.880> forty<00:04:32.300> miles<00:04:32.420> an<00:04:32.600> hour<00:04:32.780> maybe<00:04:32.930> 50<00:04:33.320> miles

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
about forty miles an hour maybe 50 miles

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.830 
about forty miles an hour maybe 50 miles
an<00:04:33.620> hour<00:04:33.710> or<00:04:33.950> so<00:04:34.270> when<00:04:35.270> you<00:04:35.360> start<00:04:35.630> going

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
an hour or so when you start going

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.600 
an hour or so when you start going
faster<00:04:36.620> though<00:04:36.770> I<00:04:36.800> actually<00:04:37.130> kind<00:04:37.520> of

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
faster though I actually kind of

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.370 
faster though I actually kind of
appreciate<00:04:38.300> that<00:04:38.480> understeer<00:04:38.870> because<00:04:39.230> it

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
appreciate that understeer because it

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.520 
appreciate that understeer because it
keeps<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.740> car<00:04:39.950> stable<00:04:40.520> at<00:04:41.480> you<00:04:41.720> know<00:04:41.840> 100

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
keeps the car stable at you know 100

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.260 
keeps the car stable at you know 100
mile<00:04:42.620> an<00:04:42.650> hour<00:04:42.800> sweepers<00:04:43.370> which<00:04:43.550> is<00:04:43.700> nice<00:04:43.880> and

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
mile an hour sweepers which is nice and

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.660 
mile an hour sweepers which is nice and
because<00:04:45.260> you<00:04:45.410> have<00:04:45.530> so<00:04:45.710> much<00:04:45.800> power<00:04:46.070> on<00:04:46.400> tap

I<00:06:13.710> think<00:06:14.490> for<00:06:14.729> it<00:06:14.820> to<00:06:14.970> become<00:06:15.330> a<00:06:15.360> really<00:06:15.930> good

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
I think for it to become a really good

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.950 
I think for it to become a really good
driver's<00:06:16.590> car<00:06:16.830> or<00:06:17.759> so<00:06:18.060> then<00:06:18.330> you<00:06:18.540> know<00:06:18.600> a<00:06:18.660> good

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
driver's car or so then you know a good

driver's car or so then you know a good
driving<00:06:19.380> facet<00:06:19.860> and<00:06:20.009> it's<00:06:20.580> going<00:06:20.759> to<00:06:20.820> need<00:06:20.940> to

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
driving facet and it's going to need to

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.490 
driving facet and it's going to need to
be<00:06:21.210> a<00:06:21.240> bit<00:06:21.509> lighter<00:06:21.870> and<00:06:22.139> that's

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
be a bit lighter and that's

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.870 
be a bit lighter and that's
unfortunately<00:06:23.070> something<00:06:23.400> not<00:06:23.580> we're<00:06:23.729> not

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
unfortunately something not we're not

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.689 
unfortunately something not we're not

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 
going to be able to change but as is I

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:28.790 
going to be able to change but as is I
definitely<00:06:27.539> respect<00:06:27.930> this<00:06:28.020> car<00:06:28.289> for<00:06:28.530> what<00:06:28.680> it

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
definitely respect this car for what it

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.409 
definitely respect this car for what it
is<00:06:28.830> a<00:06:29.960> fast<00:06:30.960> really<00:06:31.770> heavy<00:06:32.039> and<00:06:32.370> decently<00:06:33.120> fun

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
is a fast really heavy and decently fun

the competition pack should be standard

though<00:06:40.500> I<00:06:40.740> think<00:06:41.340> this<00:06:41.820> is<00:06:41.970> the<00:06:42.120> way<00:06:42.210> the<00:06:42.389> car

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.010 
should drive from the get-go though it

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.830 
should drive from the get-go though it
may<00:06:56.190> sound<00:06:56.430> obvious<00:06:56.729> the<00:06:57.180> competition

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 
may sound obvious the competition
