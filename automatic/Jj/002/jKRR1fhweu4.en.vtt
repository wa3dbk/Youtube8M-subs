00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.250
 hi friends with you evgeny famously valin 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:10.190
 project and swimming school swim simple and 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.840
 Now I will briefly answer the questions that 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:17.340
 very often asked on our site 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.690
 we decided to make it more alive 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.570
 communication they are just in the comments 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.490
 respond to attacks on the camera and will now 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.930
 ask a series of questions and i will try on 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.029
 each one answer by technique 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.570
 swimming breath and other things that 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.969
 interests you and since most probably 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.200
 frequent question how to breathe properly 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.780
 swimming crawl 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.469
 in fact this is one of the main 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.440
 beginners have problems swimming this 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.969
 the problem may be more serious 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.520
 what it seems at first glance 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.860
 and the problem is not how to breathe 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.180
 crawl and how easy it is to breathe in water and 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.399
 start by answering the question for yourself 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.079
 can you breathe water or can't 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.600
 to answer this question is 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.559
 some simple exercises first 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.689
 come in and lower your face come in 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.360
 in the water somewhere to the waist lower your face out 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.860
 and breathe out 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.260
 exhale all the air then you understand 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.930
 head inhale again lower your face 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.549
 into the water and breathe out if you can 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.560
 do it well more or less 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.619
 water you are not afraid to breathe you can 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.290
 complicate it now doing crouching water 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.930
 with exhalation you stand do above the water 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.329
 inhale and begin to exhale you can exhale 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.159
 still above the water while crouching under 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.740
 water accordingly you find yourself under 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.220
 water keep breathing out exhale 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.130
 make it better to water do it by mouth and 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.850
 nose on the first rather difficult to squeeze 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.979
 make a mouth 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.619
 as soon as you run out of air you 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.619
 stand up take a breath over the water and again 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.290
 crouching under the water doing water hold'em 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:55.229
 if you can do it 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.479
 come to work out breathing when 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.740
 swimming crawl 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.840
 actually putting the breath when 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.270
 fin the role im pretty complicated i 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.829
 I will try to briefly explain more 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.050
 it is discussed in detail with us 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.760
 swimming video course 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.910
 which you can find on our website 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.240
 I will briefly explain here that while swimming 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.490
 crawl is very important not to delay 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.980
 breathing for a long breath should be 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.110
 very smooth inhale soft exhale inhale 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.520
 soft exhale do not need to delay 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.440
 diving breath 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.590
 when we take a deep breath and there on 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.120
 a minute and a half hold your breath 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.070
 the result of such a delay follows as 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.530
 rule dyspnea when swimming crawl 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.970
 we have no time to catch our breath 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.220
 have time to breathe and 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.170
 exhale respectively inhaled on in 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.720
 surfaced exhale the cart 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.260
 breathing should not stop pauses be 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.350
 should not 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.110
 you breathed breathe out breathed breathed out 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.630
 This allows you to keep a steady rhythm 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.700
 breathing and not knock it down if we do 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.760
 delayed breathing usually breathing 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.170
 getting off I already said and just we don't 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.680
 we have no time to 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.410
 catch your breath will have to install 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.620
 such is the short answer difficult 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.620
 question 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.079
 rhythm of the movement of the hands and breathing 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.659
 swimming crawl 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:21.290
 in fact we are leaving here again on 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:25.349
 basic techniques 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.530
 to breathe properly in the water with us 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.930
 there must be a very good balance 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.450
 moreover we must not lose balance in 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.519
 water when moving with our hands we must 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.310
 work at least have lived two 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.549
 balance exercises and two exercises on 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.760
 movement of hands in the water and to change hands 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:47.400
 have a body should stand in the water with us like 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.450
 just float no problem with 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.700
 balance should not be 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.440
 only then can one proceed to 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.670
 practicing breathing techniques again 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.319
 Breathing technique itself 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.900
 herself quite complicated in detail she 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.989
 we reviewed the video course we 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:07.319
 consider it in the classroom living if 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:11.129
 shortly the bottom line is that 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.959
 there is a lot of breath 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:16.380
 important things like timing of breathing is 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.859
 inspiratory time and inspiratory time we go 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.169
 early enough inhale we have to start 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.389
 when hand he went down and inhale 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.419
 you should have time to see 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:30.300
 the hand that we bring here 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:33.090
 now i'm showing i'm already seeing arm brush 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.400
 you shouldn't see your hands accordingly 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.150
 breath should go like this i 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.430
 turned his head 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.190
 sighed and hung his head like and 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.639
 position when hand goes over water i 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:49.070
 no longer see no breathing in 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.070
 quick head down not only 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.780
 that is, we breathe early very early 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.060
 earlier than it may seem in this 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.960
 key secret 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:05.180
 the task while inhaling does not bring down the balance much 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.150
 more important than maybe even breathe 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.909
 have we have time to breathe lead 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.180
 head to the starting position and after 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:15.740
 this we put our hand in if we breathe 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.960
 the head of us is not yet in its original position and 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.960
 we invest yourself see what balance y 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.840
 breaks us we start to create a wave 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.930
 body we go wave on the surface 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:31.120
 water is wrong here so short 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.120
 the answer is also to a rather complicated question 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.380
 once again u rather small in which in 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.070
 what moment does one need to breathe where 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:45.480
 there is a hand to us we need to inhale 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:49.180
 once again our hand is in 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.430
 probably the lowest point under water here in 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.320
 this time we are already beginning you though the 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.750
 the moment when the hand should have reached the thigh 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.820
 we have already breathed and begin to turn 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:02.820
 head back and here somewhere inhaled 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.820
 to turn 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.490
 so friends 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.000
 watched basic basic questions 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.650
 which most comes by breathing 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.240
 short I answered them hope it 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.330
 it was helpful if there were still some 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.740
 questions write them down in the comments 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.760
 do not hesitate to try them 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.760
 answer only
