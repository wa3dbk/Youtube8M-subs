00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.330
 Hi, I'm eduardo silva inês tutorial 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.580
 show you how you make a camera 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.920
 I have prepared an object for this. 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.300
 scenery with graminha here an album and a 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.330
 arrow 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:20.220
 the peta is that to get out of this way 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.529
 and the simplest way of 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.930
 make objects and guide 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:31.579
 the object is you selecting the camera 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:38.460
 selected object giving against tp 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:40.410
 here object that transforms complete 10 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.969
 to exit the bed view in goal 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.450
 position by selecting only the 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.450
 camera 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.600
 zero to better position shift 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.130
 ef 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:04.449
 It's stuck on the object, I can not. 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:13.619
 to do this but to 0 again the novel in 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:13.619
 x remove it on ya 0 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:23.200
 I will position again but finishing 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.200
 to hit zero again 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:33.050
 now if there's a good image and I'm going 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.330
 release animation realize that our 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.790
 camera is following the arrow 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.970
 I put up pretty slow even at 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.230
 distance that france has put to correct 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.230
 this improvement not only for you 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:02:00.770
 here 's a little bit is still young 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.400
 Good money, this is the first way. 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.729
 to do camera animation by following 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:14.140
 the second object that is also 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:22.090
 very simple will come back for me a leave 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:22.090
 thus good control 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:32.590
 and ready just are not sticking 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.140
 on here 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:42.110
 this issue already has a constant 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:44.840
 I immediately put off this conscious and 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.690
 I'll now put him back from the paraná. 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:56.360
 our our front but first I 'm going to 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:03:05.180
 position in this box 17 front or 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:07.390
 rotated and put a link in the middle of 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.390
 week 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:15.260
 the number is small 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:17.500
 some small adjustments here is already good 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.500
 too much 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.260
 now it 's good so it 's time it's on 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.599
 my dictionary or do with the camera 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.709
 look at the flash until the access point 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.470
 outside 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:41.090
 I do this also a selected one of mine 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:45.019
 good fickle camera on - and I will 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.700
 select an object in case that bed 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:51.859
 I made it with kone 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:54.920
 so now you 're looking 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:57.650
 but still have to do 11 has taken 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.579
 schulze because she's connected here more 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:04.910
 is not looking then canon y beauty 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:08.480
 now where to move my arrow 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.870
 the camera will follow and we will enter 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.489
 They analyze 0 to see if we're going again 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.940
 release animation 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:20.269
 I realize that you are now following 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:25.680
 perfectly our arrow is very 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:29.850
 simple to do and very useful too 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.710
 the guys this is what I hope you 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.560
 You liked it and it looked good. 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.810
 It was one more tip even if you 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.350
 like to become a jewelry and even 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.350
