convert your videos down to a really
small<00:00:11.650> fall<00:00:11.889> easy<00:00:12.400> to<00:00:12.700> allow<00:00:12.940> for<00:00:13.209> people<00:00:13.539> with

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
small fall easy to allow for people with

slow internet
so<00:00:14.740> basically<00:00:15.070> me<00:00:15.940> personally<00:00:16.420> I<00:00:16.450> do<00:00:16.689> have

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
so basically me personally I do have

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.790 
so basically me personally I do have
slow<00:00:17.020> internet<00:00:17.230> myself

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
slow internet myself

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.030 
slow internet myself
I'm<00:00:17.950> with<00:00:18.310> Sky<00:00:18.700> and<00:00:18.939> if<00:00:19.630> you're<00:00:19.900> with<00:00:20.080> Sky<00:00:20.380> you

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.040 
I'm with Sky and if you're with Sky you

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.339 
I'm with Sky and if you're with Sky you
know<00:00:21.189> in<00:00:21.460> the<00:00:21.580> UK<00:00:21.910> it's<00:00:22.779> quite<00:00:23.050> slow

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
know in the UK it's quite slow

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.549 
know in the UK it's quite slow
especially<00:00:24.009> for<00:00:24.520> like<00:00:24.640> areas<00:00:25.149> like<00:00:25.960> Rare<00:00:26.320> mine

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:26.559 
especially for like areas like Rare mine

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.679 
especially for like areas like Rare mine
this<00:00:27.130> is<00:00:27.340> my<00:00:27.550> upload<00:00:27.849> speed<00:00:27.939> its<00:00:28.270> North<00:00:28.450> Point

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
this is my upload speed its North Point

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.959 
this is my upload speed its North Point
67<00:00:29.439> that's<00:00:30.160> like<00:00:30.910> actually<00:00:31.719> really<00:00:32.320> slow<00:00:32.969> so

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
67 that's like actually really slow so

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.229 
67 that's like actually really slow so
what<00:00:34.719> I<00:00:34.750> do<00:00:34.870> to<00:00:35.380> make<00:00:35.829> or<00:00:36.250> blast<00:00:36.520> faster<00:00:36.969> is<00:00:37.149> I

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
what I do to make or blast faster is I

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:38.970 
what I do to make or blast faster is I
use<00:00:37.480> these<00:00:37.660> program<00:00:38.230> called

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
use these program called

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.979 
use these program called
freemake<00:00:39.579> Video<00:00:39.910> Converter<00:00:40.059> it's<00:00:40.539> a<00:00:40.660> free

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
freemake Video Converter it's a free

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.560 
freemake Video Converter it's a free
video<00:00:41.109> converter<00:00:41.589> and<00:00:41.829> it<00:00:41.920> converts<00:00:42.570> any

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
video converter and it converts any

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.319 
video converter and it converts any
video<00:00:43.899> it's<00:00:44.710> down<00:00:44.949> to<00:00:45.129> a<00:00:45.190> really<00:00:45.550> small<00:00:45.640> format

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
video it's down to a really small format

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.439 
video it's down to a really small format
with<00:00:46.899> still<00:00:47.199> keeping<00:00:47.760> exactly<00:00:48.760> sound<00:00:48.969> quality

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
with still keeping exactly sound quality

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.739 
with still keeping exactly sound quality
so<00:00:50.230> basically<00:00:50.530> this<00:00:50.859> is<00:00:50.920> one<00:00:51.820> way<00:00:51.999> this<00:00:52.539> is<00:00:52.600> a

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:52.749 
so basically this is one way this is a

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:54.299 
so basically this is one way this is a
video<00:00:53.019> what<00:00:53.230> I've<00:00:53.350> just<00:00:53.379> rendered<00:00:53.890> over<00:00:53.980> here

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
video what I've just rendered over here

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.299 
video what I've just rendered over here
and<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:55.420> rendered<00:00:55.989> a<00:00:56.170> one<00:00:56.589> from<00:00:56.949> Sony<00:00:57.159> Vegas

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
and the rendered a one from Sony Vegas

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.540 
and the rendered a one from Sony Vegas
is<00:00:57.670> 238<00:00:58.449> megabytes<00:00:58.929> and<00:00:59.140> then<00:00:59.649> I<00:01:00.100> convert<00:01:00.519> it

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
is 238 megabytes and then I convert it

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.799 
is 238 megabytes and then I convert it
straight<00:01:00.909> after<00:01:01.210> in<00:01:01.329> the<00:01:01.420> warm<00:01:01.569> water

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
straight after in the warm water

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.160 
straight after in the warm water
conversely<00:01:02.559> got<00:01:02.920> it<00:01:03.010> down<00:01:03.190> to<00:01:03.390> 81<00:01:04.390> point<00:01:04.960> 3

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
conversely got it down to 81 point 3

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.200 
conversely got it down to 81 point 3
megabytes<00:01:05.620> that<00:01:06.070> is<00:01:06.159> a<00:01:06.280> huge<00:01:06.610> difference<00:01:06.820> and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
megabytes that is a huge difference and

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.390 
megabytes that is a huge difference and
a<00:01:07.420> lot<00:01:07.750> easier<00:01:08.080> to<00:01:08.170> upload<00:01:08.470> and<00:01:08.770> a<00:01:08.860> lot<00:01:09.040> faster

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
a lot easier to upload and a lot faster

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.860 
a lot easier to upload and a lot faster
so<00:01:09.550> that<00:01:09.670> means<00:01:09.850> I<00:01:09.940> can<00:01:10.060> get<00:01:10.150> more<00:01:10.330> videos

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
so that means I can get more videos

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.490 
so that means I can get more videos
don't<00:01:11.290> you<00:01:11.470> so<00:01:12.160> you<00:01:12.520> may<00:01:12.670> ask<00:01:13.260> are<00:01:14.260> you<00:01:14.380> gonna

first<00:01:18.280> one<00:01:18.610> for<00:01:18.730> Sony<00:01:18.910> Vegas<00:01:19.090> so<00:01:19.480> it's

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
first one for Sony Vegas so it's

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.000 
first one for Sony Vegas so it's
probably<00:01:20.200> a<00:01:20.260> bit<00:01:20.380> late<00:01:20.530> for<00:01:20.560> couple<00:01:20.950> of

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
probably a bit late for couple of

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.610 
probably a bit late for couple of
seconds<00:01:21.280> now<00:01:21.310> that<00:01:21.490> sounds<00:01:21.700> damn<00:01:21.850> good<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.470> let

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
seconds now that sounds damn good so let

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.230 
seconds now that sounds damn good so let
me<00:01:23.710> just<00:01:23.860> skip<00:01:24.250> random<00:01:24.580> parts<00:01:24.880> I'll<00:01:25.060> let<00:01:25.180> you

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
me just skip random parts I'll let you

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
me just skip random parts I'll let you
watch<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.480> couple<00:01:25.690> of<00:01:25.750> seconds

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
watch a couple of seconds

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.470 
watch a couple of seconds
I've<00:01:26.470> run<00:01:26.680> apart<00:01:27.040> and<00:01:27.340> you<00:01:28.180> could<00:01:28.390> tell

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.480 
I've run apart and you could tell

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.109 
I've run apart and you could tell
difference<00:01:28.870> for<00:01:29.110> yourselves

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.050 

because<00:01:34.780> that<00:01:35.020> c18<00:01:35.680> of<00:01:35.860> Sony<00:01:36.490> Vegas<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:36.970> this

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
because that c18 of Sony Vegas and this

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:46.639 
because that c18 of Sony Vegas and this
is<00:01:37.240> one<00:01:37.450> converted

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.160 

it's<00:01:47.159> more<00:01:47.399> or<00:01:47.429> less<00:01:47.579> design<00:01:48.030> quality<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.719> think

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
it's more or less design quality I think

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.139 
it's more or less design quality I think
it<00:01:49.710> actually<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.250> same<00:01:50.460> quality<00:01:50.880> but<00:01:50.909> you

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
it actually is the same quality but you

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.779 
it actually is the same quality but you
may<00:01:51.509> have<00:01:51.539> a<00:01:51.750> sharper<00:01:52.140> up<00:01:52.229> boys<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.710> May<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.520> as

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
may have a sharper up boys in May but as

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.330 
may have a sharper up boys in May but as
I<00:01:54.420> say<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:54.869> more<00:01:55.649> or<00:01:55.770> less<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.159> same

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
I say it is more or less the same

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.260 
I say it is more or less the same
quality<00:01:57.109> so<00:01:58.109> okay<00:01:58.859> you<00:01:58.920> may<00:01:59.219> ask<00:01:59.369> head<00:02:00.090> boy

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
quality so okay you may ask head boy

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.690 
quality so okay you may ask head boy
actually<00:02:00.569> convert<00:02:01.170> video<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.950> went<00:02:02.280> down

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
actually convert video so went down

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.609
