and<00:03:29.270> he's<00:03:29.690> had<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:29.900> clowns<00:03:30.110> in<00:03:30.260> there<00:03:30.410> for<00:03:30.590> a

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
and he's had the clowns in there for a

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.250 
and he's had the clowns in there for a
couple<00:03:31.580> years<00:03:31.700> and<00:03:32.180> hasn't<00:03:32.600> had<00:03:32.720> any<00:03:32.930> issues

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
couple years and hasn't had any issues

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.490 
couple years and hasn't had any issues
with<00:03:33.290> aggression<00:03:33.710> or<00:03:33.980> anything<00:03:34.160> like<00:03:34.430> that<00:03:34.490> I

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
with aggression or anything like that I

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.130 
with aggression or anything like that I
guess<00:03:36.500> it<00:03:36.650> just<00:03:36.680> goes<00:03:37.600> look<00:03:38.600> at<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.810> draw

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
guess it just goes look at the draw

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:46.260 
guess it just goes look at the draw
really<00:03:39.560> as<00:03:40.520> far<00:03:40.760> as<00:03:40.790> fighting<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:41.690> whatnot

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:53.110 

that<00:03:48.280> is<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.610> male<00:03:51.550> females<00:03:52.550> not<00:03:52.730> far<00:03:53.000> behind

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
that is the male females not far behind

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:06.340 
that is the male females not far behind
him<00:03:53.360> ashore

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.400 

and<00:04:07.350> that's<00:04:07.560> that<00:04:09.230> anybody's<00:04:10.230> got<00:04:10.380> any

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.850 

there's<00:04:22.610> at<00:04:22.730> other<00:04:22.850> patches<00:04:23.120> in<00:04:23.450> yet<00:04:23.600> I<00:04:23.860> was

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
there's at other patches in yet I was

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.010 
there's at other patches in yet I was
talking<00:04:25.160> about<00:04:26.020> is<00:04:27.020> ridiculous

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
talking about is ridiculous

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.800 
talking about is ridiculous
both<00:04:29.590> of<00:04:29.770> these<00:04:29.860> patches<00:04:30.130> started<00:04:30.810> probably

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
both of these patches started probably

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.990 
both of these patches started probably
with<00:04:32.110> a<00:04:32.139> frag<00:04:32.590> less<00:04:33.130> than<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.490> size<00:04:33.669> of<00:04:33.850> this

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
with a frag less than the size of this

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.050 
with a frag less than the size of this
one<00:04:34.180> right<00:04:34.210> here<00:04:35.250> it's<00:04:36.250> less<00:04:36.520> than<00:04:36.729> the<00:04:36.850> size

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
one right here it's less than the size

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.740 
one right here it's less than the size
of<00:04:37.210> that<00:04:37.300> one

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
of that one

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.790 
of that one
and<00:04:37.990> it's<00:04:38.259> grown<00:04:38.500> into<00:04:38.740> all<00:04:38.919> of<00:04:38.949> this

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
and it's grown into all of this

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.099 
and it's grown into all of this
absolutely<00:04:41.800> crazy
