00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:11.160
 great all dear friends with you do not 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.070
 first this new release of the project treats 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.170
 we remove in advance tekke chocolate 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.789
 fib server in 1 plus which you want 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.449
 show allows you to collect information 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.039
 about the players in principle probably each of 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.099
 you faced such a situation when 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.680
 you need to quickly go to the tab and start looking 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.750
 a certain person to get to know him 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.790
 I really don't know about such needs 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.380
 for example, to understand whether this 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.620
 dude because now any bombe 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.860
 may take some skin do not know 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.000
 revenge for 600 to and try to push 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.579
 anything phenotype 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.980
 dilute and when you need to know him 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.690
 level is a long time to press so 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.989
 look all this can be done much 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.989
 easier for this we enter the command and he and 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.940
 and man and he is 29 on man 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.329
 a marker appears and a marker happens 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.079
 different colors 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.649
 Well, let's see now quite different 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.560
 it shows 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:10.310
 name pink amount of health amount 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.920
 his armor level 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.320
 and coordinates in which now 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.750
 is on engle and distance but 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.770
 distance is the distance to it opengl i 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.289
 I do not know it is convenient and even the fact that we 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.939
 we can also register here please 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:30.729
 Information 100 sixth is true to them 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:33.560
 now both are less shot but u 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.940
 they both appear at the corner of 1 pickups 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:41.479
 to remove the pickup and prescribe and of 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.670
 upstairs and the pickup itself is removed 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.240
 true last selected player under 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.830
 marker 229 piaf it is understandable that is, if 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.259
 we prescribed this pickup slightly 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.140
 remain the same guys we can find out 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.750
 all information about the person who 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.119
 located in the car that is, let's say 200 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.189
 well dude already left and managed to beat it 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.190
 now wait for the little man so here I am 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:07.550
 found chuvachkov pancake out of the car does not 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.129
 at the wrong time of course so now 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.300
 I see a dude in the background 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:17.239
 Here it is written 25 25 it was on a wheelbarrow 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:21.099
 and here we have a health condition and and from 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:23.450
 machines by the way it works only in the zone 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:28.040
 drawings that is roughly spelling 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.290
 any such and we will understand that player 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.769
 not in the drawing area means and 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.920
 head 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.940
 find and learn about saying you can not know 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.610
 for what purposes can be used 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.890
 data Minsk I think you will find we 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.709
 using and to review on 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.470
 the next script we need to go on ok 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.909
 bomzhik so friends begin the review 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.640
 next crossfit 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:53.659
 and this is quite an interesting cleo script but 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.540
 and again very insignificant of it 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:03:00.110
 the function is that it is just 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.049
 allows you to pick a tray with food and 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.880
 immediately eat it well looks about 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:11.720
 so that is, you can instantly 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.540
 Well, I donâ€™t know, in principle, often 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.640
 it happens that when you believe your tray 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.730
 his character is just earlier here in principle 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.740
 for this there is protection and so now 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:28.090
 check legend number two so we take 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:32.980
 any lunch such as chicken tinctures 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.980
 No, he himself unfortunately does not eat 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.270
 in other words 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.349
 this script which i just 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:45.860
 showed it will be useful to you only with 1 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.270
 on 3 lvl so again I did on 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.310
 his review just because me 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.410
 asked this least it is not 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.819
 somehow unique but in principle if 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.790
 you constantly play the key 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.010
 furnaces and pumping accounts I do not know 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.290
 maybe it will be useful for you but 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.900
 actually today everyone thanks for all 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.040
 view forget to offer your cleo 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.230
 script and because 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.780
 cool less and less probably you 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.720
 see that and I'm not in a hurry to let out 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.300
