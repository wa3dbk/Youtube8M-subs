00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.750
 welcome to toyota 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.190
 Hi, what are you doing 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.470
 very good guys today 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.990
 I bring a tutorial on how to activate a 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.000
 Easter egg or a trick or a series or 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.790
 something weird of youtube that they have discovered 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.440
 lately it's a game if 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.720
 a game on youtube as you can listen 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.940
 people a game on youtube this game is 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.260
 it's basically about defending the video 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.720
 of some invading ships that want 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.610
 destroy the good looks like a lot 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.800
 but the truth is true in this game 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.629
 is based on space invaders or something 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.830
 well I'm not very aware of whether the 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.449
 truth is that it is a trick that has 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.370
 taken a lot of attention and I've 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.230
 said why I do not do this in a video to 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.630
 I 'm going and then nothing, let's go 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.600
 to see the tutorial on how to activate it and 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.340
 well nothing we continue with this video very 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.250
 alright guys here I am on my channel like 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.420
 can see is the channel that we're going to 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.060
 update again so they see that no 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.490
 it's no trick or anything like that is a 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.380
 trick but but nothing is our 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.210
 ampa or anything we are going to enter a video 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.220
 mine so that the copyright does not come out 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.649
 you already know well let's go what we're going to 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.009
 to do is let's lower the volume there and 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.110
 Now what we have to do is press 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.300
 1980 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.130
 very good guys this is the trick that 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.800
 I wanted to teach on the keyboard as I already 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.660
 I said 1980 have to type and right now 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.590
 let's play the game for the 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.780
 redundancy of defending the video from a 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.230
 of some small invaders who want 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.940
 wreck it 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.460
 this trick what will happen for example 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.500
 Look, when a small missile falls 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.200
 then automatically the screen too 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.120
 tremble that is also something that 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.260
 It should be highlighted, that is, at the end of accounts 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.710
 the virus that is going to end 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:57.159
 breaking but to teach you you are 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.259
 the trick is more than great 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.090
 and good as we can see the video is still 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.189
 continues to reproduce without problems and 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.649
 well now it's going to start I'm going to 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:09.420
 advance a little bit this and when it is 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.420
 have ignored almost the video we continue 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.620
 yes 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.110
 very good guys and is about to 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.750
 destroy this and as we can see I am 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.450
 quite mango I'm pretty silly and in 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.610
 one of these I finished the video goes there 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.920
 is the video the game has been destroyed 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.140
 finished and as we can see the video there 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.670
 can play or anything but good 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.590
 automatically youtube is going to do this 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.840
 and you will be able to play the video 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.470
 with total normality there we can see the 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.290
 tv or tv universe as you want to call it 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.180
 a little bit the volume and good that you 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.880
 approach or the trick that I thought 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.680
 pretty good and make your own lights 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.920
 do more houses with this video what 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.120
 can do and well that would be all 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.770
 remember with which a favorite is 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.450
 they help a lot and whenever God knows 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.489
 because this does not burden me I do not know why 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.489
 but well, nothing, guys, until another
