elbow wrist there straight and basically

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:02.129 
elbow wrist there straight and basically
you<00:00:55.719> build<00:00:55.960> up<00:00:56.519> get<00:00:57.519> faster<00:00:59.519> and<00:01:01.139> then

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:02.139 
you build up get faster and then

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
and smoother and then it's time to use

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.130 
and smoother and then it's time to use
