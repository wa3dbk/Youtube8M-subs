whatever they are on left side use those

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.390 
whatever they are on left side use those
as<00:03:28.090> cover<00:03:28.329> and<00:03:28.600> to<00:03:29.440> just<00:03:29.620> get<00:03:29.829> the<00:03:29.920> guys<00:03:30.070> coming

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
as cover and to just get the guys coming

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.310 
as cover and to just get the guys coming
out<00:03:30.549> of<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.820> tube<00:03:31.030> so<00:03:31.570> that<00:03:31.630> will<00:03:32.049> in<00:03:32.170> my

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
out of the tube so that will in my

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.949 
out of the tube so that will in my
opinion<00:03:32.560> that<00:03:32.769> would<00:03:32.950> be<00:03:33.130> a<00:03:33.340> better<00:03:33.670> idea

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
opinion that would be a better idea

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.880 
opinion that would be a better idea
because<00:03:34.959> when<00:03:35.140> you<00:03:35.230> for<00:03:35.470> example<00:03:35.530> when<00:03:35.829> you

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
because when you for example when you

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.220 
because when you for example when you
get<00:03:36.010> stunned<00:03:36.250> right<00:03:36.400> here<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:37.810> have<00:03:37.840> only

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
get stunned right here you have only

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.410 
get stunned right here you have only
your<00:03:38.410> your<00:03:38.920> mag<00:03:39.070> of<00:03:39.220> ammo<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:39.610> if<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:40.209> don't

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
your your mag of ammo and if you don't

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.210 
your your mag of ammo and if you don't
get<00:03:40.600> them<00:03:40.720> you're<00:03:40.930> dead<00:03:41.140> there's<00:03:41.709> just<00:03:41.980> no

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
get them you're dead there's just no

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.479 
get them you're dead there's just no
other<00:03:42.250> way<00:03:42.400> so<00:03:43.209> it<00:03:43.510> is<00:03:43.600> a<00:03:43.630> really<00:03:43.959> really

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
other way so it is a really really

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.789 
other way so it is a really really
dangerous<00:03:45.489> spots<00:03:46.030> but<00:03:46.329> it<00:03:46.600> works<00:03:46.840> sometimes

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
dangerous spots but it works sometimes

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.680 
dangerous spots but it works sometimes
it<00:03:47.980> doesn't<00:03:48.040> work<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:48.610> like<00:03:48.970> you<00:03:49.150> know<00:03:49.180> you

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
it doesn't work so like you know you

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.250 
it doesn't work so like you know you
just<00:03:49.930> got<00:03:50.110> to<00:03:50.140> go<00:03:50.620> as<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.970> game<00:03:52.060> goes<00:03:52.239> but<00:03:52.570> here

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
just got to go as the game goes but here

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.870 
just got to go as the game goes but here
you<00:03:53.380> know<00:03:53.500> you<00:03:53.769> see<00:03:53.980> you<00:03:54.160> don't<00:03:54.459> have<00:03:54.730> that

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
you know you see you don't have that

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.699 
you know you see you don't have that
many<00:03:55.030> enemies<00:03:55.930> again<00:03:56.200> because<00:03:56.470> they<00:03:56.590> got

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
many enemies again because they got

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.220 
many enemies again because they got
double<00:03:56.920> moved<00:03:57.299> and<00:03:58.299> the<00:03:58.600> game<00:03:58.750> isn't<00:03:58.930> really

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
double moved and the game isn't really

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.050 
double moved and the game isn't really
going<00:03:59.350> that<00:03:59.500> as<00:03:59.650> far<00:03:59.829> as<00:04:00.040> an<00:04:00.130> issue<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:00.640> again

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060
