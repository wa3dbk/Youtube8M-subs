showing<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.789> guys<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.939> glitch<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.539> how<00:00:25.019> to

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
showing you guys a glitch on how to

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.960 
showing you guys a glitch on how to
basically<00:00:25.650> pop<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> wheelie<00:00:26.250> with<00:00:26.580> your<00:00:26.730> car

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
basically pop a wheelie with your car

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.240 
basically pop a wheelie with your car
just<00:00:27.269> have<00:00:27.480> hydraulics<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.920> fairly

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
just have hydraulics this is a fairly

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.980 
just have hydraulics this is a fairly
simple<00:00:29.519> glitch<00:00:29.910> but<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.269> could<00:00:30.449> be<00:00:30.539> difficult

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
simple glitch but it could be difficult

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.569 
simple glitch but it could be difficult
to<00:00:31.109> get<00:00:31.230> used<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.650> but<00:00:31.830> once<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.070> guys<00:00:32.189> do<00:00:32.430> get

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
to get used to but once you guys do get

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.920 
to get used to but once you guys do get
the<00:00:32.669> hang<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.910> things<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.329> fairly<00:00:33.630> simple

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
the hang of things it is fairly simple

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.990 
the hang of things it is fairly simple
so<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.829> order<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.100> do<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.460> splits<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.850> guys

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
so in order to do the splits you guys

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.880 
so in order to do the splits you guys
will<00:00:36.180> need<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> rear<00:00:36.630> end<00:00:36.870> drive<00:00:37.170> car<00:00:37.530> like<00:00:37.770> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
will need a rear end drive car like the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.889 
will need a rear end drive car like the
slam<00:00:38.160> fin<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.550> i'm<00:00:38.670> using<00:00:38.700> right<00:00:38.969> now<00:00:39.149> once

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
slam fin that i'm using right now once

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.240 
slam fin that i'm using right now once
you<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> vehicle<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.040> head

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
there's this yellow thing that you guys

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.410 
there's this yellow thing that you guys
could<00:00:49.469> push<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.640> once<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.850> guys<00:00:50.969> are<00:00:51.030> at<00:00:51.300> the

airport and have your vehicle drive up

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.799 
airport and have your vehicle drive up
against<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.550> yellow<00:00:53.760> thing<00:00:54.030> what<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.690> guys

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
against the yellow thing what you guys

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.630 
against the yellow thing what you guys
want<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.079> do<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.350> drive<00:00:55.590> up<00:00:55.860> against<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.399> very

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
want to do is drive up against it very

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.279 
want to do is drive up against it very
very<00:00:56.850> slowly<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.570> while<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.140> guys<00:00:58.230> are

very slowly and while you guys are
driving<00:00:58.590> up<00:00:58.890> against<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.340> just<00:00:59.489> keep<00:00:59.730> on

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
driving up against it just keep on

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.000 
driving up against it just keep on
accelerating<00:01:00.210> more<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.930> more<00:01:01.079> very<00:01:01.620> slow<00:01:01.859> as

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
accelerating more and more very slow as

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.130 
accelerating more and more very slow as
well<00:01:02.219> until<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.670> get<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.030> max<00:01:03.300> speed<00:01:03.510> now

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
well until you get to the max speed now

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.230 
well until you get to the max speed now
this<00:01:04.379> part<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.799> very<00:01:04.920> very<00:01:05.250> tricky<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.060> might

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
this part is very very tricky it might

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.060 
this part is very very tricky it might
take<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.600> guys<00:01:06.750> some<00:01:06.990> time<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.439> do<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.740> but

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
take you guys some time to do it but

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.230 
take you guys some time to do it but
after<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.430> do<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.580> once<00:01:08.820> you're<00:01:09.060> going<00:01:09.180> to

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
after you do it once you're going to

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.910 
after you do it once you're going to
understand<00:01:09.659> how<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.110> works<00:01:10.140> more<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.860> you're

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
understand how it works more and you're

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.140 
understand how it works more and you're
gonna<00:01:11.070> be<00:01:11.520> no<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.939> be<00:01:12.000> much<00:01:12.119> easier

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
gonna be no it's going to be much easier

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.420 
gonna be no it's going to be much easier
to<00:01:12.540> do<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.439> right<00:01:13.619> over<00:01:13.799> here<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.189> part

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
to do so right over here is the part

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.070 
to do so right over here is the part
that<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.640> got<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.090> work<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.450> was<00:01:15.540> driving<00:01:15.960> up

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
that I got it to work I was driving up

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.870 
that I got it to work I was driving up
against<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.619> very<00:01:16.860> very<00:01:17.040> slowly<00:01:17.280> i<00:01:17.549> was<00:01:17.759> even

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
against it very very slowly i was even

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.490 
against it very very slowly i was even
using<00:01:18.270> my<00:01:18.390> brakes<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.810> little<00:01:18.840> bit<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.259> drive

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
using my brakes a little bit to drive

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.499 
using my brakes a little bit to drive
extremely<00:01:20.009> slow<00:01:20.280> then<00:01:20.820> i<00:01:20.909> let<00:01:21.150> go<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.390> my

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
extremely slow then i let go of my

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.359 
extremely slow then i let go of my
brakes<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.960> accelerate<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.680> fullest<00:01:23.159> and

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
brakes to accelerate to the fullest and

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.950 
brakes to accelerate to the fullest and
now<00:01:23.729> as<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.939> guys<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.299> see<00:01:24.360> once<00:01:24.750> you're<00:01:24.930> on

have hydraulics and this wheelie could

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.020 
have hydraulics and this wheelie could
only<00:01:55.530> be<00:01:55.770> done<00:01:55.920> for<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.250> limited<00:01:56.430> amount<00:01:56.729> of
