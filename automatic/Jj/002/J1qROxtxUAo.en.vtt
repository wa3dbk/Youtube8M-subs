its serial number the serial number

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.280 
its serial number the serial number
generally<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.270> I<00:03:09.330> believe<00:03:09.600> it<00:03:09.810> will

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
generally and I believe it will

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.490 
generally and I believe it will
generally<00:03:10.710> start<00:03:11.250> with<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.880> letter<00:03:12.210> which<00:03:12.930> the

generally start with a letter which the

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.520 
generally start with a letter which the

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
letter coincides with the month so in

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.560 
letter coincides with the month so in
other<00:03:16.620> words<00:03:16.860> if<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.190> have<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.640> letter<00:03:17.850> D<00:03:18.300> as

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
that means that material that bag was

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.260 
that means that material that bag was
produced<00:03:24.360> in<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:25.500> corresponding<00:03:26.459> number
