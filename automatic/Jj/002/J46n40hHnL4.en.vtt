00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
would do get it down get all those

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.750 
would do get it down get all those
juices<00:02:41.240> out<00:02:41.770> now<00:02:42.770> this<00:02:42.920> is<00:02:43.100> much<00:02:43.460> more

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
juices out now this is much more

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.200 
juices out now this is much more
manageable<00:02:44.200> easier<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.320> eat<00:02:45.610> 30<00:02:46.610> seconds

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
manageable easier to eat 30 seconds

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.000 
manageable easier to eat 30 seconds
