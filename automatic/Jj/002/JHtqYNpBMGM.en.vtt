 bernardes from the family of his josé jacinto 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.660
 the tradition in the production of cachaça has

 more than 80 years from generation to generation 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.340
 they were perfecting the process of

 begins with the milling of sugarcane 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.220
 It's from the farm with the broth ready to drink 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.230
 passes to these stainless steel tanks has 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.310
 the fermentation process where it is 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.980
 produced alcohol and every thousand liters 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.710
 180 are suitable for turning into cachaça and 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.050

 testing the acidity of the guide cachaça exists 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.489
 a formula and the chemical components 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.980
 that we will use in the process 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.600
 so the amount of weakening if you 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.579
 put in the cachaça give me the amount 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.590
 has been calculating the entire 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.140
 production of the farm is brought to be 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.620
 aged in these oak barrels.

 the standard cachaça stays for up to two years 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.079
 already the prize cachaça can stay for seven 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.420
 years later it is time to bottle the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.299
 product that has this coloration because 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.790
 the oak barrels are very pleasant 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.729
 you work with the products 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.440
 his josé jacinto has one of 14 ambique 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.840
 from bernardes 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.110
 together, the region's farmers produce 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.450
 more than 190 thousand liters per year 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.869
 to celebrate this production happens until 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.970
 Sunday the 30th cachaça festival is a 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.220
 in a way that we did not find or 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.130
 to give value to our culture here 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.350
 money was really the economy here in 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.590
 cachaça in contrast to other festivals 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.680
 is that here the cachaça arrives in troops in the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:45.329
