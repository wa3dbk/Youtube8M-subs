00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.330
 hello to all so today we're going 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.010
 see together 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.410
 what is the best program of 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.020
 bodybuilding possible then every day 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.550
 I get a ton of questions about 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.540
 quite wacky workout programs 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.860
 at day two techniques 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.480
 Intensification like the series 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.970
 degressive repetitions forced the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.559
 super 7 etc and I thought it would be 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.330
 well to take stock with you on the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.800
 what was the best program 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:48.300
 weight training possible 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.770
 for you no first point what makes 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.989
 progress in the short term does not make 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.440
 necessarily progress in the medium and long 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.180
 term for example I'm doing a session in 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.550
 super 16 degressive advisers I have 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.870
 great sensations I have arms all 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.110
 inflated the next day I have a small 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.180
 body aches but it's a safe bet 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.920
 it will not make you progress 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.070
 and in the long run so a good program 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.479
 it's already something that fits 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.850
 in a logic of progression in the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.979
 duration in time so a good 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.140
 program 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.569
 first of all it's having a good 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.009
 technical discussions of the exercise 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:24.560
 dangerous especially on the raised of 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.550
 earth I like to take this example 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.630
 because often the deadlift is going 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.060
 do anything 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.550
 we see people as the charge 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.619
 show that the bar fills used 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.810
 an inappropriate technique with aude 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.119
 the lower back all round which leads 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.979
 inexorably to the injury is to 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.800
 stopping the training to start again 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.990
 all the way down and therefore relearn the 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.619
 movement to blame then then a 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.630
 good program 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.340
 you must have a good technique 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.250
 of execution so that your progress 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.929
 are in the long term 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.550
 he's allowed on this exercise and I 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.289
 even encourages you to cheat slightly 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.660
 without it becoming anything 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.950
 to progress I explain this for 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.770
 those interested in my ebooks 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.720
 available this rudy caya points like the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.759
 second point is to understand 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.830
 that a good program must fit into 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.610
 a logic of progression in a 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.720
 overall program where each session 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.349
 interacts with another session and then a 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.950
 other session 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:24.780
 the sessions are not unique 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.730
 knows no sport no where one 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.860
 trains according to the shape of the day 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.390
 as a single session it's true 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.920
 that right now it's fashionable to say 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.959
 that we train according to the shape of the 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.610
 day we do not have the shape we put the 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.090
 giants force not too much who are both 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.129
 we will go up a lot more for 99% of 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.110
 people who read me so who are not 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.340
 people practicing bodybuilding 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.010
 an advanced level but who are 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.599
 beginners at the intermediate level he 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.099
 is important to understand that we do not 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.239
 not training according to the shape of the day 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.530
 but well according to his planning well 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.989
 following how one announced his 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.129
 program to make progress on 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.599
 the medium and long term 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.120
 we can not as you are is 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.769
 advanced say themselves like today I feel 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.030
 well I feel good if I'm going 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.920
 work more there - here and it's 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.019
 actually as a beginner or 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.599
 intermediate you have a margin of 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.760
 much more than 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.849
 advanced person who will fight for 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.290
 gain a few millimeters or a few 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.790
 pounds more on the bar while 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.519
 you can prove it's a lot more 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.269
 by following a program that fits 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:32.459
 in the duration of each session done 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.329
 part of a global program 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.940
 it's really important to 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.530
 understand often I see people 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.019
 on the three workouts change 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.519
 of exercise and tell me ah that's a lot 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.959
 better than what I did before it's 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.010
 super I have better feelings of 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.750
 best aches etc 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.190
 but that's again the short 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.049
 term it's not the medium and long 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.389
 terms on the short term like I you 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.150
 said we can progress with almost 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:56.579
 everything and anything so do it well 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.810
 be careful that each session makes you 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.660
 progress for the next 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.120
 and for the next 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.850
 in order to take moose it's really 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.200
 very very important to understand that 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.000
 it's the same our mode of the moment it's 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.990
 to say we like to go to failure 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.500
 trains until the last 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.610
 possible repetition actually on the 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.290
 account and it works very well I 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.049
 do for some time even 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.340
 several years and I realized 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.959
 filling it did not work anymore 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.550
 was not progressing however we could 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.370
 a few weeks and then stagnated 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.560
 that's how I stagnated a year I 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.330
 from 2004 to 2005 without any progress 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.480
 because I was actually going to fail 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.130
 at each session as much as possible and therefore 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.960
 it only worked a few weeks and 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.310
 after I stagnated I did not progress 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.880
 actually I had the same physique 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.470
 the next year so that's why 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.940
 go to failure or train next 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.220
 its form these are really techniques 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.830
 who walks on the very short term and 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.360
 not on the medium and long term to 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.570
 unless you are an athlete 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.100
 confirmed and you know better 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.290
 that I do not know you what should 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.270
 to be the case if you are finally advanced 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.010
 last point a good program 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.750
 workout the best workout 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.290
 possible for you need to consider 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.180
 of you so your flexibility talk about 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.820
 your mobility of your weak points 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.050
 of your time morphology of which you 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.960
 have to train yourself 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.580
 we'll take two examples you're not going 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.190
 not planned a training program 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.360
 over 5 days if you can 20 us if 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.120
 you can only train three 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.070
 days a week depending on the weather 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.419
 do you actually have and second 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.440
 point you're not going to force your 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.669
 entity of his exercise 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.910
 because you were told that it was a 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.290
 two examples the bench press like 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.730
 I talk about it in super training 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.950
 pectorals so available again one 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.130
 times this rudy caya points like all the 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.570
 world 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.750
 at the base does not have the flexibility 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.970
 sufficient to lower the recumbent tire 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.919
 we touch the bar on the pecs to 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.780
 each repetition especially if we want 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:51.410
 go down on the top of the pecs so 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.310
 here in order to work over the top of the 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.169
 pectorals bench press 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.340
 so you should never force 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.169
 flexibility otherwise you risk 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.820
 actually the injury still a 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.510
 time if we take our example it can 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.490
 to be the squat 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.090
 I do not have the flexibility to 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.230
 go down in full squat in complete squat 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:09.740
 with a vacuum bar but with the 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.720
 load gets there actually you go 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.600
 quickly hurt yourself because you impose a 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.030
 stretching too much 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.550
 important to your muscles that are more 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:20.130
 steep than it should be if you 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.900
 want to make the movement in amplitude 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.500
 complete so again do not force 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.580
 never amplitude on an exercise 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.920
 if you really want to register 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.300
 your progress in the long term as I you 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.610
 say it from the beginning of the video 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.990
 so I hope I enlightened you on 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.540
 what was the best program of 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:39.510
 bodybuilding for you and that you can 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.620
 can adapt it to you for those who 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.030
 want more information on how 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.610
 progress and that's so I recommend 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:48.000
 again but ebooks and training 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.440
 this rudy caya dot com thank you so much 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.640
 your shares and we'll see you soon 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.640
