00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.909
 well well 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.780
 in a stratum of kids how about with 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.080
 six good I know it takes a while without 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:17.010
 upload videos but it's like I have 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.150
 only 13 years is worth 14 and right now 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.860
 I have to study is worth the last 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.890
 quarter and I have to squeeze quite 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.090
 if I want to pass courses and that's why 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.600
 I'm uploading videos I'm uploading 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.430
 a lot and I hope you apologize and 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.230
 say another thing that many thanks 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.570
 for the 100 subscribers you really are 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.820
 all crash all I love you very much 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.340
 really 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.340
 and I come to bring you a little trick 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:46.420
 It's worth very cookie 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.280
 basically serves so that mods do not 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.190
 hit you for example I put a 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.500
 skeleton not pincer arrow on the balls 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.150
 the command login hits you the scripps no 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.980
 the witch exploits you they do not throw you 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.620
 potions and little pigments hits you 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.980
 is quite epic first in third 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.430
 year is packaged by aitor dÃ­az step 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.080
 to begin with, this is worth 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.229
 lightbox is worth of this block that would be 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.790
 the black lines that come out then 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.100
 As you can see, I can get in 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.899
 here it's worth and when I get in here it's like 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.640
 was inside the block and is 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.130
 you can not get hit inside a block 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.690
 the mods are not even worth these are 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.399
 all the ways that do not hit you are worth 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.380
 the skeletons play the ndr plus the 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.050
 crepes the witch and so on 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.840
 neither the line and the more plus me nor 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.310
 neither of the two types of spider is worth 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.530
 but is that this thing has a small 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.530
 fail now for example I put myself here 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.220
 from zero 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.110
 and look what happened I put some 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.190
 caletas 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.810
 if it stays like looking at me now it's 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.500
 as if it were not valid, not like I do not 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.230
 he hates me 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.470
 it's something baby hit him more shoots a 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.450
 arrow but while I'm in here not 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.700
 I will shoot 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.560
 I do not know what it is for, because 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.070
 if you are half hearted 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:11.379
 you can do is eat a chop for 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:14.019
 to recover or what is called a 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.130
 friend if you do not have food online if 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.310
 you're playing in multi called a friend 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.190
 to come and help you basically is 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.739
 that's worth collecting this here and what 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.420
 same goes with the place nor disdain 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.299
 from above to image as well as I have a 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.780
 cake is worth right now of that play knows 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.780
 That I am here 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.049
 right now he knows we're here but 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.079
 there are not games where flying is not 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.579
 it's like looking like that acquiring 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.140
 throws us a ball but you can not 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:49.590
 to stand up is something call the spear 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.239
 it makes me stay here 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.040
 perfect with manga loren a little 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.040
 I'm going to put it on and hit him 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.680
 yes 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.319
 it looks like you're on an island 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:11.590
 I imagine you do not get hit 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.740
 when he gets here but I like it 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.740
 quite 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.520
 is perfect and that 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.000
 is waiting for me to go there for 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.000
 that sticks 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 yes 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:31.020
 and good the clips we put u and I 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.820
 I wanted to explode does not explode me baby do not 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.820
 exploits explodes 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.010
 and with the witch basically 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.110
 he runs out of that because he's still here 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.880
 perfectly does not have any position 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.120
 at the moment so as not to hit him 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.310
 well for me that has a resino potion 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.070
 in the position zone that can not be worth 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.770
 but when he does not see us the potion is removed 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.750
 or when you see us he puts it on and he 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.970
 again remove this we do without and we 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.700
 we see again this is also very useful 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.890
 to kill pretty useful witch and those 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.290
 pigments did not happen once you were 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.530
 by sneijder and hits and unintentionally a 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:18.300
 pigment pursues pencil me nothing father 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.300
 Well, if I here three said rights 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.690
 what darwin's shit 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.900
 have you seen these things are quite 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.150
 useful that are made at this time 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.919
 I've done it, I just come 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.750
 taught this trick so that you know more 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.970
 that nothing is worth if you can put a 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:40.150
 shine at the time of facebook to what 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.150
 better but nothing more that you do this 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.250
 of the cake that can not rise up 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.250
 the heights of the fence 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.340
 all right 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.690
 perfect and the same thing happened with the online 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.520
 that you stay like that and the spider has a 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.770
 effect a little strange what teaches 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.490
 right now it's not from this one that 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.490
 poison better of this that they are more 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.490
 sociable 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.920
 they stay as well as in search plan 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.080
 know that I am here the same thing has 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.150
 glued 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.970
 a bit fake to me the more the block went up 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.500
 of the cake that's fine the same thing happens 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.289
 with a cave spider but when it jumps 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.810
 you poison yourself to fuck this does not happen 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.270
 nothing is looking at you and that 's it and 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.189
 now the zombies this we have putada 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.379
 because these of the most there is what 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:37.080
 more for culero that comes to you 80 blocks 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:40.560
 Well, this is the bitch of the day that 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.920
 It hides imitating what happens, it beats you 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.850
 how it came up here but I see you 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.080
 It's a shame because if you do not hit her 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.900
 basically it is that simply here already 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.610
 in the immortal moll but if you stay 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.380
 nobody here to stick something 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.310
 it means it is not recommended because 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.310
 yes a zombie 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.330
 and well this has been basically everything 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.520
 ok and I say it again sorry for 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.980
 upload videos this has been a small 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.900
 trick if you want me to know that you 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:17.030
 make some guide to some minigame of 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.030
 some server or something 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.990
 If you want me to do something here, 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:26.470
 you said to me it does not cost me absolutely 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.540
 nothing is good and I had prepared a 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:32.050
 Specially, it lasted 15 minutes but 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.760
 he would not let me upload it to youtube 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.160
 I can upload videos of more than 15 minutes 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.770
 what happens is that I do not want to be worth 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.900
 I want because first you kill me 80 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.900
 years to upload them literally 80 years 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.870
 and like it's not worth it and it did not let me 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.330
 upload them I went up has started to climb 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.880
 youtube and I gave error and did not upload it 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.860
 I 'm going to have to do another 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.930
 I made that video with a couple of friends 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.790
 is worth teaching a few things 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:02.600
 hi pixel service is worth a small 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:04.490
 guide to a game but it did not work that way 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.470
 that I will also leave you the channels of 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.590
 miami with the description is worth to throw a 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.390
 look or if you want and well this follows 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.190
 all jce subscribe and I do not have a 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.330
 next video and tell me the 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.070
 comments what do you want me to do in the 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.020
 next video I have quite a few 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.600
 things prepared but if you want 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.670
 do something in particular tell me and not 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.210
 I have no problem and good until 

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:27.919
 then 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.919
 what the fuck I have here mounted
