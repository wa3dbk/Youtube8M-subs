00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
guppy a little moth larvae after in

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.929 
guppy a little moth larvae after in
there<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> while<00:01:11.040> ago

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
there a while ago

there a while ago
I'm<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.780> letting<00:01:12.900> them<00:01:13.110> grow<00:01:13.320> out<00:01:13.590> until

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
I'm just letting them grow out until

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.980 
I'm just letting them grow out until
they<00:01:14.729> get<00:01:14.880> big<00:01:15.119> enough<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.570> where<00:01:15.720> they<00:01:15.840> won't

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
they get big enough to where they won't

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.240 
they get big enough to where they won't
get<00:01:16.140> picked<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.500> too<00:01:16.740> much<00:01:16.920> from<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> other

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
get picked on too much from the other

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.630 
get picked on too much from the other
tank<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.570> right<00:01:19.259> now<00:01:19.409> that's<00:01:19.619> that's<00:01:20.310> where<00:01:20.520> it

tank so right now that's that's where it
is<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:21.240> tank<00:01:21.600> will<00:01:21.780> eventually<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.320> am<00:01:22.439> going

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
is this tank will eventually I am going

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.940 
is this tank will eventually I am going
to<00:01:22.950> dirt<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:24.060> sand<00:01:24.530> looked<00:01:25.530> good<00:01:25.740> when

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
to dirt this this sand looked good when

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.679 
to dirt this this sand looked good when
I<00:01:25.979> first<00:01:26.220> got<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.670> was<00:01:26.759> happy<00:01:26.970> with<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.240> but

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
I first got it I was happy with it but

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.810 
I first got it I was happy with it but
the<00:01:28.320> plants<00:01:28.710> just<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.720> those<00:01:30.720> plants<00:01:31.200> they

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
the plants just like those plants they

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.130 
the plants just like those plants they
compared<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> other<00:01:33.240> tank<00:01:33.570> they<00:01:33.810> don't

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
compared to the other tank they don't

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.200 
compared to the other tank they don't
look<00:01:34.759> good<00:01:35.759> at<00:01:35.970> all

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
look good at all

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.270 
look good at all
the<00:01:36.570> other<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.049> other<00:01:37.200> tank<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.799> took<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> little

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the other the other tank I took a little

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.460 
the other the other tank I took a little
sprout<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.000> out<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.360> here<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.170> put<00:01:40.380> it

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
sprout like that out of here and put it

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.130 
sprout like that out of here and put it
in<00:01:40.619> there<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.189> it's<00:01:42.090> really<00:01:42.659> tall<00:01:42.869> it's

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
in there and it's it's really tall it's

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.950 
in there and it's it's really tall it's
really<00:01:43.380> thick<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:43.920> do<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.159> really<00:01:44.280> well<00:01:44.549> so

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
really thick it's do it really well so

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.289 
really thick it's do it really well so
dirt<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.259> way<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.619> go<00:01:46.890> for<00:01:47.399> substrate<00:01:48.000> and

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
dirt is the way to go for substrate and

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.590 
dirt is the way to go for substrate and
hold<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.990> much<00:01:49.140> nutrients<00:01:49.649> for<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.829> plants

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
hold so much nutrients for the plants

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.969 
hold so much nutrients for the plants
the<00:01:51.600> duckweed<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.259> top<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.649> don't<00:01:52.799> know<00:01:52.890> if

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
the duckweed on the top I don't know if

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.280 
the duckweed on the top I don't know if
you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.159> see<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.549> that's<00:01:54.090> why<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.200> lot
