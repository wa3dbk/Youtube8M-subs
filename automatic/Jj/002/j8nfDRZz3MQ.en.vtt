00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
keeps your being even on one of them

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.520 
keeps your being even on one of them
online<00:03:58.849> free<00:03:59.180> ones<00:03:59.419> though<00:04:00.019> I<00:04:00.049> didn't<00:04:00.290> see<00:04:00.409> the

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
online free ones though I didn't see the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.479 
online free ones though I didn't see the
point<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:00.889> spend<00:04:01.099> the<00:04:01.159> money<00:04:01.340> so<00:04:03.489> something

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
point and spend the money so something

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.219 
point and spend the money so something
like<00:04:04.519> that<00:04:04.849> I<00:04:04.879> think<00:04:04.969> the<00:04:05.239> time<00:04:05.389> is<00:04:05.419> an<00:04:05.780> open<00:04:06.109> at

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:06.229 
like that I think the time is an open at

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:09.459 
like that I think the time is an open at
time<00:04:06.439> n<00:04:06.590> now<00:04:07.549> if<00:04:07.849> you<00:04:08.060> want<00:04:08.239> that's<00:04:08.689> good<00:04:09.079> that
