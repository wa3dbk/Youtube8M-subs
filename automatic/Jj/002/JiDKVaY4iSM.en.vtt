much of the labour was done behind this
plastic<00:02:03.040> removing<00:02:04.040> asbestos

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
plastic removing asbestos

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.790 
plastic removing asbestos
I<00:02:05.030> think<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.750> asbestos<00:02:05.900> abatement<00:02:06.320> has<00:02:06.710> been

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
I think the asbestos abatement has been

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.590 
I think the asbestos abatement has been
the<00:02:06.890> biggest<00:02:07.160> challenge<00:02:07.520> on<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.670> project<00:02:08.119> the

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
the biggest challenge on the project the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.570 
the biggest challenge on the project the
next<00:02:08.930> step<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.350> stripping<00:02:09.800> out<00:02:09.950> everything

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
next step is stripping out everything

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.960 
next step is stripping out everything
down<00:02:11.210> to<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.510> bare<00:02:11.720> metal<00:02:11.990> and<00:02:12.410> concrete

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
down to the bare metal and concrete

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.120 
down to the bare metal and concrete
that's<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.090> same<00:02:14.270> there<00:02:15.170> you<00:02:15.530> can<00:02:15.710> see<00:02:15.920> where

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
that's the same there you can see where

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.550 
that's the same there you can see where
they've<00:02:16.280> actually<00:02:16.330> removed<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.560> locker-room

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
they've actually removed the locker-room

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.800 
they've actually removed the locker-room
areas<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.640> walls<00:02:19.880> and<00:02:20.210> locker<00:02:20.420> rooms<00:02:20.540> of

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
areas the walls and locker rooms of

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:21.970 
areas the walls and locker rooms of
these<00:02:20.930> bottom<00:02:21.230> areas<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.560> can<00:02:21.680> see<00:02:21.710> they're

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
these bottom areas you can see they're

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.640 
these bottom areas you can see they're
completely<00:02:22.280> stripped<00:02:22.580> down<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:23.410> concrete<00:02:24.410> and

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
completely stripped down to concrete and

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.380 
completely stripped down to concrete and
steel<00:02:25.100> at<00:02:25.250> this<00:02:25.430> point<00:02:25.700> there's<00:02:25.910> a<00:02:25.940> few<00:02:26.150> pipes

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
steel at this point there's a few pipes

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.420 
steel at this point there's a few pipes
left<00:02:26.630> in<00:02:26.750> there<00:02:26.990> those<00:02:27.470> were<00:02:27.650> Suites<00:02:27.980> right<00:02:28.280> up

what's<00:03:16.170> going<00:03:16.320> to<00:03:16.350> happen<00:03:16.440> is<00:03:16.860> a<00:03:16.890> sequence<00:03:17.730> of

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
what's going to happen is a sequence of

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.990 
what's going to happen is a sequence of
delayed<00:03:18.780> implosions<00:03:19.770> from<00:03:20.010> dynamite<00:03:20.340> loaded

delayed implosions from dynamite loaded

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.790 
delayed implosions from dynamite loaded
in<00:03:21.090> each<00:03:21.210> column<00:03:21.750> that's<00:03:22.140> going<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.470> go<00:03:22.620> in

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
in each column that's going to go in

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.430 
in each column that's going to go in
kind<00:03:23.520> of<00:03:23.670> a<00:03:23.760> clock<00:03:24.090> sequence<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.020> then<00:03:25.320> the

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
kind of a clock sequence and then the

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.500 
kind of a clock sequence and then the
outer<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:26.400> outer<00:03:26.430> buttresses<00:03:27.210> are<00:03:27.330> going<00:03:27.450> to

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
outer the outer buttresses are going to

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.510 
outer the outer buttresses are going to
fall<00:03:27.750> in<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:27.990> sequence<00:03:28.410> also<00:03:28.770> and<00:03:28.920> lay<00:03:29.070> down<00:03:29.100> so

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
fall in a sequence also and lay down so

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.699 
fall in a sequence also and lay down so
it's<00:03:29.640> kind<00:03:29.850> of<00:03:29.880> like<00:03:30.030> slicing<00:03:30.660> bread<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.470> the

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
it's kind of like slicing bread so the

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.580 
it's kind of like slicing bread so the
roll<00:03:31.980> roll<00:03:32.580> it<00:03:32.820> in<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.209> there'll<00:03:33.690> be<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.930> half

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
roll roll it in and there'll be a half

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.670 
roll roll it in and there'll be a half
second<00:03:35.130> interval<00:03:35.820> all<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.750> way<00:03:36.930> all<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.650> way

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
second interval all the way all the way

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.670

presses the button how long does this

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.940 
presses the button how long does this
whole<00:03:42.900> process<00:03:43.110> take

there's<00:03:45.500> 5554<00:03:46.500> half<00:03:46.950> second<00:03:47.430> delays<00:03:48.200> so<00:03:49.200> not

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
there's 5554 half second delays so not

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.070 
there's 5554 half second delays so not
quite<00:03:49.709> a<00:03:49.739> minute<00:03:50.190> but<00:03:50.610> it's<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.850> long<00:03:51.090> time<00:03:51.120> for

then we dust as a result of breaking up

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:51.699 
then we dust as a result of breaking up
of<00:05:49.429> all<00:05:49.639> this<00:05:49.789> concrete<00:05:50.089> now<00:05:50.899> the<00:05:50.959> quantity<00:05:51.679> I

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:51.709 
of all this concrete now the quantity I

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:53.499 
of all this concrete now the quantity I
don't<00:05:52.069> know<00:05:52.219> that<00:05:52.429> anybody<00:05:52.819> could<00:05:53.059> know<00:05:53.089> and

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:53.509 
don't know that anybody could know and

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:55.779 
don't know that anybody could know and
measure<00:05:53.719> but<00:05:54.529> it's<00:05:54.679> going<00:05:54.860> to<00:05:54.949> be<00:05:55.129> a<00:05:55.159> function

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
measure but it's going to be a function

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:00.790 
measure but it's going to be a function
of<00:05:55.939> wind<00:05:56.240> direction<00:05:58.059> so<00:05:59.349> you<00:06:00.349> certainly<00:06:00.589> want

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
of wind direction so you certainly want

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.279 
of wind direction so you certainly want
to<00:06:01.069> consider<00:06:01.520> your<00:06:02.149> location<00:06:02.809> point<00:06:03.080> that

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
to consider your location point that

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:05.379 
to consider your location point that
you're<00:06:03.529> not<00:06:03.830> your<00:06:04.339> upwind<00:06:04.729> and<00:06:04.939> not<00:06:05.089> down<00:06:05.360> with

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
you're not your upwind and not down with

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.540 
you're not your upwind and not down with
so<00:06:06.319> it<00:06:06.379> is<00:06:06.469> something<00:06:06.740> that<00:06:06.919> people<00:06:07.099> need<00:06:07.369> to

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
so it is something that people need to

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.100 
so it is something that people need to
be<00:06:07.610> aware<00:06:07.879> they<00:06:07.969> need<00:06:07.999> to<00:06:08.270> be<00:06:08.419> to<00:06:08.629> be<00:06:08.689> aware<00:06:09.050> of

be aware they need to be to be aware of

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.249 
be aware they need to be to be aware of
it<00:06:09.499> and<00:06:10.149> my<00:06:11.149> advice<00:06:11.479> is<00:06:11.719> to<00:06:11.839> stay<00:06:12.050> home<00:06:12.199> and
