00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 do not 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.629
 hello david gonzález and we are here in a 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:15.090
 new video now I bring you what it is 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:18.600
 the outfit 2 for what is windows 8 and 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:21.869
 8.1 As you can see here, what is already working 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.499
 which is completely what the suite is 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.900
 for some some motherboard is not 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.730
 available on what the page is because 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.279
 the company has to update all 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.960
 the dead or possibly not going to 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.970
 be so I bring you the solution for 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.460
 that can download what is this 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.710
 tool because it's very necessary for 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.540
 to be able to take our computer to 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.970
 maximum performance or as it should 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.040
 work so to start we're going to 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.130
 see and corroborate that they oscillated a 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.050
 windows 8 like in here is more than obvious 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.840
 I'm working a 28 but I'm 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.540
 working really hard 8.1 now let's go 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.430
 already to what is the download 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.740
 let's go to this link that I'm going to 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.760
 leave here below in the description and 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.680
 Well, here we are going to see 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.720
 and this is not love because maybe 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.340
 we have but that does not matter 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.830
 because the program is still going to work 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.310
 we come to this tab here says 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.290
 downloads or download and then we look for the 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.450
 operating system that we have 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.050
 in this case we have to position for 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.910
 the 10 thousand 28 8.1 and then here is in 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.640
 the four options because it works for 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.850
 32 bits and 64 bits in each of the 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.180
 operating systems mine would be 8.1 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.210
 64 bit and here it will show us what 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.140
 which are all the drivers of this 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.660
 motherboard that does not interest us 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.170
 we the only thing that interests us is 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.450
 to be able to develop the a2 suite 2 and 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.140
 well here we see that the first one that we 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.120
 appears that is with getino díaz that is the 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.550
 well now, it really says here 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:00.290
 suite 2 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:03.080
 escape from windows xp view 7 8.1 is the 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.890
 30 and 64 bits and here below all come 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.229
 its functions 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.270
 and the only thing we have to do to 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.190
 download it is to give to any of 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.710
 these 3 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.500
 these three links we can also occupy 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.210
 what is torrent that is this but for 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.310
 those who do not know how to use it, we can 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:25.020
 occupy any of these three we give 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.830
 here and we give it to him and we exhibit in the 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.060
 letters that we 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:34.230
 and put us and we give what is submit 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.480
 there begins to download what is already the 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.250
 the whole suite but I 'm going to cancel it 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.099
 because I really have it 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.890
 downloaded and installed but I'm going to 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.690
 show how they have to install it 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.980
 once they have already downloaded what is 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.160
 the whole file 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.680
 we give you here in extract in holt suite and 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.530
 Well, it's going to start downloading to me 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.870
 says not that I do want to replace it 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.900
 and he's going to give it to all because then 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.430
 already download it here and unzip it 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.340
 sorry 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.319
 let's get into this folder and to 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.530
 to install the suite we give here 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:14.569
 where he says he is and we give him yes 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.480
 when we give him this he begins what is 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.400
 the one of the installation sorry 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.459
 and let's wait what is a moment 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.709
 well here it was already opened what is the 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.180
 installer and says thank you for using the 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.420
 installation assistant asus the 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.370
 suite 2 and we give what is next 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.420
 as you see here it shows us all the 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.540
 functions that the all suite has 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.540
 you will appear in this case all 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.579
 marked because they may not have 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.090
 none installed to me does not seem 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.769
 none with a check because I already have 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.900
 all installed here I made the version 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.599
 that I have installed and the version that there is 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.540
 available for obvious reasons to me 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:59.879
 as in this law it does not appear that all 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.410
 are selected and the only thing 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.829
 you have to do is give it here 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.310
 install and will start installing everything 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:11.060
 I will give cancel 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.330
 well I know what the row is but 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.480
 let's open it again 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:20.049
 well we give you what it is to go out 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.520
 program and I gave him out and then we're going to 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.650
 reopen what is the all suites 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.770
 to see what you see is 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.379
 fully functioning as you see here 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.090
 I already opened it and that's all for 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:34.610
 this video I hope it serves them well 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.919
 you can keep going up how they work 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.860
 each of these tools because it 's 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.349
 quite important to know how it works 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.360
 each of them to get the most 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.580
 benefit to what is our processor 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.460
 our motherboard our ram all 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.319
 our computer so I leave them 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.569
 subscribe they leave like they comment if they 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:55.729
 liked and if it did not work too 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:05:00.039
 comment to see if how to know other 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.039
 solutions see you in the next video
