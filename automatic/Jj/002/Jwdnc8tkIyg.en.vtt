from teapot party about how to apply
glycolic<00:00:30.270> exfoliant<00:00:30.950> if<00:00:31.950> water<00:00:32.369> deactivates

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
glycolic exfoliant if water deactivates

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.520 
glycolic exfoliant if water deactivates
glycolic<00:00:33.600> acid<00:00:33.960> does<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.290> mean<00:00:34.500> that

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
glycolic acid does this mean that

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.820 
glycolic acid does this mean that
water-based<00:00:35.309> peels<00:00:35.640> are<00:00:35.820> useless<00:00:36.260> well<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
water-based peels are useless well the

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.880 
water-based peels are useless well the
way<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.250> which<00:00:38.430> water<00:00:39.260> deactivates<00:00:40.260> glycolic

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
way in which water deactivates glycolic

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.369 
way in which water deactivates glycolic
is<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.309> by<00:00:41.460> diluting<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
is just by diluting it so the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.130 
is just by diluting it so the
preparation<00:00:44.250> which<00:00:44.519> is<00:00:44.730> aqueous<00:00:45.000> water<00:00:45.870> base

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
preparation which is aqueous water base

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.140

that your glycolic peel comes in of
course<00:00:48.780> has<00:00:49.140> been<00:00:49.170> calibrated<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:50.400> be<00:00:50.550> at<00:00:50.670> a

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
course has been calibrated to be at a

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.520 
course has been calibrated to be at a
certain<00:00:51.000> percent<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.750> delivers<00:00:52.350> that

certain percent and delivers that

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.760 
certain percent and delivers that
percent<00:00:52.949> glycolic<00:00:53.520> acid<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.540> only<00:00:54.780> copious

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
percent glycolic acid it's only copious

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.709 
percent glycolic acid it's only copious
amounts<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.219> water<00:00:56.430> afterwards<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.450> rinses

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
amounts of water afterwards that rinses

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.709 
amounts of water afterwards that rinses
the<00:00:58.050> glycolic<00:00:58.710> off<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.460> deactivates<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:00.300> so

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the glycolic off that deactivates it so

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.720 
the glycolic off that deactivates it so
no<00:01:01.200> there's<00:01:01.530> no<00:01:01.860> problem<00:01:02.370> with<00:01:02.399> water-based

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
no there's no problem with water-based

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.609 
no there's no problem with water-based
glycolic<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.540> that's<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.840> only<00:01:03.870> type<00:01:04.589> of

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
glycolic and that's the only type of

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.249 
glycolic and that's the only type of
glycolic<00:01:05.309> peel<00:01:05.550> solution<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.110> can

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
glycolic peel solution that that you can

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.420 
glycolic peel solution that that you can
have<00:01:09.170> Erin<00:01:10.170> asks<00:01:10.560> about<00:01:10.710> what<00:01:11.100> our<00:01:11.130> free

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
have Erin asks about what our free

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.300 
have Erin asks about what our free
radicals<00:01:11.910> is<00:01:12.119> tretinoin<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.350> antioxidant

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
radicals is tretinoin and antioxidant

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.150 
radicals is tretinoin and antioxidant
like<00:01:14.610> vitamin<00:01:15.420> A<00:01:15.570> well<00:01:16.500> that's<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.979> good

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
like vitamin A well that's a good

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.700 
like vitamin A well that's a good
question<00:01:17.340> Erin<00:01:17.880> because<00:01:18.600> tretinoin<00:01:19.530> of

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
question Erin because tretinoin of

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.490 
question Erin because tretinoin of
course<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.190> a<00:01:20.250> derivative<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.940> vitamin<00:01:21.119> A<00:01:21.509> but

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
course is a derivative of vitamin A but

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.940 
course is a derivative of vitamin A but
it<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:23.160> very<00:01:23.399> different<00:01:24.149> from<00:01:24.539> actual<00:01:25.200> vitamin

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
it is very different from actual vitamin

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.330 
it is very different from actual vitamin
A<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.580> vitamin<00:01:27.270> A<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.840> very<00:01:28.229> good

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
A so vitamin A is a very good

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.980 
A so vitamin A is a very good
antioxidant<00:01:29.340> tretinoin<00:01:30.180> also<00:01:30.689> known<00:01:30.869> as

retina<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.560> not<00:01:32.280> an<00:01:32.490> antioxidant<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.450> has<00:01:33.689> no

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
retina is not an antioxidant and has no

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.770 
retina is not an antioxidant and has no
antioxidant<00:01:35.189> powers<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.509> great

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
antioxidant powers it's a great

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.920 
antioxidant powers it's a great
exfoliant<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.610> not<00:01:38.939> an<00:01:39.180> antioxidant

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930

using a liquid cleanser at all well
getting<00:02:03.600> nailed<00:02:03.780> that's<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.110> very<00:02:04.320> interesting

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
getting nailed that's a very interesting

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.359 
getting nailed that's a very interesting
question<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.420> actually<00:02:06.420> some<00:02:07.380> people<00:02:07.770> can

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
question and actually some people can

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.009 
question and actually some people can
get<00:02:08.670> away<00:02:08.759> with<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.209> but<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.810> whole<00:02:09.959> point

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
get away with that but the whole point

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.740 
get away with that but the whole point
of<00:02:10.440> using<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.890> toner<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.519> to<00:02:11.970> get<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.120> synergy

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
of using the toner is to get a synergy

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.050 
of using the toner is to get a synergy
between<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.560> toner<00:02:13.799> and<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.220> cleanser<00:02:14.610> so

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
between the toner and the cleanser so

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.420 
between the toner and the cleanser so
that<00:02:15.209> neither<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.750> them<00:02:16.049> has<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.650> be<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:17.040> harsh

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
that neither of them has to be so harsh

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.170
