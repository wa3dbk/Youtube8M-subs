pro<00:00:02.810> now<00:00:03.810> think<00:00:04.049> about<00:00:04.350> it<00:00:04.589> when<00:00:05.190> you're<00:00:05.370> on

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
pro now think about it when you're on

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.650 
pro now think about it when you're on
the<00:00:05.640> moon<00:00:07.519> with<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.639> Rockets<00:00:09.059> that's<00:00:09.450> going

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
the moon with the Rockets that's going

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.580 
the moon with the Rockets that's going
to<00:00:09.750> take<00:00:09.929> you<00:00:10.080> home

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
to take you home

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.589 
to take you home
there's<00:00:11.340> several<00:00:11.639> things<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:12.150> are<00:00:12.420> really

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
there's several things that are really

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.829 
there's several things that are really
important

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.500 

the<00:00:16.320> first<00:00:16.590> thing<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:18.000> want<00:00:18.270> your

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
the first thing is that you want your

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.269 
the first thing is that you want your
fuel<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.460> the<00:00:20.460> oxidizer<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.810> react<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:23.039> don't

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
fuel and the oxidizer to react you don't

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.830 
fuel and the oxidizer to react you don't
want<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.640> have<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.880> get<00:00:24.060> out<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.480> rocket

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
want to have to get out of the rocket

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.900 
want to have to get out of the rocket
and<00:00:25.050> start<00:00:25.410> lighting<00:00:25.800> matches<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.730> hope

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
and start lighting matches in the hope

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.660 
and start lighting matches in the hope
that<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.330> thing<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.630> going<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.869> react<00:00:28.670> you

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
that the thing is going to react you

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.930 
that the thing is going to react you
then<00:00:29.939> also<00:00:30.390> want<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.660> make<00:00:30.840> sure<00:00:31.369> that<00:00:32.369> when<00:00:32.790> it

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
then also want to make sure that when it

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.549 
then also want to make sure that when it
reacts<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.660> reacts<00:00:34.020> with<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.290> lot<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.770> energy

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
reacts it reacts with a lot of energy

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.119 
reacts it reacts with a lot of energy

a<00:01:20.680> few<00:01:20.920> minutes<00:01:21.250> ago<00:01:21.399> and<00:01:21.930> i<00:01:22.930> think<00:01:23.289> that<00:01:24.220> it

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
a few minutes ago and i think that it

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.499 
a few minutes ago and i think that it

going to put in the oxygen this is the

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.680 
going to put in the oxygen this is the

our<00:02:44.500> fuel<00:02:44.739> tank<00:02:44.980> when<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.819> vaporizes<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:47.260> falls

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
our fuel tank when it vaporizes it falls

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.210 
our fuel tank when it vaporizes it falls
in<00:02:48.129> a<00:02:48.760> part<00:02:49.060> into<00:02:49.480> two<00:02:49.510> pieces<00:02:49.930> no.2<00:02:50.590> which<00:02:51.010> is

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
in a part into two pieces no.2 which is

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.540 
in a part into two pieces no.2 which is
done<00:02:51.459> which<00:02:51.790> are<00:02:51.970> dark<00:02:52.180> brown<00:02:52.450> gas<00:02:53.519> so<00:02:54.519> you

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
done which are dark brown gas so you

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.759 
done which are dark brown gas so you
have<00:02:55.000> this<00:02:55.120> liquid<00:02:55.390> with<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.959> dark<00:02:56.200> brown<00:02:56.440> gas

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
have this liquid with the dark brown gas

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.009 
have this liquid with the dark brown gas
above<00:02:57.159> it<00:02:57.340> you<00:02:58.120> can<00:02:58.269> see<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.510> orange<00:02:58.750> liquid

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
above it you can see the orange liquid

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.280 
above it you can see the orange liquid
with<00:02:59.830> the<00:02:59.860> vapor<00:03:00.159> above<00:03:00.940> now<00:03:01.930> it's<00:03:02.080> very

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
with the vapor above now it's very

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.380 
with the vapor above now it's very
volatile<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.860> boils<00:03:03.130> at<00:03:03.190> 21<00:03:03.640> degrees<00:03:03.910> C<00:03:04.150> so<00:03:04.180> we

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
volatile it boils at 21 degrees C so we

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.360 
volatile it boils at 21 degrees C so we
have<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.630> keep<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:04.900> cold<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.770> we<00:03:05.860> put<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:06.130> into

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
have to keep it cold and we put it into

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.650 
have to keep it cold and we put it into
the<00:03:06.460> reaction<00:03:06.790> chamber

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
the reaction chamber

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.720 
the reaction chamber
and<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:08.260> point<00:03:08.500> about<00:03:08.800> it<00:03:08.860> is<00:03:09.160> that<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:09.580> has

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
and the point about it is that it has

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.940 
and the point about it is that it has
very<00:03:09.850> weak<00:03:10.330> bones<00:03:10.600> which<00:03:11.440> makes<00:03:11.740> it<00:03:11.920> very

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
very weak bones which makes it very

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.750 
very weak bones which makes it very
reactive<00:03:13.230> because<00:03:14.230> when<00:03:14.590> it<00:03:14.770> reacts<00:03:15.100> it

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
reactive because when it reacts it

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.310 
reactive because when it reacts it
produces<00:03:16.390> n2<00:03:16.960> nitrogen<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:18.390> n2<00:03:19.390> has<00:03:19.990> the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
produces n2 nitrogen and n2 has the

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.590 
produces n2 nitrogen and n2 has the
strongest<00:03:20.890> bond<00:03:21.220> between<00:03:21.730> any<00:03:22.150> two<00:03:22.420> atoms

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
strongest bond between any two atoms

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.370 
strongest bond between any two atoms
that<00:03:23.050> exists<00:03:23.680> so<00:03:24.310> when<00:03:24.520> n2o4<00:03:25.330> reacts<00:03:26.080> it

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
that exists so when n2o4 reacts it

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.070 
that exists so when n2o4 reacts it
releases<00:03:26.950> a<00:03:27.160> huge<00:03:27.580> amount<00:03:28.000> of<00:03:28.120> heat<00:03:28.360> so<00:03:28.960> the

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
releases a huge amount of heat so the

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.990 
releases a huge amount of heat so the
source<00:03:29.290> of<00:03:29.440> fuel<00:03:29.680> is<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:30.490> asymmetric

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
source of fuel is the asymmetric

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.810 
source of fuel is the asymmetric
dimethyl<00:03:31.840> hydrazine<00:03:35.520> and<00:03:37.620> so<00:03:38.620> what<00:03:39.460> Rae

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
dimethyl hydrazine and so what Rae

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.780 
dimethyl hydrazine and so what Rae
Thompson<00:03:40.350> discovered<00:03:41.350> I<00:03:41.590> think<00:03:42.160> almost<00:03:42.340> by

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
Thompson discovered I think almost by

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.780 
Thompson discovered I think almost by

talk<00:05:30.000> about<00:05:30.300> into<00:05:30.659> a<00:05:30.690> fall<00:05:31.050> because<00:05:31.590> I<00:05:31.710> think

talk about into a fall because I think

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.830 
talk about into a fall because I think
of<00:05:32.069> the<00:05:32.190> connection<00:05:32.729> between<00:05:32.940> my<00:05:33.300> colleagues

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
of the connection between my colleagues

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.230 
of the connection between my colleagues
here<00:05:34.080> in<00:05:34.199> Nottingham<00:05:34.409> and<00:05:34.949> the<00:05:35.669> astronauts

here in Nottingham and the astronauts

coming safely back from the moon though

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.969 
coming safely back from the moon though
I'm<00:05:39.509> not<00:05:39.659> sure<00:05:39.719> when<00:05:40.199> they<00:05:40.349> were<00:05:40.409> sitting<00:05:40.830> in

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
I'm not sure when they were sitting in

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:42.830 
I'm not sure when they were sitting in
the<00:05:41.069> lunar<00:05:41.400> module<00:05:41.520> that<00:05:42.330> they<00:05:42.509> knew<00:05:42.659> the

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
the lunar module that they knew the

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.800 
the lunar module that they knew the
chemistry<00:05:43.409> had<00:05:43.860> originated<00:05:44.729> in<00:05:45.060> an<00:05:45.360> explosion

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
chemistry had originated in an explosion
