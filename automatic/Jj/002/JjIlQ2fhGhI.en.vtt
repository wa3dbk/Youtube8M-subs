terms<00:01:25.619> here<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.189> Matt<00:01:26.460> Smith<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.880> think<00:01:26.909> his

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
terms here is it Matt Smith I think his

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.539

scores<00:01:28.170> for<00:01:28.350> Oldham<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.070> game<00:01:29.250> went<00:01:29.460> to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.749 
penalties I thought this would be a
complete<00:01:30.960> formality<00:01:31.560> free<00:01:31.860> or<00:01:31.950> four<00:01:32.159> nil<00:01:32.400> it
