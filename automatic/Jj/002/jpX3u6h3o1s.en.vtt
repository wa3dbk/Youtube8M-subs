00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:08.010
 and now let's talk about neurosurgery 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:11.300
 of the cerebral aneurysm to eliminate it 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:16.710
 there are very refined interventions 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:18.630
 very delicate we see aneurysm 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.430
 cerebral a term that is scary because 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.100
 associated with the idea of ​​sudden 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.410
 potentially lethal bleeding yet 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.269
 only in rare cases who has an aneurysm goes 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.859
 meet this risk in case 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.140
 emergency call to a center 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.239
 specialized or increase the possibilities 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.190
 of survival but what are the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.530
 aneurysms and are malformations 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.870
 vascular in practice the aneurysm is one 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.430
 kind of bag that forms long 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.559
 the wall of an artery leading to the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.809
 blood to the brain is formed because 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.789
 congenitally there is a more fragile point 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.289
 of that artery then the pressure of the 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.850
 blood as often as ours 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.160
 our heart beats determining a 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.230
 pressure wave flattens this wall 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.750
 like a balloon in which we 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.430
 we are of course the formation of 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.379
 this bag the stretching of the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.210
 wall determine a weakening 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.010
 of the wall itself so that is a 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.979
 point of least resistance he can 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.270
 break due to a sudden change in pressure 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.130
 this malformation of the blood vessels 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.020
 covers 5 percent of the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.659
 population but only in 10 cases up 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.580
 100,000 already an aneurysm rupture e 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.110
 a cerebral hemorrhage 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.970
 rupture of the aneurysm comes 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.590
 especially in an age that is between i 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.840
 35 and 60 years 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.360
 this classically as I said before 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.840
 the use of drugs such as ecstasy and la 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.270
 cocaine 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.280
 increases the risk of breakage for this 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.900
 we have been seeing breaks for some years 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.950
 aneurysms even in younger people 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.480
 just for using exciting drugs 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.850
 in case of breakage half of the patients 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.130
 they are saved in two cases out of three without 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.530
 permanent damage is still crucial 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.450
 act as soon as possible when there are 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.580
 the warning signs the headache 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.370
 sudden very severe and very strong 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.380
 this is usually acute after exertion 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.720
 clinical diagnosis this diagnosis must 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.060
 be confirmed by a tac e study 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.010
 angiography the bacchi allows to see 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.290
 if there was a hemorrhage and those were slow 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.180
 from the hemorrhage the angiotac can also 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.580
 allow us to see the aneurysm but the 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.180
 let's say clear certain diagnosis is made 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.650
 usually with a hagiographic study 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.690
 the only treatment to eliminate a 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.220
 aneurysm rupture and surgical risk 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.370
 with two modes 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.540
 in the first one is accessed directly 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.610
 the intervention consists precisely in the 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.100
 open the skull obviously 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.690
 follow certain anatomic pathways that 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.950
 allow us to reach even to 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.140
 depth of the brain without 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.700
 damage brain structures 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.709
 once we reach the aneurysm we do it 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.400
 we want from the arteries that surround it 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.230
 and we close it with a small clip in 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.880
 in this case we use these small clips 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.070
 to block the blood flow that 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.519
 ends up in the neo ream that comes later 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.680
 open they deserve the rockets are serene 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.540
 whites was well x there is the new renault 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.400
 instead it is black so it no longer has blood 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.510
 inside 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.910
 let's say the surgery is over and it is 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.440
 succeeded when possible yes 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.510
 however it intervenes in a less invasive way 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.820
 through its honda inserted in art 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.950
 and a femoral endovascular pathway 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.530
 passing television artery makes itself one 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.660
 small puncture a local anesthesia 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.250
 small incision in the silicate groin 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.810
 uses an artery we introduce a 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.670
 catheter which is carried up 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.470
 to the new stack and then through this 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.810
 catheter get rid of the spirals that 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.760
 practically certain that if you put a 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.319
 step into the aneurysm then have it in the 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.719
 blood no longer makes us the norm is not 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.549
 it can break if the surgery takes place 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:29.379
 before bleeding or when this is 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.930
 limited the patient can recover 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.219
 quickly and if we operate from a present 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.370
 which is fine as conditions 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:37.900
 neurological immediate recovery if you 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.819
 does a treatment for school-girl revenge 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.680
 after three days he goes home there is a 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.719
 endocranial treatment there is a 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.030
 real intervention people later 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:47.510
 two days he gets up after 45 days of 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.820
 vacation is fine 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.820
