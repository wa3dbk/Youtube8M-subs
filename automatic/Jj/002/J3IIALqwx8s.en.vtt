00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
how did it get rusty was it left outside

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.940 
how did it get rusty was it left outside
did<00:00:42.270> somebody<00:00:42.510> spit<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.290> did<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.649> go<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
did somebody spit on it did it go in the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.910 
did somebody spit on it did it go in the
washing<00:00:44.370> machine<00:00:44.420> didn't<00:00:45.420> rain<00:00:45.690> inside<00:00:46.559> I

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
washing machine didn't rain inside I

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.380 
washing machine didn't rain inside I
used<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.309> think<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.789> was<00:00:47.850> gonna<00:00:48.090> rain

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
used to think that I was gonna rain

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.630 
used to think that I was gonna rain
inside<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:49.170> thought<00:00:49.649> if<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:49.980> rained<00:00:50.190> outside

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
inside I thought if it rained outside

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.430 
inside I thought if it rained outside
because<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.090> water<00:00:51.300> evaporates<00:00:51.539> into<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
because the water evaporates into the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.000 
because the water evaporates into the
air<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.980> makes<00:00:53.550> clouds<00:00:54.140> then<00:00:55.140> surely<00:00:55.620> if<00:00:55.800> you

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
air and makes clouds then surely if you

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.139 
air and makes clouds then surely if you
have<00:00:56.309> enough<00:00:56.610> water<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.690> your<00:00:57.930> house

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
have enough water in your house

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.760 
have enough water in your house
evaporating<00:01:00.149> then<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.079> would<00:01:01.230> make<00:01:01.260> clouds

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
evaporating then it would make clouds

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.640 
evaporating then it would make clouds
and<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.520> rain<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.480> waited<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.470> waited

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
and in the rain so I waited and waited

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.090 
and in the rain so I waited and waited
and<00:01:05.240> waited<00:01:06.240> but<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:07.200> never<00:01:07.409> did<00:01:07.680> rain<00:01:07.920> inside

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
and waited but it never did rain inside
