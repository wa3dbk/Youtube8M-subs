digital piano and this is sort of being

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:19.939 
digital piano and this is sort of being
marketed<00:00:17.970> as<00:00:18.210> an<00:00:18.359> entry-level<00:00:18.660> piano<00:00:19.109> but<00:00:19.919> I

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
marketed as an entry-level piano but I

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.400 
marketed as an entry-level piano but I
must<00:00:20.220> say<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.640> build<00:00:21.419> quality<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.199> is

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
must say the build quality on this is

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.169 
must say the build quality on this is
really<00:00:22.679> quite<00:00:22.919> good<00:00:23.130> especially<00:00:23.849> for<00:00:24.029> an

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:24.179 
really quite good especially for an

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.089 
really quite good especially for an
entry-level<00:00:24.419> piano<00:00:24.929> the<00:00:25.199> action<00:00:25.589> on<00:00:25.679> it<00:00:25.829> feels

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
entry-level piano the action on it feels

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.819 
entry-level piano the action on it feels
really<00:00:26.609> really<00:00:26.730> nice<00:00:27.499> it's<00:00:28.499> wood

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:28.829 
really really nice it's wood

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.170 
really really nice it's wood
construction<00:00:29.419> and<00:00:30.800> if<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:32.009> notice<00:00:32.399> just<00:00:32.640> on

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
construction and if you notice just on

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.119 
construction and if you notice just on
on<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.780> keyboard<00:00:34.170> itself<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.710> won't<00:00:34.890> see<00:00:35.100> a

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
on the keyboard itself you won't see a

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.029 
on the keyboard itself you won't see a
lot<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.399> buttons<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.539> lot<00:00:37.109> of<00:00:37.230> distractions<00:00:37.829> but

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
lot of buttons a lot of distractions but

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:39.110 
lot of buttons a lot of distractions but
there's<00:00:38.219> actually<00:00:38.519> quite<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.730> bit<00:00:38.789> underneath

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
there's actually quite a bit underneath

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.759 
there's actually quite a bit underneath
the<00:00:39.269> hood<00:00:39.539> and<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.050> I'm<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.289> gonna<00:00:40.440> take<00:00:40.680> you

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
the hood and so I'm just gonna take you

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.130 
the hood and so I'm just gonna take you
through<00:00:40.949> some<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> sounds<00:00:41.750> if<00:00:42.750> there<00:00:43.019> are

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
through some of the sounds if there are

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.799 
through some of the sounds if there are
a<00:00:43.170> couple<00:00:43.350> ways<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.920> navigate<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.149> f20

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
a couple ways to navigate on the f20

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.009 
a couple ways to navigate on the f20
piano<00:00:46.109> and<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.649> way<00:00:46.800> would<00:00:47.100> be<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.340> access<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
piano and one way would be to access the

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:51.680 
piano and one way would be to access the
tones<00:00:49.350> by<00:00:49.800> using<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.280> keyboard<00:00:50.699> itself<00:00:51.030> to

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
tones by using the keyboard itself to

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.169 
tones by using the keyboard itself to
send<00:00:51.929> program<00:00:52.260> change<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:53.550> for<00:00:53.820> instance<00:00:54.120> I

00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:54.179 
send program change in for instance I

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.790 
send program change in for instance I
want<00:00:54.359> to<00:00:54.449> get<00:00:54.539> different<00:00:54.750> piano<00:00:55.109> sounds<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.620> get

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
want to get different piano sounds I get

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.540 
want to get different piano sounds I get
the<00:00:56.789> piano<00:00:57.089> and<00:00:57.960> then<00:00:58.109> strike<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> key<00:00:58.800> and

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the piano and then strike a key and

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.280 
the piano and then strike a key and
it'll<00:00:59.969> give<00:01:00.089> me<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:01.399> 66<00:01:02.399> different<00:01:02.579> pianos

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
it'll give me the 66 different pianos

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.509 
it'll give me the 66 different pianos
the<00:01:04.290> same<00:01:04.500> thing<00:01:04.710> with<00:01:04.829> the<00:01:04.920> electric<00:01:05.189> pianos

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the same thing with the electric pianos

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.100 
the same thing with the electric pianos
and<00:01:05.759> the<00:01:05.820> other<00:01:05.939> sounds<00:01:06.329> another<00:01:06.540> way<00:01:06.810> and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
and the other sounds another way and

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.530 
and the other sounds another way and
probably<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.460> easiest<00:01:08.490> way<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.000> do<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.420> if

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
probably the easiest way to do it is if

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.350 
probably the easiest way to do it is if
you<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.720> an<00:01:09.810> iOS<00:01:10.200> device<00:01:10.530> an<00:01:11.250> iPad<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:12.090> comes

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
you have an iOS device an iPad it comes

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.179 
you have an iOS device an iPad it comes
with<00:01:12.509> a<00:01:12.600> free<00:01:12.810> app<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.259> you<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.040> actually

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
with a free app and you can actually

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.740 
with a free app and you can actually
just<00:01:14.880> quickly<00:01:15.540> access<00:01:15.930> your<00:01:15.960> sounds<00:01:16.470> by

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
just quickly access your sounds by
