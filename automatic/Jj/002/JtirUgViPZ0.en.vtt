00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
looks real good

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:53.880 
looks real good
the<00:06:42.340> back<00:06:42.550> of<00:06:42.730> my<00:06:42.880> head<00:06:48.960> so<00:06:52.440> the<00:06:53.440> back<00:06:53.620> of<00:06:53.650> my

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:53.890 
the back of my head so the back of my

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.680 
the back of my head so the back of my
head<00:06:54.130> has<00:06:54.400> a<00:06:54.430> little<00:06:54.760> farther<00:06:55.000> to<00:06:55.240> go<00:06:55.420> than<00:06:55.660> the

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:55.690 
head has a little farther to go than the

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.970 
head has a little farther to go than the
front<00:06:56.140> because<00:06:57.870> the<00:06:58.870> breakage<00:06:59.290> was<00:06:59.560> at<00:06:59.800> its

00:06:59.970 --> 00:06:59.980 
front because the breakage was at its

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.790 
front because the breakage was at its
worst<00:07:00.250> back<00:07:00.580> there<00:07:00.880> so<00:07:01.600> I'm<00:07:02.230> just<00:07:02.470> happy<00:07:02.650> my

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
worst back there so I'm just happy my

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.070 
worst back there so I'm just happy my
edges<00:07:03.250> are<00:07:03.340> coming<00:07:03.640> back<00:07:05.100> so<00:07:06.100> and<00:07:06.510> I<00:07:07.510> think<00:07:07.840> my

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 
edges are coming back so and I think my

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.310 
edges are coming back so and I think my
edges<00:07:09.450> went<00:07:10.450> because<00:07:10.630> I<00:07:10.900> was<00:07:11.020> wearing<00:07:11.230> my

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:11.320 
edges went because I was wearing my

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.530 
edges went because I was wearing my
ponytails<00:07:11.920> too<00:07:12.130> tight<00:07:12.340> and<00:07:12.550> also<00:07:13.030> I<00:07:13.300> was

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:13.540 
ponytails too tight and also I was

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.680 
ponytails too tight and also I was
getting<00:07:13.840> extensions<00:07:14.760> so<00:07:15.760> I<00:07:15.790> think<00:07:16.090> the<00:07:16.450> braids

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:16.690 
getting extensions so I think the braids

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.180 
getting extensions so I think the braids
might<00:07:16.990> have<00:07:17.140> been<00:07:17.260> too<00:07:17.440> tight<00:07:17.680> and<00:07:17.890> that<00:07:18.010> might

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.190 
might have been too tight and that might

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.320 
might have been too tight and that might
have<00:07:18.280> breaking<00:07:18.700> it<00:07:18.790> off<00:07:18.940> or<00:07:19.360> I<00:07:19.720> don't<00:07:20.500> know<00:07:20.710> but

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.330 
have breaking it off or I don't know but

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.050 
have breaking it off or I don't know but
those<00:07:22.330> are<00:07:22.510> my<00:07:22.600> results<00:07:22.780> and<00:07:23.610> if<00:07:24.610> you<00:07:24.790> want<00:07:24.970> to
