00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
another plier to pry open the link from

another plier to pry open the link from
the<00:00:48.090> other<00:00:48.300> side<00:00:48.739> these<00:00:49.739> chains<00:00:50.070> are<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> little

the other side these chains are a little

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.939 
the other side these chains are a little
bit<00:00:50.700> hard<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.510> you'll<00:00:51.899> need<00:00:52.170> some<00:00:52.410> strength<00:00:52.770> to

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
bit hard so you'll need some strength to

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.029 
bit hard so you'll need some strength to
pull<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.280> apart<00:00:53.370> if<00:00:54.230> you're<00:00:55.230> strong<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.829> can

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
pull it apart if you're strong you can

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.130 
pull it apart if you're strong you can
actually<00:00:56.250> pry<00:00:56.699> open<00:00:57.059> these<00:00:57.210> links<00:00:57.570> by<00:00:57.750> hand

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
actually pry open these links by hand

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.090 
actually pry open these links by hand
but<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.280> prefer<00:00:59.670> not<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.879> do<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.980> once<00:01:01.980> you

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
but I prefer not to do that once you

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.979 
but I prefer not to do that once you
open<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.520> link<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:03.030> can<00:01:03.239> slip<00:01:03.539> off<00:01:03.690> your

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
open the link you can slip off your

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.380 
open the link you can slip off your
chain<00:01:07.369> now<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.430> finish<00:01:08.760> off<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.150> bracelet

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
you'll just have to close it off I'm

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.310 
you'll just have to close it off I'm
using<00:01:11.640> one<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:11.970> these<00:01:12.180> snap<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.780> clip

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
using one of these snap and clip

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.560 
using one of these snap and clip
enclosures<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.729> don't<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.360> use

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
enclosures and you don't have to use

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.330 
enclosures and you don't have to use
this<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:16.080> also<00:01:16.439> use<00:01:16.619> something<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.189> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
this you can also use something like a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.149 
this you can also use something like a
leather<00:01:17.640> cord<00:01:18.090> or<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.840> suede<00:01:19.409> cord<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.860> tie<00:01:19.890> it

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
leather cord or a suede cord to tie it

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.490 
leather cord or a suede cord to tie it
together<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.850> just<00:01:21.240> prefer<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.049> knife<00:01:22.290> and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
together I just prefer this knife and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.840 
together I just prefer this knife and
piece<00:01:22.680> because<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.310> little<00:01:23.549> bit<00:01:23.670> easier

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
piece because it's a little bit easier

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.630 
piece because it's a little bit easier
it<00:01:24.750> gives<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.200> more<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.619> seamless<00:01:25.890> look<00:01:26.340> and

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
it gives it more of a seamless look and

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.940 
it gives it more of a seamless look and
on<00:01:27.570> top<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.320> gives<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.650> more<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.860> a

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
on top of that it gives it more of a

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.370 
on top of that it gives it more of a
snug<00:01:29.340> fit<00:01:29.369> which<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.570> because<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.049> makes<00:01:31.259> a

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
snug fit which I like because it makes a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.319 
snug fit which I like because it makes a
bracelet<00:01:31.770> look<00:01:31.950> more<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.460> cup<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:36.030> put<00:01:36.210> on

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
bracelet look more like a cup to put on

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.940 
bracelet look more like a cup to put on
