00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.329
 Gerd Olbrich front age and the forgotten books 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.490
 I know that he sank many of you Pure Body Cult or that 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.029
 is a nice even a source to it 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:12.150
 this came 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.820
 It is really very beautiful it looks here I do not know yet if he has to 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.320
 looking at a camera it really looks like we can see that 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.110
 Become gold 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.690
 there are rations Zwettl is just my life nothing Â»in Dubai 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.690
 I do not know if we can see it 1 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:34.210
 so it's really very nice it is a great color 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.220
 March is like a little treasure 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.519
 and also the content is very successful 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.160
 Arthur is five years old for the first time together with his father 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:48.630
 Spagat departments are concerned 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.290
 He spends almost all his spare time in this from this moment 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.350
 vintage 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.450
 and Sandy is reading and reading the books and feeling there 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.290
 incredibly well and I found in comparison easy expensive says Heitz 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.940
 said other children have just been Hannes seen they have grown 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.040
 a yardstick he has just seen it at home as he von Becker as 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.770
 withheld or falling 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.800
 Frankenberg's just got bigger and bigger the textbooks 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.970
 In addition to the children's books were Wichern whom he grabbed the phone 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:22.930
 could 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.980
 Percent from the age of twelve Artur may have the books 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.880
 In his shop behind r, pocket money inventor gets us in 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.910
 Given this time on the spot in the store, he stressed the thoughtful Bonn 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.210
 Bookworm still has a granddaughter 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.340
 Percent of his children died themselves 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.510
 um and this granddaughter has the TZ with them and they were food loners 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.400
 she is not least dependent on books 7 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.400
 it's more about technology and has a few more 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.220
 other interesting but nothing 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.620
 This could also go on so well after Otto's taste until 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.809
 One day a mysterious stranger shows up in the shop and 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:14.259
 old and white immediately for this man is danger from he settles sinking 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:17.589
 I'm pretty much alone 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:22.299
 yes, and before Archer and Larissa actually know they are already sitting in the 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.489
 Train to Amsterdam in search of the forgotten books a brother us 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.159
 to say exactly after the answers and who holds this book in his hands 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.890
 he has big ones 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.129
 8 says so I know this is a criticism that many have said 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.870
 No, you would have a 14-year-old brother the two are now hanging 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.069
 you would send all of them to Amsterdam to deal with these dangerous ones 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.699
 Search to go 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:54.479
 On the one hand I could not fully understand why the old one was 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:57.739
 the two of them are always on the other side, that's the way it is 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:03.979
 The Fiepen Kits already expected a very friendly couple in Amsterdam Bern 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:09.369
 and they live there too and i can say that very positively this couple 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:12.849
 It is not the traditional couple but it is a gay couple 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:18.599
 the Jahn that is the one part of this team is one 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:19.899
 around 

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:25.119
 Orcel and caring man get so the women's role Herne act no cake 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:29.779
 Lorant Bach cake and really sucks around the kids the other part 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:31.889
 is also an antiquarian 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:36.619
 and the kids also need that help and Fine that too good that they are in it 

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:40.950
 So they really are never really or one to have a stop-off 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.969
 regrow on Dr at least 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:47.129
 Pay attention to the children in the background 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.029
 Artur is certainly a very sympathetic young boy he has too 

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:56.369
 special skills Illmensee the tarnished Amsterdam yet another 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.210
 Mysterious boy met 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:05.379
 which did not particularly fascinate one out of ten percent 1 that were 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.239
 simply the beginnings of the author around 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.829
 There are scenes example but I do not want to anticipate there are just 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.459
 one hardly goes down in the annals and 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.879
 NT yes what written there while I found it very interesting it is 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:23.849
 Whatever the case, Thiemo's opponents try to hold the book in their hands 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:27.680
 always know exactly where the kids are 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.960
 and why is that? 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.780
 These are simply because I'm just a really big class 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.900
 obvious but hard not come on it 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.490
 to handle handy really well and north report it goes from Amsterdam 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.849
 still to Polonia 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.430
 yes, and it's always like having value as if 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.930
 in addition to Amsterdam Rome strolls through the canals it is as 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.310
 if you put both years in the kitchen and it smells like cocoa beans 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.840
 after Franco Pohlmann for years is almost done to myself off so it is then 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.719
 stop in Italy too 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:10.069
 he has done very well that the evil are very angry and 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:11.779
 the 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:14.129
 So not too long torches 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:16.639
 they are really in Durban 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.330
 but tangible percentages do not stop them, especially nastiness 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.190
 back to the kids I thought that was pretty good as well so it is 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:27.129
 not so cheap 10 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.259
 Yes 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.740
 a book of what McLaren world champion must be persons 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:36.439
 all characters lovingly and expensive worked out 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:41.199
 A bug tested Lust auf mehr I will be guaranteed even the second 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.009
 and third book read on media channels 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:48.379
 yes, or this book of the series just as well liked the fame I had 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:52.399
 very good as a little girl would have or maybe a son 

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:56.750
 ten twelve is when I gave the west guaranteed but also had more 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:58.300
 This post was fun 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.100
 I hope I was able to arouse a little bit of curiosity 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:07.660
 this book on the book of answers to tivi the driver who stop trying 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:11.510
 To appreciate these books for protection and to seek ancient ones, try them too 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:13.900
 conceal 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.560
 i can really recommend it to you it's a great book i also got it in 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.830
 I went to a pub and read a wife late at noon 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.160
 Evening two stars 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.800
 but that was also because I captured my little job miracle 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.080
 and had just prescribed my day to me, I was also very grateful 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.230
 so i could really enjoy the no yes i wish you that the 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.270
 Roads pace around 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.559
 others have also licensed this book 

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:45.429
 because of poets back now I can start what it costs about Messi's asterisk 

00:06:45.429 --> 00:06:47.719
 was 

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:52.460
 Tan Beckermann I believe so Peace who you all this world are like that 

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:56.770
 Of course, as usual for the info box Wish you had a lot of fun 

00:06:56.769 --> 00:07:00.710
 and maybe you'll have a look at the book a2 and the forgotten books 

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:01.259
 more exactly
