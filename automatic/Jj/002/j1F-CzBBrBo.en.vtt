we're trying to do with this project is
make<00:00:34.550> up<00:00:34.730> for<00:00:35.030> that<00:00:35.410> deficit<00:00:36.410> that<00:00:36.530> it's

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
make up for that deficit that it's

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.790 
make up for that deficit that it's
developed<00:00:37.640> over<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:38.030> last<00:00:38.290> 20<00:00:39.290> to<00:00:39.440> 30<00:00:39.470> years

we were a major today holders and
obviously<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.160> funding<00:00:46.610> of<00:00:46.699> the<00:00:46.820> project<00:00:47.140> and

government to find a solution for me

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.029 
government to find a solution for me
around<00:00:54.850> take<00:00:55.850> a<00:00:55.879> break<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:56.270> football<00:00:56.660> stadium

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
around take a break the football stadium

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.560 
around take a break the football stadium
multiply<00:00:58.039> that<00:00:58.309> about<00:00:58.550> five<00:00:58.850> to<00:00:59.120> ten<00:00:59.329> times

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
multiply that about five to ten times

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.750 
multiply that about five to ten times
fill<00:01:00.559> it<00:01:00.649> up<00:01:00.739> with<00:01:00.949> sand<00:01:01.250> right<00:01:01.460> to<00:01:01.640> the

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
fill it up with sand right to the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.910 
fill it up with sand right to the
brandman<00:01:02.210> that's<00:01:02.629> what<00:01:02.809> we<00:01:02.930> kind<00:01:03.140> of<00:01:03.230> say<00:01:03.410> if<00:01:03.769> I

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
brandman that's what we kind of say if I

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.730 
brandman that's what we kind of say if I
can<00:01:04.220> talk<00:01:04.399> about<00:01:04.580> we<00:01:05.509> confirm<00:01:06.020> that<00:01:06.050> the

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
can talk about we confirm that the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.800 
can talk about we confirm that the
quality<00:01:07.220> of<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.399> material<00:01:07.940> is<00:01:08.149> pretty

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
quality of the material is pretty

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.200 
quality of the material is pretty
similar<00:01:09.170> to<00:01:09.320> what<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:10.130> natural<00:01:10.340> beaches<00:01:10.759> life

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
similar to what the natural beaches life

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.230 
similar to what the natural beaches life
then<00:01:11.960> we<00:01:12.170> arranged<00:01:12.619> for<00:01:12.679> a<00:01:12.860> dredge<00:01:13.220> to<00:01:13.759> come<00:01:14.000> in

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
then we arranged for a dredge to come in

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.990 
then we arranged for a dredge to come in
set<00:01:14.929> up<00:01:14.960> over<00:01:15.410> that<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:16.009> with<00:01:16.520> an<00:01:16.640> underwater

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
set up over that and with an underwater

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.969 
set up over that and with an underwater
pipeline<00:01:17.420> brought<00:01:18.289> all<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.619> way<00:01:18.710> to<00:01:18.770> the

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
pipeline brought all the way to the

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.700 
pipeline brought all the way to the
beach<00:01:19.190> and<00:01:19.789> start<00:01:20.240> pumping<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:20.840> sand<00:01:21.140> from

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
beach and start pumping the sand from

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.490

the<00:01:21.830> ocean<00:01:22.190> bottom<00:01:22.369> onto<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.300> beach<00:01:23.509> and<00:01:23.840> then

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
the ocean bottom onto the beach and then

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.710 
the ocean bottom onto the beach and then
spreading<00:01:24.979> their<00:01:25.310> bed<00:01:25.849> sand

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
spreading their bed sand

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.570 
spreading their bed sand
it's<00:01:27.990> almost<00:01:28.380> impossible<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:29.250> prevent

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
it's almost impossible to prevent

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.780 
it's almost impossible to prevent
vegetation<00:01:30.420> from<00:01:30.740> eventually<00:01:31.740> building<00:01:32.640> a

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790

 dry<00:01:33.780> sand<00:01:34.110> area<00:01:34.440> we'll<00:01:35.130> also<00:01:35.280> be

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
 dry sand area we'll also be

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.980 
 dry sand area we'll also be
putting<00:01:35.880> some<00:01:36.270> sand<00:01:36.540> fencing

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
putting some sand fencing

last year or astounded how much feature
is<00:01:50.049> now<00:01:50.380> that's<00:01:51.009> a<00:01:51.159> classic

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.500 

Kabam<00:01:54.680> ever<00:01:55.040> worked<00:01:55.730> like<00:01:55.910> mind-boggling

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
Kabam ever worked like mind-boggling

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.840 
Kabam ever worked like mind-boggling
amazed

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850

so<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.570> guests<00:01:58.930> experience<00:01:59.290> is<00:01:59.770> going<00:01:59.920> to<00:02:00.010> be

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
so the guests experience is going to be

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.190 
so the guests experience is going to be
greatly<00:02:00.370> enhanced<00:02:00.640> because<00:02:01.240> of<00:02:01.420> this<00:02:01.630> project

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
greatly enhanced because of this project

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.469 
greatly enhanced because of this project
the<00:02:03.159> Gulf<00:02:03.370> of<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.610> 18th<00:02:03.940> although<00:02:04.330> this
