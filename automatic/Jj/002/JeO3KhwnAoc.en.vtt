00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.300 
the templates it'll be an oreo file and
mainly<00:01:45.659> I'd<00:01:45.810> say<00:01:45.990> 99%<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.740> our<00:01:46.829> templates<00:01:47.189> will

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
mainly I'd say 99% of our templates will

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.029 
mainly I'd say 99% of our templates will
be<00:01:47.399> unzip<00:01:47.700> files<00:01:48.049> and<00:01:49.049> with<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.259> zip<00:01:49.530> file<00:01:49.770> you

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
be unzip files and with a zip file you

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.940 
be unzip files and with a zip file you
have<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.520> unzip<00:01:50.789> or<00:01:51.240> extract<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.200> files<00:01:52.469> and

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
have to unzip or extract the files and

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.679 
have to unzip or extract the files and
this<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.460> easily<00:01:53.729> done<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.270> you've<00:01:54.390> come<00:01:54.600> to

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
this is easily done so you've come to

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.539 
this is easily done so you've come to
this<00:01:54.780> step<00:01:55.049> basically<00:01:55.979> I'm<00:01:56.039> going<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.219> drag<00:01:56.369> up

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
this step basically I'm going to drag up

see<00:03:56.239> type<00:03:56.750> is<00:03:57.049> XML<00:03:57.500> document<00:03:58.129> and<00:03:58.220> you<00:03:58.280> can

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
see type is XML document and you can

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.159 
see type is XML document and you can
tell<00:03:58.639> by<00:03:58.819> that<00:03:58.849> little<00:03:59.060> left<00:03:59.389> thumbnail<00:03:59.930> there

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
tell by that little left thumbnail there

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.259 
tell by that little left thumbnail there
that's<00:04:00.590> an<00:04:00.709> XML<00:04:01.190> so<00:04:01.729> you<00:04:01.790> can<00:04:01.879> see<00:04:01.970> these<00:04:02.120> are

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
thumbnail that tells us this is the XML

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.929 
thumbnail that tells us this is the XML
document<00:04:08.959> and<00:04:09.409> over<00:04:10.099> here<00:04:10.310> at<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.489> side<00:04:10.669> we

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:10.939 
document and over here at the side we

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.089 
document and over here at the side we
see<00:04:11.090> XML<00:04:11.720> document<00:04:12.109> making<00:04:12.709> it<00:04:12.859> even<00:04:12.949> easier

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
see XML document making it even easier

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.429 
see XML document making it even easier
ok<00:04:13.699> so<00:04:13.760> what<00:04:14.510> we<00:04:14.569> want<00:04:14.689> to<00:04:14.720> do<00:04:14.840> is<00:04:14.959> double<00:04:15.259> click

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 
ok so what we want to do is double click

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.699 
ok so what we want to do is double click
on<00:04:15.560> our<00:04:15.680> XML<00:04:16.130> document<00:04:16.489> a<00:04:17.199> face<00:04:18.199> that's<00:04:18.470> gone

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
on our XML document a face that's gone

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.050 
on our XML document a face that's gone
in<00:04:18.859> there<00:04:19.039> now<00:04:19.250> and<00:04:19.489> simply<00:04:20.239> click<00:04:20.419> upload

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
like that now and one of the differences

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.820 
like that now and one of the differences
I<00:04:48.389> found<00:04:48.660> here<00:04:48.840> is<00:04:48.930> before<00:04:49.320> when<00:04:49.500> you<00:04:49.590> did

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
upload a template it would give you the

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.610 
upload a template it would give you the
option<00:04:51.330> to<00:04:51.360> keep<00:04:51.630> or<00:04:51.870> delete<00:04:52.230> some<00:04:52.470> of<00:04:52.500> the
