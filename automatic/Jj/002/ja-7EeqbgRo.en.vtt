tight<00:01:01.559> corners<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.030> have

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
tight corners this is the one to have

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.170 
tight corners this is the one to have
here's<00:01:04.589> another<00:01:04.860> one<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.939> which

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
here's another one that I have it which

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.870 
here's another one that I have it which
is<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.510> think<00:01:06.540> about<00:01:07.310> five<00:01:08.310> hundred<00:01:08.549> six

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
is I think about five hundred six

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.160 
is I think about five hundred six
hundred<00:01:08.909> dollars<00:01:09.360> -<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.750> sixty

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
hundred dollars - it's a sixty

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.080 
hundred dollars - it's a sixty
millimeter<00:01:10.350> prime<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.520> if<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.760> want<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.000> go

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
millimeter prime so if you want to go

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.300 
millimeter prime so if you want to go
out<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.390> take<00:01:12.570> some<00:01:12.600> pictures<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.680> portraits

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
out and take some pictures of portraits

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.770 
out and take some pictures of portraits
it's<00:01:14.700> going<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.909> throw<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> background<00:01:15.630> out

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
it's going to throw the background out

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.310 
it's going to throw the background out
of<00:01:15.810> focus

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
of focus

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.010 
of focus
this<00:01:16.560> also<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> 2.8<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:18.180> gets<00:01:18.450> down<00:01:18.659> pretty

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
this also is a 2.8 it gets down pretty

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.490 
this also is a 2.8 it gets down pretty
low<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.770> it'll<00:01:20.280> allow<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:21.470> you<00:01:22.470> know

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
low and it'll allow you to you know

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.260 
low and it'll allow you to you know
throw<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.950> background<00:01:23.310> out<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.460> focus<00:01:23.580> get

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
throw the background out of focus get

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.480 
throw the background out of focus get
some<00:01:24.450> low<00:01:24.600> light<00:01:24.810> shots

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
some low light shots

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.819 
some low light shots
generally<00:01:26.490> speaking<00:01:26.640> it'll<00:01:27.030> be<00:01:27.119> good<00:01:27.360> for<00:01:27.829> you

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
wide-angle lens can do so if you

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.370 
wide-angle lens can do so if you
position<00:03:47.580> people<00:03:47.790> or<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.270> move<00:03:48.480> around<00:03:48.630> so

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
position people or you move around so

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.290 
position people or you move around so
somebody's<00:03:49.860> closer<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.580> somebody's<00:03:50.940> farther

somebody's closer and somebody's farther

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.910 
somebody's closer and somebody's farther
in<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.510> distance<00:03:51.900> it<00:03:52.050> really<00:03:52.410> gives<00:03:52.620> more<00:03:52.860> of

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
in the distance it really gives more of

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.100 
in the distance it really gives more of
a<00:03:53.040> three-dimensional<00:03:53.790> effect<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.360> really

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
a three-dimensional effect and really

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.370 
a three-dimensional effect and really

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
your wide-angle lens to get that depth

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.410 
your wide-angle lens to get that depth
to<00:04:07.770> get<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.130> 3d<00:04:08.580> image<00:04:08.880> instead<00:04:09.209> of<00:04:09.300> just

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
to get that 3d image instead of just

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.510 
to get that 3d image instead of just
taking<00:04:09.690> flat<00:04:10.050> things<00:04:10.350> move<00:04:10.680> around<00:04:10.860> get<00:04:11.310> so

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
taking flat things move around get so

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.490 
taking flat things move around get so
have<00:04:11.670> somebody<00:04:12.000> move<00:04:12.180> closer<00:04:12.540> or<00:04:13.230> put
