00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
really silly and fat and so what I did

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.720 
really silly and fat and so what I did
is<00:04:01.360> I<00:04:01.480> went<00:04:01.600> to<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:01.840> 67<00:04:02.590> deck<00:04:02.769> lid<00:04:03.010> which<00:04:03.519> has<00:04:03.700> a

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
is I went to the 67 deck lid which has a

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.460 
is I went to the 67 deck lid which has a
similar<00:04:04.209> shape<00:04:04.570> with<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:04.989> squared<00:04:05.290> off

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
similar shape with the squared off

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.900 
similar shape with the squared off
bottom<00:04:05.920> as<00:04:06.070> the<00:04:06.730> earth<00:04:06.910> as<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.420> later<00:04:07.600> ones

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
bottom as the earth as the later ones

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.729 
bottom as the earth as the later ones
but<00:04:09.910> then<00:04:10.269> I<00:04:10.299> lowered<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.780> bumper<00:04:11.230> to<00:04:11.470> clear

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
but then I lowered the bumper to clear

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.250 
but then I lowered the bumper to clear
it<00:04:11.890> and<00:04:12.010> so<00:04:12.670> that<00:04:12.850> it<00:04:12.970> looks<00:04:13.239> so<00:04:13.720> it<00:04:13.870> still<00:04:14.080> has

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
it and so that it looks so it still has

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.979 
it and so that it looks so it still has
the<00:04:14.410> nice<00:04:14.590> long<00:04:14.890> line<00:04:15.510> that<00:04:16.510> the<00:04:16.630> beetle<00:04:16.900> was

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
the nice long line that the beetle was

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.400 
the nice long line that the beetle was
intended<00:04:17.470> to<00:04:17.500> have<00:04:17.739> Wow<00:04:18.640> not<00:04:19.599> looking<00:04:20.080> wrong

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
intended to have Wow not looking wrong

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.640 
intended to have Wow not looking wrong
or<00:04:20.770> back<00:04:21.070> Dave

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
or back Dave

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.340 
or back Dave

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
and then the 68 lights are also a

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.310 
and then the 68 lights are also a
similar<00:04:24.830> thing<00:04:25.449> because<00:04:26.449> the<00:04:26.540> 73<00:04:27.139> had

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320
