it is absolutely awesome

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.939 
it is absolutely awesome
the<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> 2<00:00:20.070> that's<00:00:20.880> used<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.949> really

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
the a 2 that's used on this is really

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.890 
the a 2 that's used on this is really
superior<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.789> lot<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.300> different<00:00:24.600> carbon

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
superior to a lot of different carbon

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.630 
superior to a lot of different carbon
steels<00:00:25.109> out<00:00:25.350> there<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.590> mean<00:00:25.890> there's<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.460> lot<00:00:26.550> of

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
steels out there I mean there's a lot of

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.689 
steels out there I mean there's a lot of
preference<00:00:27.029> involved<00:00:27.480> between<00:00:28.289> D<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.250> 2<00:00:29.369> and

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
preference involved between D to a 2 and

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.450 
preference involved between D to a 2 and
O<00:00:30.090> 1<00:00:30.359> ok<00:00:30.929> those<00:00:31.140> are<00:00:31.260> three<00:00:31.619> probably<00:00:32.099> be<00:00:32.189> most

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
O 1 ok those are three probably be most

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.750 
O 1 ok those are three probably be most
used<00:00:33.079> well<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.350> shouldn't<00:00:35.010> say<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.340> because<00:00:35.550> I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
used well I shouldn't say that because I

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.819 
used well I shouldn't say that because I
can't<00:00:35.969> leave<00:00:36.090> out<00:00:36.210> 1095<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.260> then<00:00:37.680> maybe

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
can't leave out 1095 and then maybe

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.950 
can't leave out 1095 and then maybe
10:55<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.610> stuff<00:00:38.760> like<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.059> but<00:00:39.239> let's<00:00:39.780> just

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
10:55 and stuff like that but let's just

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.630 
10:55 and stuff like that but let's just
say<00:00:40.200> D<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.420> 201<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.710> 1095<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.340> most

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
say D to a 201 and 1095 are the most

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.360 
say D to a 201 and 1095 are the most
used<00:00:45.300> carbon<00:00:45.809> Steel's<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.250> knife

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370

points of contact the bar imagine this

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.390 
points of contact the bar imagine this
being<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.350> bar<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> center<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.340> was

being the bar in the center it was

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.880 
being the bar in the center it was
raised<00:01:35.729> up<00:01:36.030> as<00:01:36.270> well<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.200> blade<00:01:37.380> hit<00:01:37.680> it

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.280 
it rolled over a little bit of metal
chipped<00:01:44.579> out<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.689> actually<00:01:45.840> me<00:01:46.049> show<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.259> a

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
chipped out and actually me show you a

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.959 
chipped out and actually me show you a
picture<00:01:46.409> before<00:01:46.829> picture<00:01:47.310> right<00:01:47.490> now

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:54.090 

so<00:01:52.450> there<00:01:52.570> you<00:01:52.600> go<00:01:52.719> there's<00:01:53.020> a<00:01:53.079> quick<00:01:53.530> shot<00:01:53.799> of

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
so there you go there's a quick shot of

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.819 
so there you go there's a quick shot of
the<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.729> damage<00:01:55.090> right<00:01:55.329> so<00:01:55.990> I<00:01:56.020> mentioned<00:01:56.679> in<00:01:56.770> a

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
the the damage right so I mentioned in a

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.050 
the the damage right so I mentioned in a
video<00:01:56.950> hey<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:57.399> know<00:01:57.520> maybe<00:01:57.640> I'll<00:01:57.819> do<00:01:57.909> a<00:01:57.939> video

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
video hey you know maybe I'll do a video

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.179 
video hey you know maybe I'll do a video
on<00:01:58.240> showing<00:01:58.780> how<00:01:58.869> to<00:01:58.899> sharpen<00:01:59.109> out<00:01:59.439> well<00:01:59.979> it's

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
on showing how to sharpen out well it's

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:01.679 
on showing how to sharpen out well it's
a<00:02:00.250> huge<00:02:00.399> pain<00:02:00.700> in<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.850> butt<00:02:01.000> reason<00:02:01.390> being<00:02:01.539> is

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
a huge pain in the butt reason being is

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.319 
a huge pain in the butt reason being is
that<00:02:01.810> this<00:02:01.899> is<00:02:02.109> completely<00:02:02.289> convex<00:02:03.280> ground<00:02:03.640> to

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
that this is completely convex ground to

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.870 
that this is completely convex ground to
a<00:02:04.359> zero<00:02:04.659> edge<00:02:04.869> so<00:02:05.649> I<00:02:05.679> can't<00:02:06.159> just<00:02:06.340> put<00:02:06.549> this<00:02:06.700> on

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
a zero edge so I can't just put this on

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.119 
a zero edge so I can't just put this on
a<00:02:07.420> sharpening<00:02:08.019> system<00:02:08.470> or<00:02:08.590> machine<00:02:08.860> that<00:02:09.039> has

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
a sharpening system or machine that has

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.970 
a sharpening system or machine that has
a<00:02:09.160> pre<00:02:09.610> angled<00:02:09.970> system<00:02:10.840> because<00:02:11.200> it's<00:02:11.799> gonna

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
a pre angled system because it's gonna

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.830 
a pre angled system because it's gonna
change<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.459> geometry<00:02:13.090> of<00:02:13.120> that<00:02:13.299> edge<00:02:13.450> I<00:02:13.660> don't

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
change the geometry of that edge I don't

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.920 
change the geometry of that edge I don't
want<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.319> make<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:15.099> know<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.940> straight<00:02:16.569> angle<00:02:16.720> I

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
want to make you know a straight angle I

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.770 
want to make you know a straight angle I
wanted<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.379> keep<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.680> convex<00:02:18.129> edge<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:18.780> very

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
wanted to keep that convex edge so very

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.369 
wanted to keep that convex edge so very
difficult<00:02:19.959> to<00:02:20.489> to<00:02:21.690> sharpen<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:22.870> out<00:02:23.049> in<00:02:23.260> this

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
difficult to to sharpen that out in this

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:24.539 
difficult to to sharpen that out in this
particular<00:02:23.560> case<00:02:24.069> when<00:02:24.250> you're<00:02:24.340> dealing<00:02:24.459> with

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
particular case when you're dealing with

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.940 
particular case when you're dealing with
convex<00:02:24.940> edges<00:02:25.329> so<00:02:26.079> what<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.260> end<00:02:26.379> up<00:02:26.470> doing<00:02:26.620> was

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
convex edges so what I end up doing was

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.350 
convex edges so what I end up doing was
taking<00:02:27.430> my<00:02:27.879> old-school<00:02:28.590> easy<00:02:29.590> lap<00:02:30.239> that<00:02:31.239> I've

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
taking my old-school easy lap that I've

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.089 
taking my old-school easy lap that I've
had<00:02:31.540> for<00:02:31.750> who<00:02:31.870> knows<00:02:31.989> how<00:02:32.049> many<00:02:32.440> years<00:02:32.500> right

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
had for who knows how many years right

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.699 
had for who knows how many years right
it's<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.340> little<00:02:33.430> pen<00:02:33.760> sized<00:02:34.060> sharpener<00:02:34.930> all

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
it's a little pen sized sharpener all

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.619 
it's a little pen sized sharpener all
right<00:02:35.860> we<00:02:36.040> have<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.220> run<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:37.000> has<00:02:37.299> a<00:02:37.329> little

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
right we have a run and has a little

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.660 
right we have a run and has a little
groove<00:02:37.780> in<00:02:37.900> here<00:02:38.140> for<00:02:38.410> fish<00:02:38.590> hooks<00:02:38.829> it<00:02:39.250> has<00:02:39.640> a

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
groove in here for fish hooks it has a

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.210 
groove in here for fish hooks it has a
flat<00:02:39.970> side<00:02:40.239> and<00:02:40.629> it<00:02:40.750> has<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.870> round<00:02:41.170> side<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:42.190> I

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
flat side and it has a round side so I

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.550 
flat side and it has a round side so I
had<00:02:42.430> taken<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.849> round<00:02:43.150> side<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:44.230> carefully

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
had taken the round side and I carefully

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.789 
had taken the round side and I carefully
by<00:02:45.310> hand<00:02:45.700> because<00:02:46.660> I<00:02:46.840> don't<00:02:47.079> have<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.590> belt

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
by hand because I don't have a belt

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.800 
by hand because I don't have a belt
grinder<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.819> if<00:02:48.910> I<00:02:49.000> did<00:02:49.180> have<00:02:49.239> a<00:02:49.329> belt<00:02:49.510> grinder

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
grinder and if I did have a belt grinder

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.539 
grinder and if I did have a belt grinder
I<00:02:49.870> put<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.379> appropriate<00:02:50.560> belt<00:02:51.010> on<00:02:51.190> there<00:02:51.400> and

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
I put the appropriate belt on there and

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:52.800 
I put the appropriate belt on there and
I<00:02:51.609> could<00:02:51.940> have<00:02:52.030> sharpened<00:02:52.269> this<00:02:52.390> out<00:02:52.569> a<00:02:52.599> few

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
I could have sharpened this out a few

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.390 
I could have sharpened this out a few
seconds<00:02:53.170> but<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.349> don't<00:02:53.530> say<00:02:53.799> I<00:02:53.829> do<00:02:53.950> it<00:02:54.040> by<00:02:54.160> hand

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
seconds but I don't say I do it by hand

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.500 
seconds but I don't say I do it by hand
and<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:55.540> literally<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.620> know<00:02:56.739> slowly<00:02:57.510> and

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
and I literally you know slowly and

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.660 
and I literally you know slowly and
sharpen<00:02:59.049> that<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.410> as<00:02:59.560> i<00:02:59.769> sharpened<00:03:00.250> out<00:03:00.489> that

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
sharpen that and as i sharpened out that

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.479 
sharpen that and as i sharpened out that
curve<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.359> know<00:03:01.959> I<00:03:01.989> made<00:03:02.530> sure<00:03:02.829> that<00:03:02.859> I<00:03:03.099> was

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
curve you know I made sure that I was

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.940 
curve you know I made sure that I was
moving<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.060> angle<00:03:04.450> of<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.380> sharpening<00:03:05.739> stone

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
moving the angle of the sharpening stone

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.430 
moving the angle of the sharpening stone
as<00:03:06.099> well<00:03:06.389> okay<00:03:07.389> because<00:03:07.660> I<00:03:07.810> had<00:03:08.049> to<00:03:08.139> keep<00:03:08.319> that

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
as well okay because I had to keep that

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.140 
as well okay because I had to keep that
constant<00:03:08.799> curvature<00:03:09.220> it's<00:03:09.579> very<00:03:09.730> hard<00:03:10.030> to

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
constant curvature it's very hard to

a<00:03:26.739> machine<00:03:26.889> you<00:03:27.700> know<00:03:27.819> set<00:03:28.389> the<00:03:28.419> angle<00:03:28.870> and

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
a machine you know set the angle and

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.390 
a machine you know set the angle and
just<00:03:29.169> go<00:03:29.410> to<00:03:29.440> town<00:03:29.739> with<00:03:29.769> some<00:03:30.069> different

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
just go to town with some different

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.250 
just go to town with some different
grits<00:03:30.549> start<00:03:31.120> with<00:03:31.239> some<00:03:31.389> some<00:03:31.720> course<00:03:31.959> work

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
grits start with some some course work

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.530 
grits start with some some course work
itself<00:03:32.799> define<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.489> strop<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.269> out<00:03:34.359> at<00:03:34.450> the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
itself define and strop it out at the

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.940 
itself define and strop it out at the
end<00:03:34.660> but<00:03:34.900> that's<00:03:35.019> just<00:03:35.230> not<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.530> case<00:03:35.560> it's

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
end but that's just not the case it's

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.390 
end but that's just not the case it's
much<00:03:36.220> harder<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:37.329> touch<00:03:37.569> up<00:03:37.780> this<00:03:37.989> type<00:03:38.290> of

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
much harder to touch up this type of

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.550 
much harder to touch up this type of
blade<00:03:39.400> grind<00:03:39.700> however<00:03:40.510> I<00:03:40.810> feel<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.290> did<00:03:41.530> a

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
blade grind however I feel I did a

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.140 
blade grind however I feel I did a
decent<00:03:41.739> job<00:03:41.950> on<00:03:42.280> it<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.579> really<00:03:42.730> only<00:03:42.940> took

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
decent job on it it really only took

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.470 
decent job on it it really only took
about<00:03:43.209> 20<00:03:43.690> minutes<00:03:43.720> or<00:03:44.079> so<00:03:44.230> after<00:03:44.590> I<00:03:45.250> used<00:03:46.209> that

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
about 20 minutes or so after I used that

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.680 
about 20 minutes or so after I used that
stone<00:03:46.870> I<00:03:47.730> dropped<00:03:48.730> it<00:03:48.879> up<00:03:48.970> a<00:03:49.090> little<00:03:49.269> bit<00:03:49.510> with

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
stone I dropped it up a little bit with

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.900 
stone I dropped it up a little bit with
some<00:03:49.720> compounds<00:03:50.470> I<00:03:50.620> ended<00:03:51.310> up<00:03:51.370> dropping<00:03:51.609> it<00:03:51.879> to

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
some compounds I ended up dropping it to

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.479 
some compounds I ended up dropping it to
fine<00:03:52.419> and<00:03:52.690> I<00:03:52.750> want<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.650> look<00:03:53.739> more<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.220> so<00:03:54.430> I

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
fine and I want to look more to so I

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:55.330 
fine and I want to look more to so I
backed<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:54.940> up

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
backed it up

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.510 
backed it up
put<00:03:55.459> it<00:03:55.550> back<00:03:55.700> on<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:56.330> flat<00:03:57.110> stone<00:03:57.410> which<00:03:58.190> was<00:03:58.400> I

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
put it back on a flat stone which was I

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.350 
put it back on a flat stone which was I
believe<00:03:59.319> 400<00:04:00.319> or<00:04:00.440> 500<00:04:00.980> grit<00:04:01.190> and<00:04:01.430> then<00:04:02.180> just

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
believe 400 or 500 grit and then just

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.690 
believe 400 or 500 grit and then just
did<00:04:02.450> a<00:04:02.480> couple<00:04:02.750> very<00:04:03.530> simple<00:04:03.830> passes<00:04:04.190> as<00:04:04.430> if<00:04:04.610> I

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
did a couple very simple passes as if I

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.970 
did a couple very simple passes as if I
was<00:04:04.819> dropping<00:04:05.150> in<00:04:05.569> a<00:04:05.690> backwards<00:04:06.140> fashion<00:04:06.500> and

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
was dropping in a backwards fashion and

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.100 
was dropping in a backwards fashion and
I<00:04:07.040> came<00:04:07.250> out<00:04:07.489> with<00:04:07.700> a<00:04:07.730> somewhat<00:04:08.599> tooth<00:04:08.930> the

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
I came out with a somewhat tooth the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.600 
I came out with a somewhat tooth the
edge<00:04:09.230> it's<00:04:09.680> going<00:04:09.800> to<00:04:09.920> be<00:04:09.980> perfect<00:04:10.370> for<00:04:10.400> what<00:04:10.550> I

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
edge it's going to be perfect for what I

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.790 
edge it's going to be perfect for what I
need<00:04:10.819> this<00:04:10.910> for<00:04:11.120> again<00:04:11.420> in<00:04:11.630> chopping<00:04:12.470> but<00:04:12.590> just

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
need this for again in chopping but just

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.290 
need this for again in chopping but just
to<00:04:12.890> give<00:04:13.010> you<00:04:13.040> a<00:04:13.160> quick<00:04:13.400> shot<00:04:13.610> actually<00:04:14.030> here's

to give you a quick shot actually here's
a<00:04:14.390> shot<00:04:14.810> a<00:04:14.959> picture<00:04:15.230> I<00:04:15.290> took

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.819 

all<00:04:20.570> right<00:04:20.720> so<00:04:20.900> you<00:04:20.989> can<00:04:21.109> tell<00:04:21.320> that<00:04:21.560> it's

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
all right so you can tell that it's

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.159 
all right so you can tell that it's
still<00:04:22.160> there<00:04:22.580> I<00:04:22.850> could<00:04:23.330> continue<00:04:23.660> to<00:04:23.840> work<00:04:23.990> on

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
still there I could continue to work on

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.270 
still there I could continue to work on
this<00:04:24.320> and<00:04:24.530> get<00:04:24.650> it<00:04:24.680> perfect<00:04:26.500> but<00:04:27.500> I'm<00:04:27.620> not<00:04:27.740> so

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
this and get it perfect but I'm not so

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.529 
this and get it perfect but I'm not so
interested<00:04:28.669> right<00:04:28.850> at<00:04:29.030> this<00:04:29.150> moment<00:04:29.360> you

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
interested right at this moment you

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.439 
interested right at this moment you
could<00:04:29.660> see<00:04:29.870> it<00:04:30.110> is<00:04:30.530> right<00:04:30.830> there<00:04:31.389> all<00:04:32.389> right

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
could see it is right there all right

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.490 
could see it is right there all right
where<00:04:32.810> that<00:04:32.840> uh<00:04:33.160> damage<00:04:34.160> was<00:04:35.169> but<00:04:36.169> not<00:04:36.289> that

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
where that uh damage was but not that

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.150

like I said if I continue this project I

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.779 
like I said if I continue this project I
can<00:04:38.930> completely<00:04:39.259> sharpen<00:04:39.680> that<00:04:39.770> out<00:04:39.949> but<00:04:40.220> it's

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
can completely sharpen that out but it's

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.969 
can completely sharpen that out but it's
not<00:04:40.910> necessary<00:04:41.419> I<00:04:41.660> don't<00:04:41.840> need<00:04:42.050> to<00:04:42.229> have<00:04:42.410> you

know a scalpel all the way up this edge

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.140 
know a scalpel all the way up this edge
this<00:04:45.289> is<00:04:45.440> not<00:04:45.590> for<00:04:45.979> precision<00:04:46.490> cutting<00:04:46.699> okay

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150
