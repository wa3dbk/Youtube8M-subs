00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.029
 football is passion 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.490
 soccer is a good race but not 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:12.550
 it's for anyone this is a race 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:16.860
 Professional is a wish 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.860
 that is to say that those who have any 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.970
 for us the difficulty is that that 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.590
 desire is for all reality that 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.300
 thinking so good that Thursday 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.640
 could by game phase be prepared 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.619
 much the departments of soldering iron and 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.350
 visuality is composed of several 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.659
 professionals us within the 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.600
 catchment there are variables that are very 

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:41.600
 important and it has to do with this 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.920
 first of all be a proposal towards 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.540
 the rest 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.040
 we strongly put ourselves to work for 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.050
 stop to put that change so 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.049
 well the first point of the look was 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.320
 internal and resolve internal issues 

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:56.059
 when then they were going to meet and there 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.890
 Really meet the deadlines that this 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.290
 with what is to continue to fulfill them when 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.299
 come will play workshop action a test 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.799
 accordingly it must receive more 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:07.939
 over there that he did not stay in the 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.590
 club because this has to do with the 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.299
 day to day with him face to face face of that 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.070
 player when he returns to his club and what is 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.170
 what he's going to exhibit at his club 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.270
 we do open tests 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.120
 also for so that everyone by 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.400
 participate to spread 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.680
 through press as appropriate with 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.660

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.770
 and I say there already that positive balance of 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.160
 the same no more than he stayed not 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.980
 I know we must attend and give 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.230
 the tension enters the intention the 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.630
 observation that corresponds to any 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.440
 play that happens here since it enters 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.350
 the club 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.180
 I start a database and so 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.980
 We know since it arrives that party 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.450
 how many minutes game of he played 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.610
 if you changed equipment without four teams 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.860
 if we pass it to the upper Canary Islands if it was 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.720
 court 4 on court 5 here what you 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.640
 position is the work the work of 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.270
 each area the professionals work 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.130
 of our players that everyone knows 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.720
 be what is up to it we go back from 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.820
 encourage growth these players 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.910
 so that if you understand what it is about 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.310
 can have their career with bill of 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.990
 football that can live on this so 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.480
 cute that is football and that 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.100
 immobilized the containment in the pension 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.290
 enter the best and you have to have a 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.790
 family dye or my practices and 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.130
 our planning and design has to 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.840
 see also that thinking that those who 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.750
 are here are our children we have to 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.070
 give everything that is among others 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.340
 possibilities for him to have a 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.470
 Growth in football with a 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.450
 comprehensive training so that he from here 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.300
 have other tools if he does not decide 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.510
 be a footballer or be integrated into 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.459
 society and have other development with 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.240
 other professions without any kind of 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.150
 problems 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.960
 the people who are obviously none 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.750
 way replaces but if Mom and Dad 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:08.600
 fulfills roles that is distances 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.780
 have to generate that is full goes to 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.770
 be a good proposal for the 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.580
 families that have in South 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:21.370
 in their internal children with possibilities 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.290
 and with talents professionalism and start 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.120
 to develop that what we are 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.340
 doing and we still need to develop 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.720
 that is the way and that path that 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.630
 must travel the player who 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.510
 we detect to be professional and the 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.550
 commitment is treatment assumed to 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.020
 directorial level the first says the 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.030
 policy decision policy decision 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.270
 of this club and at nine already has 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.280

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.819
 links to the players to the 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.739

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.909
 a workshop that is that the club deserves 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.159
