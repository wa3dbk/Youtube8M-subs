00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
training maybe it's a little bit

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:25.499 
training maybe it's a little bit
old-fashioned<00:01:10.890> industrial<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:25.210> we're<00:01:25.330> very

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
old-fashioned industrial and we're very

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.060 
old-fashioned industrial and we're very
excited<00:01:25.630> about<00:01:25.930> because<00:01:26.440> traditionally

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
excited about because traditionally

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.889 
excited about because traditionally
we've<00:01:27.280> kind<00:01:27.520> of<00:01:27.549> avoided<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.420> high-speed

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
we've kind of avoided the high-speed

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.050 
we've kind of avoided the high-speed
angle<00:01:29.830> because<00:01:30.070> it's<00:01:30.100> usually<00:01:30.340> where<00:01:30.759> city

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
angle because it's usually where city

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.150 
angle because it's usually where city
goes<00:01:31.270> and<00:01:31.929> that<00:01:32.200> tends<00:01:32.440> to<00:01:32.530> go<00:01:32.740> in<00:01:32.860> towards

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
goes and that tends to go in towards

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.740 
goes and that tends to go in towards
your<00:01:33.220> governor<00:01:33.550> crock<00:01:33.759> so<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.450> building

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
your governor crock so the building

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.300 
your governor crock so the building
experience<00:01:35.229> is<00:01:35.320> a<00:01:35.350> little<00:01:35.619> bit<00:01:35.740> more<00:01:35.860> circle

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
experience is a little bit more circle

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.820 
experience is a little bit more circle
no<00:01:36.850> one<00:01:37.179> basically<00:01:37.330> but<00:01:38.140> with<00:01:38.259> this<00:01:38.409> train<00:01:38.679> we

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
no one basically but with this train we

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.560 
no one basically but with this train we
can<00:01:38.979> assure<00:01:39.070> you<00:01:39.220> that<00:01:39.580> there<00:01:39.820> are<00:01:39.850> lots<00:01:40.330> of

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
basically I'm just going to go through

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.520 
basically I'm just going to go through
some<00:01:45.880> of<00:01:46.030> these<00:01:46.090> parts<00:01:46.450> because<00:01:46.659> they're<00:01:47.319> very

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
some of these parts because they're very

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.270 
some of these parts because they're very
exciting<00:01:48.009> to<00:01:48.100> show<00:01:48.280> you<00:01:49.800> we<00:01:50.800> start<00:01:51.039> with<00:01:51.190> the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
exciting to show you we start with the

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.980 
exciting to show you we start with the
main<00:01:51.429> engine<00:01:51.759> I<00:01:51.970> think<00:01:52.149> that's<00:01:52.479> some<00:01:52.659> really

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
main engine I think that's some really

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.740 
main engine I think that's some really
fun<00:01:53.319> things<00:01:54.280> in<00:01:54.429> here<00:01:54.580> and<00:01:55.119> that's<00:01:55.270> surprising

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
fun things in here and that's surprising

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.300 
fun things in here and that's surprising
because<00:01:55.869> these<00:01:56.229> traits<00:01:56.619> are<00:01:56.740> a<00:01:56.830> traditional

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
because these traits are a traditional

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.669 
because these traits are a traditional
need<00:01:57.460> a<00:01:57.490> very<00:01:58.000> aerodynamic<00:01:58.300> which<00:01:58.960> could<00:01:59.530> be

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
need a very aerodynamic which could be

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.230 
need a very aerodynamic which could be
even<00:01:59.890> if<00:01:59.950> they're<00:02:00.100> a<00:02:00.130> bit<00:02:00.280> simple<00:02:00.640> but<00:02:01.149> we

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
even if they're a bit simple but we

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.639 
even if they're a bit simple but we
found<00:02:01.420> some<00:02:01.630> wonderful<00:02:01.780> opportunities<00:02:02.080> to

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
found some wonderful opportunities to

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.289 
found some wonderful opportunities to
surprise<00:02:03.009> you<00:02:03.189> with<00:02:03.399> civility<00:02:03.850> techniques

some upside down building

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.160 
some upside down building
I<00:02:09.519> take<00:02:09.970> try<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.239> keep<00:02:10.450> this<00:02:10.600> nice<00:02:10.840> smooth

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
shape you can see that it continues up

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.490 
shape you can see that it continues up
into<00:02:13.239> this<00:02:13.360> windshield<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:14.019> that's<00:02:14.320> actually

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500

into this windshield and that's actually
a<00:02:14.680> printed<00:02:15.070> windshield<00:02:15.430> which<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.880> first

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
a printed windshield which is the first

a printed windshield which is the first
time<00:02:16.269> we<00:02:16.390> printed<00:02:16.720> on<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:16.959> elements<00:02:17.350> which

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
time we printed on that elements which

were pretty excited we also have
printing<00:02:19.840> on<00:02:19.989> this<00:02:20.140> tile<00:02:20.650> here<00:02:20.980> which<00:02:21.250> is

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
printing on this tile here which is

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.580 
printing on this tile here which is
quite<00:02:21.579> nice<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:22.360> then<00:02:22.720> we<00:02:23.170> wanted<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.440> go<00:02:23.530> a

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
quite nice and then we wanted to go a

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.170 
quite nice and then we wanted to go a
little<00:02:23.709> bit<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.010> orange<00:02:24.430> indeed<00:02:24.790> wanted<00:02:25.120> to

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
little bit the orange indeed wanted to

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.910 
little bit the orange indeed wanted to
kind<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:25.480> avoid<00:02:25.720> labels<00:02:26.140> weren't<00:02:26.410> impossible

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
kind of avoid labels weren't impossible

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.400 
kind of avoid labels weren't impossible
so<00:02:27.459> this<00:02:27.640> back<00:02:27.850> Harry<00:02:28.150> here<00:02:28.480> is<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.690> Reno

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.080 

oops<00:02:35.410> that<00:02:35.560> actually<00:02:35.980> make<00:02:36.160> up<00:02:36.190> each<00:02:36.640> part<00:02:37.000> of

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
oops that actually make up each part of

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.030 
oops that actually make up each part of
that<00:02:37.270> which<00:02:38.020> we<00:02:38.170> think<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:38.440> really<00:02:38.739> have<00:02:38.860> fun

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
that which we think you really have fun

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.070 
that which we think you really have fun
exploring<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.640> building<00:02:39.940> then<00:02:40.630> of<00:02:40.750> course<00:02:40.959> we

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
exploring and building then of course we

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.120 
exploring and building then of course we
have<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.380> functionality<00:02:41.770> with<00:02:42.099> the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
have the functionality with the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.780 
have the functionality with the
pantographs

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
pantographs

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.490 
pantographs
they<00:02:43.060> can<00:02:43.239> go<00:02:43.330> up<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.599> down<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:44.200> they<00:02:44.349> both

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
they can go up and down and they both

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.770 
they can go up and down and they both
work<00:02:44.770> so<00:02:44.920> depending<00:02:45.370> on<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.550> problem<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.630> can

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
work so depending on the problem you can

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.600 
work so depending on the problem you can
decide<00:02:47.050> which<00:02:47.170> way<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.470> go<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.860> then<00:02:48.520> of

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
decide which way to go and then of

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.570 
decide which way to go and then of
course<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:49.150> Train<00:02:49.360> opens<00:02:49.690> up<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:51.370> when<00:02:51.489> you

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
course the Train opens up and when you

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.290 
course the Train opens up and when you
look<00:02:51.730> inside<00:02:52.030> we<00:02:52.959> have<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.650> removable<00:02:54.300> electric

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
look inside we have a removable electric

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.670 
look inside we have a removable electric
motor<00:02:55.510> which<00:02:55.870> is<00:02:56.019> like<00:02:56.170> on<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.350> real<00:02:56.440> train

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
motor which is like on the real train

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.020 
motor which is like on the real train
except<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.100> don't<00:02:57.310> think<00:02:57.459> on<00:02:57.550> the<00:02:57.610> real<00:02:57.760> trance

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
except I don't think on the real trance

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.910 
except I don't think on the real trance
is<00:02:58.120> easily<00:02:58.569> ruled<00:03:01.470> because<00:03:02.470> just<00:03:02.800> by

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
is easily ruled because just by

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.979 
is easily ruled because just by
answering<00:03:03.069> a<00:03:03.310> battery<00:03:03.580> box<00:03:03.730> my<00:03:04.209> receiver<00:03:04.660> and

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
answering a battery box my receiver and

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.350 
answering a battery box my receiver and
you<00:03:05.680> can<00:03:05.860> power<00:03:06.069> this<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.970> they<00:03:07.120> know<00:03:07.209> the

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
you can power this and they know the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:25.440 
you can power this and they know the
front<00:03:07.510> we<00:03:07.660> also<00:03:07.690> have<00:03:09.750> which<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:23.700> out<00:03:24.700> here<00:03:24.730> and

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
front we also have which is out here and

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.430 
front we also have which is out here and
one<00:03:25.569> of<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.780> first<00:03:25.989> things<00:03:26.200> that<00:03:26.230> you'll

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
one of the first things that you'll

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.229 
one of the first things that you'll
notice<00:03:26.650> is<00:03:26.950> that<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.400> trains<00:03:27.670> are<00:03:27.910> actually

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
notice is that the trains are actually

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.240 
notice is that the trains are actually
joined<00:03:28.510> they<00:03:28.810> have<00:03:28.959> a<00:03:28.989> co<00:03:29.170> joint<00:03:29.530> wheel<00:03:29.950> sent

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
joined they have a co joint wheel sent

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.830 
joined they have a co joint wheel sent
there<00:03:30.400> by<00:03:30.970> pokey

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
there by pokey

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.360 
there by pokey
we<00:03:32.200> actually<00:03:32.380> don't<00:03:32.680> get<00:03:32.860> to<00:03:32.980> do<00:03:33.069> this<00:03:33.190> very

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
we actually don't get to do this very

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.830 
we actually don't get to do this very
often<00:03:33.610> in<00:03:33.880> fact<00:03:33.910> I<00:03:34.120> think<00:03:34.180> we've<00:03:34.390> only<00:03:34.480> done<00:03:34.720> it

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
often in fact I think we've only done it

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.750 
often in fact I think we've only done it
once<00:03:35.019> before<00:03:35.109> but<00:03:36.010> it<00:03:36.100> really<00:03:36.310> gives<00:03:36.489> a<00:03:36.579> nice

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
once before but it really gives a nice

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.789 
once before but it really gives a nice
look<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.049> train<00:03:38.230> that<00:03:38.380> we<00:03:38.500> think<00:03:38.709> is

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
look to the train that we think is

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.099 
look to the train that we think is
rather<00:03:38.980> exciting<00:03:39.370> in<00:03:40.239> addition<00:03:40.600> to<00:03:40.750> that<00:03:40.900> we

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
rather exciting in addition to that we

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.680 
rather exciting in addition to that we
have<00:03:41.260> working<00:03:41.470> doors<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:43.060> can<00:03:43.209> see<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.510> doors

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
have working doors you can see the doors

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.509 
have working doors you can see the doors
actually<00:03:44.079> function<00:03:44.470> on<00:03:44.590> both<00:03:44.620> sides<00:03:44.980> and

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
actually function on both sides and

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:46.920 
actually function on both sides and
these<00:03:45.700> are<00:03:45.820> brick<00:03:46.000> built<00:03:46.209> doors<00:03:46.450> which<00:03:46.780> we

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
these are brick built doors which we

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.390 
these are brick built doors which we
think<00:03:47.170> that's<00:03:47.320> a<00:03:47.410> really<00:03:47.680> nice<00:03:47.829> detail<00:03:48.070> in

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
think that's a really nice detail in

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.099 
think that's a really nice detail in
look<00:03:48.549> and<00:03:49.180> then<00:03:49.329> of<00:03:49.420> course<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:49.780> want<00:03:49.959> to<00:03:49.989> play

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
look and then of course you want to play

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:50.759 
look and then of course you want to play
with<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.350> Train

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
with the Train

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.140 
with the Train
so<00:03:51.100> we<00:03:51.220> want<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.459> make<00:03:51.549> a<00:03:51.579> show<00:03:51.760> that<00:03:51.910> way<00:03:52.030> the

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
so we want to make a show that way the

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.270 
so we want to make a show that way the
roofs<00:03:52.359> come<00:03:52.600> off<00:03:52.750> when<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.769> roof<00:03:53.890> comes<00:03:54.160> off

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
roofs come off when the roof comes off

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.890 
roofs come off when the roof comes off
here<00:03:54.549> you<00:03:54.760> can<00:03:55.120> see<00:03:55.239> it's<00:03:55.359> actually<00:03:55.480> a<00:03:55.690> really

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
here you can see it's actually a really

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.530 
here you can see it's actually a really
nice<00:03:56.170> split<00:03:56.500> it<00:03:57.070> divides<00:03:57.730> it<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.329> mid<00:03:58.510> point

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
nice split it divides it and a mid point

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.720 
nice split it divides it and a mid point
you<00:03:59.350> can<00:03:59.500> see<00:03:59.650> most<00:03:59.829> of<00:03:59.980> this<00:04:00.100> actually<00:04:00.489> comes

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
you can see most of this actually comes

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.910 
you can see most of this actually comes
off<00:04:00.910> on<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.359> roof<00:04:01.630> and<00:04:02.200> what<00:04:02.320> that<00:04:02.470> does<00:04:02.620> is<00:04:02.799> it

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
off on the roof and what that does is it

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.920 
off on the roof and what that does is it
allows<00:04:03.100> you<00:04:03.340> a<00:04:03.609> lot<00:04:04.060> more<00:04:04.180> access<00:04:04.390> to<00:04:04.750> get<00:04:04.900> a

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
allows you a lot more access to get a

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.060 
allows you a lot more access to get a
mental<00:04:05.170> playing<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.769> play<00:04:05.920> through

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
mental playing and play through

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.160 
mental playing and play through
minifigures<00:04:06.609> and<00:04:06.790> as<00:04:07.450> you<00:04:07.570> look<00:04:07.690> inside<00:04:07.989> on

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
minifigures and as you look inside on

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.360 
minifigures and as you look inside on
the<00:04:08.260> minifigures<00:04:08.739> one<00:04:08.950> thing<00:04:09.100> that<00:04:09.220> might

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
the minifigures one thing that might

cool elements that we have in this set
we<00:05:16.140> have<00:05:16.620> of<00:05:16.740> course<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:17.070> Train<00:05:17.250> window<00:05:17.430> which

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
we have of course the Train window which

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.220 
we have of course the Train window which
you<00:05:17.730> would<00:05:17.940> expect<00:05:18.210> in<00:05:18.330> a<00:05:18.420> normal<00:05:18.660> train<00:05:18.840> we've

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
you would expect in a normal train we've

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.440 
you would expect in a normal train we've
just<00:05:19.470> taken<00:05:19.560> it<00:05:19.860> to<00:05:20.370> another<00:05:20.400> level<00:05:20.730> framing

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450

it sideways but of course train vents

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.620 
it sideways but of course train vents
will<00:05:23.220> hopefully<00:05:23.370> like<00:05:23.640> that<00:05:23.850> we<00:05:24.390> have<00:05:24.480> some

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
will hopefully like that we have some

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.960 
will hopefully like that we have some
nice<00:05:24.810> printed<00:05:25.260> elements<00:05:25.380> here<00:05:25.800> and<00:05:26.070> in

angle<00:05:28.710> plate<00:05:28.920> and<00:05:29.280> when<00:05:29.700> you<00:05:29.790> start<00:05:30.000> building

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
angle plate and when you start building

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.250 
angle plate and when you start building
with<00:05:30.480> it<00:05:30.600> you're<00:05:30.720> really<00:05:30.960> gonna<00:05:31.080> appreciate

countryside just to give you an idea of
the<00:06:12.370> expandability<00:06:12.880> of<00:06:13.210> this<00:06:13.360> model<00:06:13.690> it<00:06:14.320> is<00:06:14.470> a

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
the expandability of this model it is a

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.670 
the expandability of this model it is a
train<00:06:14.800> and<00:06:15.160> as<00:06:16.090> a<00:06:16.150> train<00:06:16.630> we<00:06:17.230> would<00:06:17.380> really

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
train and as a train we would really

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.770 
train and as a train we would really
like<00:06:17.890> to<00:06:17.950> encourage<00:06:18.130> you<00:06:18.520> to<00:06:18.850> explore<00:06:19.240> how

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:19.780 
like to encourage you to explore how

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.260 
like to encourage you to explore how
much<00:06:20.050> beer<00:06:20.230> can<00:06:20.500> get<00:06:20.670> and<00:06:21.670> if<00:06:21.820> you<00:06:21.940> take<00:06:22.090> this

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
much beer can get and if you take this

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.750 
much beer can get and if you take this
train<00:06:22.510> and<00:06:22.600> you<00:06:22.690> add<00:06:22.840> a<00:06:22.870> second<00:06:23.260> one<00:06:23.760> you

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
train and you add a second one you

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.090 
train and you add a second one you
really<00:06:25.090> can<00:06:25.420> start<00:06:25.630> to<00:06:25.750> see<00:06:25.960> how<00:06:26.260> impressive

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
really can start to see how impressive

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.650 
really can start to see how impressive
this<00:06:27.370> can<00:06:27.580> become<00:06:27.760> a<00:06:27.940> number<00:06:28.330> and<00:06:28.540> that

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
this can become a number and that

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.150 
this can become a number and that
actually<00:06:28.990> helps<00:06:29.230> explain<00:06:29.470> about<00:06:29.710> why<00:06:29.980> we<00:06:30.130> have

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 
actually helps explain about why we have

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.220 
actually helps explain about why we have
some<00:06:30.520> of<00:06:30.610> these<00:06:30.730> numbers<00:06:31.330> on<00:06:31.780> here<00:06:32.080> because

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.230 
some of these numbers on here because

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.930 
some of these numbers on here because
it's<00:06:32.560> additional<00:06:32.980> numbers<00:06:33.280> and<00:06:33.700> you<00:06:33.790> can

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
it's additional numbers and you can

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.410 
it's additional numbers and you can
expand<00:06:34.270> your<00:06:34.330> train<00:06:34.570> as<00:06:34.750> long<00:06:34.930> as<00:06:35.110> you<00:06:35.200> want
