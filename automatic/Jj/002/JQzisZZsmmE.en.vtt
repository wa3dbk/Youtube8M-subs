to the e power chord and that's just
going<00:04:43.810> to<00:04:43.870> be<00:04:43.960> seven<00:04:44.349> and<00:04:44.470> nine

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.830 

you<00:04:56.229> go<00:04:56.319> to<00:04:56.439> a<00:04:56.469> D<00:04:56.889> power<00:04:57.129> chord<00:04:57.580> so<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.389> e<00:04:58.419> is

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
you go to a D power chord so the e is

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.070 
you go to a D power chord so the e is
seven<00:04:59.439> on<00:04:59.650> the<00:04:59.770> a<00:04:59.949> nine<00:05:00.580> on<00:05:00.849> the<00:05:00.969> D<00:05:01.210> and<00:05:01.509> then

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
seven on the a nine on the D and then

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.600 
seven on the a nine on the D and then
you<00:05:02.199> just<00:05:02.439> go<00:05:02.560> down<00:05:02.710> a<00:05:02.770> whole<00:05:03.099> step<00:05:03.279> which<00:05:03.430> is

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
you just go down a whole step which is

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.939 
you just go down a whole step which is
two<00:05:03.999> frets<00:05:04.210> down<00:05:04.990> to<00:05:05.169> the<00:05:05.289> D<00:05:07.529> then<00:05:08.529> a<00:05:08.710> counter

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:08.949 
two frets down to the D then a counter

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:11.790 
two frets down to the D then a counter
would<00:05:09.370> be<00:05:09.819> four<00:05:10.090> five<00:05:10.330> six<00:05:10.569> seven<00:05:10.960> eight<00:05:11.080> back

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
would be four five six seven eight back

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.279 
would be four five six seven eight back
to<00:05:12.039> the<00:05:12.159> G<00:05:12.490> we<00:05:12.699> did<00:05:12.909> and<00:05:13.090> this<00:05:13.210> is<00:05:13.360> where<00:05:13.539> that<00:05:13.719> D

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
to the G we did and this is where that D

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.499 
to the G we did and this is where that D
with<00:05:14.919> f-sharp<00:05:15.189> and<00:05:15.669> the<00:05:15.789> base<00:05:15.939> comes<00:05:16.210> in<00:05:16.360> so

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:16.509 
with f-sharp and the base comes in so

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:20.469 
with f-sharp and the base comes in so
goes

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.890 

so<00:05:21.199> what<00:05:21.319> you're<00:05:21.409> doing<00:05:21.439> is<00:05:21.620> going<00:05:21.860> G<00:05:22.689> D<00:05:23.689> F

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
so what you're doing is going G D F

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:31.600 
so what you're doing is going G D F
sharp<00:05:24.259> E

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:40.589 

and<00:05:32.610> then<00:05:32.760> it's<00:05:32.940> a<00:05:33.150> GD

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:48.120 

yeah<00:05:40.899> sure

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.340 

now<00:05:48.670> the<00:05:48.730> second<00:05:49.480> time<00:05:49.660> through<00:05:49.960> in<00:05:50.230> the
