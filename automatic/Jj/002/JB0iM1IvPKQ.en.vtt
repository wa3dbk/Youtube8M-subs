grown<00:03:13.600> so<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.230> know<00:03:14.500> I<00:03:14.680> said<00:03:14.829> the<00:03:15.130> bodies<00:03:15.820> are

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
grown so you know I said the bodies are

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.759 
grown so you know I said the bodies are
looking<00:03:16.209> worse<00:03:16.390> to<00:03:17.049> me<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.290> sports<00:03:17.530> going

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
looking worse to me to sports going

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.140 
looking worse to me to sports going
backwards<00:03:18.160> in<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.340> way<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:18.579> looks<00:03:18.760> and<00:03:19.000> like

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
backwards in the way it looks and like

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.670 
backwards in the way it looks and like
Arnold's<00:03:19.570> did<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.840> they're<00:03:20.049> rewarding<00:03:20.530> that

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
Arnold's did and they're rewarding that

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.710 
Arnold's did and they're rewarding that
so<00:03:21.280> they<00:03:21.370> need<00:03:21.549> to<00:03:21.700> stop<00:03:21.940> rewarding<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.600> and

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
so they need to stop rewarding that and

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.240 
so they need to stop rewarding that and
like<00:03:22.840> he<00:03:22.930> said<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.320> judges<00:03:23.560> people<00:03:23.920> need<00:03:24.160> to

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
like he said the judges people need to

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.890 
like he said the judges people need to
speak<00:03:24.489> up<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.850> judges<00:03:25.299> and<00:03:25.480> speak<00:03:25.690> up<00:03:25.810> the

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
speak up to the judges and speak up the

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
just to see them because they like their

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.180 
just to see them because they like their
attitude<00:04:59.080> or<00:04:59.470> once<00:04:59.590> they<00:04:59.710> do<00:04:59.770> get<00:05:00.040> to<00:05:00.160> know

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190
