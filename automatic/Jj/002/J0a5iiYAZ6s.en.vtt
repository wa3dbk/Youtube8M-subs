00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.420 
we'll do a tablespoon of lemon juice now
if<00:02:27.769> you<00:02:27.890> find<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:28.370> recipe<00:02:30.010> tastes<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.160> little

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
if you find this recipe tastes a little

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.160 
if you find this recipe tastes a little
too<00:02:31.610> much<00:02:31.790> like<00:02:32.030> cashews<00:02:32.569> and<00:02:32.840> not<00:02:32.959> enough

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
too much like cashews and not enough

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.500 
too much like cashews and not enough
like<00:02:33.379> the<00:02:33.500> red<00:02:33.650> bell<00:02:33.830> pepper<00:02:34.129> I<00:02:34.510> would

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
like the red bell pepper I would

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.880 
like the red bell pepper I would
definitely<00:02:35.810> recommend<00:02:35.900> throwing<00:02:36.500> in<00:02:36.590> more<00:02:36.799> of

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
definitely recommend throwing in more of

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.949 
definitely recommend throwing in more of
the<00:02:36.980> red<00:02:37.160> bell<00:02:37.340> pepper<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:38.090> more<00:02:38.599> lemon<00:02:38.930> juice

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
the red bell pepper and more lemon juice

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.990 
the red bell pepper and more lemon juice
as<00:02:39.349> well<00:02:39.379> the<00:02:39.799> lemon<00:02:40.069> juice<00:02:40.220> tends<00:02:40.579> to<00:02:40.760> bring

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
as well the lemon juice tends to bring

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.460 
as well the lemon juice tends to bring
out<00:02:41.530> more<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.680> flavor<00:02:42.920> in<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.459> pepper<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.840> it

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
out more the flavor in the pepper and it

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.350 
out more the flavor in the pepper and it
cuts<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:46.040> fattiness<00:02:46.519> of<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.819> cashews<00:02:47.329> a

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
cuts the fattiness of the cashews a

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.449 
cuts the fattiness of the cashews a
little<00:02:47.660> bit<00:02:47.920> alright<00:02:48.920> so<00:02:49.040> that's<00:02:49.190> about<00:02:49.310> a

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
little bit alright so that's about a

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.199 
little bit alright so that's about a
tablespoon<00:02:50.349> now<00:02:51.349> we'll<00:02:51.560> add<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:52.129> teaspoon<00:02:52.940> of
