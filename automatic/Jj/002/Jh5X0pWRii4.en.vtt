all about compatibility and

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.969 
all about compatibility and
interoperability<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:31.030> is<00:01:31.509> bootable<00:01:32.110> it<00:01:32.410> is

interoperability it is bootable it is

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.609 
interoperability it is bootable it is
fast<00:01:33.910> so<00:01:34.360> that's<00:01:34.509> all<00:01:34.690> good<00:01:34.840> it'll<00:01:35.229> also<00:01:35.440> work

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
fast so that's all good it'll also work

from another manufacturer they're
validating<00:01:54.340> that<00:01:54.369> too<00:01:54.819> so<00:01:55.390> these<00:01:56.080> are<00:01:56.289> some<00:01:56.410> of

like Asus because they can take that and

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.350 
like Asus because they can take that and
go<00:02:08.979> look<00:02:09.220> we're<00:02:09.610> not<00:02:09.759> going<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:09.940> do<00:02:10.090> it<00:02:10.119> that

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
go look we're not going to do it that

way<00:02:10.509> we're<00:02:10.929> gonna<00:02:10.990> fix<00:02:11.290> it<00:02:11.500> I<00:02:11.650> for<00:02:12.010> one<00:02:12.130> I'm

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
way we're gonna fix it I for one I'm

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.770 
way we're gonna fix it I for one I'm
extremely<00:02:12.670> excited<00:02:13.240> about<00:02:13.300> this<00:02:13.600> because

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
extremely excited about this because

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.750 
extremely excited about this because
frankly<00:02:14.350> there's<00:02:14.830> not<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.190> much<00:02:15.400> stuff<00:02:15.700> that

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
frankly there's not that much stuff that

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.490 
frankly there's not that much stuff that
you<00:02:16.000> can<00:02:16.150> put<00:02:16.270> in<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.390> PCI<00:02:16.720> Express<00:02:16.780> slot<00:02:17.290> I

far<00:02:19.750> as<00:02:19.840> my<00:02:19.959> computer<00:02:20.380> goes<00:02:20.560> I've<00:02:20.800> got<00:02:21.099> a<00:02:21.280> dual

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
far as my computer goes I've got a dual

slot graphics card dual GPU which is

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.140 
slot graphics card dual GPU which is
enough<00:02:23.470> for<00:02:23.620> me<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:23.950> got<00:02:24.280> my<00:02:24.400> sound<00:02:24.670> card<00:02:24.910> my

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
enough for me I got my sound card my

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.120 
enough for me I got my sound card my
ball<00:02:25.360> in<00:02:25.540> essence<00:02:25.990> dents<00:02:26.500> or<00:02:26.709> his<00:02:26.800> own<00:02:26.920> arse

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
ball in essence dents or his own arse

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.070 
ball in essence dents or his own arse
ents<00:02:27.430> rather<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:27.910> then<00:02:28.390> I've<00:02:28.599> got<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.840> raid

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
ents rather and then I've got a raid

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.380 
ents rather and then I've got a raid
card<00:02:29.349> so<00:02:29.860> this<00:02:30.010> would<00:02:30.220> be<00:02:30.400> instead<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.150> a<00:02:31.209> raid

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
card so this would be instead of a raid

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.059 
card so this would be instead of a raid
card<00:02:31.569> attached<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.020> a<00:02:32.080> bunch<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.319> SSDs<00:02:32.740> I<00:02:32.920> could

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.880 
card attached to a bunch of SSDs I could

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
have a raid card SSD thing going on in

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.620 
have a raid card SSD thing going on in
that<00:02:35.950> slot<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.970> other<00:02:37.150> than<00:02:37.360> that<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.540> mean

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
that slot and other than that I mean

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.030 
that slot and other than that I mean
what<00:02:37.840> else<00:02:37.990> can<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.200> really<00:02:38.500> put<00:02:38.770> in<00:02:38.860> there

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
what else can you really put in there

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.900 
what else can you really put in there

I<00:02:39.940> got<00:02:40.150> a<00:02:40.180> capture<00:02:40.600> card<00:02:40.840> so<00:02:41.560> now<00:02:42.490> we're<00:02:42.730> gonna

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
I got a capture card so now we're gonna

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.640 
I got a capture card so now we're gonna
have<00:02:43.030> more<00:02:43.240> options<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:43.840> because<00:02:44.440> of<00:02:44.470> that

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
have more options and because of that

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.250 
have more options and because of that

there's<00:03:07.630> actually<00:03:07.960> a<00:03:07.990> couple<00:03:08.200> cool<00:03:08.470> overlays

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
there's actually a couple cool overlays

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.430 
there's actually a couple cool overlays
so<00:03:09.550> you<00:03:09.610> can<00:03:09.880> overlay<00:03:10.420> your<00:03:10.660> own<00:03:10.810> crosshair

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
so you can overlay your own crosshair

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.680 
so you can overlay your own crosshair
