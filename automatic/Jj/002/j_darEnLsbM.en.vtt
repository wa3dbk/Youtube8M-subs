working<00:00:39.670> for<00:00:39.970> disney<00:00:40.090> is<00:00:40.300> that<00:00:40.510> they've

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
working for disney is that they've

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.869 
working for disney is that they've
always<00:00:41.110> had<00:00:41.500> that<00:00:43.620> mentality<00:00:44.620> like<00:00:45.070> you<00:00:45.760> know
