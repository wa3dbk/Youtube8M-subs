the<00:02:31.430> strike<00:02:31.820> or<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.450> can<00:02:32.570> dodge<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.290> grapple

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
the strike or you can dodge the grapple

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:34.840 
the strike or you can dodge the grapple
so<00:02:33.860> you<00:02:33.920> have<00:02:34.100> to<00:02:34.220> try<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.400> figure<00:02:34.520> out<00:02:34.670> like

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
so you have to try to figure out like

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.850 
so you have to try to figure out like
which<00:02:35.360> move<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:36.020> my<00:02:36.140> opponent<00:02:36.560> going<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.739> try

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
which move is my opponent going to try

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.680 
which move is my opponent going to try
to<00:02:36.920> use<00:02:37.160> on<00:02:37.310> me<00:02:37.489> so<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.239> sounds<00:02:38.270> like<00:02:38.510> they

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
to use on me so it sounds like they

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.510 
to use on me so it sounds like they
almost<00:02:38.870> like<00:02:39.200> our<00:02:39.650> kind<00:02:39.920> of<00:02:40.010> trying<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.280> put

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
obviously it's really easy to do

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.820 
obviously it's really easy to do
counters<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.110> things<00:03:25.260> like<00:03:25.379> that<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.739> means

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
counters and things like that it means

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.229 
counters and things like that it means
that<00:03:26.040> kind<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.310> what<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.640> theme<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:26.819> here<00:03:27.150> is

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
it's still pretty easy to pull off that

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.949 
it's still pretty easy to pull off that
stuff<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.160> how<00:03:29.280> they<00:03:29.489> have<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.569> change<00:03:30.810> any

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
stuff and how they have a change any

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
sort of the core mechanics like are

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.210 
sort of the core mechanics like are
there<00:03:32.580> any<00:03:32.730> different<00:03:33.330> types<00:03:33.599> of<00:03:33.920> moves<00:03:34.920> or

special abilities that we can assess oh

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.440 
special abilities that we can assess oh
yeah<00:03:37.650> with<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:37.950> counters<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:38.700> don't<00:03:39.180> know<00:03:39.300> if

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
yeah with the counters I don't know if

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.330 
yeah with the counters I don't know if
this<00:03:39.599> is<00:03:39.660> new<00:03:40.170> or<00:03:40.200> not<00:03:40.560> like<00:03:40.860> I<00:03:40.950> said<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.190> last

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
this is new or not like I said the last

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.250 
this is new or not like I said the last
one<00:03:41.489> I<00:03:41.519> played<00:03:41.819> intensive<00:03:42.540> leagues<00:03:42.690> too<00:03:42.989> but

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
one I played intensive leagues too but

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.809 
one I played intensive leagues too but
there<00:03:43.410> are<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:43.680> you've<00:03:43.860> got<00:03:43.890> your<00:03:44.040> your<00:03:44.550> normal

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
there are so you've got your your normal

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.370 
there are so you've got your your normal
counters<00:03:45.150> or<00:03:45.269> you<00:03:45.330> can<00:03:45.450> block<00:03:45.630> high<00:03:45.959> medium

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
counters or you can block high medium

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.530 
counters or you can block high medium
low<00:03:46.410> then<00:03:47.190> there<00:03:47.340> are<00:03:47.400> also<00:03:47.519> expert<00:03:48.150> counters

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
low then there are also expert counters

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.960 
low then there are also expert counters
those<00:03:49.380> can<00:03:49.590> only<00:03:49.709> be<00:03:49.860> used<00:03:49.890> to<00:03:50.099> block<00:03:50.310> medium

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
those can only be used to block medium

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.160 
those can only be used to block medium
punches<00:03:51.599> or<00:03:51.780> kicks<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:53.010> if<00:03:53.129> you<00:03:53.280> pull<00:03:53.670> one<00:03:53.819> off

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
punches or kicks and if you pull one off

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.420 
punches or kicks and if you pull one off
you've<00:03:55.170> launched<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.680> person<00:03:56.010> into<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.280> air

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
you've launched the person into the air

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.979 
you've launched the person into the air
it<00:03:56.549> makes<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:56.819> very<00:03:56.880> easy<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.330> follow<00:03:57.540> up<00:03:57.810> with

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
it makes it very easy to follow up with

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.100 
it makes it very easy to follow up with
another<00:03:58.650> crack<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.819> can<00:03:59.970> also<00:04:00.150> sidestep

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
another crack you can also sidestep

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.660 
another crack you can also sidestep
quickly<00:04:01.560> sort<00:04:01.799> of<00:04:01.920> like<00:04:02.069> in<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.549> upcoming

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
quickly sort of like in the upcoming

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.789 
quickly sort of like in the upcoming
soul<00:04:03.000> calibur<00:04:03.329> 5<00:04:03.450> even<00:04:03.750> shift<00:04:04.290> up<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:04.680> down

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
soul calibur 5 even shift up and down

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.979 
soul calibur 5 even shift up and down
really<00:04:05.010> fast<00:04:05.310> but<00:04:05.670> I<00:04:05.730> found<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:06.150> a<00:04:06.209> sense<00:04:06.780> so

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
really fast but I found that a sense so

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.140 
really fast but I found that a sense so
many<00:04:07.170> of<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.349> attacks<00:04:07.709> strike<00:04:08.370> horizontally

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
many of the attacks strike horizontally

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.330 
many of the attacks strike horizontally
you<00:04:09.480> really<00:04:09.720> can't<00:04:09.930> get<00:04:10.079> around<00:04:10.349> most<00:04:11.010> attacks

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
you really can't get around most attacks

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.339 
you really can't get around most attacks
by<00:04:11.519> using<00:04:11.700> that<00:04:11.880> size<00:04:12.120> I<00:04:12.750> didn't<00:04:13.019> find<00:04:13.170> it<00:04:13.200> like

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
by using that size I didn't find it like

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.550 
by using that size I didn't find it like
so<00:04:14.160> then<00:04:14.849> like<00:04:14.970> what<00:04:15.209> in<00:04:15.630> terms<00:04:15.870> of<00:04:16.049> like<00:04:16.290> I

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
so then like what in terms of like I

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.750 
so then like what in terms of like I
mean<00:04:16.799> that<00:04:16.889> they<00:04:16.950> talk<00:04:17.100> anything<00:04:17.310> about<00:04:17.549> modes

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
mean that they talk anything about modes

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.490 
mean that they talk anything about modes
like<00:04:17.940> is<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.540> going<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:18.720> be<00:04:18.810> tag<00:04:19.019> obviously<00:04:19.229> the

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
like is it going to be tag obviously the

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.020 
like is it going to be tag obviously the
Tag<00:04:19.680> Mode<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:19.919> dead<00:04:20.100> our<00:04:20.220> lives<00:04:20.400> it's<00:04:20.880> been

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
Tag Mode and dead our lives it's been

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.670 
Tag Mode and dead our lives it's been
there<00:04:21.150> for<00:04:21.299> a<00:04:21.329> while<00:04:21.479> yeah<00:04:21.660> but<00:04:21.810> is<00:04:21.930> it<00:04:21.959> I<00:04:22.229> asked

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
be in it there is going to be an online

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.629 
be in it there is going to be an online
component<00:04:27.180> but<00:04:27.720> they<00:04:27.810> did<00:04:27.960> not<00:04:27.990> elaborate

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
component but they did not elaborate

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.529 
component but they did not elaborate
those<00:04:29.639> are<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:29.789> only<00:04:29.910> two<00:04:30.120> things<00:04:30.300> i<00:04:30.479> could

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
those are the only two things i could

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:31.580 
those are the only two things i could
really<00:04:30.690> get<00:04:30.870> out<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.080> them<00:04:31.200> at<00:04:31.260> this<00:04:31.350> point

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
really get out of them at this point

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.770 
really get out of them at this point
obviously<00:04:32.160> the<00:04:32.250> game<00:04:32.400> still<00:04:32.669> has<00:04:32.700> a<00:04:32.970> ax<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.300> long

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
obviously the game still has a ax a long

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.120 
obviously the game still has a ax a long
ways<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.139> go<00:04:34.169> there<00:04:34.410> were<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.530> couple<00:04:34.680> of<00:04:35.010> the

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
ways to go there were a couple of the

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.710 
ways to go there were a couple of the
things<00:04:35.310> i<00:04:35.400> wanted<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:35.700> touch<00:04:35.850> on<00:04:36.060> about<00:04:36.510> the

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
things i wanted to touch on about the

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.960 
things i wanted to touch on about the
the<00:04:37.440> power<00:04:37.680> attacks<00:04:38.070> so<00:04:38.580> with<00:04:38.700> the<00:04:38.820> power

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
the power attacks so with the power

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.460 
the power attacks so with the power
attacks<00:04:39.270> this<00:04:39.389> is<00:04:39.570> the<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:40.020> move<00:04:40.169> that<00:04:40.200> you'll

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
attacks this is the the move that you'll

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.370 
attacks this is the the move that you'll
use<00:04:40.770> to<00:04:41.010> launch<00:04:41.190> people<00:04:41.610> into<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.360> wall<00:04:42.570> so

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
use to launch people into the wall so

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.320 
use to launch people into the wall so
when<00:04:44.100> you<00:04:44.190> go<00:04:44.310> to<00:04:44.370> do<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:44.700> you<00:04:44.820> basically<00:04:44.970> you

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
when you go to do it you basically you

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.000 
when you go to do it you basically you
like<00:04:45.539> wind<00:04:45.840> up<00:04:46.020> like<00:04:46.169> I'm<00:04:46.289> about<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:46.650> hit<00:04:46.770> you

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
like wind up like I'm about to hit you

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.040 
like wind up like I'm about to hit you
and<00:04:47.220> it<00:04:47.310> takes<00:04:47.550> like<00:04:47.820> a<00:04:47.880> half<00:04:48.150> second<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:48.780> then

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
and it takes like a half second and then

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.200 
and it takes like a half second and then
you<00:04:49.289> dash<00:04:49.860> forward<00:04:50.250> a<00:04:50.370> short<00:04:50.610> distance<00:04:50.820> and

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
you dash forward a short distance and

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.940 
you dash forward a short distance and
you<00:04:51.270> try<00:04:51.419> to<00:04:51.450> strike<00:04:51.810> them<00:04:52.080> so<00:04:52.650> there's<00:04:52.889> a

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
you try to strike them so there's a

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.110 
you try to strike them so there's a
delay<00:04:53.160> when<00:04:53.340> you<00:04:53.400> start<00:04:53.639> up<00:04:53.760> and<00:04:53.880> there's<00:04:54.060> a

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
delay when you start up and there's a

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.150 
delay when you start up and there's a
really<00:04:54.389> long<00:04:54.600> delay<00:04:54.900> if<00:04:55.080> you<00:04:55.229> will<00:04:55.530> and<00:04:55.830> it

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
really long delay if you will and it

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.800 
really long delay if you will and it
doesn't<00:04:56.460> travel<00:04:56.639> a<00:04:56.789> very<00:04:57.000> far<00:04:57.210> distance<00:04:57.240> so

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
doesn't travel a very far distance so

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.540 
doesn't travel a very far distance so
you<00:04:57.930> really<00:04:58.530> have<00:04:58.560> to<00:04:58.710> get<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.190> mind<00:04:59.400> your

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
you really have to get the mind your

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.730 
you really have to get the mind your
spacing<00:04:59.910> and<00:05:00.000> mind<00:05:00.180> your<00:05:00.270> timing<00:05:00.690> you<00:05:01.590> can

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
spacing and mind your timing you can

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.800 
spacing and mind your timing you can
cancel<00:05:01.979> out<00:05:02.400> of<00:05:02.430> this<00:05:02.580> by<00:05:02.970> side<00:05:03.270> stepping<00:05:03.570> up

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
cancel out of this by side stepping up

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.110 
cancel out of this by side stepping up
and<00:05:04.020> down<00:05:04.110> which<00:05:04.229> I<00:05:04.349> mentioned<00:05:04.410> earlier<00:05:04.710> um

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
and down which I mentioned earlier um

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.140 
and down which I mentioned earlier um
and<00:05:06.120> you<00:05:06.539> can<00:05:06.690> also<00:05:06.810> charge<00:05:07.200> it<00:05:07.440> longer<00:05:08.070> so<00:05:08.940> if

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
and you can also charge it longer so if

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.159 
and you can also charge it longer so if
you<00:05:09.240> want<00:05:09.419> to<00:05:09.479> try<00:05:09.599> to<00:05:09.660> mess<00:05:09.870> with<00:05:10.020> somebody's

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
you want to try to mess with somebody's

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:11.839 
you want to try to mess with somebody's
time<00:05:10.530> because<00:05:10.800> they<00:05:10.919> can<00:05:11.070> also<00:05:11.190> be<00:05:11.550> your

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
time because they can also be your

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:13.760 
time because they can also be your
opponent<00:05:12.240> can't<00:05:12.630> counterbid<00:05:13.169> I<00:05:13.229> think<00:05:13.590> most

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
opponent can't counterbid I think most

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.320 
opponent can't counterbid I think most
of<00:05:13.860> them<00:05:13.979> strike<00:05:14.220> minutes<00:05:14.580> and<00:05:14.820> you<00:05:15.210> can

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
of them strike minutes and you can

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.510 
of them strike minutes and you can
counter<00:05:15.630> somebody's<00:05:15.960> trying<00:05:16.229> to

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
counter somebody's trying to

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.070 
counter somebody's trying to
so<00:05:17.300> if<00:05:17.419> you're<00:05:17.509> on<00:05:17.569> the<00:05:17.629> offerings<00:05:17.960> you've

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
so if you're on the offerings you've

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.689 
so if you're on the offerings you've
been<00:05:18.169> charged<00:05:18.440> a<00:05:18.470> little<00:05:18.620> longer<00:05:18.919> try<00:05:19.460> to<00:05:19.520> pay

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 
been charged a little longer try to pay

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:22.869 
been charged a little longer try to pay
out<00:05:19.879> that<00:05:20.060> counter<00:05:20.419> you<00:05:21.080> can<00:05:21.229> also<00:05:21.379> block<00:05:22.250> via

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:22.879 
out that counter you can also block via

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.369 
out that counter you can also block via
the<00:05:23.090> power<00:05:23.330> tax<00:05:23.599> like<00:05:23.840> you<00:05:23.930> would<00:05:24.139> any<00:05:24.349> other

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:24.379 
the power tax like you would any other

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:26.740 
the power tax like you would any other
attack<00:05:24.770> and<00:05:25.030> as<00:05:26.030> far<00:05:26.150> as<00:05:26.210> I<00:05:26.330> can<00:05:26.389> tell<00:05:26.479> there's

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
attack and as far as I can tell there's

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.659 
attack and as far as I can tell there's
no<00:05:26.900> limit<00:05:27.409> on<00:05:27.530> how<00:05:27.620> many<00:05:27.830> times<00:05:28.129> you<00:05:28.310> can<00:05:28.460> light

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
no limit on how many times you can light

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.180 
no limit on how many times you can light
rail<00:05:29.000> or<00:05:29.509> just<00:05:30.020> use<00:05:30.199> a<00:05:30.229> power<00:05:30.500> attack<00:05:30.770> over<00:05:31.069> and

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
rail or just use a power attack over and

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.580 
rail or just use a power attack over and
over<00:05:31.280> again<00:05:31.460> but<00:05:31.909> again<00:05:32.150> it's<00:05:32.330> very<00:05:32.389> it<00:05:33.349> can<00:05:33.500> be

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
over again but again it's very it can be

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.770 
over again but again it's very it can be
very<00:05:33.620> unsafe<00:05:34.280> you<00:05:34.819> can<00:05:34.940> just<00:05:35.150> family<00:05:35.539> I<00:05:35.629> mean

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
very unsafe you can just family I mean

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.029 
very unsafe you can just family I mean
that's<00:05:35.870> kind<00:05:36.169> of<00:05:36.259> been<00:05:36.409> the<00:05:36.500> thing<00:05:36.680> about<00:05:36.889> the

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
that's kind of been the thing about the

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:38.290 
that's kind of been the thing about the
dead<00:05:37.190> or<00:05:37.280> alive<00:05:37.460> series<00:05:37.849> that<00:05:38.000> you<00:05:38.120> can

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
dead or alive series that you can

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.390 
dead or alive series that you can
totally<00:05:38.599> just<00:05:38.960> spam<00:05:39.229> stuff<00:05:39.650> like<00:05:39.919> I<00:05:39.949> mean<00:05:40.250> you

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
totally just spam stuff like I mean you

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.350 
totally just spam stuff like I mean you
could<00:05:40.520> span<00:05:40.729> counters<00:05:41.120> you<00:05:41.180> could<00:05:41.270> do<00:05:41.330> all

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
could span counters you could do all

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.029 
could span counters you could do all
that<00:05:41.509> stuff<00:05:41.659> but<00:05:41.870> the<00:05:42.110> you<00:05:42.620> know<00:05:42.740> there's

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.490 
that stuff but the you know there's
usually<00:05:43.159> some<00:05:43.520> risk<00:05:43.789> in<00:05:44.030> doing<00:05:44.090> so<00:05:44.599> one<00:05:45.259> thing

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
usually some risk in doing so one thing

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.619 
usually some risk in doing so one thing
that<00:05:45.560> a<00:05:45.800> I<00:05:46.280> wanted<00:05:46.819> to<00:05:46.879> mention<00:05:47.090> that<00:05:47.240> kind<00:05:47.539> of

a wall and the cameras like up alongside

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.279 
a wall and the cameras like up alongside
the<00:06:22.639> wall<00:06:22.819> and<00:06:22.940> it's<00:06:23.090> not<00:06:23.240> pointed<00:06:23.630> upwards<00:06:23.990> so

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
the wall and it's not pointed upwards so

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:26.050 
the wall and it's not pointed upwards so
they<00:06:24.710> can<00:06:24.889> kind<00:06:25.009> of<00:06:25.130> just<00:06:25.190> fall<00:06:25.610> in<00:06:25.789> very

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
they can kind of just fall in very

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.640 
they can kind of just fall in very
quickly<00:06:26.300> from<00:06:26.539> out<00:06:26.690> of<00:06:26.810> frame<00:06:27.020> and<00:06:27.289> they

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
quickly from out of frame and they

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.200 
quickly from out of frame and they
basically<00:06:27.949> come<00:06:28.310> down<00:06:28.490> right<00:06:28.699> on<00:06:28.789> top<00:06:28.819> of<00:06:29.030> you
