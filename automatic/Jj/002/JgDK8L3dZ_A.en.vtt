00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.780 
its really nice as well it's a little
bit<00:03:05.989> heavier<00:03:06.410> than<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:07.010> hair<00:03:07.430> cream<00:03:08.110> though

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
bit heavier than the hair cream though

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.470 
bit heavier than the hair cream though
and<00:03:10.790> then<00:03:11.410> this<00:03:12.410> is<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.680> hair<00:03:13.010> nectar<00:03:13.459> um<00:03:13.910> I

like<00:04:50.750> okay<00:04:51.229> I<00:04:51.260> guess<00:04:51.590> well<00:04:52.460> don't<00:04:52.669> work<00:04:52.880> that

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060
