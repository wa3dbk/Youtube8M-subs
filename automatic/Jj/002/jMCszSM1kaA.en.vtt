00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.240
 very good everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:06.280
 video on this occasion then on the 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.100
 celebration of the lunar delight that is a 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.560
 date that usually is usually 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.990
 celebrate in the justice camps of the 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.640
 league of legends and I think I remember if not 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.039
 I remember badly that it has something to do with 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.380
 the chinese new year or so do not make me 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.050
 very much, but I think it has something 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.820
 see with that and well let's see then in 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.830
 what is this year based on that of the 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.590
 Reading terminal is a test 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.970
 time in which then you can win 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.649
 free icons will also be like 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.449
 aspects of guardians aspects of 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.890
 champions etcetera etcetera 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:38.109
 except so let's see it all a 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.589
 little bit above and explain some 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:43.479
 points that you think interesting 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:45.639
 well here you see also also in January 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:47.530
 text etcetera we are not going to give much 

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:50.350
 case we're just going to go to the second 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.819
 point that would be this choose your way or 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.920
 well what is this 

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:56.049
 here as you can see we can choose three 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.940
 icons in the cone of power the truth 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:00.680
 and that of freedom and more or less makes you 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.920
 a summary birria 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.810
 what is each icon more or less about 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.580
 you can do a whim and here then 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.740
 We can login to vote for 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.960
 what is this for what the fuck are we? 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.760
 matter we vote this garbage the 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.060
 vote ends on February 11 as well 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.080
 If you want to vote for AndrÃ© with an eye 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.729
 simply this is a vote that is 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.890
 does for the servers that is to say is 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.900
 something personal about you but you go around and 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.290
 what else the server votes in my case 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.000
 for Eastern Europe and then as the 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.790
 final will be the icon that they give you is to say 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.740
 If everything is decided to vote for power 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.140
 then when the voting ends 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.910
 will most likely give your icon 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.380
 power but if they vote freedom then 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.940
 freedom if you vote true then truth what 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.160
 that more what the server so it's something 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.810
 that you contribute a little your vote but 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.729
 will really win the most 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.020
 let's continue with the third point which is 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.670
 the way of the warrior and these are the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.579
 icons that we can get in this 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.939
 period of time of lunar delight are 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.130
 four icons and you are watching them and 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.079
 we can follow and each one doing 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.720
 different things first of all the 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.369
 first icon that would be this the fan 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.509
 that you see up here the only thing that 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.479
 we have to do is it is simply 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.099
 win a match match 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.769
 during the duration of the internal 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.239
 so you do not have much heading 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.340
 we specify so I understand that it is 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.110
 anyone we win and we have the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.690
 first icon the second icon 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.940
 it's just that we fight in two 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.190
 match matches in the crack 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.500
 of invoker here follows a little more 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.500
 Attentive you do not have to earn simply that 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.030
 play a couple of games with him in 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.340
 the map of the summoner's crack and 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.970
 we will get the second icon which is 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.799
 flame kingdoms faced tc the icon 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.090
 it's already to play as a team ie 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.319
 you have to invite someone because you 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.239
 says use your help 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.040
 companions and the only thing that has to 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.739
 do 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.200
 play two games either in the forest 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.700
 twisted the glass scar during 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.069
 The festival is planto weeks 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.040
 last the temita this the light 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.659
 leonard then played a couple of games 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.489
 in the forest or the scar what 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.829
 prefer jce and you will get what you 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.540
 icon called a target moon 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.019
 they have made an icon for each skin that goes 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.760
 to take out here you see it and finally that is 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.739
 also a team icon that is called 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.079
 fight for the freedom of zero ctz 3 that 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.639
 play with your two partners 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.049
 matching matches and this one would be 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.450
 in right now of the laments and say 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.459
 a great one and I would get out with no 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.439
 knock down and tear it down with the 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.150
 dragon these are the four icons that 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:29.569
 we can get as you see are pretty 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.970
 easy you do not need to pay any kind of 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.340
 risk in making gifts gifts friends 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.930
 which is what we are used to 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.870
 in Christmas times and the whole subject this 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.540
 it's totally free and we're going to go through 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.689
 another point 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.250
 we come to the point of the aspects each 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.599
 icon as we have said make reference 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.840
 one aspect and here we have put the 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:52.090
 we just have up on dragon's sheet 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.709
 we have a diana lunar goddess that you see 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.120
 and here we have 30,000 kingdoms 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.680
 confronted if we want to see then 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.260
 we will return here to the play and mediamos a 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.659
 little what each aspect does but 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.269
 as it is the case, yes, because he wants 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:06.910
 Curious to be curious 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.310
 look for more information 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.350
 then they will also draw some aspects 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.390
 umbrella that this I suppose since yes 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.490
 that will cost little money 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.070
 immediately from riet coins since 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.830
 we have then those of 2003 and since 2014 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.450
 basically they are pretty similar and 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.500
 I really do not think I'll waste even a 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:29.680
 just hard to buy such atrocity 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.300
 in sight because there's a lot of respect already 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.280
 to water if I do not think it's the 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.840
 yours and they are free because box or by 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.910
 of course we will use it but if you are 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.320
 of paying personally I'm not going to 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:43.810
 spend not one euro in on this one in these 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.720
 aspects and finally the only thing we see 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.890
 since they are the typical ones asking what 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.740
 is that I told you you walk that you 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.990
 explain that you see for the subject of 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.580
 servers and so on and so forth and so on 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.580
 here we see more things 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.680
 but let's go little more than comment 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.719
 the aspects of the icons sorry that 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.370
 say yes no 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:07.259
 when you finish the game then you have 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.930
 than wait for a period of three days 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:12.000
 maximum at which they will begin to assign 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.310
 the icons depends on the game mode that 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.569
 you have played the whole subject and nothing 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.610
 put more than add I hope that you 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:19.139
 everything is more or less clear 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.419
 referring to the front nar if you have 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.189
 Do you have any questions? 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.750
 you can leave a comment 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:26.520
 you know we started the video with a 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.770
 I like it and if you do not want to realize them 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.300
 you see him fuck so it's all a 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.300
 greeting and until next time
