not<00:04:11.760> as<00:04:11.940> safe<00:04:12.530> and<00:04:13.530> you're<00:04:13.740> already<00:04:13.890> doing

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
not as safe and you're already doing

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.530 
not as safe and you're already doing
something<00:04:14.490> that's<00:04:14.640> not<00:04:14.820> that<00:04:14.880> safe<00:04:15.210> to<00:04:15.330> begin

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
something that's not that safe to begin

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.840 
something that's not that safe to begin
with<00:04:15.690> so<00:04:16.500> that's<00:04:16.890> why<00:04:17.040> most<00:04:17.250> people<00:04:17.459> don't

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850
