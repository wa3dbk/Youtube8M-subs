for a very long time um there's a lot of

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.550 
for a very long time um there's a lot of
reasons<00:02:13.170> why

reasons why

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.130 
reasons why
this<00:02:13.770> first<00:02:14.220> but<00:02:15.090> weakness<00:02:15.360> in<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.750> mining

the actual metals themselves have held
up<00:02:25.200> pretty<00:02:25.349> well<00:02:25.470> but<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.800> miners<00:02:26.190> have<00:02:26.310> been

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
up pretty well but the miners have been

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.400 
up pretty well but the miners have been
getting<00:02:26.700> hit<00:02:26.849> selling<00:02:27.330> off<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.510> lot<00:02:27.750> that's

getting hit selling off a lot that's
almost<00:02:28.770> always<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.520> sign<00:02:29.849> that<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:30.120> raid<00:02:30.390> is

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569

that<00:03:02.910> is<00:03:03.180> almost<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.720> be<00:03:03.840> expected<00:03:03.870> that<00:03:04.560> is

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
that is almost to be expected that is

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.380 
that is almost to be expected that is
what<00:03:04.860> i<00:03:04.890> expect<00:03:05.489> that<00:03:05.549> would<00:03:05.790> be<00:03:05.910> part<00:03:06.239> of<00:03:06.269> the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
what i expect that would be part of the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.020 
what i expect that would be part of the
game<00:03:06.599> plan<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:06.930> we've<00:03:07.230> seen<00:03:07.410> all<00:03:07.590> year

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
game plan that we've seen all year

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.300 
game plan that we've seen all year
however<00:03:09.030> i<00:03:09.360> don't<00:03:09.900> think<00:03:10.349> this<00:03:10.709> rate<00:03:11.040> even

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
however i don't think this rate even

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.620 
however i don't think this rate even
though<00:03:11.489> it<00:03:11.670> will<00:03:11.790> probably<00:03:12.030> be<00:03:12.180> very<00:03:12.269> well

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
though it will probably be very well

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.990 
though it will probably be very well
planned<00:03:12.870> out<00:03:13.080> very<00:03:13.410> aggressive<00:03:13.920> is<00:03:14.459> one<00:03:14.819> that

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
planned out very aggressive is one that

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000 
planned out very aggressive is one that
will<00:03:15.090> last<00:03:15.360> long<00:03:16.049> at<00:03:16.200> all<00:03:16.290> so<00:03:16.530> i<00:03:16.560> will<00:03:16.860> be

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
will last long at all so i will be

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.970 
will last long at all so i will be
buying<00:03:17.810> tomorrow<00:03:18.810> if<00:03:19.049> there<00:03:19.260> is<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.410> big<00:03:19.739> raid

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
buying tomorrow if there is a big raid

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.710 
buying tomorrow if there is a big raid
and<00:03:20.220> i<00:03:20.280> think<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.579> big<00:03:20.760> when<00:03:20.940> I'd<00:03:21.030> say<00:03:21.359> be<00:03:21.510> great

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
and i think a big when I'd say be great

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.599 
and i think a big when I'd say be great
i<00:03:21.750> mean<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.200> know<00:03:22.230> gold<00:03:22.590> down<00:03:22.799> at<00:03:23.070> least<00:03:23.190> fifty

consolidation and the fundamentals of

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.300 
consolidation and the fundamentals of
course<00:03:39.690> couldn't<00:03:39.959> be<00:03:40.079> better<00:03:40.500> particularly

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
course couldn't be better particularly

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.080

with<00:03:42.079> what<00:03:43.079> looks<00:03:43.290> like<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.680> be<00:03:43.799> a<00:03:43.829> big<00:03:44.519> easing

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090

with what looks like to be a big easing
coming<00:03:45.750> from<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.139> ECB<00:03:46.799> potentially<00:03:47.730> next

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
coming from the ECB potentially next

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.910 
coming from the ECB potentially next
week<00:03:48.269> so<00:03:48.540> that<00:03:48.569> that's<00:03:48.989> my<00:03:49.260> game<00:03:49.500> plan<00:03:49.709> on<00:03:49.889> a

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
week so that that's my game plan on a

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.879 
week so that that's my game plan on a
big<00:03:50.160> raid<00:03:50.400> um<00:03:50.930> even<00:03:51.930> potentially<00:03:52.590> more

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
big raid um even potentially more

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.710 
big raid um even potentially more
interesting<00:03:53.459> though<00:03:53.639> is<00:03:53.670> if<00:03:54.060> there<00:03:54.239> isn't<00:03:54.630> a

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
interesting though is if there isn't a

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.990 
interesting though is if there isn't a
big<00:03:54.870> raid<00:03:55.079> tomorrow<00:03:55.319> and<00:03:55.739> that<00:03:56.639> would<00:03:56.790> be<00:03:56.910> even

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
big raid tomorrow and that would be even

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.150 
big raid tomorrow and that would be even
more<00:03:57.150> telling<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:57.959> me<00:03:58.109> because<00:03:58.350> that<00:03:58.889> would

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
more telling to me because that would

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.400 
more telling to me because that would
say<00:03:59.400> that<00:03:59.639> the<00:03:59.819> game<00:04:00.359> plan<00:04:00.720> is<00:04:00.780> sort<00:04:01.319> of

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
say that the game plan is sort of

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.069 
say that the game plan is sort of
changed<00:04:02.010> or<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.579> control<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.389> some<00:04:03.600> degree<00:04:03.810> at

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
changed or the control to some degree at

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.250 
changed or the control to some degree at
these<00:04:04.230> prices<00:04:04.590> has<00:04:04.950> been<00:04:05.130> lost<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.959> and<00:04:06.959> the

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
these prices has been lost and and the

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.160 
these prices has been lost and and the
and<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.590> you<00:04:08.430> know<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.700> powers<00:04:09.510> that<00:04:09.540> be<00:04:09.720> are

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
and the you know the powers that be are

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.259 
and the you know the powers that be are
essentially<00:04:10.889> resigned<00:04:11.579> to<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:11.850> fact<00:04:11.880> they

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
essentially resigned to the fact they

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.879 
essentially resigned to the fact they
need<00:04:12.480> to<00:04:12.630> allow<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.019> precious<00:04:13.470> metal<00:04:13.709> markets

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
need to allow the precious metal markets

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.410 
need to allow the precious metal markets
to<00:04:14.340> move<00:04:14.519> up<00:04:14.700> much<00:04:14.910> higher<00:04:14.940> in<00:04:15.239> price<00:04:15.389> from

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
to move up much higher in price from

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.750 
to move up much higher in price from
here<00:04:15.810> before<00:04:16.260> probably<00:04:16.709> defending<00:04:17.459> a<00:04:17.579> much

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
here before probably defending a much

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.569 
here before probably defending a much
higher<00:04:17.910> price<00:04:18.150> so<00:04:18.479> um<00:04:18.840> so<00:04:19.560> you<00:04:20.280> know<00:04:20.310> in<00:04:20.519> a

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
higher price so um so you know in a

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.190 
higher price so um so you know in a
nutshell<00:04:20.789> I<00:04:21.209> would<00:04:21.329> expect<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.870> big<00:04:21.959> raid

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
nutshell I would expect a big raid

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.740 
nutshell I would expect a big raid
that's<00:04:22.680> what<00:04:23.010> all<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.210> signs<00:04:24.419> are<00:04:24.570> pointing

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
that's what all the signs are pointing

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.210 
that's what all the signs are pointing
to<00:04:25.020> that<00:04:25.229> would<00:04:25.380> be<00:04:25.470> consistent<00:04:25.800> what<00:04:26.070> we've

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
to that would be consistent what we've

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.510 
to that would be consistent what we've
seen

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
seen

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.960 
seen
sheer<00:04:26.759> and<00:04:27.000> I<00:04:27.180> would<00:04:27.330> be<00:04:27.539> buying<00:04:27.870> it<00:04:28.139> tomorrow

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
sheer and I would be buying it tomorrow

pretty<00:04:29.970> aggressively<00:04:30.710> even<00:04:31.710> some<00:04:31.860> of<00:04:31.889> the

stocks on minors if that happens but

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.149

even<00:04:35.699> more<00:04:35.849> importantly<00:04:36.409> if<00:04:37.409> you<00:04:37.590> don't<00:04:37.919> see

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:38.159 
even more importantly if you don't see

even more importantly if you don't see
that<00:04:38.190> big<00:04:38.490> raid<00:04:38.699> and<00:04:38.909> if<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.090> metals<00:04:39.330> are

that big raid and if the metals are

that big raid and if the metals are

strong sort of no matter what Bernanke

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.059 
strong sort of no matter what Bernanke
says<00:04:41.580> then<00:04:42.240> then<00:04:42.870> I<00:04:42.900> think<00:04:43.229> you<00:04:43.409> would<00:04:43.710> have<00:04:43.889> to

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
says then then I think you would have to

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.119 
says then then I think you would have to
say<00:04:44.250> that<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:45.330> precious<00:04:46.169> metals<00:04:46.590> markets<00:04:46.979> are

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:47.129 
say that the precious metals markets are

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:49.520 
say that the precious metals markets are
aren't<00:04:47.400> as<00:04:47.819> sort<00:04:48.000> of<00:04:48.060> different<00:04:48.539> phase<00:04:49.080> than

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
aren't as sort of different phase than

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.510 
aren't as sort of different phase than
they've<00:04:49.680> been<00:04:49.710> for<00:04:50.069> the<00:04:50.129> last<00:04:50.250> year<00:04:50.490> of

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
they've been for the last year of

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.369 
they've been for the last year of
consolidation<00:04:51.000> which<00:04:51.539> would<00:04:51.690> be<00:04:51.780> extremely

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:52.379 
consolidation which would be extremely

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:55.100 
consolidation which would be extremely
bullish<00:04:52.860> on<00:04:53.220> so<00:04:54.060> let's<00:04:54.300> wait<00:04:54.449> and<00:04:54.599> see<00:04:54.690> I<00:04:54.960> hope

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
bullish on so let's wait and see I hope

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.050
