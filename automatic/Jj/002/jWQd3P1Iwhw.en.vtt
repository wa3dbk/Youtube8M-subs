00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello everyone and in this video I want 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.799
 talk about feeders 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:11.759
 because the better the feeder the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.130
 more economical bird content will be released because 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.730
 what will they scatter the roots will 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.800
 depends precisely on the feeders and to approach 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.590
 choosing a feeder you should seriously 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.859
 buy a bad feeder they will eat 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.570
 feed gooid scattered you will when 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.859
 diapers change this chickens accordingly 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.740
 throw back 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.590
 give or no meaning because this 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.500
 pocket of mixed goods droppings and it's too much 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.770
 bacteria and so that the chicken does not get sick and 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.290
 then about soldering them not to unsolder 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.530
 better buy a normal feeder with 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.559
 which they will not be able to throw out feed 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.559
 when they eat and can not, respectively 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.460
 get there wheezing because if 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.800
 laying hens 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.359
 you keep it like this 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.809
 chickens they like to go wild 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.969
 accordingly I want you 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.619
 demonstrate i don't know how 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.140
 called this feeder 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:13.770
 i don't remember because of how much we bought but 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.020
 within 20 hryvnia if our not if not 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.990
 am wrong 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.390
 so you can find a similar 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.509
 Type I, in turn, can say 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.820
 that the feeders of this type are very excellent 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.229
 copes with its task independently 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.280
 age of chicken 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.530
 even though she is small or big she 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.310
 copes with its tasks on a hundred 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.310
 percent 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:44.520
 compound feed if u somehow somehow 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.850
 thrown from the feeder it 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.909
 happens in very small quantities 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.350
 just insignificant well you can now 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.580
 give us how they eat 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:00.390
 anegri boots and roots are thrown away 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:04.260
 neatly bounces off the walls itself 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:09.450
 feeders and gets back to them she from 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.950
 removable if you need to wash it 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.110
 clean and imagine 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.600
 if the pebble was such that it was 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.870
 they would immediately have climbed the whole 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:23.490
 no one would eat it 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:28.770
 were hungry therefore saved and pasted 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:32.040
 I believe the ribs given type of feeders 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.250
 very excellent for young stock 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.950
 and growing birds but up to a month 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.200
 accordingly the higher 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.010
 the hen the more she than she more 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.860
 is growing 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.090
 there is an answer to the big feed and the right one and 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.060
 when you already now we have her carmen on 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.920
 additives that is compound feed but then 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.370
 when will you start making your own 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:01.440
 mixed fodders with participation for 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:04.530
 corn and wheat and barley you have not 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.800
 will be able to handle this trough 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.900
 tasks because they will need 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.959
 more feeders already bunker type 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.620
 which I will also tell in the following 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.850
 my videos so i think that for you 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.860
 gave useful information
