00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
said was that there is not going to be

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.520 
said was that there is not going to be
well<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.660> didn't<00:00:36.930> say<00:00:37.020> there<00:00:37.170> was<00:00:37.290> not<00:00:37.500> going

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
well it didn't say there was not going

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.139 
well it didn't say there was not going
to<00:00:37.680> be<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> hut<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:38.520> there<00:00:38.700> isn't<00:00:38.940> going<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.090> be

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
to be a hut but there isn't going to be

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.750 
to be a hut but there isn't going to be
quite<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:39.989> auctions<00:00:40.620> or<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.040> fact<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.399> market

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
quite the auctions or in fact the market

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.830 
quite the auctions or in fact the market
of<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.879> hut<00:00:42.090> which<00:00:42.239> doesn't<00:00:42.570> really<00:00:42.629> make

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
of the hut which doesn't really make

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.200 
of the hut which doesn't really make
sense<00:00:43.010> there<00:00:44.010> has<00:00:44.160> been<00:00:44.190> some<00:00:44.579> speculation

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
sense there has been some speculation

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.180 
sense there has been some speculation
that<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.360> was<00:00:45.570> due<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:46.020> those<00:00:46.890> who<00:00:47.100> were

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
that it was due to those who were

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.020 
that it was due to those who were
farming<00:00:47.700> pox<00:00:48.030> or<00:00:48.379> scamming<00:00:49.379> or<00:00:49.500> whatever<00:00:49.680> but

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
farming pox or scamming or whatever but

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.869 
farming pox or scamming or whatever but
the<00:00:51.030> article<00:00:51.360> stated<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.230> lot<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.250> how<00:00:53.699> they're

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the article stated a lot of how they're

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.450 
the article stated a lot of how they're
taking<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.620> auctioning<00:00:55.620> out<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
taking the auctioning out and the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.060 
taking the auctioning out and the
trading<00:00:56.879> out<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.239> cards<00:00:57.719> which<00:00:58.289> doesn't

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
trading out of cards which doesn't

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.950 
trading out of cards which doesn't
really<00:00:59.160> make<00:00:59.399> much<00:00:59.460> sense<00:00:59.730> but<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.840> can

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
really make much sense but as you can

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.020 
really make much sense but as you can
see<00:01:01.199> from<00:01:01.379> some<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.739> these<00:01:01.800> tweets<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.789> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
see from some of these tweets this is a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.260 
see from some of these tweets this is a
real<00:01:03.420> thing<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.580> tweeted<00:01:05.580> right<00:01:05.939> off<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
real thing that I tweeted right off the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.859 
real thing that I tweeted right off the
bat<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.479> everyone<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:07.860> believed<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.820> JB<00:01:09.689> and

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
bat that everyone just believed a JB and

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.560 
bat that everyone just believed a JB and
I<00:01:09.960> we<00:01:10.380> tweeted<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:10.920> out<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.460> everyone<00:01:12.150> fell

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
I we tweeted this out and everyone fell

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.429 
I we tweeted this out and everyone fell
for<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.960> hard<00:01:13.670> I<00:01:14.670> don't<00:01:15.630> understand<00:01:16.110> how<00:01:16.259> this

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
for it hard I don't understand how this

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.870 
for it hard I don't understand how this
would<00:01:16.560> make<00:01:16.740> sense<00:01:16.979> at<00:01:17.220> all<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.460> how<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.670> guys

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
would make sense at all on how you guys

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.580 
would make sense at all on how you guys
would<00:01:18.150> believe<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.720> if<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.110> was<00:01:19.290> coming

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
would believe this if this was coming

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.910 
would believe this if this was coming
from<00:01:19.740> us<00:01:20.570> amenia<00:01:21.570> was<00:01:21.750> believable<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.409> we

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
from us amenia was believable that we
