 me package wrapped another package wrapped from 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.680
 tinydeal and this is our small should 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.920
 be quadcopter but quadric unusual 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.320
 uneasy let's open i when 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.670
 I ordered to be honest although I myself did not 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.620
 I realized that I ordered but order 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.300
 ordered and get it turns out that 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.020
 inexpensive link you can parcel 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.320
 can see the price and come it 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.320
 tinydeal secret affairs tinydeal and what 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.500
 the difference he came in 19 days 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.230
 like a man in the direction that's so small 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.590
 box on it, in principle, you can immediately 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.690
 see why I already ordered it 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.239
 paid me outraged 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.690
 here it is written iphone control 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.030
 there must be controlled from the phone 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.380
 let's support Wi fi 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.409
 Let's look at the model with the model so not by the way. 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.869
 remember and the model from the manufacturer so 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:25.080
 model cx 30w 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:28.829
 ha ha here's a quadric here 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.270
 cool what's interesting even 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.350
 I don't know what it is 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:38.729
 and this is wi-fi antenna that's what wai 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:47.390
 fay antenna camera most likely on ex 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:47.390
 at 0 3 megapixels here we have 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:57.620
 here we have a charge and 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:01.030
 spare screw set 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.430
 so there is nothing else here with us 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.050
 user manual 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:11.390
 iphone ipad 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:18.890
 control applications from the apple store 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:23.390
 and here such application is called aha 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:27.040
 This is with dad when flying you need here 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.330
 This antenna is like this post 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:34.640
 it's cool to see the signal 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:39.530
 better to post here and so 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:43.940
 we have like the type supposedly managed 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:47.540
 what utility and where and what to do to 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:51.290
 Unfortunately I did not have an iphone 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.350
 sometime now no but for testing 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.110
 i will ask my friend for leh 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.670
 which did the installation for me 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.910
 test banks 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.299
 he has an iphone he will come to me and 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:09.500
 we'll run test it here 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:11.980
 here we are disconnected and this is here 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.519
 there is even a battery compartment 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.110
 that is, the battery is connected 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:22.730
 before it can be charged and in principle 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:27.350
 pull out such a light battery 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.720
 we are 700 milliamps 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.950
 Well, since wi-fi I think consumption 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:37.400
 principle tangible enough so here 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.730
 so here is such a small little wai 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.880
 fi with bukovkoy x 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.150
 quadric here is cool so straight 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.340
 so interesting cute 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.890
 quadcopter on the review will definitely be 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.959
 iphone and we will definitely test 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.450
