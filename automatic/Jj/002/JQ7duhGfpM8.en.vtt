you<00:00:58.210> know<00:00:58.300> from<00:00:58.450> architectural<00:00:59.050> speak<00:00:59.380> and

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
you know from architectural speak and

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.520 
you know from architectural speak and
it's<00:01:00.250> really<00:01:00.520> a<00:01:00.640> winged<00:01:01.239> plane<00:01:01.540> that<00:01:01.960> is<00:01:02.170> it<00:01:02.380> is

it's really a winged plane that is it is
coming<00:01:02.800> off<00:01:03.070> of<00:01:03.100> the<00:01:03.370> teardrop<00:01:03.880> greenhouse

and<00:01:04.960> wrapping<00:01:05.409> over<00:01:05.590> and<00:01:05.979> what<00:01:06.130> that<00:01:06.280> does<00:01:06.490> is

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
and wrapping over and what that does is

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.580 
and wrapping over and what that does is
it<00:01:06.880> actually<00:01:07.210> accelerates<00:01:07.570> airflow<00:01:08.409> and

it actually accelerates airflow and
cleans<00:01:08.860> airflow<00:01:09.310> at<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:09.549> rear<00:01:09.729> of<00:01:09.759> the<00:01:09.880> car<00:01:10.180> to

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
cleans airflow at the rear of the car to

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:12.780 
cleans airflow at the rear of the car to
allow<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.590> car<00:01:11.829> to<00:01:11.920> have<00:01:12.009> greater<00:01:12.310> high<00:01:12.490> speed

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
allow the car to have greater high speed

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.790 
allow the car to have greater high speed
stability<00:01:13.000> without<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:14.020> penalty<00:01:14.380> of<00:01:14.470> drag
