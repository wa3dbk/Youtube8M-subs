00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.130 
on class again and type header click OK
and<00:02:15.610> now<00:02:16.240> we're<00:02:16.450> not<00:02:16.540> going<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.780> put<00:02:16.959> any

and now we're not going to put any
information<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.770> this<00:02:17.890> because<00:02:18.310> in<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.700> later

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
information to this because in a later

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.570 
information to this because in a later
episode<00:02:19.510> where<00:02:20.050> we<00:02:20.200> put<00:02:20.830> their<00:02:21.010> header<00:02:21.220> image

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
episode where we put their header image

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.250 
episode where we put their header image
in<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:22.180> will<00:02:22.270> automatically<00:02:22.840> adjust<00:02:23.110> the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
in that will automatically adjust the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.780 
in that will automatically adjust the
size<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:23.830> so<00:02:24.069> we<00:02:24.190> don't<00:02:24.370> need<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:24.610> touch

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
size of it so we don't need to touch

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.619 
size of it so we don't need to touch
that<00:02:25.030> but<00:02:25.480> that's<00:02:25.600> basically<00:02:25.810> your<00:02:26.020> header

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
that but that's basically your header

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.720 
that but that's basically your header
now<00:02:28.349> we're<00:02:28.499> going<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.709> do<00:02:28.829> the<00:02:29.010> same<00:02:29.219> thing<00:02:29.489> but

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
now we're going to do the same thing but

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.239 
now we're going to do the same thing but
for<00:02:30.030> content<00:02:30.689> so<00:02:31.049> that's<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.499> main<00:02:31.799> bit<00:02:32.010> well

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:32.249 
for content so that's the main bit well

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:35.869 
for content so that's the main bit well
this<00:02:32.760> information<00:02:33.450> will<00:02:34.170> go<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.700> we're<00:02:35.819> gonna

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
this information will go so we're gonna

padding we will put the temp so this is

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.610 
padding we will put the temp so this is
where<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.329> phone<00:02:48.659> will<00:02:48.870> be<00:02:48.900> right<00:02:49.260> at<00:02:49.469> get

where the phone will be right at get

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.050 
where the phone will be right at get
won't<00:02:49.799> be<00:02:49.920> right<00:02:50.129> against<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.519> side<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.790> this

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
won't be right against the side of this

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.390 
won't be right against the side of this
thing<00:02:51.359> but<00:02:51.540> we'll<00:02:51.689> have<00:02:51.840> like<00:02:52.049> 10<00:02:52.620> pixels<00:02:53.129> in

now<00:03:32.000> we're<00:03:32.180> actually<00:03:32.240> gonna<00:03:32.510> input<00:03:33.050> these

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
now we're actually gonna input these

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.949 
now we're actually gonna input these
tacks<00:03:34.040> as<00:03:34.520> you<00:03:34.700> call<00:03:34.850> it<00:03:34.970> as<00:03:35.209> we<00:03:35.360> created<00:03:35.780> these

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
tacks as you call it as we created these

dip taxes alone into our content and the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.559 
dip taxes alone into our content and the
easiest<00:03:39.770> way<00:03:39.920> to<00:03:39.950> do<00:03:40.190> this<00:03:40.220> is<00:03:40.790> in<00:03:41.209> the<00:03:41.330> code

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
easiest way to do this is in the code

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.930 
easiest way to do this is in the code
tab<00:03:41.840> so<00:03:42.770> it<00:03:42.890> might<00:03:43.040> seem<00:03:43.220> complicated<00:03:43.340> but<00:03:43.760> you

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
tab so it might seem complicated but you

up<00:05:40.720> there<00:05:40.930> central<00:05:41.410> and<00:05:41.560> it<00:05:41.650> works<00:05:41.830> we're<00:05:42.100> just

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
up there central and it works we're just

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.200 
up there central and it works we're just
gonna<00:05:42.400> drag<00:05:42.700> this<00:05:42.850> about<00:05:43.530> and<00:05:44.850> it<00:05:45.850> does<00:05:46.030> work

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
gonna drag this about and it does work

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.850
