00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 clear 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.880
 in the defensive part the defensive tactic 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.060
 was never my forte but through my experience inside football 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.200
 talking to defenders with coaches 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.810
 I tried to adapt myself, I tried to be aware of a better positioning 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.810
 of a defense 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.080
 let's say that this would be the defensive part of kashima with a clinton action left 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.219
 a little with the new 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:21.050
 The gaia the condor puppet judge 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.050
 I am practically the basis of the first phase 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.900
 I always wanted to defend myself 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.050
 with seven players did not want 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.780
 eight new players holy setpes accustom with 7 leaving 3 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.440
 players in front of us also had a greater possibility of 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.370
 counterattack 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.990
 where there is no ball here on the other side right 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.250
 what came out 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.980
 the left-back ball 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.680
 the rabbit had already said here the institute 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.520
 the second had been working here that I was closing 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.980
 round here the saints coming back here 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.450
 but what is the intention and intention is to block all your entry here? 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.880
 practice an opponent on the internet here 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.960
 try to reduce the maximum 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.209
 the spaces 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.049
 that stay near the goal 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.270
 Ball coming here has an onion topping coming 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.429
 Here is the coverage. 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:17.379
 this last month lock 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.309
 so that no one gets in the face of the sea 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:23.089
 who had the opportunity to watch the punishment games 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:24.639
 it was a little less 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.650
 of players entering with the ball dominated
