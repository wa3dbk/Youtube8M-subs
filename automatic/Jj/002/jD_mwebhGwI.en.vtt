00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:13.230
 hello me sweet eggplant 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.940
 today I come back with a farmhouse and I know that 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.940
 in each video or a hair color 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.000
 different but have patience in d one 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.460
 will come back very soon we return to the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.740
 so sterile answer questions from 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.550
 you made me under the photo of 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.340
 instagram and i won't even try to 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.660
 pronounce your names because it will fail 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:41.190
 miserably and nothing we start chocolate 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.760
 white or black absolutely white too 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.440
 smear with the hairpin I think it is 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.390
 however chocolate is white 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.070
 melting 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.090
 and hand in how many years the first color you 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.480
 I adore 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:01.850
 thank you remember that my mother was 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.590
 absolutely opposed to getting me dyed 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.630
 the hair in fact to get used to the idea 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.420
 begins with a shadow effect of then of 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.320
 take off clearer than my natural color 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.150
 and okay then the hair is 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:21.619
 magically transformed the thousand colors 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:26.899
 but all in all the purple I like everything 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:30.200
 still ruth hedgehog if I wasn't 13 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:36.020
 years because the sheep grazes and the caterpillar 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:38.660
 no sheep the sea greetings but okay me 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.160
 I want to answer you with another question 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:46.310
 screws create existential disturbances o 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:51.040
 doubts to wring out anyway where he has 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:54.229
 put his maurizio neck 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.240
 ok, shit aside I send you a kiss 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.940
 how much do you think your way of dressing 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.770
 cards etc. influential cultured for 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.470
 reviews the reports that some people 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.049
 they are glad that beautiful 6 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:10.280
 very sweet I send you a whole basin and 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.090
 however I think it all depends on who 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.190
 I have in front 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.709
 if the perfect person not obvious 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:21.220
 I think he is influenced by the appearance 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:23.720
 Physical or how I ashlar chapter 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.030

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.010
 that I can do to what to do to me 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.010
 change your mind about that thought of yours not 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:41.570
 it all depends on the other 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:44.989
 person accept you and understand that everyone is 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.820
 different and clinical in your own way 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.310
 it never happens that people stop at 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.940

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.100

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.760

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.250
 to be honest I am very very 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.230
 distracted when I walk when I am in 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.380
 around and therefore I don't realize who 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.239
 he fixes it and most of the time 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.560
 they are my friends of the characters 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.180
