00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
annoyed about that because like that's

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.399 
annoyed about that because like that's
what<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.830> wanted<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.810> after<00:01:06.810> bleaching<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.670 
what I wanted and after bleaching the
head<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.280> hair<00:01:08.490> did<00:01:08.820> get<00:01:09.090> very<00:01:09.900> damaged<00:01:10.380> and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
head the hair did get very damaged and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.429 
head the hair did get very damaged and
the<00:01:11.670> ends<00:01:11.909> were<00:01:12.030> really<00:01:12.270> dry<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:13.229> just

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
the ends were really dry and it just

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.200 
the ends were really dry and it just
wasn't<00:01:13.590> looking<00:01:13.890> very<00:01:14.010> nice<00:01:14.220> anymore<00:01:14.520> so

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
wasn't looking very nice anymore so

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.760 
wasn't looking very nice anymore so
that's<00:01:15.420> why<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.600> decided<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.990> cut<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.200> into<00:01:16.380> like

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
that's why I decided to cut it into like

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.760 
that's why I decided to cut it into like
a<00:01:16.799> little<00:01:16.950> blob<00:01:17.250> like<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.500> I

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
a little blob like this and and I I

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.070 
a little blob like this and and I I
liked<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.159> decision<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> fact

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
liked the decision like I like the fact

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.570 
liked the decision like I like the fact
that<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.290> cut<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.619> because<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.950> looks<00:01:23.130> more<00:01:23.220> like

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
that I cut it because it looks more like

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.800 
that I cut it because it looks more like
my<00:01:23.729> hair<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> lot<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.420> guys<00:01:24.570> have

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
my hair and a lot of you guys have

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.920 
my hair and a lot of you guys have
thought<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.200> was<00:01:25.320> my<00:01:25.470> hair<00:01:26.119> but<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.720> things

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
thought it was my hair but the things

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.660 
thought it was my hair but the things
that<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.140> didn't<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:28.860> about<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.340> hair<00:01:29.490> was

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
that I didn't like about the hair was

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.910 
that I didn't like about the hair was
the<00:01:29.850> fact<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.619> couldn't<00:01:31.619> bleach<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the fact that I couldn't bleach the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.319 
the fact that I couldn't bleach the
knots<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.340> if<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.520> can't<00:01:32.700> bleach<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> nuts<00:01:33.150> in

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
knots and if I can't bleach the nuts in

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.630 
knots and if I can't bleach the nuts in
that<00:01:33.360> means<00:01:33.689> their<00:01:33.960> lace<00:01:34.770> will<00:01:35.040> be<00:01:35.130> very<00:01:35.400> like

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
that means their lace will be very like

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.770 
that means their lace will be very like
the<00:01:35.790> dots<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.180> lace<00:01:36.360> would<00:01:36.509> be<00:01:36.570> very

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the dots on the lace would be very

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.590 
the dots on the lace would be very
obvious<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.409> had<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> hard<00:01:38.640> time<00:01:38.729> like<00:01:39.180> blending

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
nothing I don't like about the hair is

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:57.210 
nothing I don't like about the hair is
the<00:02:44.260> way<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.650> wig<00:02:44.829> is<00:02:44.980> construct

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.580 

I<00:02:57.280> do<00:02:58.150> like<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.540> fact<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:58.780> has<00:02:59.020> adjustable

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
I do like the fact that has adjustable

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.150 
I do like the fact that has adjustable
straps<00:02:59.860> at<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.070> back<00:03:04.380> but<00:03:05.380> I<00:03:05.410> don't<00:03:05.500> like<00:03:05.950> the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
straps at the back but I don't like the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.970 
straps at the back but I don't like the
fact<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.430> it's<00:03:06.640> not<00:03:06.760> very<00:03:07.000> secure<00:03:07.360> like<00:03:07.980> if

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
fact that it's not very secure like if

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.890 
fact that it's not very secure like if
someone<00:03:09.250> was<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.550> pull<00:03:09.700> on<00:03:09.790> my<00:03:09.910> hair<00:03:10.090> I'll<00:03:10.720> be

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
someone was to pull on my hair I'll be

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.000 
someone was to pull on my hair I'll be
scared<00:03:11.110> that<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.350> wig<00:03:11.500> come<00:03:11.710> off<00:03:11.860> because

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
scared that the wig come off because

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.160 
scared that the wig come off because
there's<00:03:12.280> no<00:03:12.400> combs<00:03:12.670> in<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.630> front<00:03:13.870> so<00:03:14.080> they

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
there's no combs in the front so they

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.720 
there's no combs in the front so they
could<00:03:14.320> probably<00:03:14.470> work<00:03:14.770> on<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.520> construction

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
could probably work on the construction

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.900 
could probably work on the construction
of<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.150> wig<00:03:16.300> all<00:03:16.870> in<00:03:17.050> all<00:03:17.200> I<00:03:17.410> do<00:03:17.500> like<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.760> way

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
of the wig all in all I do like the way

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.700 
of the wig all in all I do like the way
the<00:03:19.270> wig<00:03:19.420> looks<00:03:19.690> on<00:03:19.900> my<00:03:20.050> head<00:03:20.230> it<00:03:20.380> looks<00:03:20.530> very

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
the wig looks on my head it looks very

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:27.800 
the wig looks on my head it looks very
nice<00:03:20.980> if<00:03:21.160> it's<00:03:21.280> very<00:03:21.430> natural<00:03:21.640> like<00:03:21.910> my<00:03:22.150> hair

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.570 

and<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:29.080> did<00:03:29.320> leave<00:03:29.560> a<00:03:29.590> bit<00:03:29.830> of<00:03:29.860> hair<00:03:30.220> in<00:03:30.430> the

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
and I did leave a bit of hair in the

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.490 
and I did leave a bit of hair in the
front<00:03:30.760> out<00:03:31.260> so<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:32.410> blends<00:03:32.680> well<00:03:33.040> with<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.910> wig

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
front out so it blends well with the wig

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.900 
front out so it blends well with the wig
