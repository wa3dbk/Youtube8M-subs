 staircase with trunk east staircase 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.710
 trunk is for the same tejavana of 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.710
 michigan if it is a way that we put like this 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.069
 I'm going to load them also where they are very 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.170
 Well, well let's proceed to the sea 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:37.420
 so how is it weirder I want to see 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.550
 how to tie as it is very simple 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.890
 this is a mooring this is a here it is 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.740
 makes a knot like that for 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.120
 to grab here is an al asad and is 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.979
 nothing bad right now we are doing 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.380
 here nothing more to teach here for 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.780
 sure of this cock but will leave 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.670
 well but first hahaha 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.630
 Firstly 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.480
 it is tied like this here and here we are going to do 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.050
 a knot 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.040
 what is called moon 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.040
 detail 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.440
 and here is hooked is where you 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.910
 hook that we have these hooks 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.500
 this structure that I made to the car 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.430
 these jumps are for that here is another 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.930
 hook look because here is another hook 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.160
 on the back of another hook that 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.340
 that 's why we count here so to 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.070
 see it slowly please to see 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.920
 exactly what is then already a 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.260
 Once insured here, it's called 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.090
 new trailer is given back so that what 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:49.580
 here if you want to do this 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.790
 new trailer or so it is then then this is 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.790
 he does so 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:03:00.109
 well and here we have merchant 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:04.540
 enough though to give you a base 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.540
 hard to ensure the mind 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:29.840
 here we hold but for it to be more 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:33.169
 subject then here lends itself to use 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.000
 the foot to pull with him and so useful the 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:37.969
 weight of their body coincide and 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.930
 we pull and pull to make it more 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:40.930
 tense well 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:53.659
 and here it was fine but another very 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.160
 practical is very practical this here very 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:58.760
 good idea we cut 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:03.500
 to civilians 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:06.470
 but there must be there is and here already just 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.030
 we give a little turn to civil and 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:14.569
 studying 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:17.510
 that's all it was good solid good not 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.340
 will fall from the ccoo ladder as well 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.560
 the staircase is tied here and I 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.120
 I can go and come to grand rapids michigan 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.960
 from here from hermosillo to grand rapids 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:30.110
 Michigan and the staircase 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.700
 but how long is the spread here 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.889
 there's a scoop so we're going to try 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.470
 to make another knot in the back 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.470
 this pill because a little more 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.890
 abbreviated here we have the same the series 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.040
 it's very good so here we give the 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:52.139
 back we do the same operation 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:55.460
 one turn another turn 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.810
 and here we hook the fins in the 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.120
 machito 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.760
 and we do the ministry here we give 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.010
 a round of citations very well here 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.370
 we left the guide for this side although already 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:11.070
 I have jalamecate enough for 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.430
 reach to give the two sides tumbling 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.990
 what is required here is for the new 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.270
 assigned I'm already seeing exactly what 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.590
 what it is doing and it is turned around that 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:24.430
 A) Yes 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:29.400
 and here he is given another round so look yes 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:35.230
 fijaros up and down 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:39.370
 we do the same operation here yes but 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:41.520
 it is the same is used through weight 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.520
 of the body 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:55.600
 but as we are going very far we are going from 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.190
 here in hermosillo even in grand rapids 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.020
 Michigan 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:08.560
 we try to qualify more feel more 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:12.580
 sure there are several that we can call 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.680
 here here here gets the big toe 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.669
 so that you do not run so you do not 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.669
 lose the thought 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:46.229
 directly 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.919
 maricruz de maricruz 

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:57.490
 the afternoon we are going to 

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.490
 very well then see you later see you
