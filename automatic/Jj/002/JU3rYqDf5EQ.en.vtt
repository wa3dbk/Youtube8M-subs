left jumping and you're clicking some

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.719 
left jumping and you're clicking some
sort<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.009> some<00:01:29.009> other<00:01:29.159> key<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.579> some

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
sort of some other key is like some

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
spells or some other junk it'll register

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.840 
spells or some other junk it'll register
every<00:01:32.759> single<00:01:33.210> key<00:01:34.610> so<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.360> guess<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
every single key so the I guess the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.460 
every single key so the I guess the
biggest<00:01:38.850> difference<00:01:39.299> between<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.140> keyboard

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
biggest difference between this keyboard

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.170 
biggest difference between this keyboard
any<00:01:40.770> other<00:01:40.950> keyboard<00:01:41.250> your<00:01:41.369> finest<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.909> it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
any other keyboard your finest that it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.420 
any other keyboard your finest that it
has<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.390> mechanical<00:01:42.960> switches<00:01:43.140> obviously<00:01:43.740> so

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
has the mechanical switches obviously so

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.950 
has the mechanical switches obviously so
like<00:01:44.640> let's<00:01:44.850> take<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> little<00:01:45.210> comparison<00:01:45.630> look

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
like let's take a little comparison look

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.910 
like let's take a little comparison look
at<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:47.420> sound<00:01:48.420> comparison<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> traditional

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
at and sound comparison to a traditional

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.420 
at and sound comparison to a traditional
membrane<00:01:50.909> keyboard<00:01:51.290> and<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.560> mechanical

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
membrane keyboard and a mechanical

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.569 
membrane keyboard and a mechanical
keyboard<00:01:53.729> as<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.509> guys<00:01:54.659> can<00:01:54.810> probably<00:01:55.140> tell

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
keyboard as you guys can probably tell

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.539 
keyboard as you guys can probably tell
it's<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.640> lot<00:01:56.880> louder<00:01:57.619> now<00:01:58.619> what<00:01:58.829> basically

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
it's a lot louder now what basically

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.090 
it's a lot louder now what basically
what<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.909> mechanical<00:02:00.450> keyboard<00:02:00.719> does<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.409> it

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
what the mechanical keyboard does is it

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.859 
what the mechanical keyboard does is it
allows<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.490> give<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:03.060> gives<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.329> tactile

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
allows you give it gives you a tactile

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.440 
allows you give it gives you a tactile
and<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.590> audio<00:02:04.979> cue<00:02:05.790> every<00:02:06.000> time<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.240> press<00:02:06.360> a

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450

and a audio cue every time you press a
key<00:02:06.659> down<00:02:06.840> which<00:02:07.740> basically<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.849> turn<00:02:09.090> lets

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
key down which basically in turn lets

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.600 
key down which basically in turn lets
you<00:02:09.509> type<00:02:09.690> faster<00:02:10.229> because<00:02:10.379> you'll<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.459> can

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
you type faster because you'll you can

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.760

faster it also gives you less fatigue
because<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:41.600> don't<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.810> bottom<00:02:42.050> of<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.170> key

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
because you don't the bottom of the key

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.870 
because you don't the bottom of the key
up<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:42.890> allows<00:02:43.160> you<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.520> press<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.850> down

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
with a lot less pressure so I'm barely

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.130 
with a lot less pressure so I'm barely
putting<00:02:47.210> any<00:02:47.420> weight<00:02:47.480> on<00:02:47.660> here<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.020> it's

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
putting any weight on here and it's

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.920 
putting any weight on here and it's
already<00:02:48.320> engaging<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.740> key<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:49.450> guess<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.630> one

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
already engaging the key I guess the one

you're looking at some steals Teri's
keyboards<00:03:23.720> I<00:03:23.870> know<00:03:24.200> steelseries<00:03:25.130> has

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
keyboards I know steelseries has

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.040 
keyboards I know steelseries has
keyboard<00:03:25.430> which<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:26.330> only<00:03:26.450> section<00:03:26.810> that

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
keyboard which the only section that

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.840 
keyboard which the only section that
that's<00:03:27.380> mechanical<00:03:28.010> is<00:03:28.160> just<00:03:28.520> this<00:03:28.670> little

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
that's mechanical is just this little

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.400 
that's mechanical is just this little
section<00:03:29.120> right<00:03:29.270> here<00:03:29.420> which<00:03:30.050> i<00:03:30.170> think<00:03:30.230> is

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
section right here which i think is

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.050 
section right here which i think is
pretty<00:03:30.620> retarded<00:03:30.830> why<00:03:31.310> not<00:03:31.490> have<00:03:31.760> a

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
pretty retarded why not have a

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.840 
pretty retarded why not have a
completely<00:03:32.990> mechanical<00:03:33.500> keyboard<00:03:34.160> rather

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
completely mechanical keyboard rather

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.720 
completely mechanical keyboard rather
than<00:03:35.120> just<00:03:35.390> this<00:03:35.750> small<00:03:35.959> little<00:03:36.230> section<00:03:36.730> so

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
than just this small little section so

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.640 
than just this small little section so
that's<00:03:37.940> definitely<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.420> plus<00:03:38.630> and<00:03:41.470> regards<00:03:42.470> to

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
that's definitely a plus and regards to

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.800 
that's definitely a plus and regards to
typing<00:03:42.980> long<00:03:43.130> papers<00:03:43.550> like<00:03:43.730> I<00:03:43.790> said<00:03:44.150> it's<00:03:44.450> it's

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
typing long papers like I said it's it's

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.620 
typing long papers like I said it's it's
so<00:03:45.200> so<00:03:45.770> easy<00:03:45.800> and<00:03:46.610> I<00:03:46.970> could<00:03:47.150> definitely<00:03:47.390> take<00:03:47.570> a

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
so so easy and I could definitely take a

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.050 
so so easy and I could definitely take a
lot<00:03:47.810> longer<00:03:47.959> on<00:03:48.200> this<00:03:48.380> keyboard<00:03:48.560> then<00:03:49.459> I<00:03:49.790> can

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
lot longer on this keyboard then I can

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.890 
lot longer on this keyboard then I can
on<00:03:50.270> a<00:03:50.300> regular<00:03:50.720> you<00:03:51.590> know<00:03:51.709> membrane<00:03:52.550> keyboard
