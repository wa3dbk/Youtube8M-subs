00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
okay what I'm gonna talk about today is

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.960 
okay what I'm gonna talk about today is
applying<00:01:17.020> mortal<00:01:17.770> voicings<00:01:18.250> to<00:01:18.460> standard

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
applying mortal voicings to standard

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.270 
applying mortal voicings to standard
harmony<00:01:19.420> what<00:01:20.260> you<00:01:20.380> should<00:01:20.710> be<00:01:20.860> looking<00:01:20.980> at

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
harmony what you should be looking at

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.190 
harmony what you should be looking at
right<00:01:21.460> now<00:01:21.610> is<00:01:21.760> the<00:01:21.910> PDF<00:01:22.240> which<00:01:22.840> is<00:01:23.020> available

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
right now is the PDF which is available

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.510 
right now is the PDF which is available
on<00:01:23.530> my<00:01:23.680> blog<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:25.540> a<00:01:25.650> 251<00:01:26.650> and<00:01:26.920> either<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.340> key

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
on my blog to a 251 and either the key

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.180 
on my blog to a 251 and either the key
of<00:01:27.640> B<00:01:27.670> or<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.090> key<00:01:28.300> of<00:01:28.420> C<00:01:28.570> flat<00:01:28.980> right<00:01:29.980> now<00:01:30.130> I

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
of B or the key of C flat right now I

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.500 
of B or the key of C flat right now I
have<00:01:30.430> a<00:01:30.460> student<00:01:31.000> who<00:01:31.330> is<00:01:31.360> going<00:01:31.990> through<00:01:32.110> my

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
have a student who is going through my

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.070 
have a student who is going through my
rigorous<00:01:34.560> system<00:01:35.560> of<00:01:35.710> harmony<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:37.080> we're

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
rigorous system of harmony and we're

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.260 
rigorous system of harmony and we're
dealing<00:01:38.290> with<00:01:38.500> mortal<00:01:39.400> voicings<00:01:39.850> and

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
dealing with mortal voicings and

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.000 
dealing with mortal voicings and
creating<00:01:40.870> them<00:01:41.020> and<00:01:42.300> applying<00:01:43.300> them<00:01:43.510> so<00:01:44.080> I'm

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
creating them and applying them so I'm

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.800 
creating them and applying them so I'm
skipping<00:01:45.340> ahead<00:01:45.550> a<00:01:45.700> couple<00:01:45.880> steps<00:01:46.210> because

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
skipping ahead a couple steps because

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.260 
skipping ahead a couple steps because
obviously<00:01:47.370> there's<00:01:48.370> a<00:01:48.460> method<00:01:48.820> in<00:01:48.880> which<00:01:49.060> to

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
obviously there's a method in which to

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.810 
obviously there's a method in which to
find<00:01:49.740> literally<00:01:50.740> thousands<00:01:51.370> of<00:01:51.460> mortal

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
find literally thousands of mortal

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.390 
find literally thousands of mortal
voicings<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:53.740> what<00:01:53.860> I'm<00:01:53.950> going<00:01:54.070> to<00:01:54.100> do<00:01:54.250> is

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
voicings but what I'm going to do is

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.280 
voicings but what I'm going to do is
take<00:01:54.790> one<00:01:55.120> mortal<00:01:55.360> voicing<00:01:55.840> that<00:01:56.050> this

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
take one mortal voicing that this

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.160 
take one mortal voicing that this
gentleman<00:01:56.770> found<00:01:57.010> and<00:01:57.600> talk<00:01:58.600> about<00:01:58.900> its

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
gentleman found and talk about its

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.770 
gentleman found and talk about its
application<00:01:59.350> a<00:02:00.160> little<00:02:00.520> bit<00:02:03.480> so<00:02:04.480> once<00:02:04.660> a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
application a little bit so once a

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.270 
application a little bit so once a
student<00:02:04.960> has<00:02:05.170> found<00:02:05.530> a<00:02:05.620> voicing<00:02:06.010> that<00:02:06.040> they

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
student has found a voicing that they

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.950 
student has found a voicing that they
like<00:02:06.490> I<00:02:06.670> have<00:02:06.820> them<00:02:06.940> apply<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.330> to<00:02:07.600> as<00:02:07.720> many

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
like I have them apply it to as many

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.530 
like I have them apply it to as many
context<00:02:08.560> as<00:02:08.649> possible<00:02:09.220> so<00:02:10.179> look<00:02:10.330> at<00:02:10.420> this

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
context as possible so look at this

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.310 
context as possible so look at this
voicing<00:02:11.020> G<00:02:11.710> ad<00:02:12.660> we're<00:02:13.660> gonna<00:02:13.780> look<00:02:13.990> at<00:02:14.140> this

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
voicing G ad we're gonna look at this

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.040 
voicing G ad we're gonna look at this
with<00:02:14.950> B<00:02:15.130> flat<00:02:15.340> as<00:02:15.520> its<00:02:15.730> base<00:02:15.880> note<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:16.570> you'll

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
with B flat as its base note and you'll

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.810 
with B flat as its base note and you'll
see<00:02:17.230> how<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.380> boys<00:02:17.650> leads<00:02:17.920> nicely<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.459> a<00:02:18.490> B<00:02:18.670> flat

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
see how it boys leads nicely to a B flat

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:27.410 
see how it boys leads nicely to a B flat
triad

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.780 

okay<00:02:29.640> now<00:02:30.640> moving<00:02:31.000> forward<00:02:31.420> we<00:02:31.660> found<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:33.610> it

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
okay now moving forward we found that it

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.320 
okay now moving forward we found that it
had<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:33.970> nice<00:02:34.300> function<00:02:34.690> against<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.200> G<00:02:35.470> flat

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
had a nice function against the G flat

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.270 
had a nice function against the G flat
and<00:02:37.330> we<00:02:37.480> saw<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:37.959> had<00:02:37.989> alterations<00:02:38.980> of<00:02:39.099> G

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
and we saw that it had alterations of G

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.729 
and we saw that it had alterations of G
flat<00:02:39.459> flat<00:02:40.060> 9<00:02:40.300> sharp<00:02:40.870> 9<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:42.640> flat<00:02:42.970> 13<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:44.590> then

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
flat flat 9 sharp 9 and flat 13 so then

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:56.850 
flat flat 9 sharp 9 and flat 13 so then
we<00:02:44.830> voice<00:02:44.980> led<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.430> G<00:02:46.180> flat<00:02:46.330> 13<00:02:50.970> okay<00:02:55.860> and

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
we voice led it to G flat 13 okay and

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.009 
we voice led it to G flat 13 okay and
then<00:02:57.069> the<00:02:57.190> next<00:02:57.430> step<00:02:57.610> was<00:02:57.819> to<00:02:58.330> put<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.630> inside

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
then the next step was to put it inside

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.440 
then the next step was to put it inside
and<00:02:59.319> you<00:02:59.350> have<00:02:59.410> a<00:02:59.560> wine<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:01.060> would<00:03:01.209> apply<00:03:01.390> to

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
and you have a wine that would apply to

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:10.530 
and you have a wine that would apply to
a<00:03:01.600> 2<00:03:01.840> 5<00:03:02.110> 1<00:03:02.410> so<00:03:02.950> we<00:03:03.160> use<00:03:03.370> these<00:03:03.549> voicings<00:03:09.540> okay

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
a 2 5 1 so we use these voicings okay

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.140 
a 2 5 1 so we use these voicings okay
you<00:03:11.110> can<00:03:11.260> see<00:03:11.440> that<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.739> first<00:03:11.980> two<00:03:12.580> voicings

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
you can see that the first two voicings

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.080 
you can see that the first two voicings
are<00:03:13.959> standard<00:03:14.620> water<00:03:14.799> voicings<00:03:15.370> that<00:03:15.610> you

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
are standard water voicings that you

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.680 
are standard water voicings that you
would<00:03:16.209> play<00:03:16.390> over<00:03:16.540> you<00:03:16.840> know<00:03:16.989> a<00:03:18.450> c-sharp<00:03:19.450> minor

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
would play over you know a c-sharp minor

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.259 
would play over you know a c-sharp minor
chord<00:03:19.989> or<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.440> D<00:03:20.650> flat<00:03:20.860> minor<00:03:21.040> chord<00:03:21.160> these<00:03:22.090> are

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
chord or a D flat minor chord these are

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.000 
chord or a D flat minor chord these are
the<00:03:22.360> root<00:03:22.810> chords<00:03:23.170> if<00:03:23.319> you<00:03:23.440> wanted<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.769> look<00:03:23.890> at

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
the root chords if you wanted to look at

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.780 
the root chords if you wanted to look at
them<00:03:24.220> here<00:03:25.120> obviously<00:03:25.810> you<00:03:26.680> end<00:03:26.890> with<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.280> a

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
them here obviously you end with the a

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:40.760 
them here obviously you end with the a
b6<00:03:28.690> or<00:03:28.930> C<00:03:29.170> flat<00:03:29.410> 6<00:03:30.450> okay<00:03:32.040> one<00:03:33.040> more<00:03:33.130> time

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.820 

okay<00:03:41.770> so<00:03:42.220> now<00:03:42.460> that<00:03:42.520> you<00:03:42.700> have<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:43.030> line<00:03:43.240> down

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
okay so now that you have the line down

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.230 
okay so now that you have the line down
the<00:03:44.830> best<00:03:45.010> thing<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.220> do<00:03:45.430> would<00:03:45.580> obviously<00:03:46.030> be

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
the best thing to do would obviously be

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.440 
the best thing to do would obviously be
to<00:03:46.570> transpose<00:03:47.110> it<00:03:47.140> into<00:03:47.860> as<00:03:48.790> many<00:03:49.030> keys<00:03:49.270> as

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
to transpose it into as many keys as

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.590 
to transpose it into as many keys as
possible<00:03:50.280> but<00:03:51.280> what<00:03:51.490> I<00:03:51.520> want<00:03:51.760> you<00:03:51.880> to<00:03:52.000> see<00:03:52.240> from

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
possible but what I want you to see from

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.770 
possible but what I want you to see from
this<00:03:52.750> little<00:03:53.080> exercise<00:03:53.620> here<00:03:54.280> is<00:03:54.450> that<00:03:55.450> the

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
this little exercise here is that the

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.730 
this little exercise here is that the
work<00:03:55.960> that<00:03:55.990> we<00:03:56.290> do<00:03:56.530> in<00:03:57.070> the<00:03:57.340> mortal<00:03:57.610> context<00:03:58.740> in

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
work that we do in the mortal context in

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.240 
work that we do in the mortal context in
what<00:04:00.010> I<00:04:00.040> like<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.400> call<00:04:00.430> areas<00:04:01.150> of<00:04:01.330> activity<00:04:01.660> is

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
what I like to call areas of activity is

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.010 
what I like to call areas of activity is
applicable<00:04:03.250> not<00:04:03.640> just<00:04:03.970> to<00:04:04.150> static<00:04:04.570> harmony

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
applicable not just to static harmony

applicable not just to static harmony
but<00:04:05.470> I<00:04:05.920> think<00:04:06.610> that<00:04:06.730> we're<00:04:06.850> all<00:04:06.970> trying<00:04:07.390> to<00:04:07.830> at

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
but I think that we're all trying to at

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.460 
but I think that we're all trying to at
least<00:04:08.950> myself<00:04:09.190> anyway<00:04:09.850> I'm<00:04:10.810> trying<00:04:11.140> to<00:04:11.260> sort

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
least myself anyway I'm trying to sort

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.510 
least myself anyway I'm trying to sort
of<00:04:11.560> get<00:04:11.980> closer<00:04:12.280> and<00:04:12.460> closer<00:04:12.670> to<00:04:12.970> a<00:04:13.000> pianist

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
of get closer and closer to a pianist

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.260 
of get closer and closer to a pianist
accompained<00:04:16.650> harmonizing<00:04:17.650> melody<00:04:17.980> and

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
accompained harmonizing melody and

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.600 
accompained harmonizing melody and
responding<00:04:19.270> to<00:04:19.300> what's<00:04:19.600> around<00:04:19.750> me<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:21.190> think

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
responding to what's around me and think

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.220 
responding to what's around me and think
outside<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:21.940> box<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.390> little<00:04:22.420> bit<00:04:22.750> and<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:22.990> think

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
outside the box a little bit and I think

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.380 
outside the box a little bit and I think
that<00:04:23.410> this<00:04:23.560> is<00:04:23.800> one<00:04:24.760> of<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:24.940> better<00:04:25.090> ways<00:04:25.330> to

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
that this is one of the better ways to
