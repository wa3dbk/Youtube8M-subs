got the option of like buying the arm
curl<00:00:39.500> attachment<00:00:40.010> that<00:00:40.129> goes<00:00:40.190> on<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:40.550> end<00:00:40.760> for

preacher<00:00:41.660> curls<00:00:41.870> okay<00:00:42.650> but<00:00:43.430> you<00:00:43.519> can<00:00:43.760> do<00:00:43.970> this

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
preacher curls okay but you can do this

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.819 
preacher curls okay but you can do this
movement<00:00:44.420> here<00:00:44.720> which<00:00:45.110> is<00:00:45.260> using<00:00:45.470> the<00:00:45.650> high

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
movement here which is using the high

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.069 
movement here which is using the high
pulley<00:00:46.129> and<00:00:46.940> your<00:00:47.180> brace<00:00:47.390> your<00:00:47.570> feet<00:00:47.750> on<00:00:47.960> the

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
pulley and your brace your feet on the

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.110 
pulley and your brace your feet on the
lower<00:00:48.260> arms<00:00:48.800> okay<00:00:49.250> so<00:00:49.579> you<00:00:49.640> put<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:49.910> lower

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
lower arms okay so you put the lower

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.740 
lower arms okay so you put the lower
arms<00:00:50.449> down<00:00:50.600> now<00:00:51.410> this<00:00:51.590> is<00:00:51.710> but<00:00:51.920> basically<00:00:52.750> the

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
arms down now this is but basically the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.910 
arms down now this is but basically the
best<00:00:53.870> way<00:00:53.989> to<00:00:54.109> probably<00:00:54.469> describe<00:00:54.770> this

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
best way to probably describe this

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.180 
best way to probably describe this
movement<00:00:55.340> is<00:00:55.430> it's<00:00:56.359> a<00:00:56.480> concentration<00:00:57.140> curl<00:00:57.530> so

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
movement is it's a concentration curl so

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.470 
movement is it's a concentration curl so
when<00:00:58.309> you<00:00:58.370> do<00:00:58.460> a<00:00:58.489> dumbbell<00:00:58.730> concentration

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
when you do a dumbbell concentration

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.819 
when you do a dumbbell concentration
curls<00:00:59.629> it's<00:00:59.780> a<00:00:59.840> cross<00:01:00.050> between<00:01:00.079> that<00:01:00.680> and

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
curls it's a cross between that and

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.910 
curls it's a cross between that and
preacher<00:01:01.579> curls<00:01:01.910> okay<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:03.559> it's<00:01:03.649> a<00:01:03.739> cross

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
preacher curls okay so it's a cross

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.590 
preacher curls okay so it's a cross
between<00:01:03.980> that<00:01:04.519> it's<00:01:04.670> a<00:01:04.699> hybrid<00:01:05.119> of<00:01:05.269> those<00:01:05.539> two

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
between that it's a hybrid of those two

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.480 
between that it's a hybrid of those two
movements<00:01:06.080> then<00:01:06.740> what<00:01:06.830> we<00:01:06.920> do<00:01:07.070> is<00:01:07.190> in<00:01:07.340> place

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
movements then what we do is in place

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.880 
movements then what we do is in place
and<00:01:07.700> hands<00:01:07.820> on<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.030> bar<00:01:08.320> brace<00:01:09.320> that<00:01:09.350> feeling

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
and hands on the bar brace that feeling

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.910 
and hands on the bar brace that feeling
and<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.490> idea<00:01:10.789> is<00:01:10.910> to<00:01:10.940> pull<00:01:11.539> in<00:01:11.990> to<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.649> top<00:01:12.800> of

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
and the idea is to pull in to the top of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.499 
and the idea is to pull in to the top of
our<00:01:12.979> forehead<00:01:13.369> okay<00:01:14.350> we<00:01:15.350> do<00:01:15.500> that<00:01:15.770> now<00:01:16.509> and

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
our forehead okay we do that now and

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.419 
our forehead okay we do that now and
I've<00:01:18.170> said<00:01:18.349> if<00:01:18.440> you're<00:01:18.560> finding<00:01:18.920> this<00:01:19.069> body

00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:19.429 
I've said if you're finding this body

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:21.339 
I've said if you're finding this body
it's<00:01:19.670> bottoming<00:01:20.209> out<00:01:20.300> at<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.509> top<00:01:20.750> just<00:01:21.110> put

00:01:21.339 --> 00:01:21.349 
it's bottoming out at the top just put

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:22.660 
it's bottoming out at the top just put
more<00:01:21.560> chain<00:01:21.800> on<00:01:21.979> for<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.280> length<00:01:22.429> that<00:01:22.550> you

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
more chain on for the length that you

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.210 
more chain on for the length that you
need<00:01:22.700> it<00:01:22.940> but<00:01:23.539> the<00:01:24.349> idea<00:01:24.470> of<00:01:24.649> this<00:01:24.770> one<00:01:24.920> you<00:01:25.069> see

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
need it but the idea of this one you see

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.440 
need it but the idea of this one you see
a<00:01:25.250> lot<00:01:25.399> of<00:01:25.429> people<00:01:25.819> when<00:01:25.940> I've<00:01:26.030> shown<00:01:26.270> this

a lot of people when I've shown this

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.359 
a lot of people when I've shown this
movement<00:01:26.929> or<00:01:27.349> demonstrates<00:01:27.830> movement<00:01:28.160> then

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
movement or demonstrates movement then

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.790 
movement or demonstrates movement then
they<00:01:28.490> don't<00:01:29.030> to<00:01:29.390> do<00:01:29.539> it<00:01:29.660> in<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.810> gym<00:01:30.020> they

is you start wide first we go for about

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:55.390 
is you start wide first we go for about
10<00:02:48.680> reps<00:02:48.890> why<00:02:49.130> so<00:02:49.850> we<00:02:49.970> do<00:02:50.959> 10<00:02:51.290> reps<00:02:51.500> wide<00:02:54.400> okay

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
10 reps why so we do 10 reps wide okay
