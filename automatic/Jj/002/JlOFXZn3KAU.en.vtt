send them at the right place try to not

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.310 
send them at the right place try to not
waste<00:01:41.760> too<00:01:42.030> much<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.240> your<00:01:42.450> ass<00:01:42.750> initial

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
waste too much of your ass initial

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.410 
waste too much of your ass initial
assets<00:01:43.650> because<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.760> also<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.150> take

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
assets because you have also to take

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.020 
assets because you have also to take
care<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.600> supplies<00:01:46.080> of<00:01:46.620> a<00:01:46.700> replacement<00:01:47.700> and
