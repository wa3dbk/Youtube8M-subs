hi I'm solar moon and I'm demonstrating
my<00:00:08.299> blender<00:00:09.299> game<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.690> in<00:00:09.840> game<00:00:10.050> grid<00:00:10.710> space

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
my blender game is in game grid space

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.339 
my blender game is in game grid space
today<00:00:11.370> it's<00:00:12.179> based<00:00:12.420> in<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.719> overhead<00:00:12.960> shooter

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
today it's based in the overhead shooter

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.220 
today it's based in the overhead shooter
kind<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.950> like<00:00:14.070> geometry<00:00:14.309> wars<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.090> that<00:00:15.750> is

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
kind of like geometry wars and that is

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.470 
kind of like geometry wars and that is
the<00:00:16.349> overhead<00:00:16.710> abstract<00:00:17.099> Sugarfoot<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:18.330> will

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
the overhead abstract Sugarfoot it will

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.210 
the overhead abstract Sugarfoot it will
take<00:00:18.720> place<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.050> larger<00:00:19.410> world<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:20.039> geometry

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
take place in a larger world in geometry

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.220 
take place in a larger world in geometry
wars<00:00:20.609> it's<00:00:21.029> not<00:00:21.210> going<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.600> be<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> simple<00:00:21.960> arena

spin<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.850> while<00:00:38.850> spinning<00:00:39.059> bumping<00:00:39.570> into

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
spin and while spinning bumping into

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.979 
spin and while spinning bumping into
enemies<00:00:40.079> will<00:00:40.379> Avenger<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:41.640> also<00:00:41.989> while

enemies will Avenger but also while
you're<00:00:43.020> spinning<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.800> boost<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.760> move<00:00:44.969> quite

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
you're spinning you boost you move quite

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.330 
you're spinning you boost you move quite
a<00:00:45.329> bit<00:00:45.480> faster<00:00:45.930> than<00:00:46.469> if<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.710> don't<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.250> a

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
a bit faster than if you don't so it's a

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.760 
a bit faster than if you don't so it's a
nice<00:00:47.489> means<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.300> transportation<00:00:48.649> all<00:00:49.649> right

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
nice means of transportation all right

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.100 
nice means of transportation all right
now<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:49.950> start<00:00:50.280> off<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.520> an<00:00:50.640> outpost<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.420> as

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
now you start off in an outpost and as

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.260 
now you start off in an outpost and as
you<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.379> see<00:00:52.410> there's<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.860> field<00:00:53.789> around<00:00:53.969> here

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
you can see there's a field around here

you<00:01:50.410> okay<00:01:50.860> we've<00:01:51.010> not<00:01:51.160> really<00:01:51.340> that<00:01:51.610> hard<00:01:51.790> to

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
you okay we've not really that hard to

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.350 
you okay we've not really that hard to
dodge<00:01:52.180> or<00:01:52.510> deal<00:01:53.110> with<00:01:53.140> but<00:01:54.070> eventually<00:01:54.790> you

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
dodge or deal with but eventually you

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.120 
dodge or deal with but eventually you
know<00:01:55.420> it's<00:01:55.720> something<00:01:56.470> they<00:01:56.830> can<00:01:56.950> be<00:01:57.040> a<00:01:57.070> little

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
know it's something they can be a little

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.520 
know it's something they can be a little
more<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.630> spinning<00:01:59.550> snap<00:02:00.960> nice<00:02:01.960> little<00:02:02.230> weapon

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
more so spinning snap nice little weapon

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.470 
more so spinning snap nice little weapon
smashed<00:02:03.130> into<00:02:03.340> them<00:02:03.550> and<00:02:03.880> pick<00:02:04.300> up<00:02:04.390> the

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
smashed into them and pick up the

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.330 
smashed into them and pick up the
credits<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.790> as<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.090> as<00:02:07.720> a<00:02:07.780> basic<00:02:08.380> enemy<00:02:08.830> of

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
credits so as the as a basic enemy of

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.590 
credits so as the as a basic enemy of
course<00:02:09.550> not<00:02:09.700> all<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.030> enemies<00:02:10.179> would<00:02:10.420> mean

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
course not all the enemies would mean

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.870 
course not all the enemies would mean
it's<00:02:10.780> simple<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.230> take<00:02:11.440> down<00:02:11.670> some<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.700> them

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
it's simple to take down some of them

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
it's simple to take down some of them
will<00:02:13.000> have<00:02:13.120> different<00:02:13.450> Oh<00:02:14.340> different<00:02:15.900> attacks

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
will have different Oh different attacks

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.740 
will have different Oh different attacks
that<00:02:17.170> was<00:02:17.380> appear<00:02:17.940> gears<00:02:18.940> are<00:02:19.240> quite<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.570> bit

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
that was appear gears are quite a bit

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.330 
that was appear gears are quite a bit
harder<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.110> take<00:02:20.260> down<00:02:20.410> because<00:02:20.709> they<00:02:20.860> are

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
harder to take down because they are

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.820 
harder to take down because they are
like<00:02:21.490> you<00:02:21.670> they<00:02:21.880> have<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.390> spinning<00:02:22.870> ability<00:02:23.230> so

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
like you they have a spinning ability so

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.500 
like you they have a spinning ability so
you<00:02:23.920> can<00:02:24.070> to<00:02:24.160> spin<00:02:24.370> into<00:02:24.520> them<00:02:24.730> those<00:02:25.209> pounds

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
you can to spin into them those pounds

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.949 
you can to spin into them those pounds
off<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:26.740> it's<00:02:27.040> not<00:02:27.190> a<00:02:27.250> good<00:02:27.790> strategy<00:02:28.209> to<00:02:28.510> try

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
off so it's not a good strategy to try

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.500 
off so it's not a good strategy to try
to<00:02:29.080> directly<00:02:29.980> attack<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.700> gear<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.209> really

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
to directly attack a gear that really

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.510 
to directly attack a gear that really
does<00:02:31.660> not<00:02:31.810> work<00:02:31.990> so<00:02:32.709> what<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:32.950> can<00:02:33.040> do<00:02:33.190> instead

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
does not work so what you can do instead

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.550 
does not work so what you can do instead
is<00:02:35.100> back<00:02:36.150> first<00:02:37.150> flight<00:02:37.570> be<00:02:37.840> now<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.440> we<00:02:38.530> have

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
is back first flight be now that we have

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.520 
is back first flight be now that we have
enough<00:02:38.709> credits<00:02:38.920> of<00:02:39.700> Chris<00:02:40.060> now<00:02:40.660> let's<00:02:41.320> shoot

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
enough credits of Chris now let's shoot

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.100 
enough credits of Chris now let's shoot
button<00:02:41.770> you<00:02:42.400> can<00:02:42.520> fire<00:02:42.840> now<00:02:43.840> they<00:02:43.990> have<00:02:44.080> a

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
button you can fire now they have a

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.150 
button you can fire now they have a
range<00:02:44.410> weapon<00:02:46.020> it's<00:02:47.020> not<00:02:47.200> hard<00:02:47.560> at<00:02:47.740> all<00:02:47.770> to

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
range weapon it's not hard at all to

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.400 
range weapon it's not hard at all to
take<00:02:49.090> down<00:02:49.300> a<00:02:49.750> gear<00:02:50.320> I<00:02:50.530> let's<00:02:50.830> do<00:02:51.010> this<00:02:52.410> get

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
take down a gear I let's do this get

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.820 
take down a gear I let's do this get
them<00:02:53.560> into<00:02:53.769> a<00:02:53.800> nice<00:02:55.110> chase<00:02:56.670> once<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:57.790> give<00:02:58.830> ya

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
them into a nice chase once you give ya

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
them into a nice chase once you give ya
just<00:03:00.610> do<00:03:00.850> a<00:03:00.880> simple<00:03:01.090> uh<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:02.680> for<00:03:02.709> 12<00:03:03.190> shot<00:03:03.640> and

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
just do a simple uh so for 12 shot and

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.550 
just do a simple uh so for 12 shot and
that's<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.570> party<00:03:04.840> harder<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.290> take<00:03:05.380> down

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
that's it the party harder to take down

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.330 
that's it the party harder to take down
in<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:05.970> actual<00:03:06.970> game<00:03:07.000> but<00:03:07.390> for<00:03:08.320> a<00:03:08.680> little<00:03:09.100> demo

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
in the actual game but for a little demo

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.690 
in the actual game but for a little demo
purpose<00:03:09.760> it's<00:03:11.010> demonstrative<00:03:12.010> of<00:03:12.250> what<00:03:12.459> the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
purpose it's demonstrative of what the

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.039 
purpose it's demonstrative of what the
game<00:03:12.880> will<00:03:13.060> be<00:03:13.180> like<00:03:15.209> part<00:03:16.209> makes<00:03:16.360> that<00:03:16.570> if<00:03:16.810> you

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
game will be like part makes that if you

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.070 
game will be like part makes that if you
live<00:03:17.320> in<00:03:17.350> for<00:03:17.620> spinning<00:03:18.180> being<00:03:19.180> gears<00:03:19.570> also<00:03:19.959> if

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
live in for spinning being gears also if

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.300 
live in for spinning being gears also if
it's<00:03:20.290> damaged<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:20.890> you<00:03:20.980> can't<00:03:21.190> just

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
it's damaged that you can't just

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.449 
it's damaged that you can't just
infinitely<00:03:22.680> avoid<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.799> gear<00:03:23.980> pretty<00:03:24.160> really

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
infinitely avoid the gear pretty really

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.630 
infinitely avoid the gear pretty really
right<00:03:24.640> okay<00:03:25.450> so<00:03:25.750> let's<00:03:26.100> film<00:03:27.100> it<00:03:27.220> progress<00:03:27.370> so

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
right okay so let's film it progress so

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.420 
right okay so let's film it progress so
far<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.880> good<00:03:28.209> space
