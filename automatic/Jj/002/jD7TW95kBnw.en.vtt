00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
hi guys this is Andy from able to n-- in

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.360 
hi guys this is Andy from able to n-- in
this<00:00:12.840> quick<00:00:13.080> video<00:00:13.230> tutorial<00:00:13.590> we<00:00:14.190> will<00:00:14.309> show

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
this quick video tutorial we will show

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.400 
this quick video tutorial we will show
you<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.759> simple<00:00:15.179> technique<00:00:15.450> on<00:00:15.960> how<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.199> get

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
you a simple technique on how to get

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.890 
you a simple technique on how to get
your<00:00:16.470> sampled<00:00:17.130> kicks<00:00:17.460> clean<00:00:17.910> it's<00:00:18.600> very

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
your sampled kicks clean it's very

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.450 
your sampled kicks clean it's very
useful<00:00:19.350> for<00:00:19.380> times<00:00:19.830> like<00:00:20.070> when<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.340> use<00:00:20.430> a

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
useful for times like when you use a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.730 
useful for times like when you use a
ready-made<00:00:20.820> beat<00:00:21.359> from<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.720> sample<00:00:22.170> pack<00:00:22.380> like

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
ready-made beat from a sample pack like

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.849 
ready-made beat from a sample pack like
this<00:00:23.039> one<00:00:23.250> we<00:00:23.430> have<00:00:23.580> right<00:00:23.760> here<00:00:26.750> at<00:00:27.859> some

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
this one we have right here at some

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.980 
this one we have right here at some
point<00:00:29.130> you'll<00:00:29.369> need<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.640> clean<00:00:30.060> kick<00:00:30.359> drum<00:00:30.630> for

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
point you'll need a clean kick drum for

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.340 
point you'll need a clean kick drum for
a<00:00:31.050> part<00:00:31.410> or<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> section<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.399> your<00:00:32.550> song<00:00:33.170> you<00:00:34.170> can

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
a part or a section in your song you can

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.010 
a part or a section in your song you can
just<00:00:34.590> simply<00:00:34.800> cut<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.340> like<00:00:35.790> this

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.260 

but<00:00:41.020> we<00:00:41.140> still<00:00:41.380> have<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:41.590> hi-hats<00:00:42.130> here<00:00:42.550> and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
but we still have the hi-hats here and

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.030 
but we still have the hi-hats here and
sometimes<00:00:43.900> you<00:00:44.080> can<00:00:44.230> remove<00:00:44.530> these<00:00:44.740> with

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
sometimes you can remove these with

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.140 
sometimes you can remove these with
fades

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.970 

but<00:00:49.150> this<00:00:49.480> doesn't<00:00:49.900> really<00:00:50.050> work<00:00:50.200> well<00:00:50.710> in

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
but this doesn't really work well in

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.530 
but this doesn't really work well in
this<00:00:51.130> case<00:00:51.430> so<00:00:52.300> we<00:00:52.690> can<00:00:53.050> lose<00:00:53.380> this<00:00:53.590> tail<00:00:54.540> so

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
this case so we can lose this tail so

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.320 
this case so we can lose this tail so
I'll<00:00:55.720> use<00:00:55.960> an<00:00:56.140> EQ<00:00:56.620> 8<00:00:56.890> for<00:00:57.160> this<00:00:57.280> trick<00:00:57.610> let's

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
I'll use an EQ 8 for this trick let's

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.840 
I'll use an EQ 8 for this trick let's
switch<00:00:58.630> it<00:00:58.660> to<00:00:58.960> high<00:00:59.170> cut<00:00:59.470> and<00:00:59.710> we'll<00:01:00.550> filter

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
switch it to high cut and we'll filter

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:09.910 
switch it to high cut and we'll filter
out<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.270> high<00:01:01.420> hats

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:18.219 

okay<00:01:10.580> let's<00:01:10.850> set<00:01:11.060> a<00:01:11.090> shorter<00:01:11.510> loop

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.380 

now<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.289> hear<00:01:19.770> only<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.280> low<00:01:20.460> frequency<00:01:21.119> range

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
now we hear only the low frequency range

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.630 
now we hear only the low frequency range
so<00:01:22.229> I'm<00:01:22.350> simply<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.979> add<00:01:23.189> some

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
so I'm simply going to add some

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.910 
so I'm simply going to add some
frequency<00:01:24.270> automation<00:01:24.899> to<00:01:25.229> keep<00:01:25.380> its<00:01:25.560> attack

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
frequency automation to keep its attack

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.419 
frequency automation to keep its attack
unprocessed<00:01:30.350> sounds<00:01:31.350> almost<00:01:31.710> clean<00:01:32.070> but

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
unprocessed sounds almost clean but

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.789 
unprocessed sounds almost clean but
let's<00:01:32.880> adjust<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.420> automation<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.679> a

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
let's adjust the automation just a

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.210 
let's adjust the automation just a
little<00:01:35.039> bit<00:01:38.869> so<00:01:39.869> now<00:01:39.899> we<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.500> an<00:01:40.679> untouched

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
little bit so now we have an untouched

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.029 
little bit so now we have an untouched
attack<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.090> clean<00:01:42.869> release<00:01:43.229> without<00:01:43.679> the

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
attack and clean release without the

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.389 
attack and clean release without the
hi-hats<00:01:45.259> let's<00:01:46.259> see<00:01:46.470> how<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.649> waveform<00:01:47.189> looks

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
hi-hats let's see how the waveform looks

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.359 
hi-hats let's see how the waveform looks
now<00:01:48.170> after<00:01:49.170> all<00:01:49.890> these<00:01:50.039> manipulations

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
now after all these manipulations

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.999 
now after all these manipulations
alright<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.490> looks<00:01:53.520> clean<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.330> it<00:01:55.009> sounds

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
alright it looks clean and it sounds

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.809 
alright it looks clean and it sounds
clean<00:01:57.080> okay<00:01:58.080> that's<00:01:58.349> it<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.860> hope<00:01:59.459> you<00:01:59.549> find

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
clean okay that's it I hope you find

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:02.059 
clean okay that's it I hope you find
this<00:02:00.030> technique<00:02:00.479> useful<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.229> don't<00:02:01.770> forget
