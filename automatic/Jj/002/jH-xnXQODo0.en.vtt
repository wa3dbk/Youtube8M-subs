pushed this also has they have a a quart
of<00:01:30.110> blood<00:01:30.260> flow<00:01:30.619> amplifier<00:01:31.220> have<00:01:31.760> a<00:01:31.790> fun<00:01:32.000> which

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
of blood flow amplifier have a fun which

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.240 
of blood flow amplifier have a fun which
is<00:01:32.869> l-citrulline<00:01:33.680> and<00:01:34.160> our<00:01:35.119> our<00:01:35.450> journey

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
is l-citrulline and our our journey

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.730 
is l-citrulline and our our journey
l-citrulline<00:01:37.510> converts<00:01:38.510> into<00:01:38.810> our<00:01:39.170> arginines

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
l-citrulline converts into our arginines

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.770 
l-citrulline converts into our arginines
in<00:01:40.250> your<00:01:40.520> kidneys<00:01:40.910> after<00:01:41.270> that<00:01:41.479> with<00:01:41.690> your

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
in your kidneys after that with your

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.499 
in your kidneys after that with your
kidneys<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:42.440> also<00:01:42.860> it's<00:01:43.700> a<00:01:44.000> house<00:01:44.240> with<00:01:44.420> a

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
kidneys and also it's a house with a

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.870 
kidneys and also it's a house with a
lesion<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.930> your<00:01:45.140> blood<00:01:45.380> vessels<00:01:46.360> called

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
lesion of your blood vessels called

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.630 
lesion of your blood vessels called
endothelium<00:01:49.880> is<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:51.320> blood<00:01:51.649> vessel<00:01:52.040> so

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
endothelium is the blood vessel so

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.540 
endothelium is the blood vessel so
actually<00:01:52.820> help<00:01:53.240> dilate<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.750> blood<00:01:54.250> I'll<00:01:55.250> have

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
actually help dilate the blood I'll have

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.690 
actually help dilate the blood I'll have
the<00:01:55.700> height<00:01:55.880> above<00:01:56.180> us<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:57.250> active<00:01:58.250> it<00:01:58.490> goes

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
the height above us and active it goes

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.070 
the height above us and active it goes
through<00:01:58.940> your<00:01:59.060> kidneys<00:01:59.539> and<00:01:59.690> other<00:01:59.780> tissues

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
and actually converts into our hardening

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.249 
and actually converts into our hardening
but<00:02:03.200> you<00:02:03.259> don't<00:02:03.410> me<00:02:03.470> no<00:02:03.560> answer<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.009> help<00:02:05.259> bring
