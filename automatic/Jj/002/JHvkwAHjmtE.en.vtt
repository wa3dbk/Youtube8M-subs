00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
domination here and I think this is

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.880 
domination here and I think this is
probably<00:00:27.150> gonna<00:00:27.720> be<00:00:27.840> my<00:00:28.080> favorite<00:00:28.439> game<00:00:28.650> mode

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890

even<00:00:29.340> though<00:00:29.550> gun<00:00:30.029> gun<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.199> monster<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.619> always

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
even though gun gun the monster I always

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.740 
even though gun gun the monster I always
want<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.250> say<00:00:32.369> gun<00:00:32.610> game<00:00:32.880> because<00:00:33.180> game<00:00:33.360> master

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
want to say gun game because game master

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.200 
want to say gun game because game master
doesn't<00:00:33.930> make<00:00:34.200> sense<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.820> used<00:00:36.059> to

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
doesn't make sense and so used to

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.380 
doesn't make sense and so used to
construct<00:00:37.160> but<00:00:38.160> anyway<00:00:38.579> conquest<00:00:39.239> domination

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
construct but anyway conquest domination

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.150 
construct but anyway conquest domination

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
scrapyard but I don't think I really

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.109 
scrapyard but I don't think I really
need<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.149> say<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.570> since<00:01:46.009> yeah<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.579> says<00:01:47.850> so

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
need to say that since yeah it says so

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.410 
need to say that since yeah it says so
in<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.450> title<00:01:49.430> I<00:01:50.430> think<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.119> gonna<00:01:51.240> be

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
in the title I think it's gonna be

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.990 
in the title I think it's gonna be
pretty<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.619> understand<00:01:53.070> but

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
pretty is it is the understand but

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.810 
pretty is it is the understand but
anyways<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.590> really<00:01:55.590> actually<00:01:55.829> like<00:01:56.310> how<00:01:56.610> they

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820
