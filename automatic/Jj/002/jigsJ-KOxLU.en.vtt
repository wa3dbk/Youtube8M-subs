hey guys I'm welcome back to another

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.110 
hey guys I'm welcome back to another
video<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:02.129> time<00:00:02.190> we're<00:00:02.520> gonna<00:00:02.639> be<00:00:02.820> looking

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
video this time we're gonna be looking

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.820 
video this time we're gonna be looking
at<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.510> new<00:00:03.720> cosmetic<00:00:04.319> glyphs<00:00:04.560> that<00:00:04.740> are

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
at the new cosmetic glyphs that are

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.190 
at the new cosmetic glyphs that are
coming<00:00:05.040> in<00:00:05.100> 5.4<00:00:05.759> now<00:00:06.420> in<00:00:06.660> order<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.930> fit<00:00:07.080> these

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
coming in 5.4 now in order to fit these

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.660 
coming in 5.4 now in order to fit these
all<00:00:07.379> into<00:00:07.529> videos<00:00:07.859> where<00:00:08.040> it<00:00:08.099> makes<00:00:08.250> sense<00:00:08.370> I'm

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
all into videos where it makes sense I'm

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.190 
all into videos where it makes sense I'm
gonna<00:00:08.820> split<00:00:09.030> it<00:00:09.179> up<00:00:09.240> into<00:00:09.420> three<00:00:09.630> parts<00:00:09.719> this

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
gonna split it up into three parts this

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.290 
gonna split it up into three parts this
first<00:00:10.530> part<00:00:10.769> will<00:00:10.889> be<00:00:11.010> focusing<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.910> classes

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
first part will be focusing the classes

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.669 
first part will be focusing the classes
that<00:00:12.330> really<00:00:12.630> only<00:00:12.750> have<00:00:12.900> one<00:00:13.080> or<00:00:13.230> two<00:00:13.259> glyphs

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
that really only have one or two glyphs

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.900 
that really only have one or two glyphs
and<00:00:13.920> things<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.130> are<00:00:14.280> pretty<00:00:14.400> easy<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.790> go

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
and things that are pretty easy to go

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.849 
and things that are pretty easy to go
over<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.540> next<00:00:15.809> time<00:00:15.960> I'll<00:00:16.139> be<00:00:16.289> looking<00:00:16.680> at

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
over the next time I'll be looking at

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.470 
over the next time I'll be looking at
the<00:00:17.070> priests<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.580> shaman<00:00:17.970> which<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.180> have

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
the priests and shaman which I have

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.130 
the priests and shaman which I have
quite<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.750> lot<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.199> added<00:00:20.070> stuff<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.990> number<00:00:21.990> one

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
quite a lot of added stuff so number one

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.540 
quite a lot of added stuff so number one
the<00:00:22.500> death<00:00:22.710> knight<00:00:22.949> they<00:00:23.100> have<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> new<00:00:23.430> one

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
the death knight they have a new one

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.609 
the death knight they have a new one
called<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.939> glyph<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.420> skeleton<00:00:25.050> now<00:00:25.470> this

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
called the glyph of skeleton now this

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.410 
called the glyph of skeleton now this
will<00:00:25.800> turn<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.010> raise<00:00:26.340> dead<00:00:26.609> spell<00:00:26.910> into<00:00:27.390> a

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
will turn the raise dead spell into a

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.120 
will turn the raise dead spell into a
skeleton<00:00:27.720> instead<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.349> ghoul<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.769> think<00:00:29.039> this

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
skeleton instead of a ghoul I think this

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.679 
skeleton instead of a ghoul I think this
is<00:00:29.220> pretty<00:00:29.340> cool<00:00:29.580> another<00:00:29.939> nice<00:00:30.179> thing<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.539> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
is pretty cool another nice thing is the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.630 
is pretty cool another nice thing is the
skeleton<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.410> it's<00:00:32.009> not<00:00:32.160> one<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.309> those<00:00:32.430> crappy

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
skeleton is it's not one of those crappy

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.220 
skeleton is it's not one of those crappy
skeletons<00:00:33.180> it's<00:00:33.360> like<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.480> proper<00:00:33.809> armored<00:00:34.110> one

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
skeletons it's like a proper armored one

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.470 
skeletons it's like a proper armored one
so<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.440> think<00:00:34.620> that's<00:00:34.770> pretty<00:00:35.040> damn<00:00:35.309> nice<00:00:35.610> next

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
so I think that's pretty damn nice next

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.060 
so I think that's pretty damn nice next
up<00:00:36.660> from<00:00:36.780> ages<00:00:37.140> we<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.500> whole<00:00:37.739> bunch<00:00:37.890> of

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
up from ages we have a whole bunch of

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.850 
up from ages we have a whole bunch of
water<00:00:38.280> elemental<00:00:38.850> ones<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:40.230> first<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.649> called

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
water elemental ones the first is called

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.410 
water elemental ones the first is called
the<00:00:40.980> glyph<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.370> condensation<00:00:41.969> now<00:00:42.239> this

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
the glyph of condensation now this

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.880 
the glyph of condensation now this
increases<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> size<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.530> your<00:00:43.680> water

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
increases the size of your water

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.549 
increases the size of your water
elemental<00:00:44.430> by<00:00:44.550> 40%<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:46.020> next<00:00:46.200> one's<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
elemental by 40% the next one's the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.440 
elemental by 40% the next one's the
glyph<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.980> evaporation<00:00:47.520> which<00:00:47.789> decreases<00:00:48.270> it

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
glyph of evaporation which decreases it

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.840 
glyph of evaporation which decreases it
by<00:00:48.539> 40%<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.320> finally<00:00:50.039> we<00:00:50.160> have<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> glyph<00:00:50.640> of

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
by 40% and finally we have the glyph of

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.020 
by 40% and finally we have the glyph of
the<00:00:51.059> unbound<00:00:51.510> elemental<00:00:52.079> which<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:53.030> replaces

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the unbound elemental which and replaces

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.310 
the unbound elemental which and replaces
the<00:00:54.149> model<00:00:54.420> with<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.870> an<00:00:54.960> unbound

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the model with that of an unbound

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.860 
the model with that of an unbound
elemental<00:00:55.860> now<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.039> unbound<00:00:56.430> one<00:00:56.670> is

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
elemental now the unbound one is

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
elemental now the unbound one is
actually<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:57.989> kind<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.289> North<00:00:58.500> roundish

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
actually that kind of North roundish

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.410 
actually that kind of North roundish
model<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.670> water<00:00:59.850> elemental

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
model of a water elemental

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.939 
model of a water elemental
or<00:01:00.600> maybe<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:00.989> calculus<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.829> two

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
or maybe it's calculus of one of the two

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.189 
or maybe it's calculus of one of the two
anyway<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.489> think<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.149> looks<00:01:03.329> very<00:01:03.570> good<00:01:03.690> so

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
anyway I think it looks very good so

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.070 
anyway I think it looks very good so
yeah<00:01:04.680> thumbs<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.339> for<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.729> next<00:01:06.720> up<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.049> have

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
yeah thumbs up for that next up we have

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.990 
yeah thumbs up for that next up we have
paladin's<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.130> have<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> glyph<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
paladin's so we have the glyph of the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.810 
paladin's so we have the glyph of the
exorcist<00:01:09.540> exorcism<00:01:10.170> pretty<00:01:10.350> much<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.860> it

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
exorcist exorcism pretty much and it

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.660 
exorcist exorcism pretty much and it
just<00:01:12.060> puts<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.659> spitzer<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.979> sort<00:01:14.640> of

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
just puts the spitzer like like sort of

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.789 
just puts the spitzer like like sort of
light<00:01:14.970> sort<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.420> line<00:01:15.689> between<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.290> paladin

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
light sort of line between the paladin

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.100 
light sort of line between the paladin
and<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.460> target<00:01:17.970> which<00:01:18.450> makes<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.780> look<00:01:18.900> like

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
and the target which makes it look like

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.770 
and the target which makes it look like
you're<00:01:19.259> removing<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.890> evil<00:01:20.280> cool<00:01:21.210> now<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
you're removing the evil cool now the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.570 
you're removing the evil cool now the
next<00:01:22.080> one<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.470> pillar<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.950> light<00:01:22.979> and

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
next one is the pillar of light and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.100 
next one is the pillar of light and
pretty<00:01:23.820> much<00:01:23.939> critical<00:01:24.299> heals<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.900> other

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
pretty much critical heals on other

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.170 
pretty much critical heals on other
players<00:01:25.350> we'll<00:01:25.650> put<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.009> big<00:01:26.460> light<00:01:26.729> pillar<00:01:27.000> on

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
players we'll put a big light pillar on

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.020 
players we'll put a big light pillar on
them<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.570> really<00:01:28.080> not<00:01:28.409> ginormous<00:01:29.130> next<00:01:29.909> up

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
them it's really not ginormous next up

a random weapon in your primary bag so
as<00:02:00.210> an<00:02:00.840> example<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.469> think<00:02:01.500> my<00:02:02.070> intern<00:02:02.340> from<00:02:02.490> a

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
as an example I think my intern from a

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.910 
as an example I think my intern from a
sword<00:02:02.820> into<00:02:03.060> an<00:02:03.180> axe<00:02:03.360> or<00:02:03.719> an<00:02:04.320> accent<00:02:04.680> ass<00:02:04.770> or

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
sword into an axe or an accent ass or

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.950 
sword into an axe or an accent ass or
something<00:02:05.189> like<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.640> then<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.689> turned

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
something like that and then it turned

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.050 
something like that and then it turned
from<00:02:07.320> whatever<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.740> was<00:02:07.920> into<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.429> fishing<00:02:08.789> pole

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
from whatever it was into a fishing pole

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.960 
from whatever it was into a fishing pole
which<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.720> thought<00:02:09.899> was<00:02:10.050> pretty<00:02:10.110> cool<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:11.129> over

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
which I thought was pretty cool so over

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.340 
which I thought was pretty cool so over
these<00:02:12.150> are<00:02:12.240> just<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.570> fun<00:02:12.810> little<00:02:13.020> glyphs

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
that are meant just to throw a little

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.980 
that are meant just to throw a little
bit<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.850> spice<00:02:15.060> into<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.420> game<00:02:15.600> they're<00:02:15.810> not

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
bit of spice into the game they're not

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.070 
bit of spice into the game they're not
not<00:02:16.980> ginormous<00:02:17.640> but<00:02:17.910> hey<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.600> think<00:02:18.780> it's<00:02:19.020> a

not ginormous but hey I think it's a

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.930 
not ginormous but hey I think it's a
pretty<00:02:19.230> cool<00:02:19.410> addition<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:20.430> that's<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.820> for
