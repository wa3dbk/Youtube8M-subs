00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
water comes out when we start filling

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.119 
water comes out when we start filling
them<00:00:56.850> up<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.420> there's<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.840> outlet<00:00:58.199> pipe<00:00:58.440> and

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129

them up so there's the outlet pipe and
just<00:00:59.340> above<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.910> the<00:00:59.969> tap<00:01:00.949> turn<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.129> to

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
just above it is the tap turn that to

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.660 
just above it is the tap turn that to
the<00:01:02.489> off<00:01:02.550> position<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:04.189> we'll<00:01:05.189> go<00:01:05.339> inside

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
the off position and we'll go inside

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.929 
the off position and we'll go inside
we're<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.180> use<00:01:06.330> Milton<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.700> clean<00:01:08.700> his

caravan<00:01:15.330> stuff<00:01:15.630> such<00:01:15.869> as<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.220> pure<00:01:17.220> clean<00:01:17.490> I

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
caravan stuff such as a pure clean I

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.520 
caravan stuff such as a pure clean I
think<00:01:17.850> but<00:01:18.330> then<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.659> really<00:01:18.990> cheap<00:01:19.200> it's

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
think but then this is really cheap it's

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.399 
think but then this is really cheap it's
two<00:01:19.680> pound<00:01:19.979> for<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.250> 500<00:01:20.880> mil<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:22.229> have

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
two pound for that 500 mil and I have

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.539 
two pound for that 500 mil and I have
read<00:01:22.560> somewhere<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.890> used<00:01:23.189> today<00:01:23.400> you

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
read somewhere that used today you

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.820 
read somewhere that used today you
should<00:01:24.180> put<00:01:24.360> like<00:01:24.390> 300<00:01:24.900> mils<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.560> think

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
should put like 300 mils in but I think

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.190 
should put like 300 mils in but I think
I'm<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:26.009> going<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.220> pour<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.520> all<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:27.840> to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
