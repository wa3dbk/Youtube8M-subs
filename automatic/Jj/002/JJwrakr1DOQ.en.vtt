00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:52.229 
shada fear schufa shuffle is LP so the

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:54.560

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
easier then I have a shader packs folder

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.510 
easier then I have a shader packs folder
with<00:02:11.220> two<00:02:11.670> shader<00:02:11.970> packs<00:02:12.300> in<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:13.340> so<00:02:14.340> let's

to go to where you have the mods laying

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.550 
to go to where you have the mods laying
around<00:02:48.180> i<00:02:48.360> have<00:02:48.570> them<00:02:48.720> out<00:02:48.840> of<00:02:48.870> my<00:02:48.990> desktop<00:02:49.530> so

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
around i have them out of my desktop so

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.990 
around i have them out of my desktop so
i'm<00:02:49.800> just<00:02:49.830> going<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.220> choose<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.430> choose<00:02:50.820> them

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
i'm just going to choose to choose them

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.450 
i'm just going to choose to choose them
from<00:02:51.180> here<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.600> then<00:02:52.200> i<00:02:52.290> need<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.620> add<00:02:52.830> up<00:02:53.190> to

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
from here and then i need to add up to

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.540 
from here and then i need to add up to
find<00:02:53.700> first<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.380> secondly<00:02:55.380> at<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:56.220> shaders

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
find first and secondly at the shaders

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.120 
find first and secondly at the shaders
mod<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.970> it's<00:02:57.480> very<00:02:57.690> important<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.200> needs<00:02:58.950> to

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
mod and it's very important it needs to

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.180 
mod and it's very important it needs to
be<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.310> way<00:02:59.640> else<00:02:59.820> it<00:02:59.970> won't<00:03:00.150> work<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.980> then

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
be this way else it won't work so then

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.730 
be this way else it won't work so then
hit<00:03:02.340> OK<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:02.820> choose<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.230> configuration

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
hit OK and choose to the configuration

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:13.460 
hit OK and choose to the configuration
and<00:03:05.100> lock<00:03:05.580> in<00:03:07.820> so<00:03:10.340> that<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.490> basically<00:03:12.470> it's

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
and lock in so that is basically it's

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.790 
and lock in so that is basically it's
very<00:03:13.680> easy<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:14.010> install<00:03:14.400> actually<00:03:14.850> oh<00:03:15.800> one

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
very easy to install actually oh one

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.130 
very easy to install actually oh one
thing<00:03:16.830> yet<00:03:17.240> to<00:03:18.240> install<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.570> shader<00:03:18.840> packs

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
thing yet to install a shader packs

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.100 
thing yet to install a shader packs
you're<00:03:19.380> going<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.710> options<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.900> shaders<00:03:21.900> and

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
you're going to options and shaders and

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.280 
you're going to options and shaders and
then<00:03:22.590> open<00:03:23.040> shader<00:03:23.250> packs<00:03:23.490> folder<00:03:23.880> so<00:03:24.840> what<00:03:25.110> in

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
then open shader packs folder so what in

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.710 
then open shader packs folder so what in
here<00:03:25.530> you're<00:03:25.650> going<00:03:25.770> to<00:03:25.920> say<00:03:26.100> all<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.850> shader

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
here you're going to say all the shader

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.620 
here you're going to say all the shader
packs<00:03:28.020> from<00:03:28.350> here<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:28.860> just<00:03:29.550> drag<00:03:30.000> them<00:03:30.360> in

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
packs from here and just drag them in

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.770 
packs from here and just drag them in
like<00:03:31.110> so<00:03:31.410> but<00:03:32.840> I'll<00:03:33.840> see<00:03:34.020> you<00:03:34.800> can<00:03:34.950> fight<00:03:35.190> find

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
like so but I'll see you can fight find

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.510 
like so but I'll see you can fight find
extremely<00:03:36.780> many<00:03:37.110> shader<00:03:37.740> packs<00:03:38.070> on<00:03:38.310> the

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
extremely many shader packs on the

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.460 
extremely many shader packs on the
Minecraft<00:03:38.940> Forum<00:03:39.270> and<00:03:39.540> stuff<00:03:39.990> like<00:03:40.140> that<00:03:40.200> and

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
Minecraft Forum and stuff like that and

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.730 
Minecraft Forum and stuff like that and
then<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.430> just<00:03:41.610> put<00:03:41.970> them<00:03:42.090> in<00:03:42.240> here<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.740> no

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
then you just put them in here and no

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.930 
then you just put them in here and no
matter<00:03:43.890> what<00:03:44.010> version<00:03:44.459> there<00:03:44.640> they<00:03:44.820> will

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
matter what version there they will

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.540 
matter what version there they will
probably<00:03:45.540> work<00:03:45.750> anyways<00:03:46.380> like<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.280> sonic

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
probably work anyways like the sonic

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.040 
probably work anyways like the sonic
ether's<00:03:47.670> one<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.060> think<00:03:48.209> is<00:03:48.420> what<00:03:48.570> make<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.900> was

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
ether's one I think is what make it was

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.290 
ether's one I think is what make it was
made<00:03:49.230> for<00:03:49.440> one<00:03:50.010> point<00:03:50.310> four<00:03:50.550> point<00:03:50.580> seven<00:03:50.970> but

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
made for one point four point seven but

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.360 
made for one point four point seven but
it<00:03:51.420> still<00:03:51.690> works<00:03:51.900> in<00:03:52.310> 1.5<00:03:53.310> so<00:03:55.190> once<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.280> have

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
it still works in 1.5 so once you have

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.920 
it still works in 1.5 so once you have
done<00:03:56.520> that<00:03:56.580> you<00:03:56.820> can<00:03:56.850> choose<00:03:57.180> from<00:03:57.420> them<00:03:57.660> here

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
done that you can choose from them here

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.860 
done that you can choose from them here
so<00:03:58.080> we<00:03:58.740> have<00:03:58.860> to<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.550> Rue<00:03:59.820> du<00:04:00.030> plate<00:04:00.390> Ruto

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
so we have to the Rue du plate Ruto

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.970 
so we have to the Rue du plate Ruto
place<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:02.420> this<00:04:03.420> it<00:04:03.780> looks<00:04:04.290> like<00:04:04.500> this<00:04:04.709> and

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
place and this it looks like this and

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.130 
place and this it looks like this and
then<00:04:05.190> you<00:04:05.220> can<00:04:05.370> place<00:04:05.700> Cape<00:04:06.090> option<00:04:06.630> shaders

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
then you can place Cape option shaders

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.640 
then you can place Cape option shaders
and<00:04:07.170> take<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.310> sonic<00:04:08.580> ether's<00:04:08.700> one<00:04:09.410> and<00:04:10.410> also

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
and take the sonic ether's one and also

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.610 
and take the sonic ether's one and also
have<00:04:10.800> that<00:04:11.010> so<00:04:11.930> that<00:04:12.930> is<00:04:13.080> it<00:04:13.110> for<00:04:13.290> today<00:04:13.440> guys

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
have that so that is it for today guys
