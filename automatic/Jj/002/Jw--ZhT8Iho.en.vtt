we<00:00:10.130> won't

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.780 

keeping<00:00:56.240> keeping<00:00:57.240> pressurized<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:59.640> only

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
keeping keeping pressurized the only

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.960 
keeping keeping pressurized the only
thing<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.270> was<00:01:00.390> leaking<00:01:00.780> was<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.970> don't

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
thing that was leaking was this I don't

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.060 
thing that was leaking was this I don't
know<00:01:03.060> what<00:01:03.330> thick<00:01:03.630> that<00:01:03.810> goes<00:01:04.050> to<00:01:04.670> let<00:01:05.670> me<00:01:05.790> see

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.640 

I<00:01:10.530> think<00:01:11.530> this<00:01:11.710> goes<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.190> air<00:01:12.340> box<00:01:12.610> and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
I think this goes to the air box and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.960 
I think this goes to the air box and
when<00:01:14.650> I<00:01:14.710> was<00:01:14.800> boost<00:01:15.040> leak<00:01:15.250> testing<00:01:15.670> it<00:01:15.790> though

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
when I was boost leak testing it though

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.430 
when I was boost leak testing it though
there<00:01:16.360> was<00:01:16.600> only<00:01:16.810> coming<00:01:16.990> up<00:01:17.200> through<00:01:17.380> here

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
there was only coming up through here

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.620 
there was only coming up through here
now<00:01:18.280> that<00:01:18.430> I<00:01:18.490> capped<00:01:18.760> it<00:01:19.740> no<00:01:20.740> air<00:01:20.920> leaking<00:01:21.730> out

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630
