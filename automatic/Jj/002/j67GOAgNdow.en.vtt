00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello guys this time I bring you a 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.420
 tutorial on how to make the mate 360 good 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.190
 this year the 360 under the leg is not 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.950
 good and you're looking will practice 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.650
 with what players to do and good as much as 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.620
 easy as I do not want to go player by 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.810
 player watching 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.150
 what player has skill has 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.060
 equipped stability could catch up to 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.530
 Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.330
 the historical ones and I will equip the 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:33.710
 360 skill 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.379
 and 360 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.500
 athletic I think it's the other and good 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:44.280
 this so you can see how it's done 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.110
 it's here by editing the player 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.950
 the firm I think they want styles to see 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.920
 where was our trend engraved tome 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.930
 it's not the style l equip is tomatoes 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.080
 Well, I'm going to use this because 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.489
 then in the my player surely when 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.020
 the player progressing the team 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.720
 I will do some of these skills 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.430
 mate and good I want 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.560
 I want to learn to do before 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.840
 to train at work I did not get hurt because 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.220
 there is still enough 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.020
 Y 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.520
 good as they have changed this 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.350
 year the controls because here I leave you how 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.520
 it's basically done by running with r2 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.870
 keep pressed square while you 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.960
 you approach basket 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:29.050
 and then make a with the left stick 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.950
 do as the turn as the 360 now you 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.189
 I will put a couple of examples 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.659
 and not against a player who was 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:41.110
 equipped I decided to equip myself to jordan and 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.760
 do it here in training mode 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.650
 now shows a couple of examples of how 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.180
 you see how it would be done 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.530
 well once practice is not 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.870
 complicated at first it costs but 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.520
 good as everything is a pity that they have 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.780
 removed the 360 under the leg because 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.780
 it was quite spectacular 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.060
 and you will not see anything like how it's done 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.850
 the mate 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.740
 but good basically it consists of 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.329
 start with the r2 running when 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.950
 we came to the free throw course to the square 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.630
 and make the circle with the stick 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.970
 left so nothing left you another 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.300
 example and nothing guys have fun like 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.709
 forever 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.709
 bye bye to the boys
