00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.660
 we started with the bases of the cake 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.510
 we put the cookies in a bowl and the 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.490
 we crush very well that they stay in 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.830
 the smallest possible pieces almost 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.810
 powdered 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.850
 this step will take us a little bit but 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.850
 after a rich basis 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.930
 We need something like that left 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.790
 fine pieces to those who 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.170
 we will add the butter we mix it 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.170
 all up to get a mass 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.280
 to later put it at the bottom of the mold 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.230
 that we have chosen these long tenths 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.180
 between my sister and me for the day of the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.260
 mothers so we decided to use the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.260
 heart shaped mold 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.970
 in this step the only thing we will do is 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.180
 press well to get a base 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.180
 firm 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.740
 then we reserve them in the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.630
 frigo and we start with the lights 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.850
 the first thing to separate the yolks from the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.840
 clear of all eggs and preserve 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.840
 the whites in the refrigerator 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.979
 then mix the yolks in a bowl 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.979
 with the sugar until it is homogeneous 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.130
 we put the three chocolates in 3 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.170
 different bowls and we melted them by 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.890
 course separately we what 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.890
 We did the bathroom Maria 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.690
 then we distribute the mixture of 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.220
 the yolks and sugar in each of the 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.220
 bowls and mix very well 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.329
 here the chocolates emanate from making a 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.739
 little but then gelatin fixes 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.739
 Ok so do not worry 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.600
 now we pass the three sheets of 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.530
 gelatin for a little cold water and the 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.530
 We dilute in hot water 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.390
 when dissolved, we add them to the 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.049
 chocolate mix distributing between 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.049
 the three bowls 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.350
 we mix everything again 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.880
 now we get the whites of the cold and the 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.319
 we ride to the point of snow for this only 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.319
 one thing patience 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.659
 once we have it, we distribute them 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.560
 between the three chocolates next to 250 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.560
 grams of whipped cream 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.050
 we did not have the liquid cream 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.700
 to ride but if you have 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.700
 better to use the other 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.859
 we mix everything with movements 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.699
 envelopes and with much care 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.699
 so that it is not dismantled 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.450
 we take the mold out of the cold with the base and 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.010
 pour the full of chocolate in this 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.900
 case the first thing is white chocolate 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.389
 but I advise you to leave it for 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.310
 the last for the top part and in 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:30.050
 place the dark chocolate that 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.240
 it's harder and it weighs more 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.759
 We put in the cold let a little while that the 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.539
 set the mousse out and pour the 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:37.539
 next chocolate 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.970
 we do the same with this layer and we throw 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.970
 the last 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:00.610
 once all be filled mold 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.919
 We put in the cold and hope that it sets 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.689
 two or three hours last one 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.300
 we take out we unmold we decorate our 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:09.610
 taste and serve I hope you like it 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.899
 It was delicious do not forget to go through 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.899
 the info box and see you soon
