let's see what happens if you mess

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.280 
let's see what happens if you mess
around<00:01:09.310> with<00:01:09.700> player<00:01:09.940> support<00:01:10.330> may<00:01:11.110> bit

and that is something we work very hard
on

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.300 

ok<00:01:44.780> this<00:01:44.930> time<00:01:45.140> lesson<00:01:45.710> what<00:01:45.799> happens<00:01:46.100> if<00:01:46.189> we

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
ok this time lesson what happens if we

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.279 
ok this time lesson what happens if we
adjust<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.729> support<00:01:47.060> range<00:01:47.299> push<00:01:48.049> it<00:01:48.170> up<00:01:48.259> to

adjust the support range push it up to

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.490 
adjust the support range push it up to
100<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:49.039> players<00:01:49.340> provide<00:01:49.670> personal<00:01:50.090> support

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
100 and players provide personal support

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
push it towards zero and the player

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.430 
push it towards zero and the player
spread<00:01:55.280> out

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.470 

we<00:02:02.440> set<00:02:02.650> to<00:02:02.800> 10<00:02:03.010> this<00:02:03.160> time<00:02:03.400> it<00:02:04.120> seems<00:02:04.390> the

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
we set to 10 this time it seems the

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.850 
we set to 10 this time it seems the
perfect<00:02:04.630> length<00:02:05.020> for<00:02:05.110> playing<00:02:05.410> long<00:02:05.590> balls
