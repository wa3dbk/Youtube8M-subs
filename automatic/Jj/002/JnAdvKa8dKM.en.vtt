moon which is the last song in the album

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.030 
moon which is the last song in the album
it's<00:02:25.900> probably<00:02:26.140> like<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.410> darkest<00:02:26.890> song

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
it's probably like the darkest song

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.290 
it's probably like the darkest song
we've<00:02:27.190> ever<00:02:27.340> written<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:29.760> late<00:02:30.760> night<00:02:30.940> which

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
we've ever written and late night which

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.710 
we've ever written and late night which
is<00:02:31.330> in<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.600> middle<00:02:31.810> of<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:31.990> album<00:02:32.320> and<00:02:33.720> that's

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
is in the middle of the album and that's

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.410 
is in the middle of the album and that's
like<00:02:34.980> this<00:02:35.980> kind<00:02:36.190> of<00:02:36.220> classic<00:02:36.700> soul<00:02:36.940> song<00:02:37.240> but

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
like this kind of classic soul song but

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.640 
like this kind of classic soul song but
like<00:02:37.750> it's<00:02:37.900> been<00:02:38.080> turned<00:02:38.290> inside<00:02:38.620> out

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
like it's been turned inside out

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.050 
like it's been turned inside out
everything's<00:02:39.220> wrong<00:02:39.460> it's<00:02:39.850> all<00:02:39.940> like

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
everything's wrong it's all like

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.500 
everything's wrong it's all like
topsy-turvy<00:02:40.480> but<00:02:41.440> it<00:02:41.530> still<00:02:41.820> is<00:02:42.820> power<00:02:43.180> like<00:02:43.390> I

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
topsy-turvy but it still is power like I

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.190 
topsy-turvy but it still is power like I
think<00:02:43.690> it's<00:02:43.780> powerful<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:45.790> like<00:02:46.330> that<00:02:46.480> one<00:02:46.570> and

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
think it's powerful I like that one and

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.450 
think it's powerful I like that one and
there's<00:02:47.380> that<00:02:47.440> one<00:02:47.560> perhaps<00:02:47.830> peg<00:02:48.220> for<00:02:48.400> the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
there's that one perhaps peg for the

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.180 
there's that one perhaps peg for the
next<00:02:48.640> single<00:02:49.470> could<00:02:50.470> that<00:02:50.590> one<00:02:50.710> be<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.950> next

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
next single could that one be the next

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
next single could that one be the next
single<00:02:51.340> from<00:02:51.490> the<00:02:51.700> album

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
single from the album
