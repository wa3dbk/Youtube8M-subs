this is a cube look at papas be so

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.370 
this is a cube look at papas be so
here's<00:02:52.530> an<00:02:52.680> edge<00:02:54.650> um<00:02:56.570> this<00:02:57.570> has<00:02:57.750> ball<00:02:57.959> bearings

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
here's an edge um this has ball bearings

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.819 
here's an edge um this has ball bearings
in<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.560> too<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.760> here's<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.120> colonel<00:03:00.829> has

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.190 

there's<00:03:06.800> another<00:03:06.980> corner<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:08.360> here<00:03:08.870> is<00:03:09.019> the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
there's another corner and here is the

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.440 
there's another corner and here is the
core<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:10.780> these<00:03:11.780> big<00:03:12.140> pieces<00:03:12.349> that<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.610> can't

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
core so these big pieces that you can't

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
core so these big pieces that you can't
really<00:03:15.129> push<00:03:16.129> are<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:17.209> core<00:03:17.540> pieces<00:03:20.470> see

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
really push are the core pieces see

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.280 
really push are the core pieces see
these<00:03:22.120> triangular<00:03:23.120> looking<00:03:23.480> pieces<00:03:23.720> right

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
these triangular looking pieces right

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.559 
these triangular looking pieces right
here<00:03:24.819> are<00:03:25.819> the<00:03:26.060> core<00:03:26.360> pieces<00:03:28.209> let<00:03:29.209> me<00:03:29.330> just<00:03:29.450> get
