00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.469
 d 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.570
 angel david says health hello jose how 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.789
 you're hoping that well a week ago 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.279
 I bought a food in disks for rich 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.380
 but when I threw them into the aquarium of 13 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.900
 2 liters I realized that my time 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.360
 Oscar 500 piranhas had eaten all 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.610
 the algae disks and they did not leave anything 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.840
 to my fringe my question is will hurt them 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.910
 in the seaweed meal to my fish 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.700
 carnivores greetings from mexico and 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.559
 black kisses many fish despite 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.450
 being carnivores also need input 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.520
 vegetable such as oscar and 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.110
 certain varieties will say then not 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.059
 it's bad for them and the case would be 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.920
 throw the vegetable pills at the same 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.019
 time a juicy meal for the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.120
 carnivores and so from time to full to 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.829
 comérsela castilla anyway are 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.420
 three species that should not come together 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.850
 for obvious problems 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.859
 rafa coat original note one says yes of 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.899
 done and hello jose I have the groupies 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.210
 females two cumshots the sardines two 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.760
 nuns and two from behind lemon the case is 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.080
 that the bukis do not eat I put some 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.570
 lozenges that dissolve in water 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.670
 one of them is pregnant that I can 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.620
 do so that with this high respond 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.090
 in the video but questions 4 have you had 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.860
 lucky because you've reached at least the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.280
 6 the best would be to try with a 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.409
 food 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.690
 and if not then I could freeze and then 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.280
 also fish or seafood porridge and 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.020
 vegetable that would be the second most 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.090
 attractive to them and you can also 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.770
 try it with lyophilized food but 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.970
 Watch that you have no other symptoms for 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.310
 rule out diseases 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.229
 Edward Regner says hello I'm new but 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.450
 already make my fish tank and the keyboard is 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.880
 perfect but I still have many doubts 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.149
 according to my times I have pink zebras 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.060
 yellow greens and grated blue mupis 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.549
 tiger barbs and oranges with white I think 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.450
 that are albino two races of fish eyes 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.710
 red two silver shark four polishers 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.320
 camouflaged a baby color 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.899
 2t after the father and two catfish are 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.970
 guys but we retired because they started 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.800
 to devour zebras and start vall 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.229
 of doing is one meter by forty and 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.659
 six centimeters by 36 centimeters that 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.399
 is wrong and says postscript my wife and I 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.470
 we love your videos and they have helped us 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.569
 thank you very much we go up and create well 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.550
 our cold thank you and after here 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.800
 the pictures of this fish that is very beautiful 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.840
 and the aquarium is a very nice catfish 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.730
 but it was expected to eat other 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.470
 Sometimes although they seem peaceful part of 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.250
 your diet is based on eating other 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.380
 fishes 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.510
 I tell you that the lips with the passage of 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.270
 time they are getting worse of character for 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.250
 your 165 liters have a clear 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.440
 overpopulation all varieties of 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.720
 lips including the silver shark should 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.790
 keep in aquariums greater than 200 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.380
 liters and try to keep them in 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.910
 Separate aquariums should not 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.560
 share aquarium with most 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.360
 fish that you have so you would have to 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.220
 prepare the aquarium for one of the 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.290
 lips and staying only with 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.209
 cebritas and barbos or on the other hand 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.070
 get rid of the lips even if 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.050
 you prefer to continue with them there are no longer 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.390
 I say nothing you have two possible types of 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.489
 aquariums one of calm fish leaving 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.770
 to the bukis and back you included the 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.930
 red eyes and the runners and taking out the 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.180
 rest all an aquarium of active fish 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.880
 As we have said before, it would be the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.590
 barbs blessed ones maybe in the see if 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.660
 has a personality in conditions 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.739
 to live with them because she governs 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.540
 Álvarez says jose 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.489
 to see if you could tell me what plant is 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.350
 This and their care have told me in the 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.360
 store that is fast growing but 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.720
 I would not know what it's called is the red and 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.000
 see you one of these cameras sucks a disc 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.810
 I think the plant is alternating was 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.970
 reinick and what if it should have more 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.220
 red tones but for that you need a 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.170
 contribution of co2 iron and support with 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.180
 nitrates and phosphates although they are the 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.010
 dangerous elements to add because 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.870
 can bring algae is a plant 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.320
 quite demanding the best water for 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.170
 she is in 37 degrees of th and 8 degrees 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.570
 gh and even lower and a temperature 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.460
 ideal of about 26 degrees the world of 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.650
 aquariums says hello jose I would like that 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.959
 tell me how you see my aquarium 60 liters 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.670
 thank you for your time seems to be in 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.590
 perfect conditions and also the 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.480
 plants are very well placed is 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.370
 say the rain is in the area more 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.810
 dark aquarium that is best for 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.150
 She and the rest of the plants that need 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.860
 more lighting are in the area more 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.930
 lit up but do not forget to have 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.090
 some type of subscriber in the aquarium or 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.890
 pay at each water change with 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.080
 macronutrients and make big changes 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.700

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.540
 bullshit that you can also ask for and 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.590
 I have the worst 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.240
 leaves a portugal ryder better elaborated and

 guitar to the computer and as degree already

 that many of the ten artists at 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.050
 principle we do not have an idea of ​​how 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.520
 connect it to the computer so you have 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.530
 an acceptable sound and when 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.479
 we get usually usually have 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.310
