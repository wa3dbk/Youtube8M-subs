00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.350
 Y 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.270
 and what happens kid boy to hibernate and 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.880
 here we are in a new video in this 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.950
 case of volcano equal good we started in 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.340
 a pretty good map the truth we are 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.040
 in hell shadow and like the truth and I 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.449
 I make the wool so fast because I've decided 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.030
 leave everything not to cut 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.010
 directly as appropriate then in 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.870
 its not all good then we're going to 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.610
 start the map many you will know in 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.280
 this case I went on the right side 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.230
 you can see that there are two sides and what 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.200
 try then is to shoot those who are 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.120
 making a bridge on the other side not of the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.010
 side that does not port us because because 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.920
 it's much easier when shooting 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.450
 balloons also in the other would help 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.809
 bridge or in this case I have seen that 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.450
 they could shoot us and then basically 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.370
 I have done it I would sell it a barrier 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.379
 not so they do not throw us there to help 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.820
 a little bit of equipment and have more 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.250
 ease then to continue building 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.500
 the bridge in this case was putting 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.470
 those barriers that there is one here killed him 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.649
 perfect it was a bit a bit easy to 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.450
 sb that death not good of one that goes 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.130
 over there I see that they already kill him so 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.649
 not necessary 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.240
 more to defend so good we're going to 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.009
 eat a little bit I do not know why I 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.600
 they shoot or from where I think here of the 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.700
 top part so as I see the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.610
 top part directly we're going 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.470
 up and I take the opportunity to do more 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.439
 big the bridge as I always tell you 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.970
 that you can help the team easier going 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.009
 to be the victory is even the can 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.840
 give so good here I play it a lot 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.759
 the truth I am going to two of 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.189
 face shot one shot to another but I 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.409
 they end up killing that yes it is more apart from 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.600
 that killed one now the other one drops so 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.369
 I have not done it that bad either, it does not give me 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.470
 played but I did not do anything wrong 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.990
 then well I will take advantage now 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.610
 I'm going to go to the left I've seen that 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.020
 three were running and I say around here 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.819
 I have to go and obviously they come out 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.429
 running people there I have to god 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.869
 then good directly I put 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.380
 little blocks over here I see that there is a 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:14.069
 bridge I go up here and directly shot 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.840
 go ahead here I see an effect has decided 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.760
 load me what I obviously do not want to have 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.560
 problems after they follow me and any 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.720
 thing and I go directly to the beach 12 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.099
 here there should be people defending 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.799
 I do not know why there is not 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.910
 so good took advantage I break the 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.110
 cobweb and 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.840
 running towards nothing very well 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.600
 we arrive the first ones we take the wool 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.150
 around here I put my overalls the bow that you 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.010
 The truth is pretty good and I put on 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.020
 the wool down below 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.060
 I think here they also gave you apples 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.470
 golden not where are they where are they 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.690
 the golden apples where are my 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.520
 manzanitas there are behind so 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.490
 well we also have apple trees out there 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.290
 as I prepare little and rarely not 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.060
 There are people like I already tell you because 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.090
 normally on this map there is more 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.040
 defending from the normal so good 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.440
 I just broke this in case I had to 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.970
 come back to have it much more easily and 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.700
 here I am checking which is the best 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.560
 from the sides here as you can see then 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.530
 the son on the right side and I'm going 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.750
 directly towards the bridge I do not step 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.120
 the people there are going pretty fast and 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.040
 here look at the bridge what I do 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.750
 stopped jumping for a moment in case 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.720
 give me an arrow and not go out 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.820
 fired flying not then now now 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.459
 it's easy to say and place anything 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.350
 attention here because I give a one 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.660
 somersault and they shoot me is pretty 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.980
 epic but good here we have the wool and 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.349
 as I say 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.849
 it's easy enough to do it and more if you do not 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.190
 there are people defending that in this case 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.120
 It is complicated but something happens 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.190
 good 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.319
 has lasted three minutes and peak is the 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.239
 departure as I already tell you has not been 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.099
 very long and that's why I decided to put it 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.930
 to full full full so 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.330
 good kids I hope you like this 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.620
 it's episode number 5 but hey 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.170
 I hope you liked me 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.569
 leave your ideas in the description and 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.569
 see you in the next video bye bye
