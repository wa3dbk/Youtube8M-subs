00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
doesn't seem to to work so hopefully

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.289

they have a fix for this hopefully it's

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.120 
they have a fix for this hopefully it's
just<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.750> bug<00:01:22.080> because<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.770> amount<00:01:22.979> of

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
just a bug because of the amount of

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.240 
just a bug because of the amount of
people<00:01:23.360> and<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:25.380> know<00:01:25.500> trying<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.860> connect<00:01:26.130> to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
people and you know trying to connect to

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.950 
people and you know trying to connect to
the<00:01:26.340> servers<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.970> also<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> software<00:01:27.780> update

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
the servers is also a software update

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.420 
the servers is also a software update
which<00:01:28.350> I'm<00:01:28.470> sure<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.799> using<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.280> lot<00:01:29.310> of

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
which I'm sure is using up a lot of

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.870 
which I'm sure is using up a lot of
bandwidth<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.689> if<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.799> guys<00:01:31.950> have<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> solution

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
bandwidth so if you guys have a solution

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.810 
bandwidth so if you guys have a solution
of<00:01:33.119> how<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.329> fix<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.900> make<00:01:34.500> sure<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:35.460> you
