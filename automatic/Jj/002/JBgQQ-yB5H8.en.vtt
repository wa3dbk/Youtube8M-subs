00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.480
 score pleats roof she could 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.720

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.090
 that is, covered the inner tent and 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:29.570
 air flows freely there 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:30.640
 Next is the door to the inner 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.640
 a tent 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.640
 deaf 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.970

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.920
 scary as Moscow . protect you from 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.390
 insects

 well actually let's reboot 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.630
 inside 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.510
 means we have two pockets 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.510
 on the sides 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.790
 there are two ventilation windows behind and 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.650
 plus the internal itself has fallen. made 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.660
 breathable fabric respectively 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.070
 condensation on your head you no longer fall 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.680
 would be a leash quite comfortable for 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:32.660
 being in it 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:35.240
 sound rather large man principle 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.850
 all we can and the tents said 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.830
 Conveniently comfortable and easy now I tell you 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.140
 I'll show you how this stick is easy to assemble. 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.350
 then pay attention when assembling 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:49.400
 door tents must be open to 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:52.210
 air is more from the inside which is accordingly 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.210
 remove skin 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:08.540
 assembling a tent is easy 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:12.470
 take the front does not run away 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:15.250
 connect the back top 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.710
 rear bottom all brought it together 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.770
 They set a tent for 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.950
 here is this quit folded you met 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:28.840
 here and so just took a look three parts 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:32.410
 tents you get two rings and 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.410
 shaman king 1 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:39.809
 1 and the leash itself is difficult here 

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:43.259
 there is as i mentioned at the very beginning 

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:46.259
 fixing strap which just need 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:49.699
 wrap around but not like this 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:52.699
 convoluted i would say hand movement 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.699
 gathered 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.630
 removed the tent 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.630
 default 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.410
 the main thing is not to forget the cats 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:47.830
 but now it can 

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:51.100
 assembly took 2 minutes disassembly passed 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:54.310
 actually almost instantly 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.020
 Here it is convenient and very gender. for 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:59.640
 short trips recommend 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.640
