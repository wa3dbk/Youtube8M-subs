on Mars 3 but there wasn't one for old

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.920 
on Mars 3 but there wasn't one for old
school<00:00:11.160> for<00:00:11.490> like<00:00:11.610> several<00:00:11.940> hours<00:00:12.420> which<00:00:12.720> I

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:12.930 
school for like several hours which I

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.360 
school for like several hours which I
was<00:00:13.050> gonna<00:00:13.170> bug<00:00:13.500> down<00:00:13.680> at<00:00:13.800> that<00:00:13.920> like<00:00:14.220> me

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
was gonna bug down at that like me

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.860 
was gonna bug down at that like me
personally<00:00:14.550> I<00:00:14.790> would<00:00:14.940> think<00:00:15.240> making

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
personally I would think making

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.750 
personally I would think making
something<00:00:16.080> in-game<00:00:16.650> for<00:00:16.950> old<00:00:17.130> school<00:00:17.460> be<00:00:17.730> a

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
something in-game for old school be a

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.580 
something in-game for old school be a
whole<00:00:18.090> lot<00:00:18.120> easier<00:00:18.600> compared<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.440> making

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
whole lot easier compared to making

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.730 
whole lot easier compared to making
something<00:00:19.980> in<00:00:20.369> rs3<00:00:21.240> inserting<00:00:22.200> graphics

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
something in rs3 inserting graphics

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.070 
something in rs3 inserting graphics
modelling<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.640> kind<00:00:24.030> of<00:00:24.060> stuff<00:00:24.300> um<00:00:24.510> there's

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
modelling that kind of stuff um there's

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.500 
modelling that kind of stuff um there's
all<00:00:25.199> sort<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.440> fact<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:26.090> like<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.360> my

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
all sort of fact that like this is my

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.740 
all sort of fact that like this is my
personal<00:00:27.990> view<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.199> think<00:00:28.820> in<00:00:29.820> my<00:00:29.970> opinion<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
personal view I think in my opinion the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.170 
personal view I think in my opinion the
developers<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:31.740> old<00:00:31.949> school<00:00:32.070> are<00:00:32.399> more<00:00:32.730> likely

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
developers in old school are more likely

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.729 
developers in old school are more likely
to<00:00:33.360> actually<00:00:33.510> have<00:00:33.840> fun<00:00:34.110> with<00:00:34.350> what<00:00:34.560> they<00:00:34.680> do

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
to actually have fun with what they do

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.990 
to actually have fun with what they do
or<00:00:35.579> as<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.149> ones<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.480> rs3<00:00:37.110> not<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.250> much<00:00:38.460> like

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
or as the ones in rs3 not so much like

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.580 
or as the ones in rs3 not so much like
the<00:00:39.210> ones<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.540> old<00:00:39.690> school<00:00:40.050> they<00:00:40.380> have<00:00:40.559> a

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
the ones in the old school they have a

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.970 
the ones in the old school they have a
lot<00:00:40.770> more<00:00:40.950> freedom<00:00:41.190> with<00:00:41.430> what<00:00:41.640> they<00:00:41.760> can<00:00:42.210> do

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
lot more freedom with what they can do

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.130 
lot more freedom with what they can do
so<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.040> figured<00:00:44.070> if<00:00:44.670> anything<00:00:45.600> there<00:00:45.899> would<00:00:46.110> be

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
so I figured if anything there would be

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.680 
so I figured if anything there would be
a<00:00:46.290> April<00:00:46.649> Fool's<00:00:46.890> for<00:00:47.430> old<00:00:47.850> school<00:00:48.149> something

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
a April Fool's for old school something

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.920 
a April Fool's for old school something
like<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.940> old<00:00:50.940> school<00:00:51.180> did<00:00:51.390> get<00:00:51.570> an<00:00:51.660> April

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
like that old school did get an April

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.600 
like that old school did get an April
Fool's<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.379> actually<00:00:52.559> think<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.129> better<00:00:53.190> than

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
Fool's I actually think it's better than

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.930 
Fool's I actually think it's better than
the<00:00:53.760> one<00:00:53.940> they<00:00:54.059> got<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.510> rs3<00:00:55.260> right<00:00:56.129> now<00:00:56.280> uh<00:00:56.460> not

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the one they got in rs3 right now uh not

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.400 
the one they got in rs3 right now uh not
that<00:00:57.090> it's<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.329> contest<00:00:57.510> or<00:00:57.899> anything<00:00:58.110> it's

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
that it's a contest or anything it's

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.930 
that it's a contest or anything it's
just<00:00:58.500> my<00:00:58.800> opinion<00:00:59.160> but<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.610> can<00:00:59.850> actually

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
just my opinion but you can actually

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.029 
just my opinion but you can actually
interact<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> game<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.590> little<00:01:01.800> bit

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
interact with the game a little bit

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.130 
interact with the game a little bit
beyond<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.730> watching<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.450> animation<00:01:04.019> of

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
beyond just watching and animation of

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.320 
beyond just watching and animation of
you<00:01:04.350> throwing<00:01:04.949> party<00:01:05.369> hats<00:01:05.519> into<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.909> fire

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
you throwing party hats into a fire

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.420 
you throwing party hats into a fire
which<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.440> April<00:01:07.799> Fool's<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.100> got<00:01:08.310> in

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
which is the April Fool's that got in

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.180 
which is the April Fool's that got in
our<00:01:08.580> string<00:01:08.940> well<00:01:09.600> actually<00:01:09.750> they're<00:01:10.470> kind<00:01:10.890> of

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
our string well actually they're kind of

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.880 
our string well actually they're kind of
similar<00:01:11.690> but<00:01:12.690> again<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:13.170> my<00:01:13.290> opinion<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.710> like

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
similar but again just my opinion I like

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.710 
similar but again just my opinion I like
the<00:01:14.010> one<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> old<00:01:14.490> school<00:01:14.640> better<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.360> the

the one in the old school better so the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
voyage doesn't really matter but so far

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.210
