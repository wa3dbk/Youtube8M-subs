00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hi welcome to the inspiration of a day are 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.540
 now let's do some snow 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.559
 elastic 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:15.360
 This is very good to know, and Fernanda 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:18.440
 talking more since I arrived from 93 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.440
 white elastic 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.000
 this here was a place like january 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.519
 pimp was really cool how to decorate 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.939
 healthy capital 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.219
 beautiful on top of the other 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.739
 I think up here so you can 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:43.350
 thing was also done by a work in 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:49.530
 paper size jurist joseph milk these 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.300
 plants here at the end we have to 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:58.620
 put them all together 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:11.720
 I know it all starts with an elastic that 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:15.710
 it was my around the area around the morning 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:21.380
 and now he gets plastic surgery 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.380
 first I think not two 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.720
 Now when the other vehicle your 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.720
 in the area too. 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:42.600
 good now for me more drastic 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:46.969
 we launch this hypothesis one thing for 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.969
 these two the sx4 the elastic 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:02:12.209
 when you have 14 to the fifth unit repeat 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:17.610
 three times and we did not get a male out there 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:22.310
 I 'm going to try not to take notes and pass the 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.310
 time in the other two in tico 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:48.080
 I went there I know hours and now has 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.769
 14 I relax here and have more history than 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.769
 rock 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:03:01.489
 This unit is now ready and 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.489
 now I'm going to do the third unit 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.360
 all water space but has already worked 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.360
 no problem 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:20.500
 I think everyone knows all I think 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.500
 the other scenario 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.510
 was in your city 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.120
 OK 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:38.019
 so now you have in the other tributes 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:41.230
 and came another character who passes them 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.650
 for all the ties that now have 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.650
 friday 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.560
 not 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.480
 if I stay 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:10.720
 now there's a cause of rain 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:10.720
 because I do what I think I have more soy 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:22.060
 do everything plastic 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.040
 I keep doing this 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:53.440
 I now have aa first tip was 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:05:01.569
 so I could not fifa is 15 plus 10 or 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:04.990
 send and only 12 all the same 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:07.289
 now put all those tips in my 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.289
 life 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.790
 so far 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:41.060
 we can make room but I can not 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:44.960
 the last plant receives the seedling even with 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:47.780
 the campaign ends a bitch I took off 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.020
 globe very carefully with it in the air 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:58.699
 When I get weird, I have to do it. 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:06:02.090
 But how are you going to work? 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:07.960
 let's spend my guess we will go back 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.960
 all elastic I have in the water 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:28.159
 he now does or relaxes it even 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:34.400
 here only has my vote I take here to 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:37.400
 she had that I think here is very 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:41.749
 teeny above will not use it the 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:07:00.430
 stage was in China but the logic 

00:06:41.749 --> 00:07:00.430
 I do not think it's better to put here 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:14.620
 the first one is like this and then it's bravo sai 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:18.020
 very good 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:20.360
 silvano have made it more 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:34.969
 I'm long here, so I'll come back more 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:40.219
 elastic so I hope my band 

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:46.219
 my focus of snow exhausting to life was 

00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:47.899
 an unfortunate comment if you have an idea 

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:51.520
 automidia what I could do to 

00:07:47.899 --> 00:07:51.520
 You said that laughing. 

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:58.800
 if you want and see our front do not know 

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.800
 I laughed at the fifth brigade.
