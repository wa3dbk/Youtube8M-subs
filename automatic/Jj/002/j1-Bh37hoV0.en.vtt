compared to Harley but it celebrates a

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:22.590 
compared to Harley but it celebrates a

Triumph<00:01:26.409> motorcycle<00:01:27.659> I'm<00:01:28.659> going<00:01:28.869> to<00:01:28.959> do<00:01:29.530> a

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
Triumph motorcycle I'm going to do a

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.809 
Triumph motorcycle I'm going to do a
start<00:01:30.220> up<00:01:30.340> procedure<00:01:31.080> it's<00:01:32.490> pretty<00:01:33.490> similar

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
start up procedure it's pretty similar

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:36.180 
start up procedure it's pretty similar
to<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:34.000> stock<00:01:34.270> Tryon<00:01:34.959> Bonneville<00:01:35.440> except<00:01:35.770> you

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
to a stock Tryon Bonneville except you

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.149 
to a stock Tryon Bonneville except you
got<00:01:36.340> twice<00:01:36.789> twice<00:01:37.270> make<00:01:37.569> carburetors<00:01:38.159> so

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
got twice twice make carburetors so

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.029 
got twice twice make carburetors so
first<00:01:39.520> thing<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:39.819> do<00:01:39.909> is<00:01:40.799> turn<00:01:41.799> on<00:01:41.950> the

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
first thing to do is turn on the

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:47.040 
first thing to do is turn on the
ignition<00:01:43.679> sickle<00:01:44.679> the<00:01:44.709> carburetors<00:01:45.869> but<00:01:46.869> that

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
ignition sickle the carburetors but that

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.979 
ignition sickle the carburetors but that
does<00:01:47.259> bring<00:01:47.500> gasoline<00:01:48.129> up<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.519> the<00:01:48.989> highest

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:49.989 
does bring gasoline up to the highest

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:52.949 
does bring gasoline up to the highest
point<00:01:50.500> so<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.310> engine<00:01:51.690> starts<00:01:52.690> a<00:01:52.780> little

00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:52.959 
point so the engine starts a little

00:01:52.959 --> 00:02:10.109 
point so the engine starts a little
easier

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.780 

this<00:02:10.899> bike<00:02:11.170> is<00:02:11.200> equipped<00:02:11.739> with<00:02:11.860> compression

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
this bike is equipped with compression

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.030 
this bike is equipped with compression
releases<00:02:13.299> their<00:02:14.080> manual<00:02:14.530> manual<00:02:14.980> releases<00:02:15.849> so

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
releases their manual manual releases so

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.759 
releases their manual manual releases so
you<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.370> release<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.810> open<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.230> valve<00:02:20.440> you

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
you to release to open the valve you

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.530 
you to release to open the valve you
push<00:02:21.010> down<00:02:21.040> on<00:02:21.310> these<00:02:21.549> little<00:02:21.760> buttons<00:02:22.120> one

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
push down on these little buttons one

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.740 
push down on these little buttons one
over<00:02:23.080> each<00:02:23.200> cylinder<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:27.450> when<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.569> bike

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
over each cylinder and when the bike

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.770 
over each cylinder and when the bike
starts<00:02:29.170> they<00:02:29.349> automatically<00:02:29.890> close<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:31.540> each

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
starts they automatically close so each

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.130 
starts they automatically close so each
time<00:02:32.079> I<00:02:32.140> kick<00:02:32.739> it<00:02:32.860> over<00:02:33.480> those<00:02:34.480> usually<00:02:34.870> pop

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
time I kick it over those usually pop

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.490 
time I kick it over those usually pop
back<00:02:35.379> up<00:02:35.409> I<00:02:35.890> have<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.459> reset<00:02:36.909> them<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:38.290> we'll

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
back up I have to reset them so we'll

00:02:38.500 --> 00:04:46.370 
back up I have to reset them so we'll
give<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.799> shot
