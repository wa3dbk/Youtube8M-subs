00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
racing field we knew racers with the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.960 
racing field we knew racers with the
mandate<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.829> new<00:00:25.980> gameplay<00:00:26.400> experience

which<00:00:27.419> was<00:00:27.570> great<00:00:27.720> because<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.050> meant<00:00:28.169> we

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.290 
which was great because it meant we

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.380 
which was great because it meant we
could<00:00:28.320> rebuild<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.099> tweak<00:00:29.579> everything<00:00:30.149> that

your opponents it's beautiful power-ups
have<00:00:50.410> physical<00:00:50.890> effects<00:00:51.160> and<00:00:51.880> that's<00:00:52.000> what

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
have physical effects and that's what

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.760 
have physical effects and that's what
makes<00:00:52.270> me<00:00:52.360> so<00:00:52.570> excited<00:00:52.690> they<00:00:53.290> change<00:00:53.590> the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
makes me so excited they change the

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.410 
makes me so excited they change the
outcome<00:00:54.070> of<00:00:54.130> the<00:00:54.250> race

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
outcome of the race

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.360

there's<00:00:57.050> five<00:00:57.260> power-ups<00:00:57.739> in<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.010> game<00:00:58.190> and

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
there's five power-ups in the game and

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.049 
there's five power-ups in the game and
they<00:00:58.519> are<00:00:58.699> nitro<00:00:59.359> its<00:00:59.870> speed<00:01:00.379> power<00:01:00.909> nitro<00:01:01.909> is

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
they are nitro its speed power nitro is

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.869 
they are nitro its speed power nitro is
probably<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.539> most<00:01:02.570> straightforward<00:01:02.960> power

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
probably the most straightforward power

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.620 
probably the most straightforward power
it's<00:01:04.879> awesome<00:01:05.740> shunt<00:01:06.740> it's<00:01:07.130> a<00:01:07.220> projectile<00:01:07.790> and

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
it's awesome shunt it's a projectile and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.760 
it's awesome shunt it's a projectile and
it<00:01:08.780> will<00:01:08.899> lift<00:01:09.080> the<00:01:09.290> car<00:01:09.500> off<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:09.740> ground

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
it will lift the car off the ground

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.840 
it will lift the car off the ground
which<00:01:10.399> is<00:01:10.430> for<00:01:11.000> closer<00:01:11.299> range<00:01:11.659> target<00:01:12.850> shock

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
which is for closer range target shock

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.969 
which is for closer range target shock
the<00:01:14.360> electric<00:01:14.780> energy<00:01:14.960> fired<00:01:15.500> from<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.830> roof

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
the electric energy fired from the roof

the electric energy fired from the roof
of<00:01:16.100> your<00:01:16.159> car<00:01:16.720> EMP<00:01:17.720> blast<00:01:17.930> of<00:01:18.350> electricity

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
of your car EMP blast of electricity

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.070 
of your car EMP blast of electricity
which<00:01:19.220> disables<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:19.789> car<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:20.360> allows<00:01:20.659> you<00:01:20.899> to

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
which disables a car and allows you to

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.260 
which disables a car and allows you to
boost<00:01:21.350> past<00:01:21.649> them<00:01:21.890> or<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:22.399> follow<00:01:22.729> up<00:01:23.030> with

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
boost past them or to follow up with

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.660 
boost past them or to follow up with
another<00:01:23.659> attack<00:01:24.850> destruction<00:01:25.850> is<00:01:25.970> great

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
another attack destruction is great

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.020
