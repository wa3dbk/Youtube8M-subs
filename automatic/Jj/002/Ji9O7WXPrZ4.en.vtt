induction system in bikes

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.090 
induction system in bikes
this<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.340> used<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.360> Indian<00:00:16.080> bikes<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.680> comply

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
this is used in Indian bikes to comply

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.090 
this is used in Indian bikes to comply
with<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:18.119> you<00:00:18.330> know<00:00:18.480> two<00:00:18.840> standards<00:00:19.439> that's

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
with the you know two standards that's

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.279 
with the you know two standards that's
the<00:00:20.220> pollution<00:00:20.699> standard<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:22.020> term

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
the pollution standard so the term

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.130 
the pollution standard so the term
itself<00:00:22.830> implies<00:00:23.480> secondary<00:00:24.480> air<00:00:24.720> induction

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
itself implies secondary air induction

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.330 
itself implies secondary air induction
system<00:00:25.369> secondary<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.300> means<00:00:27.539> ii<00:00:28.140> ii<00:00:28.769> ii

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
system secondary so that means ii ii ii

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.130 
system secondary so that means ii ii ii

yeah<00:01:16.710> here<00:01:17.040> we<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.460> spark<00:01:17.790> plug<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.810> is

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
yeah here we have the spark plug this is

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.649 
yeah here we have the spark plug this is
our<00:01:19.140> cylinder<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.189> our<00:01:20.520> piston<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.240> this

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
our cylinder this is our piston and this

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.370 
our cylinder this is our piston and this
is<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.619> connecting<00:01:23.040> row<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.780> crash<00:01:25.080> of

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
is the connecting row with the crash of

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.969 
is the connecting row with the crash of
this<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> cylinder<00:01:26.450> okay<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.990> here<00:01:28.770> what

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
this is a cylinder okay so here what

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.609 
this is a cylinder okay so here what
happens<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.579> something<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.360> all<00:01:30.540> know<00:01:30.960> how<00:01:31.290> an

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
happens is something you all know how an

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.640 
happens is something you all know how an
engine<00:01:32.100> works<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.720> petrol<00:01:34.110> engine<00:01:34.229> we

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
engine works so in a petrol engine we

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.640 
engine works so in a petrol engine we
have<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.130> primary<00:01:35.759> air<00:01:35.880> induction<00:01:36.119> system<00:01:36.650> so

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
have the primary air induction system so

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.560 
have the primary air induction system so
the<00:01:37.770> air<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.100> coming<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.970> mixes<00:01:39.390> with<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
the air is coming and it mixes with the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.630 
the air is coming and it mixes with the
fuel<00:01:39.960> with<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> petrol<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.400> being

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
fuel with the petrol and it is being

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.990 
fuel with the petrol and it is being
pushed<00:01:42.450> into<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.950> combustion<00:01:44.310> chamber<00:01:44.490> and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
pushed into the combustion chamber and

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.840 
pushed into the combustion chamber and
the<00:01:45.270> spark<00:01:45.630> happens<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.409> here<00:01:47.040> we<00:01:47.250> will<00:01:47.310> get<00:01:47.610> a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
the spark happens and here we will get a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.190 
the spark happens and here we will get a
combustion<00:01:48.329> okay

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
combustion okay

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.649 
combustion okay
and<00:01:49.369> after<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.490> combustion<00:01:50.850> will<00:01:51.299> create

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
and after the combustion will create

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.920 
and after the combustion will create
axis<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.649> exhaust<00:01:53.490> valve<00:01:53.759> opens<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
axis so this exhaust valve opens and the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.569 
axis so this exhaust valve opens and the
XO's<00:01:55.350> will<00:01:55.590> be<00:01:55.710> going<00:01:55.950> out<00:01:56.250> through<00:01:56.549> the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
XO's will be going out through the

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.550 
XO's will be going out through the
exhaust<00:01:56.939> band<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.380> expo<00:01:58.680> spot<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.909> the

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
exhaust band and the expo spot so the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.080 
exhaust band and the expo spot so the
secondary<00:02:01.560> air<00:02:01.860> induction<00:02:02.130> system<00:02:02.399> comes

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
secondary air induction system comes

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.080 
secondary air induction system comes
into<00:02:03.299> play<00:02:03.750> over<00:02:04.079> there<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.430> function<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:05.939> the
