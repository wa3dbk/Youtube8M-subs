00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.810
 you put down the custom till at the 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.920
 base did not have a serial case me 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.690

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.769
 for me it's one of my favorites 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.269
 ask my episodes the Kurds of 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.380
 Syria 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.450
 then suspension you put 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.420
 street suspension at the base will put you 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.630
 in sacked fashion bleach and mi6 thinking of 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.959
 series all competitions rather turbo 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:47.140
 manual crafts painting wood like 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.250
 it's turbo wheels you go nautical 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.750
 euros so that's the second thing 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.940
 important to put so type of euros 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:56.769
 sport and you put the so-called five 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.989

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.829
 let alloy roger accessories me 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.350

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:11.049
 after they will follow me and manage a 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.819
 special myth after the smoke I had 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.160
 red red plus it's not 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.530
 victims but also the red window 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.320
