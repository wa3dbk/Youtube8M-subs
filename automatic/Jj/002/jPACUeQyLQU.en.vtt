00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
can see the crazy bad cuber sign or it's

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.520 
can see the crazy bad cuber sign or it's
called<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.990> PNG<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.220> bottom<00:01:14.729> right<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
called a PNG in the bottom right of the

called a PNG in the bottom right of the
video<00:01:16.530> screen<00:01:16.860> here<00:01:17.220> now<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.909> overlay

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
video screen here now I have to overlay

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.510 
video screen here now I have to overlay
that<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.750> top<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.290> my<00:01:19.530> video<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.340> has<00:01:20.490> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
that on top of my video so it has to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.280 
that on top of my video so it has to
write<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.119> frame<00:01:21.360> by<00:01:21.390> frame<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:22.140> called

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
write it frame by frame it's called

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.100 
write it frame by frame it's called
rendering<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.090> it's<00:01:24.090> exactly<00:01:24.330> five<00:01:24.869> minutes

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
rendering and it's exactly five minutes

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.560 
rendering and it's exactly five minutes
and<00:01:25.320> 20<00:01:25.619> seconds<00:01:26.009> long<00:01:26.240> usually<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.420> would

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
and 20 seconds long usually that would

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.899 
and 20 seconds long usually that would
take<00:01:27.720> me<00:01:27.869> about<00:01:27.900> an<00:01:28.320> hour<00:01:28.409> or<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.189> render<00:01:29.759> on

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
take me about an hour or so to render on

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.749 
take me about an hour or so to render on
my<00:01:30.180> old<00:01:30.390> computer<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.259> wasn't<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.159> powerful

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
my old computer it wasn't that powerful

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.560 
my old computer it wasn't that powerful
but<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.390> its<00:01:33.540> time<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.020> wasn't<00:01:34.200> too<00:01:34.439> bad<00:01:35.570> this

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
but in its time it wasn't too bad this

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.410 
but in its time it wasn't too bad this
computer<00:01:36.960> did<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.829> five<00:01:38.130> minutes<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:39.119> it's

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
computer did it in five minutes so it's

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.569 
computer did it in five minutes so it's
way<00:01:39.840> more<00:01:39.869> powerful<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.130> also<00:01:41.280> did<00:01:41.520> an

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
way more powerful and I also did an

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.030 
way more powerful and I also did an
exporting<00:01:42.150> test<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.570> HD<00:01:42.930> i<00:01:42.960> exported<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.710> movie

exporting test in HD i exported a movie

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.679 
exporting test in HD i exported a movie
on<00:01:44.159> my<00:01:44.189> old<00:01:44.369> computer<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:45.060> was<00:01:45.149> one<00:01:45.450> minute

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
on my old computer that was one minute

on my old computer that was one minute
long<00:01:46.490> in<00:01:47.490> HD<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.390> took<00:01:48.689> 35<00:01:49.560> minutes<00:01:50.369> or<00:01:50.520> so

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
long in HD and it took 35 minutes or so

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.569 
long in HD and it took 35 minutes or so
on<00:01:51.020> this<00:01:52.020> computer<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.680> did<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.070> exact<00:01:53.460> same

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
on this computer I did the exact same

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.980 
on this computer I did the exact same
one<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.689> took<00:01:54.720> 45<00:01:55.670> seconds<00:01:56.990> extremely

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
one and it took 45 seconds extremely

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.319 
one and it took 45 seconds extremely
powerful<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.619> fast<00:01:58.890> everything<00:01:59.640> runs<00:01:59.939> so

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
powerful and fast everything runs so

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.959 
powerful and fast everything runs so
much<00:02:00.509> more<00:02:00.750> smoothly<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.469> feel<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.850> do

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
much more smoothly I feel like I can do

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.359 
much more smoothly I feel like I can do
a<00:02:03.000> lot<00:02:03.270> better<00:02:03.630> job<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.259> my<00:02:04.380> videos<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.159> edit

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
a lot better job in my videos I can edit

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.160 
a lot better job in my videos I can edit
them<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.700> don't<00:02:05.759> have<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.180> spend<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.930> much<00:02:07.110> time

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
them I don't have to spend so much time

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.559 
them I don't have to spend so much time
waiting<00:02:07.979> for<00:02:08.220> things<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.789> happen<00:02:08.910> if<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.450> have

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
waiting for things to happen if I have

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.170 
waiting for things to happen if I have
an<00:02:09.720> idea<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:10.140> can<00:02:10.530> just<00:02:10.649> do<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.940> know<00:02:12.060> it

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
an idea I can just do it you know it

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.559 
an idea I can just do it you know it
renders<00:02:12.510> so<00:02:12.780> fast<00:02:13.140> and

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
renders so fast and

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.259 
renders so fast and
supports<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.079> know<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:15.370> I've<00:02:15.670> really<00:02:16.180> been

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
supports you know so I've really been

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.940 
supports you know so I've really been
motivated<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.900> start<00:02:17.109> making<00:02:17.349> different<00:02:17.709> kind

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
motivated to start making different kind

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.920 
motivated to start making different kind
of<00:02:18.040> series<00:02:18.489> again<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:18.939> stuff<00:02:19.120> like<00:02:19.239> that<00:02:19.299> so<00:02:19.510> I

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
of series again and stuff like that so I

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.899 
of series again and stuff like that so I
think<00:02:20.439> that<00:02:20.829> I'll<00:02:20.950> probably<00:02:21.280> be<00:02:21.579> coming<00:02:21.700> out

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
think that I'll probably be coming out

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.099 
think that I'll probably be coming out
with<00:02:21.939> some<00:02:22.120> pretty<00:02:22.209> cool<00:02:22.450> videos<00:02:22.810> in<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.079> near

a row that goes against their original

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.520 
a row that goes against their original
design<00:02:49.150> now<00:02:49.599> I'm<00:02:49.719> not<00:02:49.840> saying<00:02:50.109> you're<00:02:50.290> not

change<00:02:52.810> your<00:02:52.930> design<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:54.370> I<00:02:54.669> can't<00:02:55.030> really

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
change your design and I can't really

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.640

say<00:02:55.419> anything<00:02:55.449> about<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.989> v-cube<00:02:56.290> for

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
say anything about the v-cube for

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.379 
say anything about the v-cube for
because<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.010> haven't<00:02:57.370> seen<00:02:57.549> the<00:02:57.730> inside<00:02:57.879> of<00:02:58.150> it

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
because I haven't seen the inside of it

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:00.449 
because I haven't seen the inside of it
yet<00:02:58.540> so<00:02:59.199> right<00:02:59.560> now<00:02:59.590> it's<00:02:59.949> just<00:03:00.069> kind<00:03:00.310> of<00:03:00.370> a

yet so right now it's just kind of a

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.000 
yet so right now it's just kind of a
conversation<00:03:01.209> piece<00:03:01.239> if<00:03:01.689> anything<00:03:02.109> it's<00:03:02.799> not

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
conversation piece if anything it's not

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.559 
conversation piece if anything it's not
an<00:03:03.250> argument<00:03:03.370> or<00:03:03.849> anything<00:03:04.150> i'm<00:03:04.239> trying<00:03:04.480> to

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:06.939 
make with with you guys or v cubes or

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.909 
make with with you guys or v cubes or
anything<00:03:07.239> it's<00:03:07.780> just<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.109> second<00:03:08.530> time<00:03:08.560> in<00:03:08.709> a

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:08.919 
anything it's just the second time in a

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.530 
anything it's just the second time in a
row<00:03:08.949> that<00:03:09.099> they've<00:03:09.430> gone<00:03:10.060> against<00:03:10.389> what

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
row that they've gone against what

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.729 
row that they've gone against what
they've<00:03:10.689> done<00:03:10.810> before<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.590> of<00:03:11.680> course

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
they've done before and of course

they've done before and of course
they're<00:03:12.040> going<00:03:12.129> to<00:03:12.219> develop<00:03:12.519> because<00:03:13.000> now

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
they're going to develop because now

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.909 
they're going to develop because now
they've<00:03:13.540> got<00:03:13.689> competition<00:03:14.049> with<00:03:14.500> knockoff

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:14.919 
they've got competition with knockoff

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:18.479 
they've got competition with knockoff
companies<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:15.549> stuff<00:03:16.049> but<00:03:17.049> when<00:03:17.769> they<00:03:17.889> you

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
companies and stuff but when they you

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.369 
companies and stuff but when they you
know<00:03:18.519> take<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:18.819> v-cube<00:03:19.269> three<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:20.019> they<00:03:20.139> copy

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
know take a v-cube three and they copy

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.050 
know take a v-cube three and they copy
the<00:03:20.590> torpedoes<00:03:21.099> and<00:03:21.250> basically<00:03:21.639> make<00:03:21.879> it<00:03:22.000> a

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
the torpedoes and basically make it a

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.119 
the torpedoes and basically make it a
goo<00:03:22.239> hyung<00:03:22.419> and<00:03:22.720> then<00:03:23.109> don't<00:03:23.319> offer<00:03:23.590> any

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
goo hyung and then don't offer any

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.830
