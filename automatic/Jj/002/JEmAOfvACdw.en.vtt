00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
see if I can but like I said I shouldn't

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.340 
see if I can but like I said I shouldn't
have<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.520> know<00:02:11.640> play<00:02:11.849> capture<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.330> flag

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350
