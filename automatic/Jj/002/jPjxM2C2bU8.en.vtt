00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
you how to draw an evergreen tree I'm

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.240 
you how to draw an evergreen tree I'm
going<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.210> start<00:00:15.540> with<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.839> trunk<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.440> draw<00:00:17.070> a

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
going to start with the trunk and draw a

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.830 
going to start with the trunk and draw a
tall<00:00:17.670> line<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:19.020> middle<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.680> trunk

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
tall line in the middle of that trunk

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.269 
tall line in the middle of that trunk
this<00:00:21.840> line<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.230> going<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.650> indicate<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
this line is going to indicate the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.910 
this line is going to indicate the
middle<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.910> tree<00:00:24.529> we're<00:00:25.529> not<00:00:25.680> going<00:00:25.859> to

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
middle of the tree we're not going to

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.470 
middle of the tree we're not going to
really<00:00:26.070> see<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.609> I'm<00:00:26.789> going<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.029> erase<00:00:27.269> it

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
really see it I'm going to erase it

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.790 
really see it I'm going to erase it
later<00:00:27.510> on<00:00:27.869> but<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.320> need<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.590> now<00:00:30.320> the<00:00:31.320> shape<00:00:31.590> of

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
later on but I need it now the shape of

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.970 
later on but I need it now the shape of
this<00:00:31.980> tree<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.340> like<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> triangle<00:00:33.500> so<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.680> top

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
this tree is like a triangle so the top

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.889 
this tree is like a triangle so the top
will<00:00:35.190> be<00:00:35.370> narrow<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.210> bottom<00:00:36.570> will<00:00:36.750> be

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
will be narrow and the bottom will be

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.880 
will be narrow and the bottom will be
wide<00:00:38.420> now<00:00:39.420> I'll<00:00:39.690> draw<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> leaves<00:00:40.530> in

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
wide now I'll draw the leaves in

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.090 
wide now I'll draw the leaves in
triangular<00:00:41.670> shapes<00:00:42.200> that<00:00:43.200> will<00:00:43.379> indicate<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
triangular shapes that will indicate the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.720 
triangular shapes that will indicate the
groups<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.850> leaves<00:00:46.460> starting<00:00:47.460> from<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
groups of the leaves starting from the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.350 
groups of the leaves starting from the
top<00:00:48.770> I'm<00:00:49.770> going<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.129> start<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.789> left<00:00:50.969> side

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
top I'm going to start on the left side

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.520 
top I'm going to start on the left side
and<00:00:51.949> as<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.219> draw<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:54.000> lower<00:00:54.210> side<00:00:54.750> I'm<00:00:55.170> going

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
and as I draw the lower side I'm going

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.770 
and as I draw the lower side I'm going
to<00:00:55.590> widen<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.190> up<00:00:58.699> once<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.850> have<00:01:00.000> half<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.510> tree

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
to widen it up once I have half the tree

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.510 
to widen it up once I have half the tree
ready<00:01:00.989> I'll<00:01:01.379> go<00:01:01.590> ahead<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.010> draw<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.250> other

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
ready I'll go ahead and draw the other

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.390 
ready I'll go ahead and draw the other
side<00:01:03.170> it<00:01:04.170> doesn't<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.129> same

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
side it doesn't have to be the same

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.230 
side it doesn't have to be the same
thing<00:01:06.240> or<00:01:06.630> symmetric<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:08.430> do<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.760> similar

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
thing or symmetric so just do it similar

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.170 
thing or symmetric so just do it similar
to<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> other<00:01:09.869> side<00:01:13.490> now<00:01:14.490> we'll<00:01:14.670> go<00:01:14.820> ahead<00:01:14.939> and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
to the other side now we'll go ahead and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.920 
to the other side now we'll go ahead and
erase<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.840> middle<00:01:16.140> line<00:01:19.220> okay<00:01:20.220> that's<00:01:20.670> good

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.420 

I'm<00:01:24.930> going<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.229> finish<00:01:25.409> up<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.860> leaves<00:01:26.100> by

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
I'm going to finish up the leaves by

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.260 
I'm going to finish up the leaves by
drawing<00:01:26.759> triangle<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.659> shaggy<00:01:28.110> shapes<00:01:29.270> they

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
drawing triangle a shaggy shapes they

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.899 
drawing triangle a shaggy shapes they
are<00:01:30.329> like<00:01:30.630> triangles<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:32.130> they're<00:01:32.369> open<00:01:32.579> on

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
are like triangles but they're open on

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.090 
are like triangles but they're open on
the<00:01:33.060> top<00:01:33.299> I'm<00:01:33.780> not<00:01:33.810> going<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.229> finish<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
the top I'm not going to finish the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:55.929 
the top I'm not going to finish the
triangle<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> top

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
okay now let's finish up the trunk like

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.770 
okay now let's finish up the trunk like
this<00:02:04.600> that's<00:02:05.600> it<00:02:06.460> if<00:02:07.460> you'd<00:02:08.030> like<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.450> see<00:02:08.629> how
