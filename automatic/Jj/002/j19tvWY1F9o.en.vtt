the<00:01:05.190> level<00:01:05.460> 2<00:01:05.610> assignments<00:01:06.150> well<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.690> bald

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the level 2 assignments well the bald

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.649 
the level 2 assignments well the bald
eagle<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.800> very<00:01:08.550> easily<00:01:08.909> one<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.510> most

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
eagle is very easily one of the most

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.170 
eagle is very easily one of the most
powerful<00:01:09.810> weapons<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.500> game<00:01:10.800> and<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.640> think<00:01:12.060> in

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
powerful weapons in game and I think in

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.210 
powerful weapons in game and I think in
general<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.570> enforcer<00:01:13.050> class<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.560> doesn't

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
general the enforcer class is doesn't

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.820 
general the enforcer class is doesn't
have<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.700> best<00:01:14.850> weapon<00:01:15.240> options<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.260> the<00:01:16.620> bald

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
have the best weapon options so the bald

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.350 
have the best weapon options so the bald
eagle<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.220> kind<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.550> breath<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.940> fresh<00:01:18.000> air

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
eagle is kind of a breath of fresh air

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.770 
eagle is kind of a breath of fresh air
for<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.660> class<00:01:18.930> it's<00:01:19.590> hugely<00:01:20.220> powerful<00:01:20.550> as<00:01:21.510> an

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
for the class it's hugely powerful as an

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.160 
for the class it's hugely powerful as an
8-round<00:01:22.230> mag<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:23.310> can<00:01:23.490> drop<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.820> guy<00:01:24.120> in<00:01:24.570> 2<00:01:24.900> shots

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
8-round mag it can drop a guy in 2 shots

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.230 
8-round mag it can drop a guy in 2 shots
up<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.590> 30<00:01:25.800> metres<00:01:26.160> away<00:01:26.310> which<00:01:26.760> means<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.120> can

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
up to 30 metres away which means you can

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.560 
up to 30 metres away which means you can
take<00:01:27.270> down<00:01:27.660> 4<00:01:28.110> enemies<00:01:28.770> before<00:01:29.250> reloading<00:01:29.880> so

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
take down 4 enemies before reloading so

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.880 
take down 4 enemies before reloading so
is<00:01:30.690> that<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> first<00:01:31.140> one<00:01:31.290> you'd<00:01:31.440> recommend

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
is that the first one you'd recommend

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.280 
is that the first one you'd recommend
going<00:01:32.070> for<00:01:32.190> I<00:01:32.580> would<00:01:33.330> especially<00:01:33.810> again

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
going for I would especially again

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.110 
going for I would especially again
because<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.620> the<00:01:34.950> enforcer<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.610> kind<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
because of the enforcer is kind of a

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.570 
because of the enforcer is kind of a
ho-hum<00:01:36.450> class<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.260> begin<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.430> not

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
ho-hum class to begin with and it's not

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.690 
ho-hum class to begin with and it's not
that<00:01:38.730> hard<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.030> get<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.900> essentially

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
that hard to get it's essentially

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.860 
that hard to get it's essentially
absorbing<00:01:41.700> damage<00:01:41.730> with<00:01:42.180> your<00:01:42.210> shield<00:01:42.540> and

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
absorbing damage with your shield and

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.830 
absorbing damage with your shield and
some<00:01:43.650> shotgun<00:01:44.070> kills<00:01:44.310> yeah<00:01:44.850> it's<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.180> just<00:01:45.780> a

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
some shotgun kills yeah it's a just a

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.660 
some shotgun kills yeah it's a just a
handful<00:01:46.230> of<00:01:46.290> shotgun<00:01:46.830> kills<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.460> then<00:01:47.640> a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
handful of shotgun kills and then a

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.250 
handful of shotgun kills and then a
certain<00:01:48.090> amount<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.420> damage<00:01:48.630> with<00:01:48.900> the<00:01:49.020> shield

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
certain amount of damage with the shield

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.080

in a heartbeat and it's super fun as far

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.740 
in a heartbeat and it's super fun as far
as<00:02:25.440> is<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.950> better<00:02:26.490> than<00:02:26.640> what<00:02:27.090> already<00:02:27.270> exists

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
as is it better than what already exists

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.150 
as is it better than what already exists
in<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.930> class<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.380> don't<00:02:28.530> know<00:02:28.590> if<00:02:28.680> that's<00:02:28.860> true

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
in the class I don't know if that's true

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.699 
in the class I don't know if that's true
like<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.730> think<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.330> g18<00:02:30.690> once<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.410> tame

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
like I think that the g18 once you tame

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.100 
like I think that the g18 once you tame
it<00:02:31.890> with<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> compensator<00:02:32.820> is<00:02:33.150> probably<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
it with a compensator is probably the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.320 
it with a compensator is probably the
go-to<00:02:34.350> for<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.920> professional<00:02:35.430> class<00:02:35.670> but<00:02:36.300> for

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
go-to for the professional class but for

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.720 
go-to for the professional class but for
style<00:02:36.900> points<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.620> mac-10<00:02:37.830> just<00:02:38.100> too<00:02:38.550> damn

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
style points the mac-10 just too damn

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.370 
style points the mac-10 just too damn
cool<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.090> put<00:02:39.270> them<00:02:39.450> another<00:02:40.050> thing<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.350> a

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
cool to put them another thing is a

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.110 
cool to put them another thing is a
pretty<00:02:40.800> crazy<00:02:41.190> rate<00:02:41.489> of<00:02:41.610> fire<00:02:41.790> like<00:02:42.000> I've

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
pretty crazy rate of fire like I've

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.150 
pretty crazy rate of fire like I've
noticed<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:43.140> kicks<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.709> has<00:02:43.800> a<00:02:43.830> high<00:02:43.980> rate

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
noticed it kicks and it has a high rate

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.890 
noticed it kicks and it has a high rate
of<00:02:44.190> fire<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.730> pretty<00:02:45.030> much<00:02:45.209> can<00:02:45.450> get<00:02:45.600> one

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
of fire so you pretty much can get one

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.380 
of fire so you pretty much can get one
maybe<00:02:46.170> two<00:02:46.410> guys<00:02:46.620> if<00:02:46.830> they're<00:02:46.980> lined<00:02:47.370> up<00:02:47.640> but

the other two weapons that you were not

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.020 
the other two weapons that you were not
as<00:03:33.810> thrilled<00:03:34.170> about<00:03:34.790> starting<00:03:35.790> with<00:03:35.880> the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
as thrilled about starting with the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.000 
as thrilled about starting with the

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
Glock 17 unlock for the operator

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.870 
Glock 17 unlock for the operator
so<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.760> g17<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.720> fine<00:03:40.230> it's<00:03:40.769> basically<00:03:41.370> just<00:03:41.489> a

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
so the g17 is fine it's basically just a

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.660 
so the g17 is fine it's basically just a
semi-automatic<00:03:42.540> version<00:03:42.989> of<00:03:43.080> the<00:03:43.170> G<00:03:43.350> 18<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:44.040> I

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
semi-automatic version of the G 18 and I

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.380 
semi-automatic version of the G 18 and I
just<00:03:44.850> don't<00:03:45.000> think<00:03:45.120> there's<00:03:45.239> anything

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
just don't think there's anything

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.360 
just don't think there's anything
special<00:03:45.810> about<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:46.019> considering<00:03:47.010> that<00:03:47.280> the

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
special about it considering that the

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.949 
special about it considering that the
operator<00:03:47.760> class<00:03:48.030> has<00:03:48.390> some<00:03:48.570> of<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.780> most

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
operator class has some of the most

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.320 
operator class has some of the most
dominant<00:03:49.620> weapons<00:03:50.310> in<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.640> game<00:03:50.670> for<00:03:51.239> the

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
dominant weapons in the game for the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.420 
dominant weapons in the game for the
primary<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:51.989> think<00:03:52.230> it's<00:03:52.350> okay<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.920> secondary

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
primary I think it's okay the secondary

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.270 
primary I think it's okay the secondary
is<00:03:53.549> a<00:03:53.580> little<00:03:53.880> weak<00:03:54.060> but<00:03:54.360> I<00:03:54.390> would<00:03:54.810> personally

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
is a little weak but I would personally

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.430 
is a little weak but I would personally
stick<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.549> cz-75<00:03:57.269> if<00:03:57.720> I'm<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.870> criminal<00:03:58.320> and

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
stick to the cz-75 if I'm a criminal and

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.100 
stick to the cz-75 if I'm a criminal and
probably<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.040> p226<00:03:59.700> as<00:04:00.120> a<00:04:00.180> cop<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.870> last

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
probably the p226 as a cop and the last
