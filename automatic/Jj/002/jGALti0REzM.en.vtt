what<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> beautiful<00:00:17.810> russian<00:00:18.810> jet<00:00:19.320> tell<00:00:19.710> me<00:00:19.800> a

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
what a beautiful russian jet tell me a

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.650 
what a beautiful russian jet tell me a
little<00:00:19.980> bit<00:00:20.130> about<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.490> plane<00:00:20.760> yeah<00:00:21.420> you're

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
little bit about this plane yeah you're

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.540 
little bit about this plane yeah you're
right<00:00:21.840> it's<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.140> Russian<00:00:22.320> jet<00:00:22.680> it's<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.099> Sukhoi

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
right it's a Russian jet it's a Sukhoi

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.269 
right it's a Russian jet it's a Sukhoi
27<00:00:23.759> flanker<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:25.110> a<00:00:25.560> semi<00:00:25.800> scale<00:00:26.099> aircraft

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
27 flanker it's a semi scale aircraft

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.640 
27 flanker it's a semi scale aircraft
it's<00:00:26.640> not<00:00:26.849> super<00:00:27.570> scale<00:00:27.810> cheat<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> little<00:00:28.500> bit

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
it's not super scale cheat a little bit

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.200 
it's not super scale cheat a little bit
the<00:00:28.890> original<00:00:29.220> aircraft<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.669> a<00:00:29.700> twin-engine

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
the original aircraft is a twin-engine

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.510 
the original aircraft is a twin-engine
aircraft<00:00:30.360> and<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:31.649> just<00:00:31.829> have<00:00:31.950> one<00:00:32.130> engine

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
aircraft and I just have one engine

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.889 
aircraft and I just have one engine
stuck<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:32.970> the<00:00:33.059> middle<00:00:33.149> but<00:00:33.390> it's<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.750> big

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
stuck in the middle but it's a big

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.690 
stuck in the middle but it's a big
powerful<00:00:34.140> engine<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.620> it's<00:00:34.710> as<00:00:34.829> well<00:00:34.950> now<00:00:35.520> how

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
powerful engine so it's as well now how

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.130 
powerful engine so it's as well now how
does<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.970> handle<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.450> air<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.780> everything

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
does it handle in the air and everything

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.780 
does it handle in the air and everything
is<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.440> quite<00:00:37.710> easy<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.100> fly<00:00:38.399> or<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.760> a

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
is it quite easy to fly or is it a

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.340 
is it quite easy to fly or is it a
little<00:00:38.969> bit<00:00:39.149> more<00:00:39.360> difficult<00:00:39.600> because<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
little bit more difficult because of a

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.049 
little bit more difficult because of a
single<00:00:40.680> engine<00:00:41.010> no<00:00:41.219> actually<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.790> number<00:00:41.880> of

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
single engine no actually the number of

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.549 
single engine no actually the number of
engines<00:00:42.300> doesn't<00:00:43.050> really<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.290> anything<00:00:43.440> to

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
engines doesn't really have anything to

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.020 
engines doesn't really have anything to
do<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:43.710> flying<00:00:43.980> characteristics<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:44.790> it<00:00:44.910> is

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
do with flying characteristics but it is

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.579 
do with flying characteristics but it is
a<00:00:45.059> heavier<00:00:45.570> aircraft<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.410> what<00:00:46.500> I'm

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:46.589 
a heavier aircraft and what I'm

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.119 
a heavier aircraft and what I'm
typically<00:00:47.339> flying<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.750> need<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.199> fly<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:49.949> as

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
typically flying so I need to fly it as

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.799 
typically flying so I need to fly it as
such<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.519> can't<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:51.030> hook<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.210> around<00:00:51.359> like<00:00:51.660> I

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
such I can't just hook it around like I

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.079 
such I can't just hook it around like I
do<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.469> my<00:00:52.620> other<00:00:52.769> airplanes<00:00:53.160> I'm<00:00:53.820> still<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
do so my other airplanes I'm still a

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:55.759 
do so my other airplanes I'm still a
little<00:00:54.269> bit<00:00:54.449> new<00:00:54.600> applying<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.410> I

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
little bit new applying this so I

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:57.259 
little bit new applying this so I
haven't<00:00:56.100> really<00:00:56.280> gotten<00:00:56.640> up<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.940> speed<00:00:57.239> with

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
haven't really gotten up to speed with

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.360 
haven't really gotten up to speed with
it<00:00:57.570> especially<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.260> landings<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:58.800> hopefully

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
it especially the landings but hopefully

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.229 
it especially the landings but hopefully
that<00:00:59.519> will<00:00:59.579> improve<00:00:59.850> in<00:00:59.999> the<00:01:00.059> near<00:01:00.210> future

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
that will improve in the near future

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.759 
that will improve in the near future
what<00:01:00.690> about<00:01:00.749> the<00:01:00.960> air<00:01:01.079> brake<00:01:01.289> here<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.649> an

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
what about the air brake here is that an

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.380 
what about the air brake here is that an
actual<00:01:01.890> functional<00:01:02.699> piece<00:01:02.909> or<00:01:03.089> is<00:01:03.179> that<00:01:03.329> just

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
actual functional piece or is that just

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.060 
actual functional piece or is that just
more<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:03.899> looks<00:01:04.019> yes<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.800> very

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
more for looks yes it is it's very

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.580 
more for looks yes it is it's very
effective<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.730> it<00:01:06.090> does<00:01:06.270> double<00:01:06.659> duty<00:01:06.690> as<00:01:07.020> it

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
effective and it does double duty as it

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.740 
effective and it does double duty as it
provides<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.250> hatch<00:01:08.610> or<00:01:08.909> some<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.270> my<00:01:09.330> services

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
provides a hatch or some of my services

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.390 
provides a hatch or some of my services
for<00:01:09.810> starting<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.800> were<00:01:10.890> saying<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.310> a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
for starting you were saying it's a

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.800 
for starting you were saying it's a
single<00:01:11.729> engine<00:01:11.970> why<00:01:12.090> did<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.300> go<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.420> single

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
single engine why did you go to single

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.050 
single engine why did you go to single
engine<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.350> less<00:01:14.010> complexity<00:01:14.520> less<00:01:14.790> cost

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
engine on this less complexity less cost

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.870 
engine on this less complexity less cost
and<00:01:15.450> being<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.440> semi<00:01:16.740> scale<00:01:17.040> aircraft<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.610> wasn't

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
and being a semi scale aircraft I wasn't

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.940 
and being a semi scale aircraft I wasn't
too<00:01:17.970> concerned<00:01:18.000> with<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.660> being<00:01:18.870> that<00:01:19.560> scale

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
too concerned with it being that scale

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.310 
too concerned with it being that scale
if<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.430> was<00:01:20.610> more<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.090> scale<00:01:21.450> yeah<00:01:21.840> version

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
if it was more of a scale yeah version

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.510 
if it was more of a scale yeah version
you<00:01:22.410> probably<00:01:22.740> got<00:01:22.890> into<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.340> bigger

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
you probably got into it's a bigger

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.210 
you probably got into it's a bigger
engine<00:01:23.910> it's<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.240> red<00:01:24.540> X<00:01:24.750> l200<00:01:25.410> it<00:01:25.530> puts<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.770> 33

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
engine it's a red X l200 it puts a 33

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.250 
engine it's a red X l200 it puts a 33
pounds<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.640> thrust<00:01:26.760> and<00:01:27.120> a<00:01:27.270> takeoff<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:27.840> 39

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
pounds of thrust and a takeoff it's 39

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.900 
pounds of thrust and a takeoff it's 39
pounds<00:01:28.500> yeah<00:01:28.830> so<00:01:29.100> you're<00:01:29.310> pretty<00:01:29.490> you're

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
pounds yeah so you're pretty you're

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.520 
pounds yeah so you're pretty you're
pretty<00:01:29.970> one<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> one<00:01:30.750> there<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.170> more<00:01:31.410> than

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
pretty one the one there it's more than

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.370 
pretty one the one there it's more than
those<00:01:31.710> fools<00:01:31.920> yeah<00:01:32.040> yeah<00:01:32.670> exactly<00:01:33.080> well<00:01:34.080> let's

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.010 

okay<00:01:58.400> i'm<00:01:58.550> here<00:01:58.730> with<00:01:58.820> type<00:01:59.090> 2<00:01:59.360> chance<00:01:59.660> Pat

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
okay i'm here with type 2 chance Pat

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.260 
okay i'm here with type 2 chance Pat
what<00:02:00.050> a<00:02:00.350> beautiful<00:02:00.830> plane<00:02:01.250> now<00:02:01.850> I'm<00:02:01.970> looking

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
what a beautiful plane now I'm looking

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.150 
what a beautiful plane now I'm looking
at<00:02:02.390> this<00:02:02.510> motor<00:02:02.900> here<00:02:03.350> I<00:02:03.470> mean<00:02:03.800> that's<00:02:03.950> pretty

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
at this motor here I mean that's pretty

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.650 
at this motor here I mean that's pretty
neat<00:02:04.490> huh<00:02:04.520> so<00:02:05.030> what's<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.360> big<00:02:05.480> difference

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
neat huh so what's the big difference

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.840 
neat huh so what's the big difference
between<00:02:06.200> this<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.710> one<00:02:06.950> cylinder<00:02:07.400> engine

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
between this and the one cylinder engine

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.070 
between this and the one cylinder engine
what's<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.119> big<00:02:08.240> difference<00:02:08.360> well<00:02:08.810> this<00:02:09.050> is

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
what's the big difference well this is

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.760 
what's the big difference well this is
four-stroke<00:02:09.800> radial<00:02:09.950> engine<00:02:10.720> 250<00:02:11.720> CCS<00:02:12.200> about

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
four-stroke radial engine 250 CCS about

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.040 
four-stroke radial engine 250 CCS about
13<00:02:13.190> horsepower<00:02:13.430> of<00:02:14.330> course<00:02:14.540> with<00:02:15.020> a

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
13 horsepower of course with a

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.630 
13 horsepower of course with a
four-stroke<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:15.740> have<00:02:15.860> all<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.100> valves<00:02:16.280> and

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
four-stroke you have all the valves and

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.970 
four-stroke you have all the valves and
push<00:02:17.120> rods<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:18.020> whole<00:02:18.140> thing<00:02:18.350> operates<00:02:18.740> the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
push rods the whole thing operates the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.680 
push rods the whole thing operates the
same<00:02:19.190> principle<00:02:19.430> is<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.790> real<00:02:20.030> radial<00:02:20.390> engine

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
same principle is a real radial engine

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.140 
same principle is a real radial engine
the<00:02:21.050> only<00:02:21.230> difference<00:02:21.410> is<00:02:21.710> this<00:02:22.040> uses<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.460> 32

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
the only difference is this uses a 32

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.650 
the only difference is this uses a 32
one<00:02:23.330> gas<00:02:24.170> oil<00:02:24.380> mix<00:02:24.530> for<00:02:25.430> cooling<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:26.270> rockers

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
one gas oil mix for cooling the rockers

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.930 
one gas oil mix for cooling the rockers
are<00:02:26.870> manually<00:02:27.590> lubricated<00:02:28.400> once<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.790> day

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
are manually lubricated once a day

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.670 
are manually lubricated once a day
before<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.390> fly<00:02:29.570> you<00:02:29.630> can<00:02:29.870> fly<00:02:29.990> four<00:02:30.440> or<00:02:30.530> five

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
before you fly you can fly four or five

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.440 
before you fly you can fly four or five
flights<00:02:30.920> with<00:02:31.190> one<00:02:31.370> oiling<00:02:31.730> of<00:02:31.850> your<00:02:32.060> rockers

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
flights with one oiling of your rockers

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.080 
flights with one oiling of your rockers
okay<00:02:33.290> padnel<00:02:33.620> obviously<00:02:34.250> because<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.550> radial

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
okay padnel obviously because the radial

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.640 
okay padnel obviously because the radial
motor<00:02:35.330> we<00:02:35.540> have<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.810> greasing<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.470> vows

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
motor we have the greasing of the vows

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.620 
motor we have the greasing of the vows
we<00:02:36.680> have<00:02:37.040> these<00:02:37.130> piston<00:02:37.670> rods<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.240> there

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
we have these piston rods it is there

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.270 
we have these piston rods it is there
more<00:02:38.780> things<00:02:39.050> to<00:02:39.170> break<00:02:39.350> down<00:02:39.500> with<00:02:39.709> this<00:02:39.860> yeah

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
more things to break down with this yeah

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.040 
more things to break down with this yeah
yeah<00:02:40.730> you're<00:02:40.850> going<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.060> have<00:02:41.209> probably<00:02:41.690> a

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
yeah you're going to have probably a

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.330 
yeah you're going to have probably a
little<00:02:42.200> more<00:02:42.320> maintenance<00:02:42.680> with<00:02:43.010> this<00:02:43.130> you

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
little more maintenance with this you

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.190 
little more maintenance with this you
have<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:43.820> keep<00:02:43.940> your<00:02:44.090> valves<00:02:44.420> adjusted<00:02:44.510> it's

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
have to keep your valves adjusted it's

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.380 
have to keep your valves adjusted it's
one<00:02:45.470> critical<00:02:45.890> area<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:47.030> course<00:02:47.060> there's

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
one critical area and of course there's

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.940 
one critical area and of course there's
a<00:02:47.420> lot<00:02:47.570> more<00:02:47.600> moving<00:02:47.870> parts<00:02:48.050> so<00:02:48.530> eventually

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
a lot more moving parts so eventually

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.190 
a lot more moving parts so eventually
you<00:02:49.220> probably<00:02:49.790> have<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.060> bigger<00:02:50.570> problem<00:02:50.840> of<00:02:51.110> a

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
you probably have a bigger problem of a

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.960 
you probably have a bigger problem of a
breakdown<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:52.190> there's<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.459> lot<00:02:52.610> of<00:02:52.640> wear<00:02:52.940> and

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
breakdown so there's a lot of wear and

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.630 
breakdown so there's a lot of wear and
stress<00:02:53.600> in<00:02:53.780> here<00:02:53.959> I<00:02:53.990> mean<00:02:54.170> basically<00:02:54.550> you<00:02:55.550> know

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
stress in here I mean basically you know

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.520 
stress in here I mean basically you know
that<00:02:55.850> little<00:02:56.120> screw<00:02:56.420> there<00:02:56.660> if<00:02:56.870> it<00:02:56.990> bends<00:02:57.260> or

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
that little screw there if it bends or

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.260 
that little screw there if it bends or
snaps<00:02:57.860> now<00:02:58.430> what<00:02:58.610> if<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:58.820> happens<00:02:59.120> during

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
snaps now what if that happens during

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.150 
snaps now what if that happens during
flight<00:02:59.630> or<00:02:59.810> something<00:03:00.200> is<00:03:00.350> it<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.590> cast<00:03:00.860> Rafa

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
flight or something is it a cast Rafa

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.699 
flight or something is it a cast Rafa
caeliar<00:03:01.670> or<00:03:01.850> not<00:03:02.030> no<00:03:02.390> they<00:03:02.959> give<00:03:03.230> you<00:03:03.380> extra

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
caeliar or not no they give you extra

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.610 
caeliar or not no they give you extra
push<00:03:04.430> rods<00:03:04.670> haven't<00:03:05.660> blown<00:03:05.840> one<00:03:06.080> yet<00:03:06.260> but<00:03:06.500> if

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
push rods haven't blown one yet but if

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.590 
push rods haven't blown one yet but if
you<00:03:06.709> happen<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.100> throw<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.610> push<00:03:07.910> rod<00:03:08.030> out<00:03:08.330> you

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
you happen to throw a push rod out you

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.870 
you happen to throw a push rod out you
would<00:03:08.750> lose<00:03:08.900> one<00:03:09.080> cylinder<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.860> I'm<00:03:10.670> sure

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
would lose one cylinder and I'm sure

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.490 
would lose one cylinder and I'm sure
that<00:03:11.060> you'd<00:03:11.180> be<00:03:11.330> fine<00:03:11.570> to<00:03:11.750> bring<00:03:12.200> it<00:03:12.290> in<00:03:12.380> and

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
that you'd be fine to bring it in and

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.110 
that you'd be fine to bring it in and
land<00:03:12.620> it<00:03:12.800> especially<00:03:13.220> with<00:03:13.519> being<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.880> biplane

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
land it especially with being a biplane

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.180 
land it especially with being a biplane
now<00:03:14.750> getting<00:03:15.110> to<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.290> plane<00:03:15.590> now<00:03:15.620> what<00:03:16.010> type

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
now getting to the plane now what type

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.890 
now getting to the plane now what type
of<00:03:16.220> plane<00:03:16.489> is<00:03:16.670> this<00:03:16.850> modeled<00:03:17.209> after<00:03:17.330> this<00:03:17.660> is<00:03:17.870> a

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
of plane is this modeled after this is a

40s to train pilots in the US Air Force

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.320 
40s to train pilots in the US Air Force
mainly<00:03:23.840> it's<00:03:24.380> modeled<00:03:24.769> after<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.130> PT<00:03:25.580> 17<00:03:26.090> and

mainly it's modeled after the PT 17 and

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.300 
mainly it's modeled after the PT 17 and
they<00:03:26.390> use<00:03:26.540> these<00:03:26.750> things<00:03:26.810> by<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.620> hundreds<00:03:28.100> to

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
they use these things by the hundreds to

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.930 
they use these things by the hundreds to
train<00:03:28.550> pilots<00:03:28.850> for<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.360> war<00:03:29.570> now<00:03:29.840> easy<00:03:30.500> to<00:03:30.739> fly

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
train pilots for the war now easy to fly
