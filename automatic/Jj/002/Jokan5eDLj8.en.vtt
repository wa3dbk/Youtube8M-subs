drop rides on this ride you won't feel

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.030 
drop rides on this ride you won't feel
like<00:00:33.600> you're<00:00:33.809> climbing<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.440> outside<00:00:34.890> of

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
like you're climbing on the outside of

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.709 
like you're climbing on the outside of
the<00:00:35.100> tower<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.790> scared<00:00:36.149> you'll<00:00:36.329> feel<00:00:36.510> like

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
the tower and scared you'll feel like

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.209 
the tower and scared you'll feel like
you're<00:00:36.899> suspended<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> middle<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.980> space

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
you're suspended in the middle of space

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.760 
you're suspended in the middle of space
the<00:00:39.149> seats<00:00:39.420> are<00:00:39.629> faced<00:00:39.899> away<00:00:40.110> from<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.500> tower

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
the seats are faced away from the tower

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.160 
the seats are faced away from the tower
so<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.309> allows<00:00:41.610> room<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.149> pivot<00:00:42.420> into<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.960> face

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
so it allows room to pivot into the face

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.900 
so it allows room to pivot into the face
down<00:00:43.379> position<00:00:43.950> that's<00:00:44.370> something<00:00:44.760> that's

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
down position that's something that's

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.049 
down position that's something that's
never<00:00:45.239> been<00:00:45.360> done<00:00:45.750> before<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:47.309> ride<00:00:47.520> vehicle

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
never been done before the ride vehicle

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.150 
never been done before the ride vehicle
was<00:00:48.210> designed<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.320> seats<00:00:49.620> are<00:00:49.800> attached

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
was designed so the seats are attached

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.580 
was designed so the seats are attached
to<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> ring<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.449> suspended<00:00:51.809> by<00:00:52.110> spokes

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
to a ring that is suspended by spokes

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.910 
to a ring that is suspended by spokes
like<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.100> wheel<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.520> bicycle<00:00:54.829> it's<00:00:55.829> a
