another<00:01:40.550> one<00:01:40.729> at<00:01:40.880> all

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.300 

happens<00:01:43.410> if<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.620> want<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.830> work<00:01:43.950> even<00:01:44.130> though

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
happens if you want to work even though

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.760 
happens if you want to work even though
we<00:01:44.400> connect<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.940> Wi-Fi<00:01:45.560> as<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.650> can

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
we connect to the Wi-Fi as you can

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.320 
we connect to the Wi-Fi as you can
imagine<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.280> page<00:01:47.430> will<00:01:47.580> be<00:01:47.610> quite<00:01:47.880> wide<00:01:48.120> on

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
imagine the page will be quite wide on

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.780 
imagine the page will be quite wide on
the<00:01:48.420> display<00:01:49.040> and<00:01:50.040> as<00:01:50.160> you<00:01:50.250> can<00:01:50.400> see<00:01:50.430> it's

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
the display and as you can see it's

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.110 
the display and as you can see it's
pretty<00:01:51.150> quick<00:01:51.510> to<00:01:51.690> load<00:01:51.840> things<00:01:52.080> up<00:01:52.350> as<00:01:52.530> well

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
pretty quick to load things up as well

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.990 
pretty quick to load things up as well
so<00:01:54.120> it's<00:01:54.270> pretty<00:01:54.510> nice<00:01:54.690> device<00:01:55.460> 12<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.610> ASA

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
so it's pretty nice device 12 the ASA

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.480 
so it's pretty nice device 12 the ASA
blurb<00:01:57.300> it's<00:01:57.480> got<00:01:57.720> LED<00:01:58.500> edge<00:01:58.800> lighting<00:01:59.070> as<00:01:59.370> one

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
blurb it's got LED edge lighting as one

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.969 
blurb it's got LED edge lighting as one
on<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.700> display<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.690> since<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:01.590> it's

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
on the display so since it's just it's

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.370 
on the display so since it's just it's
not<00:02:02.130> an<00:02:02.220> AMOLED<00:02:02.550> display<00:02:03.050> there's<00:02:04.050> other

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
not an AMOLED display there's other

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.350 
not an AMOLED display there's other
things<00:02:04.410> like<00:02:04.830> flash<00:02:05.190> 10.1<00:02:05.430> support<00:02:06.120> so<00:02:06.300> it

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
things like flash 10.1 support so it

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.730 
things like flash 10.1 support so it
should<00:02:06.510> be<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.660> pretty<00:02:06.690> good<00:02:06.870> web<00:02:07.170> experience

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
should be a pretty good web experience

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.540 
should be a pretty good web experience
again<00:02:08.340> judging<00:02:08.640> by<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.790> size<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.240> screen

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
again judging by the size of the screen

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.800 
again judging by the size of the screen
