my usual penetrating oil I usually use C
foams<00:02:20.990> deep<00:02:21.350> creep<00:02:21.680> but<00:02:22.210> basically<00:02:23.210> I'm<00:02:23.420> out

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
heat was automatic transmission fluid

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.600 
heat was automatic transmission fluid
and<00:02:33.390> believe<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.900> or<00:02:33.960> not<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:35.040> combination<00:02:35.550> of

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
and believe it or not the combination of

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.680 
and believe it or not the combination of
the<00:02:35.700> heat<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.030> transmission<00:02:36.600> fluid

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
the heat and the transmission fluid

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.590 
the heat and the transmission fluid
really<00:02:37.110> did<00:02:37.350> just<00:02:37.560> kind<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.740> power<00:02:37.950> through<00:02:38.310> it

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
really did just kind of power through it

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.340 
really did just kind of power through it
especially<00:02:39.600> on<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:40.290> on<00:02:41.690> this<00:02:42.690> one<00:02:42.870> right<00:02:42.990> here

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
especially on the on this one right here

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.100 
especially on the on this one right here
once<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.460> had<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:45.150> shank<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.570> bolt<00:02:45.750> heated

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
once I had the shank of the bolt heated

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.110 
once I had the shank of the bolt heated
up<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:48.920> put<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:49.950> couple<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.250> just<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.490> few<00:02:50.640> drops<00:02:50.820> of

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
up I put a couple of just a few drops of

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.700 
up I put a couple of just a few drops of
transmission<00:02:51.570> fluid<00:02:51.660> on<00:02:51.900> there<00:02:52.080> really

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
transmission fluid on there really

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.500 
transmission fluid on there really
didn't<00:02:53.010> take<00:02:53.160> much<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.520> soak<00:02:53.700> in<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.390> could

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
didn't take much to soak in and I could

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.990 
didn't take much to soak in and I could
see<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.780> rust<00:02:55.020> bubbling<00:02:55.530> up<00:02:55.680> so<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.520> knew<00:02:56.790> was

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
see the rust bubbling up so I knew was

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.130 
see the rust bubbling up so I knew was
working<00:02:57.360> at<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.590> point<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.190> had<00:02:59.400> I<00:03:00.110> had<00:03:01.110> a

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
working at that point I had I had a

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.070 
working at that point I had I had a
little<00:03:01.380> bit<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:02.270> bolt<00:03:03.270> sticking<00:03:03.750> out<00:03:03.900> on

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
little bit of bolt sticking out on

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.620 
little bit of bolt sticking out on
either<00:03:04.260> side<00:03:04.620> here<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.600> I<00:03:06.600> was<00:03:06.780> able<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:07.110> grip

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
either side here and I was able to grip

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.500 
either side here and I was able to grip
I<00:03:09.630> was<00:03:09.990> able<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.230> grip<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:10.940> with<00:03:11.940> vice<00:03:12.180> grips

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
I was able to grip that with vice grips

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.000 
I was able to grip that with vice grips
as<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.810> see<00:03:12.990> here<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:14.810> very<00:03:15.810> very<00:03:16.380> carefully

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
as you see here and very very carefully

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.990 
as you see here and very very carefully
twisted<00:03:17.730> out<00:03:17.880> and<00:03:18.920> a<00:03:19.920> lot<00:03:20.070> of<00:03:20.160> times<00:03:20.370> if<00:03:20.850> it

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
twisted out and a lot of times if it

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.840 
twisted out and a lot of times if it
started<00:03:21.210> to<00:03:21.390> snag<00:03:21.690> again<00:03:21.990> I<00:03:22.230> would<00:03:23.040> go<00:03:23.490> back<00:03:23.670> in

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
started to snag again I would go back in

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.670 
started to snag again I would go back in
the<00:03:23.940> other<00:03:24.030> direction<00:03:24.270> clockwise<00:03:24.870> tighten<00:03:25.470> it

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
the other direction clockwise tighten it

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.140 
the other direction clockwise tighten it
back<00:03:25.800> down<00:03:25.860> pull<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.370> little<00:03:26.490> more<00:03:26.640> put<00:03:27.120> a

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
back down pull a little more put a

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.670 
back down pull a little more put a
little<00:03:27.450> more<00:03:27.570> penetrating<00:03:28.080> oil<00:03:28.290> or

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
little more penetrating oil or

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.740 
little more penetrating oil or
transmission<00:03:29.160> fluid<00:03:29.490> on<00:03:29.610> it<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:29.940> then<00:03:30.660> go

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
transmission fluid on it and then go

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.110 
transmission fluid on it and then go
back<00:03:30.930> in<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.140> other<00:03:31.230> direction<00:03:31.880> and<00:03:32.880> every

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
back in the other direction and every

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.580 
back in the other direction and every
time<00:03:33.330> it's<00:03:33.480> snagged<00:03:33.750> I<00:03:34.020> was<00:03:34.260> just<00:03:34.440> very

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
time it's snagged I was just very

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.730 
time it's snagged I was just very
patient<00:03:35.420> did<00:03:36.420> that<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.900> eventually<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:37.560> did

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
patient did that and eventually I did

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.930 
patient did that and eventually I did
get<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.160> bolt<00:03:38.340> out<00:03:38.490> so<00:03:40.490> thankfully<00:03:41.490> I<00:03:41.520> was

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
get the bolt out so thankfully I was

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.340 
get the bolt out so thankfully I was
able<00:03:42.210> to<00:03:42.360> get<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.690> bolts<00:03:42.990> out<00:03:43.110> without

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
able to get the bolts out without

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.950 
able to get the bolts out without
damaging<00:03:43.710> the<00:03:44.100> threads<00:03:44.370> here<00:03:44.610> so<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:45.120> will<00:03:45.630> be

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
damaging the threads here so I will be

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.410 
damaging the threads here so I will be
able<00:03:46.140> to<00:03:46.470> install<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.400> new<00:03:47.430> shock<00:03:47.820> absorber

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
able to install the new shock absorber

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.460 
able to install the new shock absorber
without<00:03:49.320> any<00:03:49.530> problem<00:03:49.920> so<00:03:50.610> that<00:03:51.420> is<00:03:51.720> my<00:03:51.960> tip<00:03:52.020> on

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
that of course I had to go to the store

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.400 
that of course I had to go to the store
and<00:03:55.500> buy<00:03:55.740> new<00:03:56.010> bolts<00:03:56.490> and<00:03:56.870> my<00:03:57.870> only<00:03:58.110> other<00:03:58.200> tip

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
and buy new bolts and my only other tip

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.710 
and buy new bolts and my only other tip
on<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.620> job<00:03:58.830> is<00:03:59.960> when<00:04:00.960> you're<00:04:01.250> reinstalling
