00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
is that hook opens up a little bit it'll

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.349 
is that hook opens up a little bit it'll
cut<00:03:11.260> its<00:03:11.439> way<00:03:11.650> out<00:03:11.730> instead<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.909> punching

cut its way out instead of it punching

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.330 
cut its way out instead of it punching
right<00:03:13.540> through<00:03:13.840> so<00:03:14.470> many<00:03:14.620> times<00:03:14.980> you<00:03:15.220> know

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
right through so many times you know

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.860 
right through so many times you know
you'll<00:03:15.579> flip<00:03:15.909> in<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.150> place<00:03:16.329> and<00:03:16.510> get<00:03:16.599> a<00:03:16.629> hard

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
you'll flip in a place and get a hard

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.569 
you'll flip in a place and get a hard
bite<00:03:17.079> and<00:03:17.260> set<00:03:17.439> the<00:03:17.560> hook<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:17.950> when<00:03:18.280> you<00:03:18.370> catch

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
bite and set the hook and when you catch

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.610 
bite and set the hook and when you catch
the<00:03:18.790> fish<00:03:18.969> he's<00:03:19.329> hooked<00:03:19.569> right<00:03:19.810> here<00:03:20.049> and<00:03:20.230> the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
the fish he's hooked right here and the

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.470 
the fish he's hooked right here and the
reason<00:03:20.889> for<00:03:20.919> that<00:03:21.099> is<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:21.370> hook<00:03:21.790> is<00:03:21.939> flexed

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
reason for that is that hook is flexed

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.270 
reason for that is that hook is flexed
and<00:03:22.629> opened<00:03:23.019> and<00:03:23.169> it<00:03:23.560> will<00:03:23.680> never<00:03:23.799> go<00:03:23.919> through

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
and opened and it will never go through

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.920 
and opened and it will never go through
it<00:03:24.400> just<00:03:24.579> keeps<00:03:24.760> tearing<00:03:25.030> its<00:03:25.299> way<00:03:25.480> out<00:03:25.510> and

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
it just keeps tearing its way out and

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.390 
it just keeps tearing its way out and
then<00:03:26.319> it<00:03:26.439> catches<00:03:26.829> you<00:03:26.950> know<00:03:27.040> I<00:03:27.069> don't<00:03:27.219> know

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
then it catches you know I don't know

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.399 
then it catches you know I don't know
mouth<00:03:27.579> normally<00:03:28.450> with<00:03:28.599> that<00:03:28.750> with<00:03:28.959> this<00:03:29.139> hook
