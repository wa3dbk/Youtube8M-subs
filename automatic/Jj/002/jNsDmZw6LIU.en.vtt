00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:38.500
 And these are the bees of those days 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.870
 on the former court of richard bosse 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.590
 the ruler of these many peoples 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.380
 if I am about a bad dictator but 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.800
 a sensitive working and proud 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:55.670
 father cheerfully them from renner 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:59.629
 hermannsburg the young newly built 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.140
 have been controlled and the green 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:06.050
 tree cut out 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.590
 because the threatened red are limited 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.009
 should 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.549
 Drones are known to carry no honey 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.399
 1 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.590
 here in the always laughs again 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.920
 apiary in Low German at the 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:25.499
 There was always something in heathen in cologne 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.299
 to be amazed and to learn a lot 

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:31.780
 here were more than half ago 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:35.560
 century for us guys the basics 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:39.130
 if you want to beekeep 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.420
 Operation and bees flats 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.780
 have changed 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.299
 remained the admiration of the 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.450
 hard work and the services of ours 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.450
 protÃ©gÃ©s 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.720
 the swarm time has begun 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.980
 From 100 standing people will be in the basket 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.610
 Imkerei more than 300 now for the 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.340
 heathen be prepared 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.190
 the swarms will bag with sway 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.970
 intercepted when the time 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.490
 is recognized in time 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:08.600
 otherwise the bees will live the swarm 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:12.860
 process deliciously and accumulate 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:16.989
 then as a big grape most of the cases 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.989
 on a tree or bush 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.489
 catching the swarm is not 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.129
 always easy as we see here 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.739
 often the beekeeper gets a part of the 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:37.690
 Bees on the head and a few stitches 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.690
 are then unavoidable 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:17.650
 the swarm gets a new dwelling 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:20.130
 and devotes a few even bumps calmed down 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.800
 The queen of 10,000 bees 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:27.120
 picking out requires a good one 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.120
 screw and a lot of experience 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.569
 More and more peoples became more and more in the course of the 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:32.080
 Summer from about August, it went off then 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:37.569
 with all the baskets to the heather in the 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:42.699
 harvest the e mail from my booth 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:45.550
 then for seven to eight months as empty 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:48.610
 We then watched boys in the spring 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:52.360
 over and over again, waiting for the 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:55.389
 beekeepers there was still much to learn 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.870
 of bees father totally runner out 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:57.870
