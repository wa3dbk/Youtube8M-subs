 monoprix or finally in supermarkets and 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.529

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.050
 and that I close where I start this 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:27.750

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:44.789
 so that's the range that's 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:48.899

 that women have an intense life and 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.439
 so taken care of choosing the best 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.299
 ingredients the fragrances and the 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.649

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.200
 use that allow your hair

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.300
 so they say they wish she punishes 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.190
 repairing shampoo formula he betrayed 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.470
 moisturizing date that would nourish by the 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.480
 dry and damaged hair based on extract 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.950
 dancing and shea protein the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.870
 hair become so silky and 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.810
 bright and even topo 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:34.110
 same topo for the little mask that 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.030
 is there then the English I noticed 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.010
 they have barbers tabs and I like 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.870
 well the small openings like that 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.140
 for shampoos I have a doubt 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.390
 product of which I will speak to you here and 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.360
 so that's opening up like this and you 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.510
 have the shampoo that comes out so I 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.170
 I'm going to use I'm here I'm at the 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.780
 msa shampoo month champagne room 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.990
 but he is still well tested then 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:06.900
 the plus point of this product is that 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:09.330
 gmail or 500 hours the caramel the 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.390
 sweet caramel what is karate 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.640
 karate carrick karate pup the shea which 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.790
 a little caramel smell down that's it 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.959
 that smell and I can shoot myself 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.640
 with central and the positive point is 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.840
 that you have this smell in your cabbages 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:31.650
 go when they are dry for if the 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.070
 you have your hair that is not too much 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.140
 assaulted or too much 12h go for 12 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:41.690
 hours what's not left all the time 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.520
 but it still remains and it's great 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.680
 in fact the positive point that I would say 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:51.810
 is it smell what because 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.380
 these are my hair already the shampoo it 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.390
 my daughter 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.560
 actually it makes me weird because the 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.410
 champo actually when I did the 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.470
 shampoo my hair they are not when 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.680
 I breeds they are not where they are 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.150
 dry and in addition they do clinical chemistry 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.530
 on pc you see when you touch 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.060
 the impression I make is that 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.010
 it's chic clinical chemistry that I'm 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.140
 say that good does not mean anything because 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.580
 farid habib shampoo of Farid abbots 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.799
 do me chemistry clinical philippe hardworking 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.609
 in the hair but that's for sure 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:23.469
 that he's bad you see 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:25.889
 and well frankly the shampoo bof 

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:28.599
 so what's the same time it's a shampoo 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:31.030
 here I was playing close game but you are 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:35.830
 more hope in the mask that is there 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:38.080
 and who is like 6 that's it yes I do them 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.340
 used goods that sits the same 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.590
 smell of caramel shea I do not know what 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.099
 and in fact 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.659
 well it feeds but not enough what 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:53.740
 to know that I have very very thin hair 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:55.419
 dried up by proof I went in 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.740
 a jean louis david they put me in the heart 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.569
 one at this point in the hair because 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:03.009
 kerastase and the six- way vanity where 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:07.900
 I put the kerastase mask on a t shirt 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:09.520
 and they did not even know what they 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.250
 are not even where they had to put themselves 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.990
 to two for me to love the hair so 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.060
 be aware that I may have 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.250
 appearance hair that comes but 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.650
 they are nevertheless very very very very 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.120
 very dry and I need something 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.639
 shock to feed them and it happened 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:29.560
 we may not doubt that this 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:33.009
 range on dry hair idoine up 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.319
 must frankly work well but me 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.580
 for me personally and for the 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.099
 people who have curly hair 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.580
 I do not advise you what it is not 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:43.900
 finally I want to loop at ease finally for 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.430
 those who have really very hair 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.509
 dry 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.300
 do not use that stuff 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:50.889
 to give you an idea I know 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.439
 not me the dup is heavier and franck 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:54.590
 what to dope over nourishing or 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:57.110
 dope 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.940
 garnish the stra soft and more nourishing 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.920
 what to what 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.550
 the smell is fantastic but for the 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:07.700
 time it stays in the hair and 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:10.610
 and the thing that's good bah wood times 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.960
 yeah frankly it's those of 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.560
 products to test if you have them 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.510
 hair a little dry and not too dry 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.570
 and you want to give them a nice 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:24.260
 appearance here is also to know that 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:27.050
 these products are a bit more expensive not 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.270
 Too much expensive, though a bit more 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.300
 dear that the winners things like 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.800
 so that's something to know about our 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.180
 knowledge is still 400 milliliters 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.600
 is a bit huge 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:41.960
 the mask also effect 306 1300 activists 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.340
 bigger so there budget level it's up to 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.860
 you to see frankly for the loan 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.720
 know that I do not necessarily advise you 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.200
 this kind of product especially if you have 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.410
 selected 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:54.650
 so that's my review of 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:57.050
 products andrew barton sos and night i 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.880
 does this quick review rise because 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.550
 I saw them on none of the channels and 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.830
 that I always find that way 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.050
 always find it nice enough if we 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.350
 can find one on youtube so I 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.350
 you do
