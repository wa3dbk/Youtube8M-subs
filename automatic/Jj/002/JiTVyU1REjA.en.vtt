 salt mines north of the nature you are 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.800
 makes present with the perfect soil for the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.230
 cultivation of sugar cane raw material 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.710
 for the making of a wonder 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.710

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.769
 the production has been passed through several 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.080
 generations with the latest technology and 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.869
 special secret for the preparation of a

 true cachaça turned the north 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.760

 is talking to you one more 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.250
 program 'the leone show and today we 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.020
 is here in the city of salinas the city 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.360
 of cachaça and we are here in 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.550
 alembic cachaça this salt 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.710
 cachaça is the most sold in brazil 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.730
 You will know a little more about your 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.989
 story 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.960
 the organization indigenization environment 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.750
 air conditioning is one of the requirements 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.330
 the producer of cachaça salinas became 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:16.820
 reference in production of cachaça 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:25.049
 in Brazil and led to this 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:25.950
 that the baby had beer had no 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.520
 refrigerator 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.829
 So we started drinking cachaça and I 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.200
 I suddenly decided to make cachaça 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.070
 buy by starting just to 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.610
 Negotiate 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:47.189
 I was representative later in the future 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:50.970
 I decided to play the standardized solo 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.700
 whole life that usually cachaça today 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.159
 next year is different and we 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.549
 we got 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:04.049
 years and the students is the same cachaça 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:08.069
 whole life that swim on the palate 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:11.310
 of a product is of quality 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.459
 everything starts with the very grinding of sugarcane 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.310
 in which the cane is all diverted and 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.269
 reused in several segments after the 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.690
 its use 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.849
 right after the sugarcane juice in walking 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.750
 to the donuts through stainless steel tubes 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.760
 where the fermentation process is carried out. 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.000
 estimated time of this process 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.790
 fermentation in the donuts between 16 to 24 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.480
 hours and only after all this 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.980
 procedure is that the fermented 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.629
 sent for distillation the 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.360
 claudinei explains to us how it is that 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.420
 this process of distillation of the 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.420
 Sugarcane liquor 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:58.049
 when comes when the must is ready 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:03:00.299
 fermented 10k and supplies the friend 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:04.139
 also needs capacity and uncle 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:06.989
 of it is 2,500 liters of heated wort 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:10.709
 with the temperature of 90 ninety 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:14.579
 that degree there the steam rises up there 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:23.639
 receives the shopping condensa and where 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:28.019
 turns into cachaça with a first 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:31.049
 time with the tree exists one to three years 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.030
 in the cachaça pool really was on 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.910
 position and our standard 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.120
 after it is stored then it is 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:43.140
 that of oak baux d 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.989
 and we have the health care in the state that the 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.330
 white cachaça that usually the person 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.360
 Speak like I do not like cachaça. 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.150
 colored so we have are unique and 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.299
 of a cachaça is squid in this region 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.790
 store is also a major concern in the 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:03.030
 of the salinas cachaça that is 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.549
 carried out in several stages 1 all 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.879
 bottles that are used by cachaça 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:11.819
 saline are washed and sterilized with 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:14.970
 the use of technology is placed 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.979
 in all bottles the exact amount 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:23.720
 of cachaça so that no consumers 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:27.330
 slight damage with packaging labels 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.289
 are the hallmark of a reliable product and 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.000
 quality is clear all this process 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:36.030
 facilitates the distribution of cachaça to 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.410
 all regions of brazil 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:44.630
 thank you very much, thank you 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.630
 continue our program takes the trash 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.670
 ah
