at<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.270> top<00:02:15.330> we<00:02:15.870> have<00:02:16.020> two<00:02:16.290> more<00:02:16.319> that<00:02:16.620> we<00:02:16.770> can

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
at the top we have two more that we can

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.620 
at the top we have two more that we can
slide<00:02:17.130> open<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.700> course<00:02:17.730> there's<00:02:18.150> multiple

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
slide open of course there's multiple

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.960 
slide open of course there's multiple
positions<00:02:19.110> but<00:02:19.770> this<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.130> going<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.520> allow<00:02:20.910> the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
positions but this is going to allow the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.790 
positions but this is going to allow the

now<00:02:23.730> we<00:02:23.790> all<00:02:24.060> know<00:02:24.090> about<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.420> venturi<00:02:24.900> effect

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
now we all know about the venturi effect

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.010 
now we all know about the venturi effect
and<00:02:25.530> here<00:02:25.680> on<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.890> back<00:02:26.070> what<00:02:26.280> we<00:02:26.400> have<00:02:26.580> is

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
and here on the back what we have is

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.500 
and here on the back what we have is
open<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.380> close<00:02:28.590> mechanism<00:02:29.310> here<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:30.300> way
