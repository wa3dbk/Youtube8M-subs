was<00:01:06.780> able<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.110> also<00:01:07.350> add<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.920> more<00:01:07.950> training

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
was able to also add in more training

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.750 
was able to also add in more training
volume<00:01:09.360> today<00:01:09.540> as<00:01:09.869> well<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:11.130> overall<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.700> a

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
volume today as well so overall just a

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.330

really<00:01:11.939> good<00:01:11.970> training<00:01:12.390> day<00:01:12.799> after<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:13.950> top

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
really good training day after this top

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.120 
really good training day after this top
set<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.000> 250<00:01:15.420> for<00:01:15.570> seven<00:01:15.869> reps<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.470> went

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
set here of 250 for seven reps I went

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.499 
set here of 250 for seven reps I went
down<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.520> 225<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.810> did<00:01:18.930> eight<00:01:19.229> pause<00:01:19.590> reps<00:01:20.009> and

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
down to 225 and did eight pause reps and

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.980 
down to 225 and did eight pause reps and
that<00:01:21.509> felt<00:01:21.750> really<00:01:22.110> good<00:01:22.200> as<00:01:22.500> well<00:01:23.600> so<00:01:24.600> I'm<00:01:24.869> not

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
that felt really good as well so I'm not

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.929 
that felt really good as well so I'm not
sure<00:01:25.049> what<00:01:25.259> I'm<00:01:25.560> going<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> do<00:01:25.950> next<00:01:26.250> week<00:01:26.460> I

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
sure what I'm going to do next week I

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.289 
sure what I'm going to do next week I
think<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.900> will<00:01:28.110> up<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.530> weight<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.920> 255<00:01:29.640> and

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
think I will up the weight to 255 and

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.350 
think I will up the weight to 255 and
just<00:01:31.100> probably<00:01:32.100> shoot<00:01:32.460> for<00:01:32.670> six<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.030> seven

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
just probably shoot for six to seven

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.149 
just probably shoot for six to seven
pause<00:01:33.540> reps<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.259> near<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> one<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.890> press

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
pause reps with near the one to press

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.390 
pause reps with near the one to press
command<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.380> hope<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.650> best<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:38.159> guess

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400

back<00:03:47.850> in<00:03:48.030> high<00:03:48.150> school<00:03:48.180> way<00:03:48.900> better<00:03:49.230> than<00:03:49.410> this

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
back in high school way better than this

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.850 
back in high school way better than this
and<00:03:49.920> I<00:03:50.880> kind<00:03:51.239> of<00:03:51.270> lost<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:51.690> over<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.110> past<00:03:52.470> two

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
and I kind of lost it over the past two

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.010 
and I kind of lost it over the past two
years<00:03:53.160> of<00:03:53.489> mostly<00:03:54.270> bodybuilding<00:03:54.870> training

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
years of mostly bodybuilding training

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.740 
years of mostly bodybuilding training
has<00:03:55.440> diminished<00:03:55.950> that<00:03:56.250> arch<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:57.600> main

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
has diminished that arch and the main

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.410 
has diminished that arch and the main
reason<00:03:58.050> why<00:03:58.200> is<00:03:58.680> because<00:03:59.040> my<00:03:59.550> lower<00:03:59.880> back<00:04:00.180> it

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
reason why is because my lower back it

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.000 
reason why is because my lower back it
just<00:04:00.600> seems<00:04:00.810> a<00:04:00.930> lot<00:04:01.110> more<00:04:01.140> tight<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:01.770> sore

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
just seems a lot more tight and sore

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.550 
just seems a lot more tight and sore
