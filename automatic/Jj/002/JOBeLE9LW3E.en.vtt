00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.360
 Roulade sponge cake with apples 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.040
 Biscuit roulade with apples is a simple, cheap and delicious cake 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.360
 consisting of a large amount of juicy and sweet apples 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.167
 sprinkled with delicious cinnamon 

00:00:14.374 --> 00:00:16.374
 fluffy and delicate sponge cake 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.080
 where we wrap a lot of apples into an effective-looking roulade 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.440
 So we have an interesting look, a simple design and what is most important 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.160
 an unforgettable taste, obtained literally from several ingredients 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.680
 To make a biscuit roll with apples, the following ingredients are needed: 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.760
 apples 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.754
 eggs 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.960
 sugar 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.360
 wheat flour 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.393
 baking powder 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.180
 powdered sugar 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.900
 cinnamon 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.120
 First, peel the apple 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.180
 Peel the peeled apples in the slices 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.680
 Bake the baking mold with margarine 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.680
 Then we put the baking foil to the form, 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.740
 so that you can easily get the sponge later 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.840
 and put the cut apples 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.060
 We arrange as much as possible so that they take up the entire surface of the form 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.280
 Then sprinkle with a lot of cinnamon 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.820
 We separate the proteins from yolks 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.320
 Mix the proteins and beat them into a stiff foam 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.180
 We check if it falls out, if it does not fall out, it is almost compacted 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.720
 Then add sugar, mixing at the same time 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.200
 After pouring the whole glass, add one egg yolk 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.820
 and we're still mixing 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.900
 Finally, we sift the baking powder and wheat flour 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.180
 and the whole mix, this time by hand 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.120
 so that the ingredients are combined exactly 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.880
 Pour sponge mass onto apples 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.020
 it should be spread over the whole surface to cover all apples 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.740
 Preheat the oven to 180 degrees and then reduce it to 160 degrees 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.320
 and bake 30 minutes 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.400
 After removing the sponge from the oven, sprinkle it with powdered sugar 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.100
 he broke off the cloth easier 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.920
 We cover it with a cloth and then rotate the form 180 degrees 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.420
 We break the baking foil from the biscuit 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.580
 and at the end we wrap in roulade 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.800
 Leave about 10 minutes under the cloth 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.820
 Then, remove the cloth and sprinkle with powdered sugar 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.700
 and leave to cool 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.420
 This is the final effect 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.660
 Apple roulade is really delicious, simple 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.620
 cheap in performance, it's worth doing 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.820
 especially that now the apples are fresh 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.140
