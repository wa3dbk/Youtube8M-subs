is that this app gets access to your
music<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.760> will<00:00:38.850> stream<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.899> way<00:00:40.050> it

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
music and it will stream it the way it

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.470 
music and it will stream it the way it
works<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.680> simply<00:00:42.200> you<00:00:43.200> turn<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.480> once

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
works is simply you turn it on and once

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.970 
works is simply you turn it on and once
when<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:45.780> finished<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.230> loading<00:00:46.770> thing

when it's finished this loading thing
it's<00:00:47.100> doing<00:00:47.340> right<00:00:47.520> now<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.940> little<00:00:49.129> pop-up

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
it's doing right now a little pop-up

it's doing right now a little pop-up
will<00:00:50.550> come<00:00:51.059> up<00:00:51.210> saying<00:00:51.539> do<00:00:52.140> not<00:00:52.170> turn<00:00:52.500> off<00:00:52.680> your

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
will come up saying do not turn off your

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.950 
will come up saying do not turn off your
do<00:00:53.460> not<00:00:53.610> put<00:00:54.030> your<00:00:54.059> iDevice<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.750> sleep

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
do not put your iDevice in the sleep

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.869 
do not put your iDevice in the sleep
mode<00:00:55.110> do<00:00:55.379> not<00:00:55.530> run<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:55.920> app<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
mode do not run this app in the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.099 
mode do not run this app in the
background<00:00:57.449> etc<00:00:58.109> etc<00:00:58.670> after<00:00:59.670> 10<00:00:59.879> minutes<00:01:00.109> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
background etc etc after 10 minutes the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.049 
background etc etc after 10 minutes the
reason<00:01:01.410> why<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.590> because<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.609> cannot<00:01:02.820> run

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
reason why is because it cannot run

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.880 
reason why is because it cannot run
through<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> background<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.470> cannot<00:01:04.680> run

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
through a background and it cannot run

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.750 
through a background and it cannot run
while<00:01:05.070> your<00:01:05.280> device<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.740> quote-unquote

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
while your device is in quote-unquote

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.300 
while your device is in quote-unquote
sleep<00:01:08.760> mode<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.780> because<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.799> needs<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.100> steady

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
sleep mode it because it needs a steady

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.210 
sleep mode it because it needs a steady
stream<00:01:11.729> kind<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> PC<00:01:12.659> would<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
stream kind of like a PC would so the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.219 
stream kind of like a PC would so the
way<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.490> basically<00:01:14.939> works<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.840> same<00:01:16.049> way

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
way this basically works is the same way

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.789 
way this basically works is the same way
the<00:01:16.380> next<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.070> ps3<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.090> xbox<00:01:18.409> version<00:01:19.409> works

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
the next the ps3 to xbox version works

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.359 
the next the ps3 to xbox version works
what<00:01:20.759> does<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.450> goes<00:01:21.659> ahead<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.369> you

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
what does is that it goes ahead and you

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.700 
what does is that it goes ahead and you
go<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> your<00:01:23.759> music<00:01:23.880> file<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:25.259> find<00:01:25.530> the

as you might have noticed it took a

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.749 
as you might have noticed it took a
