00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
a little bit too much then then you know

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.370 
a little bit too much then then you know
then<00:02:45.730> he<00:02:45.820> wants<00:02:46.060> basically<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.720> but<00:02:47.200> last

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
then he wants basically and but last

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.290 
then he wants basically and but last
season<00:02:47.470> he<00:02:47.650> played<00:02:47.830> 18<00:02:48.280> games<00:02:48.610> scored<00:02:49.120> one

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
season he played 18 games scored one

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.760 
season he played 18 games scored one
goal<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.660> got<00:02:49.840> one<00:02:50.020> assist<00:02:50.320> he's<00:02:50.470> not<00:02:50.620> only

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
goal and got one assist he's not only

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.620 
goal and got one assist he's not only
you<00:02:50.980> know<00:02:51.010> well<00:02:51.430> up<00:02:51.550> there<00:02:51.580> with<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:51.970> 30<00:02:52.209> 40

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
you know well up there with the 30 40

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.630 
you know well up there with the 30 40
games<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.140> so<00:02:53.709> obviously<00:02:53.830> that<00:02:54.220> has<00:02:54.400> latched

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
games and so obviously that has latched

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.120 
games and so obviously that has latched
this<00:02:55.090> season<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.680> think<00:02:56.860> it<00:02:56.920> will<00:02:57.010> lack

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
this season and I think it will lack

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.370 
this season and I think it will lack
even<00:02:57.160> more<00:02:57.580> next<00:02:58.000> season<00:02:58.090> after<00:02:58.540> signing<00:02:59.019> you

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
even more next season after signing you

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.949 
even more next season after signing you
know<00:02:59.470> so<00:02:59.650> many<00:02:59.739> players<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.340> but<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.330> think<00:03:01.660> I

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
know so many players and but I think I

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.410 
know so many players and but I think I
well<00:03:02.800> it<00:03:02.860> seems<00:03:03.100> like<00:03:03.160> Arsenal<00:03:03.610> most<00:03:04.090> likely

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
well it seems like Arsenal most likely

a<00:05:10.600> little<00:05:10.750> bit<00:05:10.840> more<00:05:10.990> of<00:05:11.050> a<00:05:11.140> defensive<00:05:11.260> role

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
a little bit more of a defensive role

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.290 
a little bit more of a defensive role
and<00:05:11.920> he's<00:05:12.220> actually<00:05:12.370> we<00:05:12.640> getting<00:05:12.880> stuck<00:05:13.120> in
