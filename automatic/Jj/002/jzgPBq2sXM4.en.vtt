00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
change overnight so we're just going to

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.289 
change overnight so we're just going to
give<00:02:18.989> up<00:02:19.140> on<00:02:19.319> it<00:02:19.349> okay<00:02:20.250> unless<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.030> want<00:02:21.209> to

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
give up on it okay unless you want to

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.470 
give up on it okay unless you want to
die<00:02:21.510> for<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.870> which<00:02:22.349> you<00:02:23.310> can<00:02:23.489> do<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.970> if<00:02:24.360> you

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
die for it which you can do and if you

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.570 
die for it which you can do and if you
do<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.959> a<00:02:25.230> bunch<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.620> people<00:02:25.739> did<00:02:26.069> too<00:02:26.280> then

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
do and a bunch of people did too then

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.190 
do and a bunch of people did too then
you<00:02:26.760> will<00:02:26.940> probably<00:02:27.120> change<00:02:27.569> it<00:02:27.780> because<00:02:28.080> well

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
you will probably change it because well

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.960 
you will probably change it because well
if<00:02:28.319> you<00:02:28.349> look<00:02:28.620> at<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.799> biggest<00:02:29.099> changes<00:02:29.430> that

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
if you look at the biggest changes that

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
people have made in history as people

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.350 
people have made in history as people
that<00:02:31.530> like<00:02:31.680> fought<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:32.250> hard<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.790> took<00:02:33.239> a

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
that like fought so hard and took a

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.350 
that like fought so hard and took a
chance<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:34.049> took<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.349> big<00:02:34.590> risk<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.400> some<00:02:36.209> of

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
chance and took a big risk and some of

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.170 
chance and took a big risk and some of
that<00:02:36.450> risk<00:02:36.660> was<00:02:36.959> dead<00:02:37.739> most<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.640> time<00:02:38.849> you

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
that risk was dead most of the time you

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.150 
that risk was dead most of the time you
know<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:40.079> if<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.410> will<00:02:40.650> it's<00:02:40.769> about<00:02:41.010> that

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
know so if you will it's about that

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160 
know so if you will it's about that
right<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.610> can<00:02:41.849> but<00:02:42.239> then<00:02:42.420> if<00:02:42.599> you're<00:02:42.750> not<00:02:42.780> the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
right you can but then if you're not the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.520 
right you can but then if you're not the
new<00:02:43.440> height<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.810> I'm<00:02:45.810> not<00:02:46.019> saying<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.379> number

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
new height and I'm not saying a number

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.770 
new height and I'm not saying a number
worse<00:02:46.920> because<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.489> chose<00:02:47.849> that<00:02:48.120> path<00:02:48.420> it's

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
worse because I chose that path it's

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.839 
worse because I chose that path it's
because<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.379> want<00:02:50.099> to<00:02:50.250> experience<00:02:50.610> the

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
because I want to experience the

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.750 
because I want to experience the
benefits<00:02:51.329> of<00:02:51.569> that<00:02:51.840> path<00:02:52.170> as<00:02:52.530> well<00:02:52.799> and<00:02:53.489> you

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
benefits of that path as well and you

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.190 
benefits of that path as well and you
cannot<00:02:54.060> experience<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.629> benefits<00:02:55.079> of

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
cannot experience the benefits of

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.680 
cannot experience the benefits of
something<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.769> you<00:02:55.890> fight<00:02:56.160> for<00:02:56.209> my<00:02:57.209> dying<00:02:57.480> in

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
something that you fight for my dying in

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.119 
something that you fight for my dying in
40<00:02:58.049> because<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.319> would<00:02:58.440> never<00:02:58.530> experience<00:02:58.890> it

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
40 because you would never experience it

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.699 
40 because you would never experience it
after<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.760> die<00:02:59.910> of<00:03:00.150> course<00:03:00.329> so<00:03:01.170> I<00:03:01.200> decided

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
after you die of course so I decided

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.250 
after you die of course so I decided
well<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.099> I'm<00:03:02.220> going<00:03:02.609> to<00:03:02.640> just<00:03:02.879> hide<00:03:03.260> you

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
well that I'm going to just hide you

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.750 
well that I'm going to just hide you
know<00:03:04.290> it's<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.799> wuss<00:03:05.010> in<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.280> way<00:03:05.400> but<00:03:05.640> I<00:03:05.700> don't

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
know it's a wuss in the way but I don't

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.430 
know it's a wuss in the way but I don't
think<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.239> don't<00:03:06.420> think<00:03:06.569> of<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:06.930> way

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
think I don't think of it that way

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.819 
think I don't think of it that way
but<00:03:08.160> anyways<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.540> for<00:03:09.720> me<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:10.049> was<00:03:10.200> basically

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
but anyways so for me it was basically

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.780 
but anyways so for me it was basically
not<00:03:12.019> telling<00:03:13.019> anyone<00:03:13.319> that<00:03:13.709> way<00:03:14.190> I<00:03:14.220> can<00:03:14.459> enjoy

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
not telling anyone that way I can enjoy

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.640 
not telling anyone that way I can enjoy
because<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.329> felt<00:03:15.810> like<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.260> other<00:03:16.440> people

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
because I felt like the other people

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.530 
because I felt like the other people
outside<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:17.310> can't<00:03:17.549> change<00:03:17.730> your<00:03:17.880> mind<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.420> with
