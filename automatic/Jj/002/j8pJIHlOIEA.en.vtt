00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.569
 Hello dear viewers of my 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.840
 channel today would like to talk about 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:14.170
 my gloves 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:17.210
 from the company mechanics original mechanics and 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.550
 experience of use because i have them 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.590
 Job 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.680
 I have a lot of work to do 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.539
 tell how we see them already with me 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:32.050
 pretty all pauses on and even with 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.050
 traces of some pollution 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.440
 this one 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:43.559
 no worse than not have it now wants all 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.559
 say what this pattern 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:52.180
 that is, the very pattern of the gloves she 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.810
 pretty well there are of course disadvantages 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:01:00.100
 such as for example here seams here for example 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:04.690
 in these places yes where are our fingers 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.940
 are they give a little nose fingers 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.370
 but this I think is inevitable because 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.250
 when a few thick pieces of material 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.390
 the joints are necessarily sewn together 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.950
 there will be nothing to be done 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.970
 First of all, I would like to point out 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:25.840
 that these gloves are very comfortable clasp 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:30.280
 here it does not interfere with the work I am these 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:34.119
 gloves a lot of things dragged pieces 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.540
 some kind of plywood chipboard tools are very 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:40.420
 conveniently allows you to hold for example 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:45.780
 even a knife though I have fewer legs 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:48.780
 total work hammers all there 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.780
 nail catchers 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:57.119
 that's very good that is 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:01.409
 fold a knife without any problems 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:04.250
 you can put the safety on filming 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.250
 fuse 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:16.330
 Well, for example, a flashlight is convenient 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.370
 falls in hand due to the fact that here 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:28.170
 here are these faux suede inserts 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:28.170
 then this whole thing clings very well 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.110
 here and performs its function here here 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.250
 exactly here in that place where 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.230
 carried capture there is such a done 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.769
 it is here that is very successful in my opinion 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.739
 rate 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:49.150
 and she is so much the way the content 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:53.290
 mechanix gloves 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.510
 the original such itself say what most 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.660
 unpretentious happens even without 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.239
 buckles just go out and gloves 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.660
 but they satisfy all my needs 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.480
 there are actually more impact models 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:13.090
 It happens models with such rates precisely 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.950
 not called go that is beating them 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.510
 tried something I did not really like 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.160
 perhaps for some work will be convenient 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.590
 but they suit me 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.510
 You see, quite happy with those 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.639
 I will repeat tactical 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.060
 using the name work on my wall in 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:31.580
 work 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.940
 but I think that somewhere in some 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:42.020
 airsoft battles there in campaigns 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:43.430
 it will be really comfortable at home 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.920
 add what they are in different 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:53.260
 Here, for example, I have black flowers 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:58.239
 still black with white lettering are 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:03.700
 black with inlays of such beige leather 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.700
 time it is the fabric itself beige 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:12.920
 and looks pretty good 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:21.079
 here is something not level here and 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:21.079
 25-30 dollars a principle like this 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.849
 conveniently 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:35.069
 in their hand they donâ€™t have much loss from not 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.069
 stinks that the nicest 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.210
 here there are such small ones even 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.990
 pen with the inscription probably can go 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.990
 to sign 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.510
 in principle, that's all I wanted about these 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:05:00.650
 gloved hands say the whole review was 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.650
 interesting useful to new meetings
