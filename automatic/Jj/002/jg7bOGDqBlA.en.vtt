00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 and I'm going to make it see if it's true or is 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.630
 lie about if the galaxy s3 mini is 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.010
 compatible with the cable on the go or more 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.010
 with according to cable protects 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:23.330
 about the state connection using the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.520
 charger wherever the device is but 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.970
 is this connection can only be 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.970
 see and decorative shapes in 3000 one that 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.210
 I would say with this network in the middle juticia 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.309
 from the rom coal that I have a video of 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.300
 made of this route and the other would be 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.260
 modify the terminal 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.210
 but I think it will be a more messy job 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.880
 since the stock rom is not compatible 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.240
 as tg 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.480
 and become compatible to buy a 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.770
 cable apart from that would be to put it to 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.440
 charge then disconnect it very fast 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.240
 and connect the outer knitting wire of 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.640
 a little messy and once in the way more 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.730
 complicated you have to be hot a 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.740
 little and a bit complicated but now 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.740
 How to test it with a cable protects 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:24.030
 in this case it only works with a 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.030
 The first keyboard 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.450
 to show you 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.450
 when the configurations 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.490
 and anglo positioning and here they will see 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.730
 that this is the internal space as 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.680
 you can see on the sd card and below 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.680
 as good tells me usb storage 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.020
 we are in the cable connection protects 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.070
 connected I will have 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.990
 ready 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.229
 s 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.130
 and it acquires no problem now the 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:15.540
 file syndrome 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:20.370
 in a usb storage cards in 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:23.240
 I'm excited I'm like the artist 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:28.140
 and you asked me here 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:31.490
 I have a pure video but we go example 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.490
 the race does not 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.950
 and a video that I have 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.590
 m 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.630
 one 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.670
 already long no 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.569
 no problem in reading 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.569
 no problem 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.090
 the personal I think I've been better kills 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.870
 gtc of her here walk with a cable been 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.680
 flying in a little 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.680
 uncomfortable 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.370
 yes 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:18.630
 but I knit that is a treaty has 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.170
 a possible micro entry to make 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.490
 comments 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.490
 we arrived at the test 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.020
 with a nice way 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.020
 as you can observe 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.710
 the case would be 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.790
 cÃ¡diz 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.690
 and the most song lit the light in hands 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.810
 connecting that if they approach the 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.090
 screen here if I want to focus that 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.940
 The monster give important study 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.280
 can enter the bed because the 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.740
 visit does not work 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.650
 and how can you see 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.650
 work without any problem for less 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.890
 let's see what 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.800
 it works totally normal to the bar 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.300
 avoid 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.040
 and the problem is that you can not 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.220
 explains is how modem turned on screen 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.610
 it could be 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.150
 and we double click does not happen I have 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.150
 held down 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.650
 figuration 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.180
 to see if as a double click with what 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.660
 that if it were a computer 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.340
 what makes the game that one can 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.139
 play with this 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.590
 well for example in the case of one 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.360
 we have music a multi connector 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.810
 we could do this and connect a 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.440
 keyboard and a Serbian mouse and can play 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.440
 without any problem 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:53.120
 and team to see that it 's in a 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.960
 room works 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.960
 one of the state 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:20.610
 in this case please but it was for 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:20.610
 show that in this case if it works 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:27.900
 inter-bar 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:32.060
 well I'm going to show you with the one 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:37.639
 They saw that it works but to see me 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:40.310
 come on we go ice cream in the same way for 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:42.890
 check that 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.730
 very good problem here 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.730
 this is the keyboard 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:54.970
 forgive a salvation 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.970
 let's connect it in Quito 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.780
 we will enter 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:08.190
 and we are going to assemble the week and raise 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.190
 in rotation world 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.750
 but I do not have a thing without 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.760
 to the screen 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:26.740
 the rotation like this but before and psycho de 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.740
 fifa of motivation with cement have 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.200
 says Mr. and keyboard selected that 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.080
 that happened automatically when one 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:38.500
 connect the keyboard 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.500
 and now we leave in a being here in google 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:44.110
 as fixed mode appears and keyboard in 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.110
 the screen 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:48.010
 but I 'm going to write for example 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:54.300
 android 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.300
 we are going to write 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.110
 goodbye 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.320
 no problem 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.320
 what the numbering 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.710
 do not 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.710
 we could 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:11.710
 the 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.720
 the arrows work obviously clear 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.500
 alicante 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.360
 inside 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.270
 with space you can not enter the 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:31.990
 first thing that appears to inquire 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:31.990
 try a little more to see the veracity 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:40.990
 and it was not compatible there are ways to 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:44.080
 do it with another type of error 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:48.449
 it did not work 

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.449
 or breaks it either
