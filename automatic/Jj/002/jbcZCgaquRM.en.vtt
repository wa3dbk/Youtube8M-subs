kind<00:03:22.370> of<00:03:22.430> like<00:03:23.120> I<00:03:23.390> say<00:03:24.050> me<00:03:24.170> sick<00:03:24.519> see<00:03:25.519> me<00:03:25.610> really

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
kind of like I say me sick see me really

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.850 
kind of like I say me sick see me really
nice<00:03:26.000> mobility<00:03:26.870> a<00:03:27.050> fire<00:03:27.260> engine<00:03:27.440> is<00:03:27.590> gonna<00:03:27.709> be

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
nice mobility a fire engine is gonna be

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.190 
nice mobility a fire engine is gonna be
really<00:03:28.010> crazy<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.640> bit<00:03:29.300> a<00:03:29.330> mage<00:03:29.690> is<00:03:29.870> actually

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
really crazy a bit a mage is actually

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.660 
really crazy a bit a mage is actually
not<00:03:30.290> to<00:03:30.380> think<00:03:30.470> about<00:03:30.560> it<00:03:30.709> because<00:03:31.340> arcane

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
not to think about it because arcane

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.800 
not to think about it because arcane
also<00:03:31.880> gotta<00:03:32.060> move<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.269> sweet<00:03:32.480> so<00:03:32.570> I'm<00:03:32.630> sure

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
also gotta move a sweet so I'm sure

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.240 
also gotta move a sweet so I'm sure
frost<00:03:33.170> will<00:03:33.410> get<00:03:33.530> some<00:03:33.830> sort<00:03:33.980> of<00:03:34.100> movement

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
frost will get some sort of movement

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.600 
frost will get some sort of movement
speed<00:03:34.660> will<00:03:35.660> see<00:03:35.950> her<00:03:36.950> fire<00:03:37.130> bond<00:03:37.280> frost

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
speed will see her fire bond frost

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.979 
speed will see her fire bond frost
firebolt<00:03:38.030> increase<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.450> damage<00:03:38.570> of<00:03:38.780> frost

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
firebolt increase the damage of frost

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.840 
firebolt increase the damage of frost
wow<00:03:39.700> that's<00:03:40.700> a<00:03:41.110> that's<00:03:42.110> pretty<00:03:42.380> nice<00:03:42.850> by

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
wow that's a that's pretty nice by

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.650 
wow that's a that's pretty nice by
twenty<00:03:44.269> percent<00:03:45.070> not<00:03:46.070> bad<00:03:46.310> Chris<00:03:47.120> had<00:03:47.330> damaged

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
twenty percent not bad Chris had damaged

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.720 
twenty percent not bad Chris had damaged
a<00:03:47.720> dragon<00:03:48.019> specifications<00:03:48.620> yeah<00:03:48.769> that<00:03:49.580> was

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
a dragon specifications yeah that was

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.130 
a dragon specifications yeah that was
kind<00:03:49.910> of<00:03:49.970> weird<00:03:50.090> people<00:03:50.570> don't<00:03:50.720> usually<00:03:50.810> drag

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
kind of weird people don't usually drag

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.390 
kind of weird people don't usually drag
his<00:03:51.260> breath<00:03:51.440> for<00:03:51.470> damage<00:03:51.950> I<00:03:52.130> think<00:03:52.370> very

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
his breath for damage I think very

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.100 
his breath for damage I think very
rarely<00:03:52.850> will<00:03:53.000> you<00:03:53.180> dragons<00:03:53.570> rush<00:03:53.690> for<00:03:53.840> damage

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
rarely will you dragons rush for damage

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.160 
rarely will you dragons rush for damage
I<00:03:54.320> think<00:03:55.190> would<00:03:55.250> win<00:03:55.400> cool<00:03:55.610> fit<00:03:55.820> maybe<00:03:56.000> up<00:03:56.450> the

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
I think would win cool fit maybe up the

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.199 
I think would win cool fit maybe up the
damage<00:03:57.410> threshold<00:03:58.130> I<00:03:58.310> tell<00:03:58.820> dragon's<00:03:59.150> breath

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
damage threshold I tell dragon's breath

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.240 
damage threshold I tell dragon's breath
broke<00:03:59.570> from<00:04:00.260> direct<00:04:00.590> damage<00:04:00.739> I<00:04:00.950> think<00:04:01.130> that

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
broke from direct damage I think that

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.110 
broke from direct damage I think that
would<00:04:01.340> have<00:04:01.430> been<00:04:01.489> cool<00:04:01.550> because<00:04:01.880> i'm<00:04:02.030> pretty

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
would have been cool because i'm pretty

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.240 
would have been cool because i'm pretty
sure<00:04:02.269> dragon's<00:04:02.600> breath<00:04:02.660> doesn't<00:04:02.900> break<00:04:03.380> from

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
sure dragon's breath doesn't break from

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.820 
sure dragon's breath doesn't break from
damage<00:04:04.910> over<00:04:05.120> time<00:04:05.150> damage<00:04:05.780> it<00:04:06.320> only<00:04:06.530> breaks

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
damage over time damage it only breaks

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.229 
damage over time damage it only breaks
from<00:04:06.980> direct<00:04:07.310> damage<00:04:07.459> so<00:04:07.700> maybe<00:04:07.850> if<00:04:08.000> they<00:04:08.090> up

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
from direct damage so maybe if they up

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:09.460 
from direct damage so maybe if they up
that<00:04:08.450> threshold<00:04:08.720> a<00:04:08.959> bit<00:04:09.110> that'd<00:04:09.260> be<00:04:09.350> really

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
that threshold a bit that'd be really

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.320 
that threshold a bit that'd be really
cool<00:04:09.590> or<00:04:09.890> add<00:04:10.310> a<00:04:10.370> threshold<00:04:10.940> to<00:04:11.030> some<00:04:11.209> pretty

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
cool or add a threshold to some pretty

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.009 
cool or add a threshold to some pretty
short<00:04:11.510> breaks<00:04:11.750> no<00:04:12.500> matter<00:04:12.680> what<00:04:13.060> but<00:04:14.060> it's

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
short breaks no matter what but it's

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.680 
short breaks no matter what but it's

to actually cast a fireball it would be

get<00:05:06.320> right<00:05:06.500> into<00:05:06.650> this<00:05:06.740> enhanced<00:05:07.280> Ross<00:05:07.370> bolt

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
get right into this enhanced Ross bolt

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.370 
get right into this enhanced Ross bolt
reduces<00:05:07.970> the<00:05:08.030> cast<00:05:08.240> time<00:05:08.450> by<00:05:08.960> point<00:05:09.200> five

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
reduces the cast time by point five

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.130 
reduces the cast time by point five
seconds<00:05:10.180> kind<00:05:11.180> of<00:05:11.240> like<00:05:11.360> an<00:05:11.480> early<00:05:11.720> frost<00:05:11.990> I

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
seconds kind of like an early frost I

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.990 
seconds kind of like an early frost I
think<00:05:12.320> early<00:05:12.440> frost<00:05:12.800> reduced<00:05:13.370> it<00:05:13.550> by<00:05:13.580> more

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
think early frost reduced it by more

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.690 
think early frost reduced it by more
than<00:05:14.240> that<00:05:15.110> I<00:05:15.350> think<00:05:15.860> it's<00:05:16.100> like<00:05:16.220> a<00:05:16.250> one<00:05:16.550> and

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
than that I think it's like a one and

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.050 
than that I think it's like a one and
actually<00:05:17.540> one<00:05:18.400> maybe<00:05:19.400> like<00:05:19.610> almost<00:05:19.910> a

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
actually one maybe like almost a

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.430 
actually one maybe like almost a
one-second<00:05:20.570> cast<00:05:20.750> for<00:05:20.930> frost<00:05:21.170> will<00:05:21.320> so

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
one-second cast for frost will so

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.650 
one-second cast for frost will so
actually<00:05:21.800> it's<00:05:22.430> pretty<00:05:22.520> fast<00:05:22.820> the<00:05:23.330> fam<00:05:23.450> a

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
actually it's pretty fast the fam a

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.170 
actually it's pretty fast the fam a
chaste<00:05:23.870> you<00:05:23.990> have<00:05:24.110> his<00:05:24.890> isolette<00:05:25.310> fingers

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
chaste you have his isolette fingers

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.550 
chaste you have his isolette fingers
frost<00:05:26.450> can<00:05:26.540> stack<00:05:26.750> one<00:05:26.990> additional<00:05:27.320> time

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
frost can stack one additional time

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.110 
frost can stack one additional time
that's<00:05:27.800> pretty<00:05:27.980> nice<00:05:28.130> I<00:05:28.400> don't<00:05:28.910> know<00:05:29.000> why<00:05:29.090> that

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
that's pretty nice I don't know why that

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.670 
that's pretty nice I don't know why that
wouldn't<00:05:29.420> be<00:05:29.570> called<00:05:29.750> enhanced<00:05:29.900> fingers<00:05:30.590> to

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
wouldn't be called enhanced fingers to

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.820 
wouldn't be called enhanced fingers to

Nova if you like if you have this I'm
not<00:07:01.129> sure<00:07:01.360> it's<00:07:02.360> because<00:07:02.419> it<00:07:02.629> says<00:07:02.749> also<00:07:03.169> know

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:03.289 
not sure it's because it says also know

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:05.289 
not sure it's because it says also know
so<00:07:03.439> if<00:07:03.589> you<00:07:03.679> could<00:07:03.769> root<00:07:04.009> this<00:07:04.189> and<00:07:04.459> then<00:07:04.549> water

so if you could root this and then water

00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:06.699 
so if you could root this and then water
jedem<00:07:05.659> and<00:07:05.809> then<00:07:05.959> just<00:07:06.110> start

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:06.709 
jedem and then just start

good<00:07:10.339> damage<00:07:10.399> so<00:07:11.299> i<00:07:11.329> think<00:07:11.509> that'd<00:07:11.689> be<00:07:11.749> good

00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:11.839

good damage so i think that'd be good
and<00:07:12.019> increases<00:07:12.349> damage<00:07:12.469> across<00:07:12.709> our<00:07:12.919> boat<00:07:13.069> by

twenty percent so over all these perks
