those back and forth and if you do have
those<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.220> your<00:01:44.250> images<00:01:44.670> I'm<00:01:45.299> going<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.479> show

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
those in your images I'm going to show

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.210 
those in your images I'm going to show
you<00:01:45.600> great<00:01:45.899> way<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.049> simplify<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:46.649> we

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
you great way to simplify it so we

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.219 
you great way to simplify it so we
already<00:01:47.490> have<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:49.049> image

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
already have that in this in this image

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.870 
already have that in this in this image
what<00:01:49.649> we're<00:01:49.770> going<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:50.100> I'm<00:01:50.579> going<00:01:50.820> to

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
what we're going to do I'm going to

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.340 
what we're going to do I'm going to
create<00:01:51.030> an<00:01:51.210> adjustment<00:01:51.450> layer<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.990> we're

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
create an adjustment layer and we're

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.800 
create an adjustment layer and we're
going<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.500> go<00:01:52.619> over<00:01:52.829> here<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.040> solid<00:01:53.880> color<00:01:54.090> so

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
going to go over here to solid color so

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.209 
going to go over here to solid color so
we've<00:01:54.960> got<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> solid<00:01:55.500> color<00:01:55.680> adjustment<00:01:55.740> layer

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
we've got a solid color adjustment layer

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.950 
we've got a solid color adjustment layer
and<00:01:56.310> I'm<00:01:56.520> going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.700> choose<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> green<00:01:57.540> that's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
and I'm going to choose a green that's

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.899 
and I'm going to choose a green that's
relatively<00:01:58.469> similar<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.520> green<00:01:59.729> that's

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
relatively similar to the green that's

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.310 
relatively similar to the green that's
actually<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.420> photo<00:02:00.659> don't<00:02:01.079> worry<00:02:01.200> about

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
actually in the photo don't worry about

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.660 
actually in the photo don't worry about
it<00:02:01.500> if<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.680> don't<00:02:01.770> get<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.100> exactly<00:02:02.460> right

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
it if you don't get it exactly right

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.450 
it if you don't get it exactly right
just<00:02:02.880> now<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.689> let's<00:02:03.899> hit<00:02:03.990> OK<00:02:04.369> what<00:02:05.369> we're

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
just now so let's hit OK what we're

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.649 
just now so let's hit OK what we're
going<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.640> do<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.820> change<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.060> from<00:02:06.299> normal

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
going to do is change that from normal

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.050 
going to do is change that from normal
down<00:02:06.810> here<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.229> color<00:02:07.560> all<00:02:08.550> right<00:02:08.729> now<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:08.910> know

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
down here to color all right now I know

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.029 
down here to color all right now I know
it<00:02:09.270> doesn't<00:02:09.450> look<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.869> great<00:02:10.200> right<00:02:10.560> now<00:02:10.590> but

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
it doesn't look that great right now but

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.990 
it doesn't look that great right now but
what<00:02:11.160> we're<00:02:11.250> going<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.400> do<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.640> change<00:02:11.879> our

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
what we're going to do is change our

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.650 
what we're going to do is change our
opacity

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
opacity

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.710 
opacity
here<00:02:12.810> down<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.110> 20%<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:13.980> hit<00:02:14.160> V<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.180> then<00:02:15.540> hit

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
here down to 20% so hit V and then hit

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.150 
here down to 20% so hit V and then hit
the<00:02:15.960> number<00:02:16.170> two<00:02:16.350> on<00:02:16.530> your<00:02:16.560> keyboard<00:02:16.800> and

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
the number two on your keyboard and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.500 
the number two on your keyboard and
that's<00:02:17.640> going<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.850> bring<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.120> down<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.300> about

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
that's going to bring you down to about

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.990 
that's going to bring you down to about
20<00:02:18.810> percent<00:02:19.190> so<00:02:20.190> let's<00:02:20.220> just<00:02:20.670> turn<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:20.880> off

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
20 percent so let's just turn this off

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.670 
20 percent so let's just turn this off
and<00:02:21.060> on<00:02:21.240> and<00:02:21.420> see<00:02:21.540> if<00:02:21.630> we<00:02:21.750> it's<00:02:22.020> what<00:02:22.380> we<00:02:22.500> like

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
and on and see if we it's what we like

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.170 
and on and see if we it's what we like
if<00:02:22.860> it's<00:02:23.100> not<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.430> can<00:02:23.550> just<00:02:23.580> double<00:02:23.970> click

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
if it's not you can just double click

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.210 
if it's not you can just double click
right<00:02:24.210> over<00:02:24.450> here<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.990> you<00:02:25.710> can<00:02:25.860> change<00:02:26.040> your

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
right over here and you can change your

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.740 
right over here and you can change your
saturation<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:26.880> can<00:02:27.150> change<00:02:27.390> your<00:02:27.510> color<00:02:27.630> a

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
saturation you can change your color a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.360 
saturation you can change your color a
little<00:02:27.990> bit<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.320> see<00:02:28.440> how<00:02:28.560> it's<00:02:28.740> you<00:02:29.250> know

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
little bit and see how it's you know

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.460 
little bit and see how it's you know
kind<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.670> coloring<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.210> background<00:02:30.630> here<00:02:31.320> if

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
kind of coloring the background here if

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.110 
kind of coloring the background here if
we<00:02:31.620> went<00:02:31.800> up<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.100> like<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.550> know<00:02:32.670> reds<00:02:32.940> and

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
we went up to like you know reds and

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.340 
we went up to like you know reds and
things<00:02:33.360> like<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.720> would<00:02:33.840> add<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.110> little

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
things like that it would add a little

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.960 
things like that it would add a little
bit<00:02:34.470> more<00:02:34.500> red<00:02:34.830> so<00:02:35.040> let's<00:02:35.220> go<00:02:35.400> right<00:02:35.790> over<00:02:35.820> here

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
bit more red so let's go right over here

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.810 
bit more red so let's go right over here
so<00:02:36.270> towards<00:02:36.810> green<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:38.160> think<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.670> looks

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
so towards green and I think that looks

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.820 
so towards green and I think that looks
great<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.810> what<00:02:40.200> we're<00:02:40.320> doing<00:02:40.350> is<00:02:40.650> bringing

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
great so what we're doing is bringing

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.470 
great so what we're doing is bringing
down<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.280> opacity<00:02:41.520> of<00:02:41.820> this<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.120> let<00:02:42.240> me<00:02:42.270> just

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
down the opacity of this and let me just

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.390 
down the opacity of this and let me just
turn<00:02:42.600> this<00:02:42.660> off<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.080> on<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.440> can<00:02:43.560> see<00:02:43.770> it

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
turn this off and on so you can see it

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.910 
turn this off and on so you can see it
really<00:02:44.760> limits<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:46.170> know<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.410> kind<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.710> color

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
really limits you know the kind of color

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.170 
really limits you know the kind of color
in<00:02:47.100> your<00:02:47.130> image<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.520> brings<00:02:47.790> almost

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
in your image it brings almost

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.540 
in your image it brings almost
everything<00:02:48.600> towards<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:49.770> green<00:02:50.160> spectrum

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
everything towards that green spectrum

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.520 
everything towards that green spectrum
which<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.180> doesn't<00:02:51.450> look<00:02:51.570> weird<00:02:51.600> but<00:02:51.960> it<00:02:52.260> kind

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
which it doesn't look weird but it kind

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.560 
which it doesn't look weird but it kind
of<00:02:52.620> simplifies<00:02:53.190> everything<00:02:53.370> now<00:02:54.300> what<00:02:54.480> we're

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
of simplifies everything now what we're

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.270 
of simplifies everything now what we're
going<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.720> do<00:02:54.870> is<00:02:55.110> let's<00:02:55.740> just<00:02:55.800> go<00:02:56.040> ahead<00:02:56.160> and

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
going to do is let's just go ahead and

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.580 
going to do is let's just go ahead and
zoom<00:02:56.670> in<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.480> our<00:02:57.720> main<00:02:57.900> subject<00:02:58.110> we're<00:02:58.440> going

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
zoom in to our main subject we're going

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.590 
zoom in to our main subject we're going
to<00:02:58.650> go<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.220> our<00:02:59.310> layer<00:02:59.610> mask<00:02:59.640> and<00:03:00.120> I'm<00:03:00.450> going<00:03:00.570> to

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
to go to our layer mask and I'm going to

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.110 
to go to our layer mask and I'm going to
paint<00:03:00.810> black<00:03:01.200> on<00:03:01.560> our<00:03:01.740> layer<00:03:01.860> mask<00:03:01.910> where<00:03:02.910> our

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
paint black on our layer mask where our

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.220 
paint black on our layer mask where our
subject<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:04.260> this<00:03:04.800> is<00:03:05.010> using<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.850> can<00:03:06.000> see

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
subject is so this is using you can see

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.360 
subject is so this is using you can see
let<00:03:07.230> me<00:03:07.320> just<00:03:07.530> zoom<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:07.770> a<00:03:07.860> little<00:03:07.950> bit<00:03:08.130> so<00:03:08.280> you

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
let me just zoom in a little bit so you

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.000 
let me just zoom in a little bit so you
actually<00:03:08.490> can<00:03:08.820> see<00:03:09.200> it's<00:03:10.200> making<00:03:10.590> this<00:03:10.740> green

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
actually can see it's making this green

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.370 
actually can see it's making this green
layer<00:03:11.220> not<00:03:11.520> visible<00:03:12.060> where<00:03:12.510> our<00:03:12.870> subject<00:03:13.260> is

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
layer not visible where our subject is

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.740 
layer not visible where our subject is
so<00:03:13.860> it's<00:03:14.070> going<00:03:14.460> to<00:03:14.520> not<00:03:14.760> really<00:03:14.970> affect<00:03:15.300> skin

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
so it's going to not really affect skin

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.390 
so it's going to not really affect skin
tones<00:03:16.020> too<00:03:16.290> much<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.650> it's<00:03:16.860> going<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.310> get

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
tones too much and it's going to get

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.580 
tones too much and it's going to get
this<00:03:17.550> nice<00:03:17.760> magenta<00:03:18.330> color<00:03:18.540> popping<00:03:19.440> out<00:03:19.560> a

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
this nice magenta color popping out a

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.100 
this nice magenta color popping out a
little<00:03:19.950> bit<00:03:20.130> better<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:21.120> I'm<00:03:21.390> painting<00:03:21.780> black

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
little bit better so I'm painting black

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.570 
little bit better so I'm painting black
on<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.320> layer<00:03:22.500> mask<00:03:22.530> which<00:03:22.890> just<00:03:23.100> makes<00:03:23.340> this

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
on a layer mask which just makes this

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.940 
on a layer mask which just makes this
layer<00:03:24.590> invisible<00:03:25.590> wherever<00:03:26.459> I'm<00:03:26.640> painting

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
layer invisible wherever I'm painting

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.710 
layer invisible wherever I'm painting
there<00:03:28.950> we<00:03:29.130> go<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.430> we'll<00:03:29.670> just<00:03:29.880> hold<00:03:30.390> alt<00:03:30.600> or

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
there we go and we'll just hold alt or

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.970 
there we go and we'll just hold alt or
option<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:31.170> can<00:03:31.260> see<00:03:31.440> that's<00:03:31.590> what<00:03:31.709> my<00:03:31.830> layer

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
option you can see that's what my layer

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.380 
option you can see that's what my layer
mask<00:03:32.010> looks<00:03:32.400> like<00:03:32.520> it's<00:03:32.730> really<00:03:33.000> not<00:03:33.150> that

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
mask looks like it's really not that

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.449 
mask looks like it's really not that
great<00:03:33.570> but<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.200> doesn't<00:03:34.680> matter<00:03:34.920> for<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.280> most

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
great but it doesn't matter for the most

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.880 
great but it doesn't matter for the most
part<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.850> gets<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.330> job<00:03:36.510> done<00:03:36.570> so<00:03:36.959> let's<00:03:37.650> just

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
part it gets the job done so let's just

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.280 
part it gets the job done so let's just
zoom<00:03:37.950> out<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.490> we<00:03:38.700> can<00:03:38.850> see<00:03:39.060> now<00:03:39.090> how<00:03:39.780> well<00:03:40.080> she

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
zoom out and we can see now how well she

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.650 
zoom out and we can see now how well she
really<00:03:40.620> does<00:03:40.800> stand<00:03:41.160> out<00:03:41.430> of<00:03:41.459> that<00:03:42.180> background

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
really does stand out of that background

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.050 
really does stand out of that background
and<00:03:42.989> you<00:03:43.260> could<00:03:43.410> crop<00:03:43.620> this<00:03:43.830> in<00:03:44.040> in<00:03:44.220> any<00:03:44.610> number

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
and you could crop this in in any number

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.250 
and you could crop this in in any number
of<00:03:45.090> ways<00:03:45.150> but<00:03:45.510> let's<00:03:45.720> just<00:03:45.840> turn<00:03:46.020> this<00:03:46.140> layer

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
of ways but let's just turn this layer

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.860 
of ways but let's just turn this layer
off<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:46.800> on<00:03:46.890> so<00:03:47.610> you<00:03:47.700> can<00:03:47.820> see<00:03:48.000> with<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:48.570> off

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
off and on so you can see with it off

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.229 
off and on so you can see with it off
it's<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.950> know<00:03:50.040> she<00:03:50.160> does<00:03:50.400> stand<00:03:50.640> out<00:03:50.790> but<00:03:50.970> the

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
it's you know she does stand out but the

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.940 
it's you know she does stand out but the
tree<00:03:51.570> color<00:03:51.780> in<00:03:52.050> the<00:03:52.140> background<00:03:52.320> color<00:03:52.709> they

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
tree color in the background color they

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.890 
tree color in the background color they
all<00:03:53.070> kind<00:03:53.340> of<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.610> creates<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.060> lot<00:03:54.209> of<00:03:54.239> not

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
all kind of it creates a lot of not

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.600 
all kind of it creates a lot of not
distraction<00:03:55.590> but<00:03:55.739> it<00:03:55.920> could<00:03:56.070> be<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.220> little<00:03:56.400> bit

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
distraction but it could be a little bit

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.640 
distraction but it could be a little bit
simplified<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.660> by<00:03:57.780> bringing<00:03:58.110> that<00:03:58.230> one

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
simplified and by bringing that one

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.470 
simplified and by bringing that one
color<00:03:58.920> throughout<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.640> really<00:04:00.000> does<00:04:00.180> help<00:04:00.390> to

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
color throughout it really does help to

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.510 
color throughout it really does help to
simplify<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.050> image<00:04:01.350> and<00:04:01.530> she<00:04:02.010> does<00:04:02.190> stand

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
simplify the image and she does stand

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.190 
simplify the image and she does stand
out<00:04:02.670> quite<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:03.060> bit<00:04:03.150> more<00:04:03.480> so<00:04:03.720> something<00:04:04.170> you

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
out quite a bit more so something you

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.050 
out quite a bit more so something you
guys<00:04:04.410> can<00:04:04.620> do<00:04:04.739> in<00:04:04.920> like<00:04:05.070> two<00:04:05.400> seconds<00:04:05.820> just

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
guys can do in like two seconds just

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.610 
guys can do in like two seconds just
pick<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.360> background<00:04:06.780> color<00:04:06.959> predominant

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
pick the background color predominant

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.870 
pick the background color predominant
and<00:04:07.709> then<00:04:07.830> just<00:04:07.980> mask<00:04:08.190> that<00:04:08.370> out<00:04:08.550> wherever

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
and then just mask that out wherever

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.370 
and then just mask that out wherever
your<00:04:08.970> subjects<00:04:09.330> are<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.660> it's<00:04:10.050> going<00:04:10.140> to<00:04:10.230> make

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
your subjects are and it's going to make

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.949 
your subjects are and it's going to make
them<00:04:10.530> really<00:04:10.560> pop<00:04:11.160> out<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.730> lot<00:04:12.150> more<00:04:12.360> now

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
them really pop out a lot more now

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.170 
them really pop out a lot more now
because<00:04:13.470> it's<00:04:13.680> phlearn<00:04:14.550> and<00:04:14.760> I<00:04:14.790> want<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.060> do<00:04:15.150> a

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
because it's phlearn and I want to do a

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.240 
because it's phlearn and I want to do a
little<00:04:15.390> bit<00:04:15.570> more<00:04:15.780> to<00:04:15.989> this<00:04:16.140> what<00:04:16.950> we're<00:04:17.100> going

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
little bit more to this what we're going

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.229 
little bit more to this what we're going
to<00:04:17.280> do<00:04:17.370> is<00:04:17.520> going<00:04:17.669> to<00:04:17.730> bring<00:04:17.850> her<00:04:18.000> out<00:04:18.120> a<00:04:18.150> little

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
to do is going to bring her out a little

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.120 
to do is going to bring her out a little
bit<00:04:18.510> more<00:04:18.660> using<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.140> really<00:04:19.350> cool<00:04:19.560> than<00:04:19.890> yet

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
bit more using a really cool than yet

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.890 
bit more using a really cool than yet
technique<00:04:20.640> so<00:04:20.910> let's<00:04:21.270> grab<00:04:21.450> an<00:04:21.570> adjustment

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
technique so let's grab an adjustment

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.930 
technique so let's grab an adjustment
layer<00:04:22.020> and<00:04:22.350> I'm<00:04:23.100> going<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.250> go<00:04:23.370> here<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.610> curves

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
layer and I'm going to go here to curves

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.430 
layer and I'm going to go here to curves
we're<00:04:24.300> just<00:04:24.450> going<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.630> click<00:04:24.840> right<00:04:25.200> here<00:04:25.260> in

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
we're just going to click right here in

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.030 
we're just going to click right here in
the<00:04:25.530> middle<00:04:25.740> and

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
the middle and

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.850 
the middle and
just<00:04:26.190> drag<00:04:26.430> that<00:04:26.670> guy<00:04:27.270> up<00:04:27.480> now<00:04:28.230> oftentimes

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
just drag that guy up now oftentimes

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.770 
just drag that guy up now oftentimes
when<00:04:29.010> you're<00:04:29.100> creating<00:04:29.460> a<00:04:29.850> curves<00:04:30.360> layer<00:04:30.480> and

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
when you're creating a curves layer and

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.540 
when you're creating a curves layer and
you<00:04:30.840> bring<00:04:31.350> this<00:04:31.470> up<00:04:31.680> what<00:04:31.890> happens<00:04:32.190> is<00:04:32.340> your

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
you bring this up what happens is your

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.760 
you bring this up what happens is your
highlights<00:04:33.140> become<00:04:34.140> too<00:04:34.290> bright<00:04:34.500> they<00:04:34.620> get

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
highlights become too bright they get

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.560 
highlights become too bright they get
blown<00:04:35.010> out<00:04:35.220> so<00:04:35.970> I'm<00:04:36.030> going<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.210> show<00:04:36.330> you<00:04:36.360> how

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
blown out so I'm going to show you how

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.360 
blown out so I'm going to show you how
to<00:04:36.630> fix<00:04:36.960> that<00:04:37.170> so<00:04:37.740> we're<00:04:37.950> going<00:04:38.040> to<00:04:38.130> bring<00:04:38.340> that

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
to fix that so we're going to bring that

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.050 
to fix that so we're going to bring that
up<00:04:38.520> just<00:04:39.330> right<00:04:40.140> about<00:04:40.320> there<00:04:40.530> and<00:04:40.700> now<00:04:41.700> we're

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
up just right about there and now we're

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.250 
up just right about there and now we're
going<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.240> go<00:04:42.360> to<00:04:42.420> click<00:04:42.840> on<00:04:42.990> your<00:04:43.080> layer<00:04:43.200> mask

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
going to go to click on your layer mask

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.500 
going to go to click on your layer mask
and<00:04:43.740> go<00:04:43.890> to<00:04:43.950> image<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:44.580> then<00:04:44.940> down<00:04:45.150> here<00:04:45.180> to

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
apply image and all you have to do is

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.000 
apply image and all you have to do is
it's<00:04:48.480> by<00:04:48.840> default<00:04:49.230> it's<00:04:49.410> going<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.620> say<00:04:49.740> merge

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
it's by default it's going to say merge

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.490 
it's by default it's going to say merge
RGB<00:04:50.820> multiply<00:04:51.480> all<00:04:51.750> that's<00:04:51.960> correct<00:04:52.230> by

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
RGB multiply all that's correct by

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
checked so what I want you to do is

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.490 
checked so what I want you to do is
click<00:04:56.250> on<00:04:56.310> that<00:04:56.430> invert<00:04:57.000> and<00:04:57.240> what<00:04:57.960> it<00:04:58.050> does<00:04:58.230> is

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
click on that invert and what it does is

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.650 
click on that invert and what it does is
it<00:04:58.740> makes<00:04:58.890> any<00:04:59.250> where<00:04:59.550> that's<00:04:59.730> bright<00:05:00.090> not

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
it makes any where that's bright not

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.420 
it makes any where that's bright not
visible<00:05:01.110> on<00:05:01.260> this<00:05:01.380> layer<00:05:01.620> mask<00:05:01.710> and<00:05:02.100> anywhere

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
visible on this layer mask and anywhere

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.030 
visible on this layer mask and anywhere
that's<00:05:02.640> dark<00:05:02.910> visible<00:05:03.540> so<00:05:04.110> we'll<00:05:04.410> hit<00:05:04.470> OK<00:05:04.830> and

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
that's dark visible so we'll hit OK and

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.740 
that's dark visible so we'll hit OK and
let's<00:05:05.910> just<00:05:06.030> look<00:05:06.180> at<00:05:06.270> what<00:05:06.450> our<00:05:06.540> layer<00:05:06.660> mask

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
let's just look at what our layer mask

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.450 
let's just look at what our layer mask
looks<00:05:07.050> like<00:05:07.200> hold<00:05:07.560> alt<00:05:07.770> or<00:05:07.890> option<00:05:07.950> to<00:05:08.220> look<00:05:08.310> at

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
looks like hold alt or option to look at

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.650 
looks like hold alt or option to look at
it<00:05:08.580> I<00:05:08.700> know<00:05:08.790> it<00:05:09.000> looks<00:05:09.120> really<00:05:09.240> weird<00:05:09.480> but

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
it I know it looks really weird but

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.510 
it I know it looks really weird but
basically<00:05:09.990> it's<00:05:10.590> masking<00:05:11.100> out<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.370> light

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
basically it's masking out the light

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.460 
basically it's masking out the light
areas<00:05:11.910> and<00:05:12.090> it's<00:05:12.420> making<00:05:12.720> sure<00:05:12.840> it's<00:05:13.080> visible

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
areas and it's making sure it's visible

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.200 
areas and it's making sure it's visible
where<00:05:13.620> they<00:05:13.770> are<00:05:13.950> where<00:05:14.430> everything<00:05:15.090> is

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
where they are where everything is

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.750 
where they are where everything is
darker<00:05:15.630> so<00:05:15.810> it's<00:05:16.590> taking<00:05:17.010> all<00:05:17.220> the<00:05:17.340> darks<00:05:17.640> and

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
darker so it's taking all the darks and

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.100 
darker so it's taking all the darks and
kind<00:05:17.940> of<00:05:18.030> like<00:05:18.120> bringing<00:05:18.450> those<00:05:18.720> up<00:05:18.960> and

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
kind of like bringing those up and

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.180 
kind of like bringing those up and
brightness<00:05:19.440> so<00:05:19.560> you've<00:05:19.680> seen<00:05:19.830> those<00:05:20.010> great

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
brightness so you've seen those great

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.890 
brightness so you've seen those great
images<00:05:20.550> and<00:05:20.760> you<00:05:21.180> know<00:05:21.300> where<00:05:21.480> like<00:05:21.690> the

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
images and you know where like the

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.570 
images and you know where like the
shadows<00:05:22.410> really<00:05:22.680> aren't<00:05:22.800> that<00:05:22.890> dark<00:05:23.190> this<00:05:23.400> is

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
shadows really aren't that dark this is

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.370 
shadows really aren't that dark this is
how<00:05:23.700> they<00:05:23.880> do<00:05:23.940> that<00:05:24.180> so<00:05:24.870> let's<00:05:25.080> make<00:05:25.230> that

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
how they do that so let's make that

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.110 
how they do that so let's make that
visible<00:05:25.830> and<00:05:26.070> then<00:05:26.190> not<00:05:26.370> visible<00:05:26.700> and<00:05:26.910> you<00:05:26.970> can

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
visible and then not visible and you can

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.610 
visible and then not visible and you can
see<00:05:27.270> you<00:05:27.480> almost<00:05:27.720> have<00:05:27.840> like<00:05:27.870> a<00:05:27.990> painterly

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
see you almost have like a painterly

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.680 
see you almost have like a painterly
effect<00:05:28.650> going<00:05:29.220> on<00:05:29.400> with<00:05:30.060> your<00:05:30.240> image<00:05:30.480> which<00:05:30.660> is

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
effect going on with your image which is

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.450 
effect going on with your image which is
great<00:05:31.020> let's<00:05:31.410> just<00:05:31.590> lower<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:31.920> opacity<00:05:32.040> of

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
great let's just lower the opacity of

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.190 
great let's just lower the opacity of
that<00:05:32.550> a<00:05:32.640> little<00:05:32.940> bit<00:05:33.090> and<00:05:33.270> then<00:05:33.630> just<00:05:33.810> to<00:05:34.050> draw

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
that a little bit and then just to draw

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.900 
that a little bit and then just to draw
a<00:05:34.230> little<00:05:34.500> bit<00:05:34.590> more<00:05:34.860> attention<00:05:35.070> to<00:05:35.430> our

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
a little bit more attention to our

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.370 
a little bit more attention to our
subject<00:05:36.210> let's<00:05:36.720> describe<00:05:36.900> a<00:05:37.140> curves

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
subject let's describe a curves

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.950 
subject let's describe a curves
adjustment<00:05:37.470> layer<00:05:38.270> there<00:05:39.270> we<00:05:39.360> go<00:05:39.510> and<00:05:39.720> I'm

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
adjustment layer there we go and I'm

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.540 
adjustment layer there we go and I'm
going<00:05:40.050> to<00:05:40.140> bring<00:05:40.290> the<00:05:40.470> mid-tone<00:05:41.250> down<00:05:41.520> a

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
going to bring the mid-tone down a

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.130 
going to bring the mid-tone down a

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
layer let's just hit shift delete and

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.180 
layer let's just hit shift delete and
fill<00:05:51.450> the<00:05:51.600> middle<00:05:51.780> of<00:05:52.020> the<00:05:52.620> selection<00:05:53.070> with

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
black there we go

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.300 
black there we go
command<00:05:55.020> D<00:05:55.170> to<00:05:55.200> deselect<00:05:55.320> and<00:05:55.860> then<00:05:55.950> go<00:05:56.250> to

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
command D to deselect and then go to

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.750 
command D to deselect and then go to
filter<00:05:56.670> blur<00:05:56.880> and<00:05:57.720> two<00:05:58.560> Gaussian<00:05:59.400> blur<00:05:59.580> and

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
filter blur and two Gaussian blur and

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.730 
filter blur and two Gaussian blur and

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
it's too small you can still see the

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.990 
it's too small you can still see the
edges<00:06:03.480> so<00:06:04.020> make<00:06:04.140> sure<00:06:04.170> you<00:06:04.410> go<00:06:04.500> really<00:06:04.800> big<00:06:05.000> and

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
edges so make sure you go really big and

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.460 
edges so make sure you go really big and
it's<00:06:06.390> going<00:06:06.510> to<00:06:06.600> look<00:06:06.720> quite<00:06:07.080> a<00:06:07.110> bit<00:06:07.290> more

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
it's going to look quite a bit more

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.640 
it's going to look quite a bit more
natural<00:06:08.310> all<00:06:09.300> right<00:06:09.510> so<00:06:10.050> there<00:06:10.290> you<00:06:10.380> can<00:06:10.530> see

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
natural all right so there you can see

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.410 
natural all right so there you can see
