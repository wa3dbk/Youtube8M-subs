00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.820
 so magic box commands i'm all tired 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.530
 pro just disappointed in many things 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.650
 we will of course not yet we say 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.529
 it's all in the final episode reached 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.300
 Finally, before playing dying light with 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.040
 same developers as it comes out 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.980
 Thailand is only here for the caste 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:30.009
 passed 10 in the city with elements of power 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.989
 Parkour by day and night life as well as 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.890
 people so zombies 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.920
 Actually we will be defiantly 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.850
 the gameplay itself well yes that is, we are promised 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.649
 there is something interesting 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.489
 although I doubt that you can show 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:48.579
 something new after d-dai londa that is 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.859
 the city of a crowd of zombies is already there 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.050
 Repeatedly this is the topic of the gnawed 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:56.140
 length and breadth 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.140
 that they completely redesigned the system as 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.359
 fight so zombie mechanics probably 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.089
 completely remade the game that is, we are here 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.140
 know there is a parkour about how 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.979
 probably in some 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.979
 mirror's edge 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.259
 and as I understand it the night begins the most 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.210
 hardcore ie in the afternoon in the good zone 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.479
 go and actually 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.759
 especially not cause problems and at night they 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.310
 suddenly everyone mutates turn into 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.319
 some wild running zombies and 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.700
 starts to knead you right 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:34.119
 just so while we run and the hunter we and 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.829
 not a creation but at night from which it is completely 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.299
 the mode changes differently 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:42.520
 sorry to become travelers 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.979
 in every way to run away from them survive that is 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.130
 In terms of graphics, we see that everything is 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.969
 principle at the height of the game 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.259
 multiplatform cartoon 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.259
 district multiplatform 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.399
 for example, there was no one around with them 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.079
 in the afternoon they basically can not get along 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.909
 nowhere what is up but at night 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.710
 they are already running on the roofs 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.909
 general walls in every way tries you 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.909
 get some and shake 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:15.390
 Well, I hope the game does not disappoint because 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.650
 which is already quite difficult from such 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.410
 hackneyed ideas 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.320
 something new to suck up and creating that 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.090
 we reached skoda which meant 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.610
 synchronization start on the machine so that 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.620
 attract zombie attention 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.020
 after some exploded no why 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.160
 you can create new ones by next year 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.090
 there will be a mixture not a parkour zombie action game 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:42.980
 zombie action skateboards 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.980
 then snowboard zombie fifa it was already 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.750
 but 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.110
 us in trying not to new bash it 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.750
 such zombies from resident evil 5 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.590
 only missing him here because there 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.590
 the tone fell from the roof 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.940
 complete freedom of movement yes it is 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.640
 great that you can run away at any time 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.240
 from the crowd of zombies climb climbing on 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.670
 the building 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.500
 yeah that's only afternoon 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.530
 but sensually quite differently that is 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.130
 we turn into zombies yes bison something 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.130
 in the likeness of this 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.580
 as I understand it in the game there is some 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.620
 multiplayer make it the same 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.020
 like water thailand we have a cooperative 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.930
 on four players 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.329
 a 4 to 14 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.989
 weapons can be created as for example 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:40.030
 there is paint already have a full red cake 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.740
 you find some parts connect 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.920
 them and can stand their unique weapons 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.900
 great 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.650
 Well, as I understood mostly here as 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.920
 just the same as the same you Thailand 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.000
 chopping and piercing crushing 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.880
 gunshot whose regret is not enough 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.610
 Yes, very few of us are naturally not particularly 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.020
 shoot a kick is a novelty here 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:07.770
 there are soap bubbles from sulfuric acid 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:10.280
 have you not seen you are a murderous weapon 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.510
 hatchet 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.480
 not us fabia 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.850
 at our place language becomes a place 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.239
 flies principle we all showed you 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.449
 wait wait then play yourself we go 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.449
 farther
