now we are ready for this part come off
so<00:04:56.310> what<00:04:56.730> we're<00:04:56.910> going<00:04:57.060> to<00:04:57.120> do<00:04:57.890> is<00:04:58.890> this<00:04:59.310> case

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
so what we're going to do is this case

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.160 
so what we're going to do is this case
and<00:05:00.450> this<00:05:01.380> here<00:05:01.830> twists<00:05:02.520> off<00:05:02.900> so<00:05:03.900> we're<00:05:04.020> going

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
and this here twists off so we're going

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:13.280 
and this here twists off so we're going
to<00:05:04.260> twist<00:05:04.470> it<00:05:05.660> this<00:05:06.660> way<00:05:11.660> that's<00:05:12.660> a<00:05:13.020> little

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
to twist it this way that's a little

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.380 
to twist it this way that's a little
challenging<00:05:16.220> actually<00:05:17.220> I<00:05:17.520> told<00:05:17.910> you<00:05:18.060> the

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
challenging actually I told you the

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:24.050 
challenging actually I told you the
wrong<00:05:18.600> way<00:05:18.830> it's<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:20.010> other<00:05:20.160> way<00:05:22.760> and<00:05:23.760> if<00:05:23.910> you

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
wrong way it's the other way and if you

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.520 
wrong way it's the other way and if you
notice<00:05:24.830> when<00:05:25.830> you<00:05:25.980> first<00:05:27.110> twist<00:05:28.110> it<00:05:28.230> that<00:05:28.350> way

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
notice when you first twist it that way

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.580 
notice when you first twist it that way
and<00:05:28.800> it<00:05:28.919> comes<00:05:29.100> off<00:05:32.780> these<00:05:33.780> plastic<00:05:34.380> pieces

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
and it comes off these plastic pieces

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.260 
and it comes off these plastic pieces
are<00:05:34.890> going<00:05:35.010> to<00:05:35.100> come<00:05:35.310> down<00:05:35.340> off<00:05:35.880> of<00:05:36.150> this

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
are going to come down off of this

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.390 
are going to come down off of this
because<00:05:36.510> they<00:05:36.720> don't<00:05:37.020> turn<00:05:37.590> unattached<00:05:38.100> and

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
because they don't turn unattached and

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.850 
because they don't turn unattached and
so<00:05:39.090> when<00:05:39.240> I<00:05:39.270> first<00:05:39.480> saw<00:05:39.720> it<00:05:39.930> it<00:05:40.410> was<00:05:40.590> a<00:05:40.650> little

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
so when I first saw it it was a little

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.470 
so when I first saw it it was a little
star<00:05:41.430> length<00:05:41.640> and<00:05:41.790> I<00:05:41.850> thought<00:05:42.060> I<00:05:42.090> have<00:05:42.240> broke

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
star length and I thought I have broke

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.260 
star length and I thought I have broke
it<00:05:42.660> so<00:05:42.950> if<00:05:43.950> you<00:05:44.070> notice<00:05:44.340> the<00:05:44.370> spring<00:05:44.850> here<00:05:45.090> also

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
it so if you notice the spring here also

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.140 
it so if you notice the spring here also
came<00:05:45.600> off<00:05:46.160> which<00:05:47.160> if<00:05:47.970> it<00:05:48.180> does<00:05:48.740> just<00:05:49.740> simply

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
came off which if it does just simply

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.780 
came off which if it does just simply
slides<00:05:51.150> back<00:05:51.540> in<00:05:51.780> at<00:05:52.050> an<00:05:52.290> angle<00:05:52.410> like<00:05:52.800> this<00:05:52.830> and

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.210 

you<00:05:56.790> just<00:05:56.970> push<00:05:57.210> it<00:05:57.360> in<00:05:57.479> like<00:05:57.510> that<00:05:58.220> real

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
you just push it in like that real

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.540 
you just push it in like that real
simple<00:05:59.610> to<00:05:59.700> do<00:06:00.180> that<00:06:00.620> okay<00:06:01.620> so<00:06:01.919> we<00:06:02.130> are<00:06:02.370> going

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
simple to do that okay so we are going

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.600 
simple to do that okay so we are going
to<00:06:02.760> worry<00:06:02.970> about<00:06:03.120> these<00:06:03.450> white<00:06:04.140> three<00:06:05.130> pieces

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
to worry about these white three pieces

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.690 
to worry about these white three pieces
in<00:06:05.820> just<00:06:06.200> a<00:06:07.200> little<00:06:07.229> bit<00:06:07.590> so<00:06:08.250> let's<00:06:08.430> go<00:06:08.580> ahead

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
in just a little bit so let's go ahead

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.730 
in just a little bit so let's go ahead
and<00:06:08.820> pick<00:06:09.360> this<00:06:09.510> up<00:06:09.570> there's<00:06:10.350> three<00:06:10.590> white

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
and pick this up there's three white

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.550 
and pick this up there's three white
pieces<00:06:11.100> are<00:06:11.220> going<00:06:11.310> to<00:06:11.370> fall<00:06:11.580> out<00:06:12.020> and<00:06:13.020> if<00:06:13.410> you

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
pieces are going to fall out and if you

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.670 
pieces are going to fall out and if you
notice

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
notice

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.600 
notice
just<00:06:16.680> be<00:06:16.800> careful<00:06:16.950> touching<00:06:17.460> the<00:06:17.520> motor<00:06:17.729> stuff

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
just be careful touching the motor stuff

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.320 
just be careful touching the motor stuff
so<00:06:20.610> if<00:06:20.729> you<00:06:20.910> notice<00:06:22.310> these<00:06:23.310> slots

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
so if you notice these slots

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:29.270 
so if you notice these slots
down<00:06:24.570> in<00:06:24.750> here<00:06:25.700> are<00:06:26.700> where<00:06:27.800> we<00:06:28.800> had<00:06:28.919> a<00:06:28.950> lot<00:06:29.250> of

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
down in here are where we had a lot of

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.540 
down in here are where we had a lot of
liquid<00:06:29.790> collected<00:06:30.270> and<00:06:30.479> so<00:06:31.470> I<00:06:31.860> actually<00:06:32.310> ended

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
liquid collected and so I actually ended

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.650 
liquid collected and so I actually ended
up<00:06:32.880> taking<00:06:33.229> these<00:06:34.700> plastic<00:06:35.700> spring<00:06:36.090> pieces

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
up taking these plastic spring pieces

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:43.000 
up taking these plastic spring pieces
off<00:06:37.050> and<00:06:37.940> cleaning<00:06:38.940> this<00:06:39.710> down<00:06:40.710> in<00:06:40.860> these

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
off and cleaning this down in these

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.800 
off and cleaning this down in these
channels<00:06:44.010> here<00:06:44.310> I<00:06:44.490> did<00:06:45.060> that<00:06:45.210> with<00:06:45.360> all<00:06:45.540> three

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810 
channels here I did that with all three

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.300 
channels here I did that with all three
of<00:06:45.930> them<00:06:46.160> and<00:06:47.160> then<00:06:47.340> I<00:06:47.370> just<00:06:47.640> simply<00:06:48.000> put<00:06:48.620> this

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.310 
of them and then I just simply put this

00:06:50.310 --> 00:07:03.469 
of them and then I just simply put this
back<00:06:51.310> in<00:06:51.520> like<00:06:51.730> this

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:08.709

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:17.449 
inside down in here it's time to put it

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:20.169 
inside down in here it's time to put it
back<00:07:17.479> together<00:07:17.749> and<00:07:18.729> you<00:07:19.729> might<00:07:19.879> want<00:07:20.029> to<00:07:20.059> wait

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:20.179 
back together and you might want to wait

00:07:20.179 --> 00:07:22.769 
back together and you might want to wait
a<00:07:20.209> few<00:07:20.389> minutes<00:07:20.689> if<00:07:20.839> it's<00:07:21.139> still<00:07:21.739> wet<00:07:21.919> just<00:07:22.489> off
