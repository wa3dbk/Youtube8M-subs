00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.020 

even<00:01:56.170> go<00:01:57.180> go<00:01:58.180> fast<00:01:58.479> fast<00:01:58.689> fast<00:01:58.840> drop<00:02:00.030> 20

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
even go go fast fast fast drop 20

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:10.830 
even go go fast fast fast drop 20
seconds<00:02:07.380> um<00:02:08.819> you've<00:02:09.819> just<00:02:10.000> come<00:02:10.179> back<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:10.720> got

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
seconds um you've just come back and got

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.770 
seconds um you've just come back and got
a<00:02:10.869> third<00:02:11.140> in<00:02:11.350> x-fighters<00:02:12.190> like<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
a third in x-fighters like the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.320 
a third in x-fighters like the
importance<00:02:14.350> of<00:02:14.590> your<00:02:15.280> strength<00:02:15.580> training<00:02:15.850> and

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
importance of your strength training and

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.760 
importance of your strength training and
how<00:02:16.540> much<00:02:16.720> input<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.170> how<00:02:17.260> much<00:02:17.410> emphasis<00:02:17.709> you

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
how much input and how much emphasis you

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.910 
how much input and how much emphasis you
put<00:02:18.130> on<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:19.660> suppose<00:02:20.200> looking<00:02:20.680> at<00:02:20.800> your

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
put on it and I suppose looking at your

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.220 
put on it and I suppose looking at your
progressions<00:02:21.519> you'd<00:02:22.209> have<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.630> be<00:02:22.780> happy<00:02:22.989> with

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
progressions you'd have to be happy with

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.430 
progressions you'd have to be happy with
that

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
that

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.870 
that
yeah<00:02:28.200> because<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.380> could<00:02:29.560> be<00:02:29.680> riding<00:02:30.100> but<00:02:30.340> the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
yeah because I could be riding but the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.300 
yeah because I could be riding but the
amount<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.239> time<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.900> takes<00:02:32.110> for<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.069> for<00:02:33.280> a

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
amount of time it takes for that for a

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.789 
amount of time it takes for that for a
nerve<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:33.700> be<00:02:33.819> offered<00:02:34.360> a<00:02:34.600> muscle<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.530> get<00:02:35.650> its

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
nerve to be offered a muscle to get its

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.170 
nerve to be offered a muscle to get its
natural<00:02:36.130> state<00:02:36.220> like<00:02:36.580> just<00:02:36.819> from<00:02:36.940> everyday

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
natural state like just from everyday

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.440 
natural state like just from everyday
work<00:02:37.540> would<00:02:37.780> be<00:02:37.930> take<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.739> whole<00:02:38.920> year<00:02:38.950> but

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
work would be take a whole year but

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.770 
work would be take a whole year but
that's<00:02:40.650> so<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:41.980> important<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:43.450> do<00:02:43.600> all<00:02:43.630> that

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
that's so so important to do all that

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.050 
that's so so important to do all that
off<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.049> bike<00:02:44.200> training<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.830> not<00:02:45.610> only<00:02:45.760> work

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
off the bike training to not only work

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.610 
off the bike training to not only work
the<00:02:46.269> muscle<00:02:46.600> just<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.840> get<00:02:47.019> you<00:02:47.319> know<00:02:47.440> the

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
the muscle just to get you know the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.009 
the muscle just to get you know the
nerve<00:02:47.799> working<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.519> firing<00:02:49.299> and<00:02:49.569> you<00:02:49.630> know<00:02:49.840> if

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
nerve working and firing and you know if

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.090 
nerve working and firing and you know if
you<00:02:50.170> need<00:02:50.290> that<00:02:50.380> other<00:02:50.590> nerves<00:02:50.860> maybe

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
you need that other nerves maybe

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.970 
you need that other nerves maybe
compensate<00:02:51.700> need<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.810> work<00:02:53.260> so<00:02:53.500> hard<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.830> get

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
compensate need to work so hard to get

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.900 
compensate need to work so hard to get
all<00:02:54.069> that<00:02:54.190> activator<00:02:54.700> them<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.780> just<00:02:56.730> so<00:02:57.730> much

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
all that activator them and just so much

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.340 
all that activator them and just so much
harder<00:02:58.209> to<00:02:58.239> get<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.600> sphincter<00:02:58.989> Eastham

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
harder to get the sphincter Eastham

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.309 
harder to get the sphincter Eastham
ideas<00:03:00.310> so<00:03:01.060> much<00:03:01.269> work

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
ideas so much work

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.580 
ideas so much work
and<00:03:03.000> you've<00:03:04.000> come<00:03:04.180> on<00:03:04.329> board<00:03:04.569> with<00:03:04.780> every

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
and you've come on board with every

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909 
running and then well after riding my

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.119 
running and then well after riding my
bike<00:03:37.120> that<00:03:37.299> I've<00:03:37.420> struggled<00:03:37.629> to<00:03:38.019> run<00:03:38.560> say<00:03:38.920> we

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
bike that I've struggled to run say we

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.809 
bike that I've struggled to run say we
saw<00:03:39.430> glutes<00:03:40.239> or<00:03:40.419> lower<00:03:40.629> back<00:03:40.930> but<00:03:41.680> then<00:03:41.889> he

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
saw glutes or lower back but then he

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.170 
saw glutes or lower back but then he
realized<00:03:43.239> that<00:03:43.470> bikes<00:03:44.470> not<00:03:45.400> you<00:03:45.909> know<00:03:46.030> it's

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
realized that bikes not you know it's

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.259 
realized that bikes not you know it's
not<00:03:47.079> so<00:03:47.290> much<00:03:47.439> just<00:03:47.709> speed<00:03:48.099> and<00:03:48.310> then<00:03:48.879> fitness

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
not so much just speed and then fitness

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.449 
not so much just speed and then fitness
it's<00:03:49.450> more<00:03:49.659> stamina<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:50.470> it's<00:03:51.129> going<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:51.340> be

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
it's more stamina and it's going to be

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.009 
it's more stamina and it's going to be
just<00:03:51.669> like<00:03:51.909> there's<00:03:52.209> a<00:03:52.269> lot<00:03:52.450> more<00:03:52.599> strength

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
just like there's a lot more strength

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.210 
just like there's a lot more strength
involved<00:03:53.530> but<00:03:53.650> you<00:03:53.709> need<00:03:53.859> to<00:03:53.919> be<00:03:54.040> able<00:03:54.129> to

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
involved but you need to be able to

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:02.449 
involved but you need to be able to
maintain<00:03:54.700> that<00:03:54.939> strength<00:03:55.299> so<00:03:55.569> it's<00:03:55.720> just

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.149

to be able to recapture that and try to

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:03.140 
to be able to recapture that and try to
prevent<00:04:58.750> a<00:04:58.840> crash<00:04:59.050> yeah<00:05:01.080> inspire<00:05:02.080> defenses<00:05:02.650> so

prevent a crash yeah inspire defenses so
it's<00:05:04.150> quick<00:05:04.449> like<00:05:04.900> you<00:05:04.990> don't<00:05:05.169> need<00:05:05.320> if<00:05:05.440> you

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
it's quick like you don't need if you
