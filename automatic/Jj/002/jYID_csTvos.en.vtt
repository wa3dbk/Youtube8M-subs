[Background chatter]

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.380
[♫ Chuck Berry - "You Never Can Tell" ♫]

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.120
♫ It was a teenage wedding, and the old folks wished them well ♫

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.820
♫ You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle ♫

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.960
♫ And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell ♫

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.180
♫ "C'est la vie", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell ♫

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.280
♫ They furnished off an apartment with a two room Roebuck sale ♫

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.340
♫ The coolerator was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale ♫

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.320
♫ But when Pierre found work, the little money comin' worked out well ♫

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.540
♫ "C'est la vie", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell ♫

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.620
♫ They had a hi-fi phono, boy, did they let it blast ♫

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.660
♫ Seven hundred little records, all rock, rhythm and jazz ♫

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.820
♫ But when the sun went down, the rapid tempo of the music fell ♫

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.020
♫ "C'est la vie", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell ♫

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.440
♫ They had a teenage wedding, and the old folks wished them well ♫

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.240
[Fade-out]
♫ You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle... ♫
