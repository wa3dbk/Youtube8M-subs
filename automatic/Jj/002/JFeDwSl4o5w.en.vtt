more<00:00:24.560> with<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.619> hunter's<00:00:25.949> knife<00:00:26.160> it's<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
more with a hunter's knife it's the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:39.639 
more with a hunter's knife it's the
hunter's<00:00:27.480> knife<00:00:27.630> plus<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.199> believe<00:00:28.260> actually

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.200 

so<00:00:40.649> if<00:00:40.739> you've<00:00:40.860> been<00:00:41.070> watching<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.460> entire<00:00:41.760> LP

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
so if you've been watching the entire LP

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.020 
so if you've been watching the entire LP
you'll<00:00:42.390> see<00:00:42.540> I've<00:00:42.660> used<00:00:43.610> sword<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.730> shield<00:00:44.879> on

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
you'll see I've used sword and shield on

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.900 
you'll see I've used sword and shield on
a<00:00:45.090> couple<00:00:45.360> gathering<00:00:45.750> quests<00:00:46.730> and<00:00:47.730> there's

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
a couple gathering quests and there's

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.369 
a couple gathering quests and there's
one<00:00:48.059> attack<00:00:48.329> I'm<00:00:48.510> still<00:00:48.719> trying<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.020> get<00:00:49.170> used

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
one attack I'm still trying to get used

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.240 
one attack I'm still trying to get used
to<00:00:51.079> it's<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.199> attack<00:00:52.440> where<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.739> kind<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.039> -

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
to it's the attack where you kind of -

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.529 
to it's the attack where you kind of -
backwards<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:54.800> guess<00:00:55.800> it's<00:00:56.300> kind<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.360> like<00:00:57.510> a

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
backwards I guess it's kind of like a

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.540 
backwards I guess it's kind of like a
combo<00:00:58.070> or<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> counter<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:01.550> if

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
combo or a counter that is and that if

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.799 
combo or a counter that is and that if
you<00:01:02.699> can't<00:01:02.969> get<00:01:03.120> out<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> way<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.719> an

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
you can't get out of the way of an

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.800 
you can't get out of the way of an
attack<00:01:04.110> by<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.589> left<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.920> right<00:01:05.630> it's<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.689> way

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
attack by going left to right it's a way

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.590 
attack by going left to right it's a way
to<00:01:06.840> kind<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.170> dodge<00:01:07.380> backwards<00:01:08.150> it<00:01:09.150> also<00:01:09.299> makes

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
to kind of dodge backwards it also makes

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.690 
to kind of dodge backwards it also makes
it<00:01:09.689> easy<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.200> back<00:01:10.290> into<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.680> fight<00:01:11.400> again

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
it easy to get back into the fight again

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.600 
it easy to get back into the fight again
by<00:01:11.909> by<00:01:12.240> just<00:01:12.450> pressing<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:13.189> attack<00:01:14.189> button

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
by by just pressing the attack button

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.740 
by by just pressing the attack button
again<00:01:14.790> because<00:01:14.939> we'll<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.210> -<00:01:15.360> right<00:01:15.600> up

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
again because we'll just - right up

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.980 
again because we'll just - right up
immediately<00:01:17.360> have<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.450> really<00:01:18.570> practiced

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
immediately have it really practiced

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.120 
immediately have it really practiced
with<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.229> yet<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.500> we'll<00:01:19.619> see<00:01:19.770> how<00:01:19.890> effective

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
with it yet so we'll see how effective

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:31.090 
with it yet so we'll see how effective
it<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:23.840> I'll<00:01:24.840> see<00:01:24.990> if<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.229> get<00:01:25.320> used<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.619> it

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.950 

okay<00:01:31.850> so<00:01:31.909> our<00:01:32.150> assumption<00:01:32.600> is<00:01:32.720> that<00:01:32.750> he's

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
okay so our assumption is that he's

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:43.280 
okay so our assumption is that he's
going<00:01:33.110> to<00:01:33.200> be<00:01:33.290> here<00:01:35.229> okay

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.310 

so<00:01:44.290> my<00:01:44.740> plan<00:01:44.950> on<00:01:45.100> this<00:01:45.220> is<00:01:45.400> I<00:01:45.490> would<00:01:45.790> normally

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
so my plan on this is I would normally

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.320 
so my plan on this is I would normally
never<00:01:47.320> really<00:01:47.890> recommend<00:01:48.369> just<00:01:49.000> shield

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
never really recommend just shield

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.390 
never really recommend just shield
bashing<00:01:49.780> monsters<00:01:50.200> for<00:01:50.380> fun<00:01:50.560> of<00:01:50.680> it<00:01:50.800> but<00:01:51.790> I

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
bashing monsters for fun of it but I

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.800 
bashing monsters for fun of it but I
really<00:01:54.400> want<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:54.670> break<00:01:54.790> his<00:01:54.940> face<00:01:55.150> I<00:01:57.720> mean<00:01:58.720> it

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
really want to break his face I mean it

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.730 
really want to break his face I mean it
could<00:01:58.930> be<00:01:58.960> a<00:02:00.420> easier<00:02:01.420> way<00:02:01.600> for<00:02:01.630> me<00:02:01.899> to<00:02:01.930> build<00:02:02.560> up

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
could be a easier way for me to build up

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.270 
could be a easier way for me to build up
damage<00:02:03.100> on<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.340> face<00:02:03.580> and<00:02:03.909> also<00:02:05.460> get<00:02:06.460> a<00:02:06.490> little

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
damage on the face and also get a little

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.590 
damage on the face and also get a little
moment<00:02:09.280> of<00:02:09.459> opportunity<00:02:09.550> as<00:02:10.000> well<00:02:10.119> actually

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
moment of opportunity as well actually

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.750 
moment of opportunity as well actually
we'll<00:02:10.810> probably<00:02:10.959> even<00:02:11.370> exhaust<00:02:12.370> him<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.640> lot

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
we'll probably even exhaust him a lot

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:26.320 
we'll probably even exhaust him a lot
faster<00:02:13.209> as<00:02:13.330> well

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.940 

and<00:02:26.840> I<00:02:26.900> really<00:02:27.110> don't<00:02:27.230> think<00:02:27.320> his<00:02:27.500> first<00:02:27.650> kale

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
and I really don't think his first kale

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:36.040 
and I really don't think his first kale
is<00:02:28.160> all<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.460> hard<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.940> get<00:02:29.090> anyways<00:02:34.960> look<00:02:35.960> a

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
is all that hard to get anyways look a

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:46.160 
is all that hard to get anyways look a
cha-cha<00:02:36.320> just<00:02:36.770> going<00:02:37.190> in<00:02:37.310> for<00:02:37.490> that<00:02:37.610> kill

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:57.770 

okay<00:02:47.069> so<00:02:47.130> now<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.340> we<00:02:47.520> have<00:02:47.730> it

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.140 

well<00:02:58.780> that's<00:02:59.020> the<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.590> purpose<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.910> make<00:03:01.060> it

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
well that's the the purpose to make it

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:27.150 
well that's the the purpose to make it
easier<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.510> extend<00:03:01.900> combos<00:03:02.350> as<00:03:02.500> well

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.530 

all<00:03:28.160> right<00:03:28.340> sad<00:03:28.670> thing<00:03:28.910> about<00:03:28.970> this<00:03:29.240> armored

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
all right sad thing about this armored

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.130 
all right sad thing about this armored
suck<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:31.010> has<00:03:31.160> very<00:03:31.850> bad<00:03:32.120> defense<00:03:32.660> it's

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
suck it has very bad defense it's

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.290 
suck it has very bad defense it's
actually<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.590> equivalent<00:03:34.040> of<00:03:34.070> leather<00:03:35.000> armor

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
actually the equivalent of leather armor

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.880 
actually the equivalent of leather armor
so<00:03:38.300> you<00:03:38.360> really<00:03:38.720> don't<00:03:38.930> get<00:03:39.110> any<00:03:41.590> break<00:03:42.590> at<00:03:42.740> all

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
so you really don't get any break at all

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:54.720 
so you really don't get any break at all
for<00:03:43.190> using<00:03:43.520> it

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:12.160 

I<00:03:55.379> need<00:03:56.379> it<00:03:58.530> well<00:03:59.530> that's<00:03:59.680> great

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.210 

it's<00:04:12.560> look<00:04:12.770> thrilled<00:04:13.100> that<00:04:13.370> well<00:04:13.580> not<00:04:13.790> great

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220

really shows you shows you how powerful
having<00:04:20.590> green<00:04:21.590> sharpness<00:04:22.220> because<00:04:23.120> that's

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
having green sharpness because that's

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.990 
having green sharpness because that's
why<00:04:24.740> mean<00:04:24.950> I<00:04:25.040> guess<00:04:25.190> the<00:04:25.430> Lance<00:04:26.240> did<00:04:26.510> get<00:04:28.000> quite

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
why mean I guess the Lance did get quite

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.400 
why mean I guess the Lance did get quite
a<00:04:29.120> damage<00:04:29.600> boost<00:04:29.750> by<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.020> fact<00:04:30.260> that<00:04:30.380> I

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
a damage boost by the fact that I

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.520 
a damage boost by the fact that I
upgraded<00:04:30.800> it<00:04:30.980> so<00:04:31.190> much<00:04:31.430> but<00:04:31.670> really<00:04:32.530> it's

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
upgraded it so much but really it's

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.800 
upgraded it so much but really it's
still<00:04:33.620> a<00:04:33.770> very<00:04:34.460> low<00:04:34.730> ranked<00:04:34.970> weapon<00:04:35.360> but<00:04:35.600> the

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
still a very low ranked weapon but the

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.310 
still a very low ranked weapon but the
the<00:04:36.110> difference<00:04:36.380> was<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.620> sharpness<00:04:38.320> the

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
the difference was the sharpness the

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.750 
the difference was the sharpness the
frills<00:04:39.590> still<00:04:39.800> isn't<00:04:39.920> breaking<00:04:42.640> you<00:04:43.640> know

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
frills still isn't breaking you know

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
we'll just have to really really focus

we'll just have to really really focus
it<00:04:45.320> down

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:56.689 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:58.640 

no<00:04:57.689> I<00:04:57.720> thought<00:04:57.960> that<00:04:58.020> would<00:04:58.199> have<00:04:58.229> been<00:04:58.379> a<00:04:58.409> ride

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
time we have to really do the mini game

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:11.860 
time we have to really do the mini game
we<00:05:06.599> can't<00:05:06.780> just<00:05:07.189> mash<00:05:08.189> the<00:05:08.370> button<00:05:08.610> forever

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:20.090 

have<00:05:12.870> to<00:05:12.990> pay<00:05:13.110> attention<00:05:13.469> to<00:05:13.530> what<00:05:13.650> he's<00:05:13.770> doing

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.560 

you<00:05:21.100> break<00:05:21.310> it

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:47.240 

looks<00:05:25.140> like<00:05:25.290> it<00:05:25.380> might<00:05:25.500> have<00:05:25.530> been<00:05:25.620> broken<00:05:25.860> yes

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.970 

what<00:05:47.790> are<00:05:47.880> you<00:05:47.940> going<00:05:48.210> Jaggi<00:05:48.770> well<00:05:49.770> you<00:05:49.860> know<00:05:49.950> I

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
what are you going Jaggi well you know I

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:58.400 
what are you going Jaggi well you know I
think<00:05:50.160> he<00:05:50.370> goes<00:05:50.520> to<00:05:50.700> area<00:05:52.100> 9<00:05:57.170> think<00:05:58.170> he<00:05:58.230> needs

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
think he goes to area 9 think he needs

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.780 
think he goes to area 9 think he needs
to<00:05:58.590> sleep<00:05:58.830> there<00:05:59.100> I<00:05:59.130> think<00:05:59.280> that's<00:05:59.490> where<00:05:59.700> the

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
to sleep there I think that's where the

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:19.290 
to sleep there I think that's where the
nest<00:06:00.000> is<00:06:04.280> nah<00:06:05.280> but<00:06:05.430> not<00:06:05.550> this<00:06:05.730> way<00:06:07.460> this<00:06:08.460> way

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.250 

see<00:06:20.300> if<00:06:20.360> they<00:06:20.480> make<00:06:20.630> it<00:06:20.750> easy<00:06:20.900> to<00:06:21.050> do<00:06:21.230> a

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
see if they make it easy to do a

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:36.090 
see if they make it easy to do a
drop-down<00:06:21.800> attack

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:48.480 

that<00:06:36.850> was<00:06:37.030> pretty<00:06:37.750> fun<00:06:47.040> there's<00:06:48.040> a<00:06:48.100> really<00:06:48.310> fun

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
that was pretty fun there's a really fun

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.190 
that was pretty fun there's a really fun
part<00:06:48.730> about<00:06:48.790> climbing<00:06:49.360> that<00:06:49.510> I<00:06:49.750> just

part about climbing that I just

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.910 
part about climbing that I just
discovered<00:06:50.710> by<00:06:50.860> watching<00:06:51.070> a<00:06:52.920> Japanese

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:53.920 
discovered by watching a Japanese

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.610 
discovered by watching a Japanese
trailer<00:06:54.400> of<00:06:54.520> the<00:06:54.640> game<00:06:55.200> let<00:06:56.200> me<00:06:56.260> see<00:06:56.380> if<00:06:56.440> I<00:06:56.500> can

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620 
trailer of the game let me see if I can

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:08.620 
trailer of the game let me see if I can
show<00:06:56.770> it<00:06:56.890> off

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:08.630 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:14.920 

it's<00:07:09.630> like<00:07:09.750> you<00:07:09.870> go<00:07:09.990> flying<00:07:10.350> I<00:07:10.770> love<00:07:11.190> it

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:14.930 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:21.390 

I'm<00:07:15.930> Superman

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.450 

okay<00:07:22.400> so<00:07:23.500> the<00:07:24.500> sword<00:07:24.800> and<00:07:24.920> shield<00:07:25.040> may<00:07:25.220> seem

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:25.460 
okay so the sword and shield may seem

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.430 
okay so the sword and shield may seem
weak<00:07:25.700> and<00:07:26.000> this<00:07:26.720> will<00:07:26.870> definitely<00:07:26.990> be<00:07:27.350> the

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 
weak and this will definitely be the

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.110 
weak and this will definitely be the
longest<00:07:27.770> time<00:07:28.040> but<00:07:28.070> once<00:07:28.760> it<00:07:28.850> gets<00:07:29.000> some

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 
longest time but once it gets some

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.550 
longest time but once it gets some
upgrades<00:07:29.540> I'm<00:07:29.720> sure<00:07:29.900> it'll<00:07:30.050> be<00:07:30.110> really

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 
upgrades I'm sure it'll be really

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.520 
upgrades I'm sure it'll be really
standing<00:07:31.040> its<00:07:31.160> own<00:07:31.750> you<00:07:32.750> know<00:07:32.870> I<00:07:33.110> couldn't

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:33.530 
standing its own you know I couldn't

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:34.990 
standing its own you know I couldn't
even<00:07:33.620> really<00:07:33.860> even<00:07:34.160> use<00:07:34.190> the<00:07:34.430> bone<00:07:34.580> version

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.000 
even really even use the bone version

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.070 
even really even use the bone version
because<00:07:35.270> I<00:07:35.360> would<00:07:35.480> have<00:07:35.570> just<00:07:35.690> worn<00:07:35.900> through

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 
because I would have just worn through

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.560 
because I would have just worn through
the<00:07:36.170> shortness<00:07:36.530> too<00:07:36.680> quickly<00:07:37.030> but<00:07:38.030> certainly

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:38.570 
the shortness too quickly but certainly

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.120 
the shortness too quickly but certainly
once<00:07:38.780> we<00:07:38.900> get<00:07:38.990> the<00:07:39.110> Jaggi<00:07:39.350> upgraded<00:07:39.950> I'll<00:07:40.040> be

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.130 
once we get the Jaggi upgraded I'll be

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:53.230 
once we get the Jaggi upgraded I'll be
doing<00:07:40.370> fine

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:53.240 

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.330
