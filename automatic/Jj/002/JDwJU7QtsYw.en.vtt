this thing just as well try to get I
tried<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.880> tie<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.060> copper<00:01:09.479> wiring<00:01:09.690> on<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049

far side so it works a lot better to get

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.640 
far side so it works a lot better to get
it<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.479> far<00:01:12.690> side<00:01:12.720> if<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.440> kind

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
of why you put that on the far side this

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.790 
of why you put that on the far side this
counter<00:02:22.520> if<00:02:22.670> I'm<00:02:22.760> going<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:22.970> do<00:02:23.060> with<00:02:23.210> about

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
counter if I'm going to do with about

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.490 
counter if I'm going to do with about
anywhere<00:02:24.800> three<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.340> four<00:02:26.170> maybe<00:02:27.170> even<00:02:27.410> a

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
anywhere three to four maybe even a

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.470 
anywhere three to four maybe even a
fifth<00:02:27.740> wrap<00:02:28.010> get<00:02:28.550> that<00:02:28.700> up<00:02:28.820> to<00:02:29.000> about<00:02:29.120> where

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
fifth wrap get that up to about where

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:37.080 
fifth wrap get that up to about where
the<00:02:29.630> beat<00:02:29.810> is<00:02:29.840> tie<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.560> off<00:02:33.940> all<00:02:34.940> right

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.070 

this<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.180> almost<00:02:38.360> not<00:02:38.570> fair<00:02:38.600> that<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:38.990> can

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
this is almost not fair that you can

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.650 
this is almost not fair that you can
catch<00:02:39.260> as<00:02:39.410> many<00:02:39.560> fish<00:02:39.620> on<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.070> fly<00:02:40.660> compared

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
catch as many fish on this fly compared

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.510 
catch as many fish on this fly compared
to<00:02:41.780> how<00:02:41.870> much<00:02:41.990> time<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.350> spend<00:02:42.590> tying<00:02:42.860> it<00:02:43.040> all

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
to how much time you spend tying it all

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.560 
to how much time you spend tying it all
right<00:02:43.610> so<00:02:43.730> now<00:02:43.790> I'm<00:02:43.880> gonna<00:02:44.000> take<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.240> little<00:02:44.450> bit
