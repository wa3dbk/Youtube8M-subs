00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
the same screen so it's splitting the

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.640 
the same screen so it's splitting the
screen<00:03:31.750> at<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:31.930> totally<00:03:32.290> different<00:03:32.560> way

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
screen at a totally different way

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.250

different<00:03:32.860> which<00:03:33.580> is<00:03:33.760> kind<00:03:34.000> of<00:03:34.090> incredible

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
different which is kind of incredible

different which is kind of incredible
we'll<00:03:35.260> see<00:03:35.440> how<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:35.650> works<00:03:35.800> later<00:03:36.490> in<00:03:36.760> the

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
we'll see how that works later in the

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
we'll see how that works later in the
year<00:03:37.120> but<00:03:37.300> it<00:03:37.420> seems<00:03:37.570> like<00:03:37.630> what<00:03:37.840> they're

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
year but it seems like what they're

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.240 
year but it seems like what they're
really<00:03:38.080> trying<00:03:38.290> to<00:03:38.410> do<00:03:38.560> is<00:03:38.770> they're<00:03:39.010> trying<00:03:39.040> to

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
really trying to do is they're trying to

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.340

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
well as a 3d TV stuff but the 3d TV

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.700 
well as a 3d TV stuff but the 3d TV
stuff<00:03:43.720> is<00:03:43.810> generally<00:03:44.050> pretty<00:03:44.140> expensive<00:03:44.470> and

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 
stuff is generally pretty expensive and

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.260 
stuff is generally pretty expensive and
it<00:03:44.770> looks<00:03:44.920> like<00:03:45.040> with<00:03:45.160> this<00:03:45.280> this<00:03:45.820> TV<00:03:46.120> they're

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.370 
it looks like with this this TV they're
trying<00:03:46.450> to<00:03:46.510> actually<00:03:46.660> bring<00:03:46.900> it<00:03:47.050> down<00:03:47.170> to<00:03:47.350> a

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
trying to actually bring it down to a

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.080 
trying to actually bring it down to a
different<00:03:47.680> level<00:03:47.770> so<00:03:48.070> that<00:03:48.100> you<00:03:48.670> know<00:03:48.760> college

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
different level so that you know college

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.790 
different level so that you know college
students<00:03:49.420> could<00:03:49.600> theoretically<00:03:49.990> afford<00:03:50.680> it

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
students could theoretically afford it

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
though in other bad news it looks like

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.839 
though in other bad news it looks like

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
started it all yeah the 3ds is not not

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.839 
started it all yeah the 3ds is not not
doing<00:05:41.409> no<00:05:41.770> much<00:05:41.919> for<00:05:42.129> multiplayer<00:05:42.520> but<00:05:42.699> just

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:42.849 
doing no much for multiplayer but just

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:44.459 
doing no much for multiplayer but just
looks<00:05:43.000> like<00:05:43.120> it<00:05:43.240> could<00:05:43.389> be<00:05:43.419> really<00:05:43.900> the<00:05:44.169> first

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:44.469 
looks like it could be really the first

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:45.809 
looks like it could be really the first
the<00:05:44.740> first<00:05:44.860> handheld<00:05:45.190> that's<00:05:45.460> really<00:05:45.699> pushing

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:45.819

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
towards serious multiplayer and I think

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.100
