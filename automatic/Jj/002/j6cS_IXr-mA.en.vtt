far<00:00:29.669> only<00:00:30.740> major<00:00:31.740> tour<00:00:32.099> time

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.560 

Rob<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.360> think<00:00:39.570> Danny<00:00:39.780> Wiseman's<00:00:40.320> game<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.620> very

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
Rob I think Danny Wiseman's game is very

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.420 
Rob I think Danny Wiseman's game is very
suited<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.380> type<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.739> oil<00:00:44.010> pattern<00:00:44.340> that

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
suited to the type of oil pattern that

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.860 
suited to the type of oil pattern that
the<00:00:44.550> user<00:00:44.760> if<00:00:44.970> the<00:00:45.059> master<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.720> the<00:00:45.780> reason

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the user if the master is and the reason

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.410 
the user if the master is and the reason
I<00:00:46.079> say<00:00:46.290> that<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.640> because<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.970> back<00:00:48.150> part<00:00:48.360> of

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
I say that is because the back part of

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.610 
I say that is because the back part of
the<00:00:48.480> lane<00:00:48.600> plays<00:00:48.809> very<00:00:49.050> slick<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.410> we'll<00:00:49.500> get

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the lane plays very slick and we'll get

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.200 
the lane plays very slick and we'll get
it<00:00:49.710> into<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.250> bit<00:00:50.340> more<00:00:50.760> when<00:00:50.910> we<00:00:51.030> talk

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
it into that a bit more when we talk

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.700 
it into that a bit more when we talk
about<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.510> oil<00:00:51.540> pattern<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:52.530> Danny

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
about the oil pattern but Danny

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.070 
about the oil pattern but Danny
Wiseman's<00:00:53.250> kind<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.580> medium<00:00:53.879> speed<00:00:54.090> medium

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
Wiseman's kind of a medium speed medium

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.840 
Wiseman's kind of a medium speed medium
rev<00:00:55.320> die<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.830> I<00:00:55.890> think<00:00:56.160> that's<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.489> great

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
rev die and I think that's a great

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:11.240 
rev die and I think that's a great
matchup<00:00:57.150> for<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:57.989> oil

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.640 

that's<00:01:11.970> good<00:01:12.240> break<00:01:12.570> yeah<00:01:13.050> that's<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.440> huge

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
that's good break yeah that's a huge

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.020 
that's good break yeah that's a huge
break<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.070> it's<00:01:14.160> the<00:01:14.340> last<00:01:14.580> thing<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.850> want

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
break and it's the last thing you want

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.820 
break and it's the last thing you want
to<00:01:15.120> see<00:01:15.240> when<00:01:15.360> you're<00:01:15.450> Danny<00:01:15.630> Wiseman<00:01:16.260> you've

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
to see when you're Danny Wiseman you've

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.680 
to see when you're Danny Wiseman you've
