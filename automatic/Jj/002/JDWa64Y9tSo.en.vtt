top<00:02:05.510> right<00:02:05.780> where<00:02:06.560> is<00:02:06.710> she<00:02:08.349> there<00:02:09.349> she<00:02:09.379> is<00:02:09.590> she

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
top right where is she there she is she

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.580 
top right where is she there she is she
comes<00:02:10.459> in<00:02:10.640> starts<00:02:11.450> shooting<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.810> cannon<00:02:12.080> then

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
comes in starts shooting the cannon then

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.229 
comes in starts shooting the cannon then
I'll<00:02:12.769> make<00:02:12.920> her<00:02:13.099> in<00:02:13.190> visible<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:13.760> she<00:02:13.819> can<00:02:14.090> get

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
I'll make her in visible so she can get

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.490 
I'll make her in visible so she can get
both<00:02:14.930> gold<00:02:15.260> mines<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.930> get<00:02:17.930> as<00:02:18.050> much<00:02:18.170> loot<00:02:18.410> as

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
both gold mines and get as much loot as

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.199 
both gold mines and get as much loot as
possible<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:19.189> there's<00:02:19.370> about<00:02:19.489> 40<00:02:19.849> k<00:02:20.030> in<00:02:20.090> each

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
possible so there's about 40 k in each

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.209 
possible so there's about 40 k in each
other's<00:02:20.420> gold<00:02:20.629> mines<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.499> it's<00:02:21.709> a<00:02:21.799> good<00:02:21.950> bonus

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:22.219

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
there's a 4600 are clicksor so the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.319 
there's a 4600 are clicksor so the
balloons<00:02:39.280> are<00:02:39.370> just<00:02:39.519> going<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.730> be<00:02:39.790> coming<00:02:40.239> in

balloons are just going to be coming in

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.710 
balloons are just going to be coming in
here<00:02:41.099> easily<00:02:42.099> destroying<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.090> archer<00:02:43.329> towers

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
here easily destroying the archer towers

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.559 
here easily destroying the archer towers
and<00:02:43.870> cannons<00:02:44.409> around<00:02:44.799> the<00:02:44.859> outside<00:02:45.370> this<00:02:46.150> the

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
and cannons around the outside this the

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.270 
and cannons around the outside this the
space<00:02:46.810> is<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:47.019> bit<00:02:47.260> harder<00:02:47.620> because<00:02:47.739> the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
space is a bit harder because the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.420 
space is a bit harder because the
storages<00:02:48.700> are<00:02:48.909> a<00:02:48.939> bit<00:02:49.150> more<00:02:49.359> protected<00:02:49.959> and

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
storages are a bit more protected and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.449 
storages are a bit more protected and
it's<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.549> hog<00:02:51.730> base<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:52.269> I<00:02:52.299> got<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.599> take<00:02:52.780> out<00:02:52.959> the

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
it's a hog base so I got to take out the

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.009 
it's a hog base so I got to take out the
sum<00:02:54.459> of<00:02:54.579> the<00:02:54.640> corner<00:02:54.970> defenses<00:02:55.540> then<00:02:55.720> I'll<00:02:55.840> put

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
sum of the corner defenses then I'll put

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.300 
sum of the corner defenses then I'll put
all<00:02:56.140> my<00:02:56.170> balloons<00:02:56.590> in<00:02:56.769> and<00:02:57.010> they'll<00:02:57.159> head

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
all my balloons in and they'll head

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.339 
all my balloons in and they'll head
towards<00:02:57.579> the<00:02:57.670> center<00:02:58.000> so<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.989> balloons<00:02:59.230> are

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
towards the center so the balloons are

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.970 
towards the center so the balloons are
taking<00:02:59.680> out<00:02:59.769> the<00:02:59.889> corner<00:03:00.220> defenses<00:03:01.180> here<00:03:01.510> and

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
use his ability unfortunately all the

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.509 
use his ability unfortunately all the
barbs<00:04:12.639> got<00:04:12.819> destroyed<00:04:13.329> but<00:04:13.840> that's<00:04:14.620> okay<00:04:15.190> and

barbs got destroyed but that's okay and

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.849 
barbs got destroyed but that's okay and
here<00:04:16.299> come<00:04:16.449> out<00:04:16.570> some<00:04:16.750> more<00:04:16.870> barbs<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.500> dark

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
here come out some more barbs the dark

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.219 
here come out some more barbs the dark
elixir<00:04:18.010> went<00:04:18.310> down<00:04:18.489> which<00:04:18.669> is<00:04:18.699> good<00:04:19.030> not<00:04:20.019> sure

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
elixir went down which is good not sure

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.449 
elixir went down which is good not sure
where<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.470> rest<00:04:20.620> of<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.799> dark<00:04:20.979> liq<00:04:21.159> sure<00:04:21.310> was

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
where the rest of the dark liq sure was

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.710 
where the rest of the dark liq sure was
I<00:04:21.579> think<00:04:21.609> it<00:04:21.880> may<00:04:22.030> be<00:04:22.060> in<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.449> clan<00:04:22.690> castle

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
I think it may be in the clan castle

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.420 
I think it may be in the clan castle
that's<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:23.620> only<00:04:23.770> place<00:04:23.889> it<00:04:24.070> could<00:04:24.220> have<00:04:24.340> been

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
that's the only place it could have been

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.950 
that's the only place it could have been
because<00:04:24.580> all<00:04:24.909> the<00:04:25.060> dark<00:04:25.270> elixir<00:04:25.419> buildings

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
because all the dark elixir buildings

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.680 
because all the dark elixir buildings
were<00:04:26.110> down<00:04:26.430> so<00:04:27.430> now<00:04:27.610> make<00:04:28.150> my<00:04:28.300> hair<00:04:28.449> is<00:04:28.539> going

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
were down so now make my hair is going

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.719 
were down so now make my hair is going
visible<00:04:29.169> luckily<00:04:29.949> no<00:04:30.159> defenses<00:04:30.580> we're

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
visible luckily no defenses we're

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.550 
visible luckily no defenses we're
targeting<00:04:30.909> them<00:04:31.360> so<00:04:31.510> they<00:04:31.630> could<00:04:31.810> clean<00:04:32.440> up

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
targeting them so they could clean up

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.100 
targeting them so they could clean up
the<00:04:32.770> extra<00:04:33.250> loot<00:04:33.430> here<00:04:33.760> and<00:04:34.860> get<00:04:35.860> to

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.010 
the extra loot here and get to
seventy-two<00:04:36.500> percent<00:04:37.360> so<00:04:38.360> that's<00:04:38.810> all<00:04:38.960> for

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
seventy-two percent so that's all for

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.790 
seventy-two percent so that's all for
the<00:04:39.200> raids<00:04:39.380> today<00:04:39.740> but<00:04:40.130> as<00:04:40.750> you<00:04:41.750> can<00:04:41.870> see<00:04:42.200> here

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
here in my well I upgrade them both I

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.960 
here in my well I upgrade them both I
don't<00:05:03.830> know<00:05:03.890> which<00:05:04.280> first<00:05:04.520> so<00:05:04.640> here's<00:05:04.850> the

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
don't know which first so here's the

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.410 
don't know which first so here's the
Queen<00:05:05.560> 100,000<00:05:06.560> a<00:05:06.740> hundred<00:05:07.400> five<00:05:07.640> thousand<00:05:08.180> so

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
Queen 100,000 a hundred five thousand so

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.240 
Queen 100,000 a hundred five thousand so
I'll<00:05:08.570> and<00:05:08.780> the<00:05:08.810> boost<00:05:09.440> it<00:05:09.620> was<00:05:09.710> only<00:05:09.830> one<00:05:10.040> gem

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
I'll and the boost it was only one gem

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.870 
I'll and the boost it was only one gem
so<00:05:10.490> it's<00:05:10.700> not<00:05:11.000> really<00:05:11.060> worth<00:05:11.900> losing<00:05:12.410> so<00:05:12.880> here

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
so it's not really worth losing so here

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.070 
so it's not really worth losing so here
we're<00:05:14.000> going<00:05:14.120> to<00:05:14.210> have<00:05:14.300> the<00:05:14.390> King<00:05:14.630> going<00:05:14.780> up<00:05:14.930> as

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
we're going to have the King going up as

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.580 
we're going to have the King going up as
well<00:05:15.410> and<00:05:15.710> we're<00:05:16.460> at<00:05:16.670> exactly<00:05:17.510> zero<00:05:18.200> dark

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
well and we're at exactly zero dark

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.690 
well and we're at exactly zero dark
elixir<00:05:18.860> so<00:05:19.850> hopefully<00:05:20.270> i<00:05:20.480> can<00:05:20.980> get<00:05:21.980> at<00:05:22.640> least

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
elixir so hopefully i can get at least

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.730 
elixir so hopefully i can get at least
enough<00:05:23.360> for<00:05:23.540> the<00:05:23.630> archer<00:05:23.870> queen<00:05:24.140> to<00:05:24.380> upgrade

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
enough for the archer queen to upgrade

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.300 
enough for the archer queen to upgrade
her<00:05:24.980> again<00:05:25.490> 222<00:05:26.330> within<00:05:26.810> the<00:05:26.930> next<00:05:27.080> week<00:05:27.380> when

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
her again 222 within the next week when

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.630 
her again 222 within the next week when
that<00:05:28.460> finishes<00:05:29.030> so<00:05:29.480> i'll<00:05:30.440> probably<00:05:30.740> be

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
that finishes so i'll probably be

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.600 
that finishes so i'll probably be
