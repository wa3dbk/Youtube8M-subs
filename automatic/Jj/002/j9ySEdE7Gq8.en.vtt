first<00:01:32.009> impression<00:01:32.630> seems<00:01:33.630> like<00:01:33.780> they'd<00:01:33.930> be

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
first impression seems like they'd be

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.599 
first impression seems like they'd be
very<00:01:34.229> easy<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.619> click<00:01:34.859> on<00:01:35.039> the<00:01:37.460> objective<00:01:38.460> is

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
very easy to click on the objective is

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:46.370 
very easy to click on the objective is
to<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:39.289> push<00:01:40.289> them<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.530> there<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:42.049> just<00:01:45.380> have

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
to just push them on there and just have

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.539 
to just push them on there and just have
to<00:01:46.469> use<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.619> little<00:01:46.859> bit<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:46.979> course<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.490> now

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
to use a little bit of course and now

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:55.940 
to use a little bit of course and now
that<00:01:47.700> one's<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:49.909> and<00:01:52.159> this<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:54.530> FPS<00:01:55.530> freek

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
that one's on and this is the FPS freek

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.700 
that one's on and this is the FPS freek
one<00:01:56.429> which<00:01:57.420> i'll<00:01:57.600> most<00:01:57.810> likely<00:01:57.899> be<00:01:58.259> using<00:01:58.590> more

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
one which i'll most likely be using more

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.630 
one which i'll most likely be using more
often<00:01:59.009> because<00:01:59.159> i<00:01:59.640> play<00:01:59.969> up<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.299> SS<00:02:03.049> so<00:02:04.640> my

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
often because i play up the SS so my

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.340 
often because i play up the SS so my
first<00:02:05.850> impression<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.990> little

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
first impression is it's a little

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.070 
first impression is it's a little
awkward<00:02:07.619> having<00:02:08.250> your<00:02:08.460> sticks<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.899> much

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
awkward having your sticks so much

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.830 
awkward having your sticks so much
higher<00:02:10.320> up<00:02:10.590> as<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:11.099> can<00:02:11.220> see<00:02:11.430> they<00:02:12.360> are<00:02:12.390> quite

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
higher up as you can see they are quite

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.649 
higher up as you can see they are quite
high<00:02:13.019> up<00:02:13.050> but<00:02:13.580> like<00:02:14.580> anything<00:02:14.879> I'm<00:02:15.360> sure<00:02:15.599> I'll

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
high up but like anything I'm sure I'll

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:16.540 
high up but like anything I'm sure I'll
get<00:02:15.810> used<00:02:16.019> to<00:02:16.140> that

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
get used to that

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.120 
get used to that
and<00:02:17.800> other<00:02:18.800> than<00:02:18.920> that<00:02:19.100> they<00:02:19.460> feel<00:02:20.920> this<00:02:21.920> is

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
and other than that they feel this is

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.340 
and other than that they feel this is
very<00:02:22.430> is<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.760> very<00:02:23.120> nice<00:02:23.330> build<00:02:23.630> quality<00:02:23.930> the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
very is a very nice build quality the

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.350 
very is a very nice build quality the
material<00:02:24.890> it's<00:02:25.040> made<00:02:25.100> I've<00:02:25.340> really<00:02:26.150> sound

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
material it's made I've really sound

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.680 
material it's made I've really sound
seems<00:02:26.840> like<00:02:26.990> it's<00:02:27.140> going<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.530> hold<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:28.940> last

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
seems like it's going to hold and last

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.650 
seems like it's going to hold and last
over<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.200> years<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.790> now<00:02:32.300> let<00:02:32.510> me<00:02:32.540> just

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
over the years so now let me just

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.640 
over the years so now let me just
quickly<00:02:33.050> take<00:02:33.620> out<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:33.950> Speed<00:02:34.280> Freaks<00:02:34.550> and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
quickly take out the Speed Freaks and

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.870 
quickly take out the Speed Freaks and
leave<00:02:36.650> my<00:02:36.800> first<00:02:37.040> impression<00:02:37.400> of<00:02:37.460> that<00:02:37.640> and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
leave my first impression of that and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.050 
leave my first impression of that and
then<00:02:38.090> make<00:02:38.390> sure<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.570> look<00:02:38.750> forward<00:02:39.320> to<00:02:40.130> g

review<00:02:44.530> coming<00:02:45.530> in<00:02:46.010> about<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.310> week<00:02:47.410> I'll<00:02:48.410> see

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
review coming in about a week I'll see

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.000 
review coming in about a week I'll see
how<00:02:49.340> easy<00:02:49.670> is<00:02:49.820> to<00:02:49.850> get<00:02:50.150> these<00:02:50.330> off<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:51.260> I

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
how easy is to get these off and I

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.900 
how easy is to get these off and I
actually<00:02:52.520> just<00:02:52.850> turned<00:02:53.090> on<00:02:53.270> my<00:02:53.300> xbox<00:02:54.850> there<00:02:55.850> we

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
actually just turned on my xbox there we

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.170 
actually just turned on my xbox there we
go<00:02:59.500> so<00:03:00.500> again<00:03:00.770> a<00:03:00.800> little<00:03:01.010> bit<00:03:01.130> of<00:03:01.280> fourth<00:03:01.550> force

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
go so again a little bit of fourth force

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.050 
go so again a little bit of fourth force
both<00:03:02.810> ways<00:03:03.260> up<00:03:03.770> taking<00:03:04.520> them<00:03:04.640> off<00:03:04.730> but<00:03:04.880> that's

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
both ways up taking them off but that's

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.610 
both ways up taking them off but that's
a<00:03:05.150> good<00:03:05.300> thing<00:03:05.360> because<00:03:05.630> for<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.290> most<00:03:06.320> part

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
a good thing because for the most part

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.230 
a good thing because for the most part
you<00:03:06.770> aren't<00:03:07.130> going<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.520> be<00:03:07.640> taking<00:03:07.970> them<00:03:08.060> off

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
you aren't going to be taking them off

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.320 
you aren't going to be taking them off
and<00:03:08.740> that<00:03:09.740> means<00:03:10.220> that<00:03:10.610> they're<00:03:11.090> going<00:03:11.270> to

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
and that means that they're going to

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.010 
and that means that they're going to
stay<00:03:11.600> on<00:03:11.630> your<00:03:11.990> xbox<00:03:12.260> really<00:03:12.740> well<00:03:13.840> so<00:03:14.840> here

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
stay on your xbox really well so here

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.970 
stay on your xbox really well so here
are<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.110> speed<00:03:15.500> freaks<00:03:16.180> they<00:03:17.180> provide<00:03:17.510> like

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
are the speed freaks they provide like

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.180 
are the speed freaks they provide like
sort<00:03:18.980> of<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.130> dome<00:03:19.780> for<00:03:20.780> your<00:03:21.140> controller<00:03:22.150> and

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
sort of a dome for your controller and

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.250 
sort of a dome for your controller and
here<00:03:26.110> wow<00:03:27.110> that<00:03:27.739> is<00:03:27.770> cool<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.550> is<00:03:28.760> cool

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
here wow that is cool that is cool

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.660 
here wow that is cool that is cool
basically<00:03:30.260> I<00:03:30.530> think<00:03:30.860> these<00:03:31.010> are<00:03:31.070> meant<00:03:31.400> for

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
basically I think these are meant for

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.930 
basically I think these are meant for
more<00:03:31.820> of<00:03:32.000> SPF<00:03:32.450> not<00:03:33.200> not<00:03:33.739> FPS<00:03:34.250> games<00:03:34.520> but<00:03:34.820> rather

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
more of SPF not not FPS games but rather

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.350 
more of SPF not not FPS games but rather
racing<00:03:35.450> games<00:03:35.630> and<00:03:35.870> what<00:03:36.500> you<00:03:36.590> can<00:03:36.739> do<00:03:36.890> is<00:03:37.040> just

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
racing games and what you can do is just

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.720 
racing games and what you can do is just
jolt<00:03:38.360> your<00:03:38.510> finger<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.080> side<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.830> it<00:03:40.610> will

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
jolt your finger to the side and it will

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.390 
jolt your finger to the side and it will
move<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.030> analog<00:03:41.570> stick<00:03:41.600> rather<00:03:42.080> than<00:03:42.400> like

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
move the analog stick rather than like

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.340 
move the analog stick rather than like
providing<00:03:44.360> force<00:03:44.600> and<00:03:44.840> then<00:03:44.930> pushing<00:03:45.290> it

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
providing force and then pushing it

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.650 
providing force and then pushing it
aside<00:03:45.440> you<00:03:45.650> can<00:03:45.800> just<00:03:46.750> like<00:03:47.750> that<00:03:49.120> so<00:03:50.120> that<00:03:50.540> is

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
aside you can just like that so that is

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.220 
aside you can just like that so that is
a<00:03:50.690> really<00:03:51.200> interesting<00:03:51.230> idea<00:03:53.050> although<00:03:54.050> those

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
a really interesting idea although those

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.479 
a really interesting idea although those
are<00:03:54.290> made<00:03:54.590> for<00:03:55.480> although<00:03:56.480> these<00:03:56.660> are<00:03:56.870> made<00:03:57.080> for

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
are made for although these are made for

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.130 
are made for although these are made for
racing<00:03:58.489> games<00:03:58.850> most<00:03:59.450> likely<00:03:59.780> I'm<00:03:59.900> going<00:04:00.020> to<00:04:00.080> be

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
racing games most likely I'm going to be

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.449 
racing games most likely I'm going to be
trying<00:04:00.290> to<00:04:00.440> decide<00:04:00.680> on<00:04:00.709> Call<00:04:01.070> of<00:04:01.100> Duty
