00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:07.280 
question is well what about eating whole
grains<00:04:05.989> the<00:04:06.989> good

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
grains the good

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.080 
grains the good
for<00:04:07.439> you<00:04:07.530> grains<00:04:08.189> didn't<00:04:08.579> enter<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.879> diet

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
for you grains didn't enter the diet

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.030 
for you grains didn't enter the diet
until<00:04:09.360> twelve<00:04:09.810> thousand<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.469> ten<00:04:10.620> thousand

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
until twelve thousand to ten thousand

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.679 
until twelve thousand to ten thousand
years<00:04:11.189> ago<00:04:11.459> to<00:04:11.730> take<00:04:11.909> the<00:04:12.060> evolutionary

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:12.689 
years ago to take the evolutionary

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:14.690 
years ago to take the evolutionary
perspective<00:04:13.260> you<00:04:13.769> don't<00:04:13.950> need<00:04:14.069> grains<00:04:14.400> I

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
perspective you don't need grains I

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.840 
perspective you don't need grains I
don't<00:04:15.150> eat<00:04:15.269> any<00:04:15.480> grains<00:04:16.370> going<00:04:17.370> from<00:04:17.549> grains

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
don't eat any grains going from grains

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.439 
don't eat any grains going from grains
we<00:04:18.150> now<00:04:18.299> go<00:04:18.539> to<00:04:18.570> something<00:04:18.989> even<00:04:19.759> less<00:04:20.759> wise<00:04:21.060> in

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
we now go to something even less wise in

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.749 
we now go to something even less wise in
my<00:04:21.630> opinion<00:04:21.930> and<00:04:22.199> that<00:04:22.350> is<00:04:22.500> vegetarianism<00:04:23.280> the

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 
my opinion and that is vegetarianism the

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.540 
my opinion and that is vegetarianism the
human<00:04:24.150> species<00:04:24.630> evolved<00:04:25.380> from<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:25.949> line<00:04:26.160> that

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
human species evolved from a line that

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.430 
human species evolved from a line that
included<00:04:27.030> vegetarians<00:04:27.750> as<00:04:27.930> well<00:04:28.110> as<00:04:28.229> meat

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
included vegetarians as well as meat

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.680 
included vegetarians as well as meat
eaters<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:29.009> meat<00:04:29.190> eating<00:04:29.490> human<00:04:29.970> eats<00:04:30.210> high

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690

density<00:04:31.229> nutrients<00:04:31.889> could<00:04:32.160> therefore<00:04:32.370> afford

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
density nutrients could therefore afford

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.520 
density nutrients could therefore afford
to<00:04:33.030> have<00:04:33.150> a<00:04:33.210> small<00:04:33.570> stomach<00:04:33.870> you<00:04:34.289> trade

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
to have a small stomach you trade

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.320 
to have a small stomach you trade
stomach<00:04:35.009> for<00:04:35.220> brain<00:04:35.430> mass<00:04:35.729> so<00:04:36.090> they<00:04:36.180> could

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
stomach for brain mass so they could

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.749 
stomach for brain mass so they could
therefore<00:04:36.539> become<00:04:37.110> smarter<00:04:37.680> you<00:04:37.949> also<00:04:38.130> gain

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
therefore become smarter you also gain

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.450 
therefore become smarter you also gain
mobility<00:04:39.419> by<00:04:39.599> having<00:04:39.900> a<00:04:39.990> small<00:04:40.259> stomach<00:04:40.590> so<00:04:41.099> if

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
mobility by having a small stomach so if

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.610 
mobility by having a small stomach so if
you<00:04:41.639> wanted<00:04:41.910> to<00:04:41.970> look<00:04:42.240> like<00:04:42.419> a<00:04:42.449> vegetarian<00:04:43.259> who

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
you wanted to look like a vegetarian who

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.499 
you wanted to look like a vegetarian who
didn't<00:04:43.949> quite<00:04:44.099> make<00:04:44.370> it<00:04:44.430> have<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.060> look<00:04:45.300> at<00:04:45.419> the

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
didn't quite make it have a look at the

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.029 
didn't quite make it have a look at the
gorilla<00:04:45.810> that's<00:04:46.229> what<00:04:46.440> humans<00:04:46.740> would<00:04:46.919> look

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
gorilla that's what humans would look

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.860 
gorilla that's what humans would look
like<00:04:47.220> I<00:04:47.490> think<00:04:47.940> if<00:04:48.060> you<00:04:48.180> want<00:04:48.360> to<00:04:48.479> live<00:04:48.630> a<00:04:48.660> long

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
like I think if you want to live a long

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.140 
like I think if you want to live a long
time<00:04:49.169> in<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.680> kind<00:04:49.889> of<00:04:49.949> health<00:04:50.190> that<00:04:50.460> I've

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
time in the kind of health that I've

time in the kind of health that I've
been<00:04:51.300> lucky<00:04:51.509> enough<00:04:51.660> to<00:04:51.960> enjoy<00:04:52.110> you<00:04:52.770> want<00:04:52.979> body

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
a new evolution diet and see how easy it

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.900 
a new evolution diet and see how easy it
is<00:04:55.919> to<00:04:56.099> do<00:04:56.430> this<00:04:56.610> great<00:04:57.449> workout
