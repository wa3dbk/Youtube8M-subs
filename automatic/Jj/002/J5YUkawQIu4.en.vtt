00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:09.490
 and wooden packaging an industry 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.490
 sustainable committed to quality 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.549
 wooden type containers 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.320
 fruit and vegetables are manufactured 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.860
 mainly with plywood board 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.259
 of poplar or pine sawn wood or with 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.360
 wood fiber boards materials 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.960
 natural fit for direct contact 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.960
 with food 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.170
 The wooden container consists of two 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.800
 front ends 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.250
 two lateral four square or 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.250
 stairs 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.409
 and a background 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.890
 from these components you can 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.040
 get a wide range of formats 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.690
 standardized or customized to the customer 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.260
 from sales units to packaging 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.260
 transport 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.700
 and the wood that is used comes from 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.470
 sustainable crops and forests that 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.500
 They also offer many advantages 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.870
 environmental 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.570
 during its growth the trees 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.380
 they absorb the CO2 from the atmosphere 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.220
 contributing to the fight against 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.220
 climate change 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.960
 once the components arrive at the 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.900
 packaging factory are printed with the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.790
 Flexography customer brand is the 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.530
 most widespread printing technique 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.140
 your good results in the combination 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.640
 of color after marking are cut to 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.640
 measure the tablets of the container 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.470
 the square is cut according to the height 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.900
 Container other components 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.189
 they are entering the assembly line 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.020
 where they are joined by wire wires 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.020
 conferring great resistance 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.380
 first the slats and the 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.380
 squares forming the front ends 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.060
 Subsequently, the 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.450
 sides forming the fence of the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.450
 container 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.439
 and we just need to incorporate the fund that 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.549
 It can be smooth and die-cut or the 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.549
 traditional slats 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.080
 the fund is a key piece in the good 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.080
 ventilation of the wooden container 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.340
 and so the package is ready 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.140
 the package fits to save space 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.030
 in his later politicized and expedition 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.030
 direct to the client's facilities 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.299
 in the agri-food industry the 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.340
 wooden container responds to 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.340
 automation and hygiene requirements 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.890
 its resistance and good behavior in 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.570
 the stack makes it be the container 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.630
 preferred for transport to long 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.630
 distances 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.530
 ah 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.180
 At destination the wooden container is the 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.510
 best ambassador of the products of 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.510
 quality 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.030
