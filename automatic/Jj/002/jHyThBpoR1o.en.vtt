00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
trailer and this has probably gotten him

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.910 
trailer and this has probably gotten him
more<00:00:21.480> aroused<00:00:21.840> than<00:00:22.140> any<00:00:22.289> day<00:00:22.439> he's<00:00:22.619> been<00:00:22.800> on

maybe<00:00:23.130> since<00:00:23.369> prom<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.230> uh<00:00:25.519> that<00:00:26.519> goes

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
maybe since prom so that is uh that goes

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.630 
maybe since prom so that is uh that goes
it<00:00:27.300> goes<00:00:27.449> without<00:00:27.539> saying<00:00:27.900> Godzilla<00:00:28.380> is

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.900 
massive and the coolest thing about this
is<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.859> fact<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.130> we've<00:00:32.309> got<00:00:32.489> we<00:00:32.730> knew<00:00:32.880> that
