00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
with the 320 320 long block some 320

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.109 
with the 320 320 long block some 320
grit<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.850> long<00:00:24.029> block<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:25.880> had<00:00:26.880> some

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
grit in the long block and had some

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.240 
grit in the long block and had some
small<00:00:27.390> blocks<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.019> get<00:00:28.199> get<00:00:28.680> where<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:28.890> need<00:00:29.130> to

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
small blocks to get get where I need to

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.799 
small blocks to get get where I need to
get<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:30.470> just<00:00:31.470> pretty<00:00:31.769> much<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.009> sand<00:00:32.489> it

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
wherever there was primer and also get a

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.180 
wherever there was primer and also get a
good<00:00:36.540> idea<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.020> how<00:00:37.140> much<00:00:37.200> bondo<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:37.980> dude

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190

good idea of how much bondo this dude
was<00:00:38.489> using

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
was using

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.110

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
seems like he used you know quite a bit

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.040 
seems like he used you know quite a bit

imperfections down

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.450 
imperfections down
the<00:00:48.030> pinholes<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.840> then<00:00:49.219> probably<00:00:50.219> tomorrow

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the pinholes and then probably tomorrow

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.069 
the pinholes and then probably tomorrow
I'll<00:00:50.879> go<00:00:51.120> over<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:53.059> check<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.449> hand

start<00:01:39.329> pulling<00:01:39.689> some<00:01:39.810> dents<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:41.540> that'll<00:01:42.540> be

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
start pulling some dents so that'll be

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.679 
start pulling some dents so that'll be
chapter<00:01:43.619> 2<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:45.200> what<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.229> got<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.560> do<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.250> then

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
chapter 2 of what I got to do and then

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.149 
chapter 2 of what I got to do and then
once<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.840> get<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:50.820> primer<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.780> high<00:01:52.590> build<00:01:52.920> and

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
once I get the primer on high build and

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.800 
once I get the primer on high build and
then<00:01:53.280> block<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.579> then<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> next<00:01:54.390> thing<00:01:54.630> would

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
then block it then the next thing would

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.600 
then block it then the next thing would
be<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:57.290> get<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.439> hood<00:01:58.619> ready<00:01:58.950> -<00:01:59.159> hood<00:01:59.310> scoop

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
be to get the hood ready - hood scoop

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.170 
be to get the hood ready - hood scoop
get<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.570> hood<00:02:00.750> scoop<00:02:00.899> on<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.909> once<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.030> hood

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
get the hood scoop on and once the hood

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.060 
get the hood scoop on and once the hood
scoop<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.810> block<00:02:04.259> down<00:02:04.530> everything

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
scoop is on block down everything

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.580 
scoop is on block down everything
straight<00:02:05.399> with<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:07.670> then<00:02:09.140> take<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.259> bumpers

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
straight with that then take the bumpers

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.290 
straight with that then take the bumpers
and<00:02:10.649> everything<00:02:11.129> off<00:02:11.340> and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
and everything off and

prime sand down the bumpers priming the
bumpers<00:02:15.680> prime<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.860> little<00:02:17.100> stuff<00:02:17.310> that's

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
bumpers prime a little stuff that's

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.480 
bumpers prime a little stuff that's
going<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.790> be<00:02:17.850> chrome<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.980> get<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.190> ready<00:02:20.400> to

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
going to be chrome and get that ready to

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.010 
going to be chrome and get that ready to
be<00:02:20.730> sprayed<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:22.400> then<00:02:23.400> will<00:02:23.580> be<00:02:23.730> good<00:02:24.020> then

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
straight as an arrow

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.460 
straight as an arrow
then<00:02:29.910> we're<00:02:30.030> gonna<00:02:30.180> go<00:02:30.810> ahead<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.110> spray<00:02:31.290> that
