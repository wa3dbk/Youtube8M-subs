hi everyone I'm going to show you how to
change<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.710> batteries<00:00:05.130> on<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:05.460> razor<00:00:05.940> MX<00:00:06.629> 650

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
change the batteries on a razor MX 650

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.950 
change the batteries on a razor MX 650
now<00:00:08.099> this<00:00:08.370> bike<00:00:08.580> here<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:08.910> just<00:00:09.300> purchased<00:00:09.480> on

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
now this bike here I just purchased on

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.830 
now this bike here I just purchased on
eBay<00:00:10.070> it<00:00:11.070> was<00:00:11.190> actually<00:00:11.639> at<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:12.000> huge<00:00:12.570> discount

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
eBay it was actually at a huge discount

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.749 
eBay it was actually at a huge discount
because<00:00:13.320> it<00:00:13.440> was<00:00:13.559> an<00:00:13.679> open<00:00:13.980> box<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.610> was

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
because it was an open box and it was

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.840 
because it was an open box and it was
missing<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.269> front<00:00:15.630> wheel<00:00:15.949> so<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:16.980> got<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.609> home

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
missing the front wheel so I got it home

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.210 
missing the front wheel so I got it home
and<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.570> also<00:00:18.810> bought<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.230> new<00:00:19.500> front<00:00:19.890> wheel<00:00:20.070> as

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
and I also bought a new front wheel as

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.410 
and I also bought a new front wheel as
you<00:00:20.250> can<00:00:20.490> see<00:00:20.640> here<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.060> put<00:00:21.210> everything

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
you can see here and put everything

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.660 
you can see here and put everything
together<00:00:21.630> but<00:00:22.619> when<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.830> went<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.100> power<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.580> up

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
together but when I went to power it up

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.070 
together but when I went to power it up
I<00:00:23.850> found<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.300> batteries<00:00:24.660> didn't<00:00:24.930> work

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
I found that the batteries didn't work

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.230 
I found that the batteries didn't work
even<00:00:25.830> after<00:00:25.949> charging<00:00:26.460> them<00:00:26.580> for<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.910> couple

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
even after charging them for a couple

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.089 
even after charging them for a couple
days<00:00:27.390> they<00:00:28.230> didn't<00:00:28.439> seem<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.680> be<00:00:28.769> taking<00:00:29.039> a

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
days they didn't seem to be taking a

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.890 
days they didn't seem to be taking a
charge<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.849> guess<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.660> means<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
charge so I guess that means the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.900 
charge so I guess that means the
batteries<00:00:31.289> are<00:00:31.410> shot<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.070> what<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.460> did<00:00:32.550> was<00:00:32.820> I

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
batteries are shot so what I did was I

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.520 
batteries are shot so what I did was I
purchased<00:00:33.300> some<00:00:33.329> new<00:00:33.540> batteries<00:00:33.750> actually

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
purchased some new batteries actually

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.020 
purchased some new batteries actually
some<00:00:34.920> better<00:00:35.100> batteries<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.700> I'll<00:00:35.760> tell<00:00:35.940> you

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
some better batteries and I'll tell you

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.240 
some better batteries and I'll tell you
about<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.630> little<00:00:36.809> bit<00:00:36.930> later<00:00:37.250> so

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
about that and a little bit later so

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.040 
about that and a little bit later so
let's<00:00:38.399> get<00:00:38.489> started

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
let's get started

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.780 
let's get started
so<00:00:40.050> before<00:00:40.440> we<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.800> get<00:00:40.980> at<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> batteries<00:00:41.610> we

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
so before we can get at the batteries we

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.790 
so before we can get at the batteries we
have<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.090> remove<00:00:42.420> these<00:00:42.629> battery<00:00:43.350> covers<00:00:43.680> that

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
have to remove these battery covers that

00:00:43.800 --> 00:01:11.030 
have to remove these battery covers that
you<00:00:43.950> see<00:00:44.160> here

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.740 

okay<00:01:12.040> well<00:01:12.250> as<00:01:12.400> you<00:01:12.430> can<00:01:12.700> see<00:01:12.760> I've<00:01:13.210> stripped

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
okay well as you can see I've stripped

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.310 
okay well as you can see I've stripped
off<00:01:13.930> all<00:01:14.170> of<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.820> battery<00:01:15.820> fairing<00:01:16.270> as<00:01:16.450> well

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
off all of the battery fairing as well

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.650 
off all of the battery fairing as well
as<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.980> seat<00:01:18.340> and<00:01:18.580> the<00:01:18.940> rear<00:01:19.120> fender<00:01:19.510> it

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
as the seat and the rear fender it

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.330 
as the seat and the rear fender it
actually<00:01:19.960> ended<00:01:20.170> up<00:01:20.290> being<00:01:20.500> more<00:01:20.770> work<00:01:21.010> than<00:01:21.220> I

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
actually ended up being more work than I

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.910 
actually ended up being more work than I
thought<00:01:21.580> to<00:01:22.510> ticket<00:01:23.110> out<00:01:23.230> the<00:01:23.350> batteries<00:01:23.740> but

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
thought to ticket out the batteries but

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.130 
thought to ticket out the batteries but
now<00:01:24.580> we<00:01:24.640> can<00:01:25.030> see<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.300> batteries<00:01:25.660> so<00:01:25.840> here<00:01:26.020> we

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
now we can see the batteries so here we

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.500 
now we can see the batteries so here we
have<00:01:26.260> the<00:01:26.350> three<00:01:26.560> batteries<00:01:27.150> still<00:01:28.150> mounted

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
have the three batteries still mounted

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.920 
have the three batteries still mounted
this<00:01:28.690> is<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:29.730> controller<00:01:30.730> for<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.480> bike<00:01:31.720> the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
this is the controller for the bike the

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.170 
this is the controller for the bike the
speed<00:01:32.170> controller<00:01:32.620> and<00:01:32.950> each<00:01:33.640> of<00:01:33.790> these<00:01:33.880> black

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
speed controller and each of these black

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.580 
speed controller and each of these black
things<00:01:34.510> that<00:01:34.660> you<00:01:34.780> see<00:01:34.960> there's<00:01:35.170> actually<00:01:35.440> one

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
things that you see there's actually one

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.870 
things that you see there's actually one
here<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.070> twenty<00:01:36.340> other<00:01:36.460> sides<00:01:36.700> these<00:01:36.820> are

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
here and twenty other sides these are

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.540 
here and twenty other sides these are
the<00:01:37.120> fuses<00:01:37.620> so<00:01:38.620> once<00:01:38.920> I<00:01:39.010> get<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.220> batteries

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
the fuses so once I get the batteries

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.340 
the fuses so once I get the batteries
out<00:01:39.670> I'm<00:01:39.850> going<00:01:40.210> to<00:01:40.300> check<00:01:40.510> the<00:01:40.660> fuses<00:01:41.110> first

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
out I'm going to check the fuses first

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.950 
out I'm going to check the fuses first
just<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.680> make<00:01:41.830> sure<00:01:42.210> those<00:01:43.210> aren't<00:01:43.450> blown<00:01:43.720> and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
just to make sure those aren't blown and

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.020 
just to make sure those aren't blown and
then<00:01:44.350> I'll<00:01:44.560> show<00:01:44.800> you<00:01:44.830> how<00:01:44.979> I'm<00:01:45.460> replacing<00:01:45.820> the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
then I'll show you how I'm replacing the

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.690 
then I'll show you how I'm replacing the
batteries<00:01:48.510> well<00:01:49.510> as<00:01:49.720> you<00:01:49.900> can<00:01:49.990> see<00:01:50.290> I<00:01:50.520> got<00:01:51.520> all

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
batteries well as you can see I got all

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.719 
batteries well as you can see I got all
three<00:01:51.910> batteries<00:01:52.420> out<00:01:52.600> of<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:52.780> bike<00:01:53.050> I<00:01:54.009> won't

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
three batteries out of the bike I won't

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.490 
three batteries out of the bike I won't
say<00:01:54.940> that<00:01:54.970> was<00:01:55.300> easy<00:01:55.540> that<00:01:55.840> was<00:01:55.930> actually<00:01:56.290> kind

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
say that was easy that was actually kind

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.620 
say that was easy that was actually kind
of<00:01:56.530> a<00:01:56.650> pain<00:01:56.860> in<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.100> ass<00:01:57.310> but<00:01:57.729> here<00:01:58.450> they<00:01:58.600> are

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630

of a pain in the ass but here they are
all<00:01:58.990> these<00:01:59.950> black<00:02:00.220> things<00:02:00.250> that<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:00.820> see<00:02:01.030> here

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
all these black things that you see here

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.780 
all these black things that you see here
are<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:02.080> fuse<00:02:02.380> holders<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.190> fuses<00:02:03.580> and<00:02:03.610> I

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
are the fuse holders and the fuses and I

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.100 
are the fuse holders and the fuses and I
checked<00:02:04.030> those<00:02:04.210> real<00:02:04.420> quick<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.780> make<00:02:04.869> sure

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
checked those real quick to make sure

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.690 
checked those real quick to make sure
they're<00:02:05.710> okay<00:02:06.040> there's<00:02:06.220> actually<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.520> little

window<00:02:07.030> here<00:02:07.060> you<00:02:07.360> can<00:02:07.509> look<00:02:07.660> in<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:07.960> see<00:02:08.080> if

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
window here you can look in and see if

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.350 
window here you can look in and see if
the<00:02:08.350> fuse<00:02:08.590> is<00:02:08.709> blown<00:02:08.830> or<00:02:09.100> not<00:02:09.250> so<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.270> original

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
the fuse is blown or not so the original

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.330 
the fuse is blown or not so the original
batteries<00:02:11.140> I<00:02:11.380> don't<00:02:11.740> know<00:02:11.800> if<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:11.980> can<00:02:12.130> see

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
batteries I don't know if you can see

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.900 
batteries I don't know if you can see
this<00:02:12.490> or<00:02:12.700> not<00:02:12.880> were<00:02:13.600> 12<00:02:14.500> volt<00:02:14.830> 12<00:02:15.489> amp<00:02:15.730> power

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
this or not were 12 volt 12 amp power

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.830 
this or not were 12 volt 12 amp power
and<00:02:16.480> what<00:02:16.660> I<00:02:16.690> did<00:02:16.930> was<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.170> went<00:02:17.500> on<00:02:17.560> Amazon<00:02:18.840> some

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
and what I did was I went on Amazon some

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.229 
and what I did was I went on Amazon some
new<00:02:20.050> batteries<00:02:20.519> made<00:02:21.519> by<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.730> company<00:02:22.150> called

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
new batteries made by a company called

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.190 
new batteries made by a company called
Mighty<00:02:22.840> Max<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.500> these<00:02:24.130> are<00:02:24.340> 12<00:02:24.640> volt<00:02:25.019> 15<00:02:26.019> amp

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
Mighty Max and these are 12 volt 15 amp

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.920 
Mighty Max and these are 12 volt 15 amp
hours<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:26.739> these<00:02:26.890> are<00:02:27.160> about<00:02:27.760> 25<00:02:28.450> percent

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
hours so these are about 25 percent

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.780 
hours so these are about 25 percent
higher<00:02:29.110> so<00:02:29.680> these<00:02:29.830> are<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.160> fuse<00:02:30.400> holders

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
higher so these are the fuse holders

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.420 
higher so these are the fuse holders
they<00:02:31.480> are<00:02:31.720> 30<00:02:32.170> amp<00:02:32.470> fuses<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.190> there<00:02:33.310> are

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
they are 30 amp fuses and there are

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.910 
they are 30 amp fuses and there are
three<00:02:33.790> of<00:02:33.820> them<00:02:34.050> connected<00:02:35.050> in<00:02:35.170> series<00:02:35.410> with

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
three of them connected in series with

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.979 
three of them connected in series with
the<00:02:36.310> batteries<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:36.970> what<00:02:37.450> I've<00:02:37.570> done<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:37.870> I've

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
the batteries and what I've done is I've

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.300 
the batteries and what I've done is I've
just<00:02:38.110> done<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.320> quick<00:02:38.590> check<00:02:38.799> to<00:02:38.950> make<00:02:39.100> sure

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
just done a quick check to make sure

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.070 
just done a quick check to make sure
none<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.790> fuses<00:02:40.150> are<00:02:40.269> blown<00:02:40.330> there's

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
none of the fuses are blown there's

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.360 
none of the fuses are blown there's
actually<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.470> little<00:02:41.680> window<00:02:42.010> here<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.250> don't

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
actually a little window here I don't

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.250 
actually a little window here I don't
know<00:02:42.519> if<00:02:42.549> you<00:02:42.670> can<00:02:42.820> see<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:43.959> can<00:02:44.110> just

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
know if you can see it and you can just

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.420 
know if you can see it and you can just
do<00:02:44.320> a<00:02:44.350> quick<00:02:44.590> visual<00:02:44.769> check<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:45.250> make<00:02:45.370> sure

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
do a quick visual check to make sure

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.280 
do a quick visual check to make sure
that<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:46.090> fuses<00:02:46.660> aren't<00:02:46.810> blown

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
that the fuses aren't blown

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.759 
that the fuses aren't blown
I<00:02:47.320> also<00:02:47.769> took<00:02:47.920> my<00:02:48.190> multimeter<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:49.620> check<00:02:50.620> the

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
I also took my multimeter and check the

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.220 
I also took my multimeter and check the
voltage<00:02:50.950> on<00:02:51.459> these<00:02:51.850> batteries<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.690> what<00:02:53.200> I

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
voltage on these batteries and what I

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.150 
voltage on these batteries and what I
found<00:02:53.530> was<00:02:55.170> these<00:02:56.170> batteries<00:02:56.799> hooked<00:02:57.040> in

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
found was these batteries hooked in

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.430 
found was these batteries hooked in
series<00:02:57.549> are<00:02:58.120> only<00:02:58.330> putting<00:02:58.600> out<00:02:58.690> about<00:02:58.810> 16

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
series are only putting out about 16

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.050 
series are only putting out about 16
volts<00:02:59.799> so<00:03:00.100> there's<00:03:00.370> definitely<00:03:00.730> something

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
volts so there's definitely something

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.180 
volts so there's definitely something
wrong<00:03:01.239> with<00:03:01.390> them<00:03:01.540> hopefully<00:03:02.500> once<00:03:02.950> I<00:03:03.010> put<00:03:03.160> my

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
wrong with them hopefully once I put my

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.000 
wrong with them hopefully once I put my
new<00:03:03.400> ones<00:03:03.580> in<00:03:03.730> all<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:03.970> problems<00:03:04.150> are<00:03:04.390> solved

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
of these connections back on that was

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
of these connections back on that was
pretty<00:04:08.120> easy<00:04:08.330> and<00:04:08.570> then<00:04:08.660> I<00:04:08.720> put<00:04:08.900> some

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
electrical tape over them too to protect

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.330 
electrical tape over them too to protect
their<00:04:10.940> connectors<00:04:11.410> so<00:04:12.410> before<00:04:12.770> I<00:04:12.800> put<00:04:12.890> all<00:04:13.310> of

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
this back together I want to test it to

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.060 
this back together I want to test it to
make<00:04:16.250> sure<00:04:16.430> it<00:04:16.730> works<00:04:16.959> so<00:04:17.959> I<00:04:17.989> put<00:04:18.470> one<00:04:18.890> of<00:04:18.980> the

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
make sure it works so I put one of the

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.370 
make sure it works so I put one of the
side<00:04:19.310> panels<00:04:19.730> on<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:20.090> one<00:04:20.269> with<00:04:20.450> the<00:04:20.690> power

side panels on the one with the power

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.240 
side panels on the one with the power
switch<00:04:21.680> so<00:04:22.670> let<00:04:22.790> me<00:04:22.850> flip<00:04:23.090> it<00:04:23.210> on<00:04:23.360> here

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
switch so let me flip it on here

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.500 
switch so let me flip it on here
okay<00:04:25.250> powers<00:04:25.610> on<00:04:25.790> let's<00:04:26.090> see<00:04:26.240> what<00:04:26.390> we're

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.230 
showing on the handlebar here okay it's
good<00:04:28.910> so<00:04:29.060> power<00:04:29.830> full<00:04:30.830> low<00:04:31.220> so<00:04:31.670> try<00:04:32.180> the

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
good so power full low so try the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:40.650 
good so power full low so try the
throttle<00:04:32.570> here<00:04:36.130> yep<00:04:37.130> looks<00:04:37.460> like<00:04:37.520> it<00:04:37.730> works

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.430 

it's<00:04:41.660> working<00:04:42.050> we<00:04:42.980> hit<00:04:43.130> the<00:04:43.250> brake<00:04:44.320> should<00:04:45.320> be

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
it's working we hit the brake should be

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.570 
it's working we hit the brake should be
a<00:04:45.470> low

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
a low

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.600 
a low
