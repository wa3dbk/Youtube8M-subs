00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
beginning at 44 an actor yeah I think

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.160 
beginning at 44 an actor yeah I think
that<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.310> life<00:01:09.520> of<00:01:09.610> an<00:01:09.759> actor<00:01:10.000> you<00:01:10.170> with

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
that in the life of an actor you with

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.080 
that in the life of an actor you with
each<00:01:11.320> year<00:01:11.679> with<00:01:11.890> each<00:01:12.039> passing<00:01:12.310> year<00:01:12.520> or<00:01:12.910> each

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
each year with each passing year or each

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.730 
each year with each passing year or each
passing<00:01:13.509> decade<00:01:13.630> if<00:01:13.929> you<00:01:14.020> have<00:01:14.200> survived<00:01:14.560> that

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
passing decade if you have survived that

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.160 
passing decade if you have survived that
long<00:01:14.890> then<00:01:15.550> you<00:01:16.090> play<00:01:16.450> roles<00:01:16.720> which<00:01:16.929> are<00:01:17.050> more

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
long then you play roles which are more

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.139 
long then you play roles which are more
commensurate<00:01:17.619> with<00:01:17.679> your<00:01:17.830> age<00:01:18.100> I<00:01:18.399> think<00:01:18.970> that

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
commensurate with your age I think that

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:20.820 
commensurate with your age I think that
a<00:01:19.179> lot<00:01:19.509> of<00:01:19.570> what<00:01:19.869> has<00:01:20.020> come<00:01:20.050> to<00:01:20.229> me<00:01:20.500> has<00:01:20.649> been

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
a lot of what has come to me has been

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.880 
a lot of what has come to me has been
just<00:01:21.580> that<00:01:21.729> is<00:01:22.720> that<00:01:23.020> I<00:01:23.050> can't<00:01:23.440> play<00:01:23.619> a<00:01:23.649> young

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
just that is that I can't play a young

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.770 
just that is that I can't play a young
man<00:01:24.100> anymore<00:01:24.130> so<00:01:25.350> rules<00:01:26.490> which<00:01:27.490> are<00:01:27.700> going<00:01:28.689> to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
man anymore so rules which are going to

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.130 
man anymore so rules which are going to
reflect<00:01:29.110> my<00:01:29.170> age<00:01:29.470> or<00:01:30.210> my<00:01:31.210> age<00:01:31.450> that<00:01:31.479> reflects<00:01:32.049> a

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
reflect my age or my age that reflects a

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.130 
reflect my age or my age that reflects a
particular<00:01:32.500> role<00:01:32.650> those<00:01:33.220> are<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.369> kind<00:01:33.610> of

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
particular role those are the kind of

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.920 
particular role those are the kind of
acts<00:01:35.140> that<00:01:35.350> I<00:01:35.470> do<00:01:36.420> obviously<00:01:37.420> there<00:01:37.570> is<00:01:37.689> a<00:01:37.720> lot

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
acts that I do obviously there is a lot

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.830 
acts that I do obviously there is a lot
more<00:01:37.960> variety<00:01:38.850> when<00:01:39.850> when<00:01:40.450> you're<00:01:40.570> at<00:01:40.689> this

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
more variety when when you're at this

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.840 
more variety when when you're at this
age<00:01:40.990> because<00:01:41.320> you're<00:01:41.560> not<00:01:42.310> in<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.579> leading

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
think that we would take a lot away from

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.100 
think that we would take a lot away from
our<00:04:52.070> audiences<00:04:52.639> intellect<00:04:53.120> if<00:04:53.570> we<00:04:53.810> were<00:04:53.930> to

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
our audiences intellect if we were to

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.350 
our audiences intellect if we were to
not<00:04:54.800> follow<00:04:55.070> this<00:04:55.340> routine<00:04:55.729> it<00:04:55.970> is<00:04:56.150> they<00:04:56.330> who

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
not follow this routine it is they who

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.110 
not follow this routine it is they who
decide<00:04:56.949> what<00:04:57.949> is<00:04:58.070> going<00:04:58.250> to<00:04:58.370> be<00:04:58.520> good<00:04:58.880> for<00:04:59.090> us

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
decide what is going to be good for us

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.439 
decide what is going to be good for us
what<00:04:59.419> is<00:04:59.539> going<00:04:59.720> to<00:04:59.780> be<00:04:59.900> bad<00:05:00.139> for<00:05:00.169> us<00:05:00.380> and<00:05:01.449> we

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
what is going to be bad for us and we

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.290 
what is going to be bad for us and we
must<00:05:02.660> respect<00:05:02.930> that<00:05:03.259> so<00:05:04.039> if<00:05:04.430> yes<00:05:04.880> we<00:05:05.090> made<00:05:05.270> a
