00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello to all today we're going 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.049
 talk about stakes well known minecraft 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.970
 good so I first want to be all to 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.469
 honesty was you even if it's a 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.950
 game that I love and play 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.960
 a lot 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.880
 I am deeply void 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.100
 I am very often afraid I do not dare 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.640
 go out at night I have trouble going in 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.260
 the caves I die without stopping actually 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.720
 I get killed by zombies and 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.880
 monsters of course that's obvious but 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.470
 I am also easily killed by 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.230
 holes is very violent 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.480
 a hole and I also like to kill myself 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.270
 all alone with cactus rise wary 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.550
 cactus good you'll understand I 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.350
 am not really a great adventurer 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.360
 there is a point that I really know 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.510
 very very well in minecraft it's the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.700
 villages added in the game since already 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.829
 a moment the villages of pnj are 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.340
 invited by beautiful gay kids 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.410
 with a big nose when I play my goal 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.260
 it is to find improvement and 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.790
 protect these villages I'm a little 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.260
 as the protector of big noses here 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.240
 because yes even if some are from 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.409
 big scammers others are proposing 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.549
 interesting exchanges 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.210
 and then I like them the main 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.340
 difficulty 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.409
 in addition to the fact that they are not very 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.500
 smart is to protect them every 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.000
 night against the covers for that my 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.950
 first advice is to put the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.560
 level terrain and fence your 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.450
 village like that the monsters rest 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.189
 blocked which also makes them more 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.070
 easy to kill since they do not care 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.140
 touch at the same place remember no 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.180
 to better illuminate your homes and 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.740
 paths why because as you 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.509
 know the zombies and the monsters 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.850
 appear where it is dark 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.860
 so if your village there are 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.439
 big dark areas the monsters 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.420
 can appear there development 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.850
 of a village depends on the number of doors 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.500
 for your villagers to reproduce it 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.049
 takes twice as doors 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.060
 villagers I therefore encourage you to 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.189
 put several doors to your buildings 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.159
 but be careful the double doors it does not 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.680
 doesnt it only counts as one if 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.080
 your village becomes a real 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.870
 very big iron angouleme will appear 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.390
 naturally he will protect the village 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.270
 but be careful if the villagers do not 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.110
 do not like they will break your mouth 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.810
 that's why you have to be nice 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.280
 with the villagers for them to 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.110
 what needs to be done is their 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.160
 give what they ask for and especially 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.600
 their last wants the most important if he 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.550
 is happy it makes small crosses 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.050
 green if he's not happy it makes 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.420
 small flashes this is particularly the case 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.890
 when you hit it the interest of 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.690
 villagers is that they offer you 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.370
 sometimes very rare objects 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.709
 with champion years we can have 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.020
 little like that and then the other benefit 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.360
 it feels less alone because 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.000
 technically apart from the monsters and the 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.870
 witches and there's not a lot of human 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.880
 in minecraft already that survive everything 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.950
 it's difficult to survive 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.550
 a village of morons it's even more 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.940
 complicated especially that very often they 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.760
 do stuff completely 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.610
 incomprehensible in fact these little 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.360
 buddies have a taste for risk to a point 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.850
 absolutely unimaginable so much so that there 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.540
 has things to never do or 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.430
 build in a village first of all 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.470
 elites and buildings in height or 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.310
 then buildings with a roof that is 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.930
 accessible 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.330
 do you really say that as soon as there will be a 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.890
 cliff a tower where something a little 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.690
 in height it will be crazy 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.000
 automatically on it but then 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.410
 automatically 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.170
 especially that in addition they are usually 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.989
 a little suicidal and have fun jumping 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.330
 in thoughts also always has good 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.310
 closed your fence if you leave a 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.100
 hole in five minutes 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.500
 they will all be outside 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.980
 but there is something really really 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.730
 really important to never install 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.160
 in a village one morning while I am 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.650
 walk quietly and gently in 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.240
 my village minecraft I realized 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.540
 I did not find Jean-Paul 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.800
 that frederic girl etienne and david 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.410
 could not be found 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.690
 but where was so past but villagers 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.950
 I found myself in a desert face 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:21.020
 what was going on I decided then with 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.420
 a lot of worry remaining in the 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.710
 nose earth using the portal that 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.840
 I had installed the day before 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:32.750
 and there how to say I think it has me 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.000
 completely traumatized I you 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.620
 also advise against putting cacti on 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.600
 inside your villages because 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.360
 the villagers are a bit like me they 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.710
 do not care about it automatically 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.930
 against I like to put around 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.120
 fences because I tell myself that it's done 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.210
 scared to zombies I surely do not have true 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.430
 but I find it pretty good I admit that 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.760
 the little advantages of the villages 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.420
 minecraft is the sound background that 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.420
 is sometimes a little 

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:06.669
 especially when for some unknown reason 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:09.789
 he did not care we found in the same 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.409
 room to protect the villages 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.119
 you can also make moats in 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.069
 washes for the waves to fall in 

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:18.009
 or even installed a tower for 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:21.179
 shoot at the bow but for that you have to 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:24.999
 know how to shoot the arc that does not be 

00:05:21.179 --> 00:05:26.919
 super naked after you can bring some 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:28.689
 cats inside and outside of 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.779
 your village why because they do 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:34.119
 run away from the creepers and then they are also 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:35.830
 super cute I think that's not 

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:40.449
 depended on me that there would be 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:42.399
 cats technically I find that more 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:44.409
 fun to settle in a village 

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:46.569
 already pre existing that it is in the 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:49.029
 desert in the plains but you can 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:51.639
 also create a village from the beginning thanks 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:53.709
 to village zombies we recognize them 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:57.369
 easily to their big noses sign 

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:58.119
 distinctive by throwing them a potion 

00:05:57.369 --> 00:06:00.729
 weakening 

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:03.729
 then a golden apple they will become 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:05.289
 real villagers after a while this 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:07.719
 which allows you to create villages 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.639
 in any good but also in 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:10.749
 caves 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.089
 I hope this little video 

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:15.459
 recap on the villages you 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:18.119
 I will tell you very soon for 

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:18.119
 other videos
