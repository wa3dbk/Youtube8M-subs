00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.030
 take out now to decorate last elba 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.450
 clear that now we are going to unite all the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.119
 Pistachio nuts ingredients the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.280

 teaspoon of clove and we mix very 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.810
 well once mixed the 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.080
 ingredients let's separate half and 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.970
 about half of all this with 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.509
 a butter brush not very well 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.509
 all 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.380
 and phyllo dough and place always is 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.000
 Butter 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.030
 the phyllo dough always makes me stay 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.840
 the always every layer by layer and here 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.630
 bent and edge and we repaint 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.420
 like the ones like bg a sheet 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.970
 have come out two layers let's make eight 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.730
 layers that we will therefore use 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.140
 four sheets of filo dough normally 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:22.379
 in the packages they come from 8 to 10 already 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.660
 where are we going to put the filling 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.900
 let's cut the surplus which 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.390
 get it is sharp knife 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.010
 but now here we have half of all 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.769
 the mixture of nuts that 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.319
 we had now let's go we put the 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.760
 half of the nuts and we're 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.349
 reserving the other half we continue 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.250
 putting layers but now let's put 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:46.280
 4 that is 2 sheets in the same way 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.760
 before 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.549
 I'm sorry we have four more layers 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.200
 where are we going to put a layer of 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.480
 nuts that we have 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.760
 and now we start with I'm going to put 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.530
 all the layers of phyllo dough you see 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.080
 on the fart for not wasting the no 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.480
 two more remain would be six layers 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.890
 instead of four if you are to spare 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.860
 you can also put it perfectly 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.220
 so as not to waste the pasta sheets 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.200
 fine 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.700
 well now that we have it already mounted 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.590
 before bringing to the oven we have to 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.360
 cut the nails I'll start you by 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.180
 half and now we're going to start 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.220
 cut to bite us and we will try to 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.950
 that are not so small 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.800
 once cut you know next 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.620
 we put the butters and again 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.380
 above and it is precarious 180 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.100
 degrees and now we put the environment around 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.100
 30 minutes 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.860
 While fresh from the oven as well as 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.900
 as it's hot we're going then this 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.239
 exercise although the syrup is already cold 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.239
 and now let's go 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.150
 and we had talked away but not 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.800
 we let it rest that is 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.960
 completely at room temperature 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.239
 so they can enjoy it and this is 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.040
 the cod of the sweet tree can not 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.940
