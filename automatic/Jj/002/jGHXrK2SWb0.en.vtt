00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.860 
so if you're developing DLC
simultaneously<00:03:44.519> in<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.640> timeline<00:03:45.150> with

simultaneously in the timeline with
parallel<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:46.950> game<00:03:47.130> then<00:03:47.850> you're<00:03:48.060> just

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
parallel to the game then you're just

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.780 
parallel to the game then you're just
trying<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.530> make<00:03:49.680> an<00:03:49.799> extra<00:03:50.010> $10<00:03:50.430> of<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:50.610> game

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
trying to make an extra $10 of the game

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.009 
trying to make an extra $10 of the game
if<00:03:51.000> games<00:03:51.690> need<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.500> be<00:03:52.620> more<00:03:52.830> expensive<00:03:53.190> to

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
if games need to be more expensive to

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.150 
if games need to be more expensive to
include<00:03:55.019> this<00:03:55.230> kind<00:03:55.440> of<00:03:55.590> stuff<00:03:55.739> in<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.010> game

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
include this kind of stuff in the game

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.729 
include this kind of stuff in the game
then<00:03:56.459> raise<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.850> price<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:58.049> makes<00:03:58.320> sense<00:03:58.530> I

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
then raise the price it makes sense I

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.590 
then raise the price it makes sense I
mean<00:03:58.769> inflation<00:03:59.580> these<00:04:00.150> games<00:04:00.420> are<00:04:00.540> getting

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
mean inflation these games are getting

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.479 
mean inflation these games are getting

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
make sense but they didn't so they think

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.250 
make sense but they didn't so they think
they<00:04:04.980> can<00:04:05.130> get<00:04:05.250> away<00:04:05.370> with<00:04:06.080> chopping<00:04:07.080> up<00:04:07.200> a

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.289 
they can get away with chopping up a
game<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:07.680> this<00:04:07.769> is<00:04:07.920> typical<00:04:08.519> of<00:04:08.610> EA<00:04:08.790> chopping
