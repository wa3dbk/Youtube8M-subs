00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 the seagate pillon everyone 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.279
 find for a new video ulg 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.830
 so in reality this video is rather 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.330
 old she has some almost a 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.469
 month and a half except that at the beginning the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.880
 first time I plots debate him in 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.620
 reality he 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.049
 she was stuck because of the music 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.100
 not free of rights of law and visited 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.150
 a good part I was a little garlic and 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.080
 then I do not realize that I 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.940
 I had not removed it so I 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.170
 decided to redo the sound is 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.310
 of bah shot here 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.660
 so here I start the part the map 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.970
 Kwinter 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.470
 and pollux so I do not care that he 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.960
 I know it's not all about us 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.859
 not an oversight not so much 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.390
 so I start quietly at my 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.030
 rents mcf a little later I laugh I 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.199
 cross a guy 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.309
 so I run him I run him 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:38.890
 apparently he still did not see me at that 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.020
 moment there 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.000
 and so after 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.260
 must I at this project shore that 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.380
 it was because I put a blow 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.940
 then 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.790
 then easily manage to have it and I 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.050
 do all my books 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.220
 we see there it was to prove that he 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.290
 assists simple to do and I do not 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.730
 works that plus there were some 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.700
 interesting coating stuff even though its 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.320
 own players 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.450
 suddenly a little later I return 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.980
 louis dollÃ© there I see that there are people 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.270
 so I'm pretty happy because it's 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.280
 what i want i 'm going to foil the fight 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.550
 and it seems to me to be a 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.159
 team chasing a guy is so after 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.719
 have looked a little more in detail 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.159
 I see that the team is composed of 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:14.359
 stickers and erwin ie a word 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.859
 of the 2000s and saw that I was in 

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:17.980
 again a moment when I was accused 

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:20.960
 38 hours of stuff 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.580
 I am excited a dream opportunity so 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.659
 I tried to enter the team I 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.590
 started to hit everyone i've 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.539
 touched in ruins 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.680
 I continued to put arrow arrow to people 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.540
 his success 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.130
 I continued to continue there I arrive at 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.140
 put an arrow on his heart he stands 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.490
 go back and then it's coming but 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.620
 he's totally so suddenly he's 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.380
 easy to beat 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.579
 then I always feel that way 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.079
 so I had to join the other two 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.680
 views that still remains erwin and and 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.899
 their targets 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.750
 I see them they are full middle and 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.659
 and then I start hitting their targets 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.070
 at lexos kraft 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.689
 and start to flee and so there I 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.979
 I'm getting lander win but he was 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.159
 so that means he has more 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.450
 from him 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.819
 and seeing that I know he's going to get around me 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.229
 I'm going back to you and then it was said 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.310
 so was the game starting at him but 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.290
 of an arrow and at the end of the second 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.750
 I can see him 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.060
 so that's already 2 out of 3 beat the 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.620
 team there is only one missing 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.450
 nobody and I would have won this epic 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.010
 fight 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.090
 to the games that quickly loses the stuff that 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.160
 can be the sword in doing such 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.870
 time that I forgot to m but it remains 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.860
 still a sword in dm what it takes 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.410
 remember as it is warm underfoot 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.340
 and I follow the combat combo combo he 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.370
 can do nothing 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.299
 and I'm going to defeat him 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.299
 still a beautiful island 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.080
 and there we meet again much later 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.790
 meanwhile it not happen in two 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.650
 but that remained only two 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.180
 people and then I 'm trying to 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.830
 look for them at the mountain level 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.810
 because I thought to myself that they would be 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.580
 who might have seen that I had 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.880
 I had already gone around the forest 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.800
 so maybe it's here and 20h09 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.599
 approached I see the pseudo so 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.010
 it's a team it does not matter a 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.330
 amazement that I am that I really 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.180
 the advantage level stuff at this stage 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.680
 of the game I'm crazy said m 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.420
 while he probably does not have to be 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.440
 that apparently yes 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.420
 already to play the little ones had me 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.860
 already share the stuff that wants 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.390
 to say that they are less well stuff and 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.190
 this is the case no I start at them 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.650
 send arrows and there I come to 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.910
 touch several times and it starts to 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.560
 do so silly so suddenly a 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.740
 small arrow well placed and then he is 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.390
 dead woman 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.830
 and the second I put an arrow 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.610
 they steal they are wrong about 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.410
 damage due to the fall 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.880
 I want to continue the pursuit I try 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.390
 to him arrows but that 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.620
 at men's 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.330
 he a little bit away from me and there he stands 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.430
 go back next step and may 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.430
 it will as well the number Algeria 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.430
 the game is won 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.700
 here's the second part happening 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.700
 in my skin 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.739
 so I start quietly 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.709
 buses are full there are plenty of people 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.540
 it's normal and then it starts so he 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.470
 are air bubbles bucaille 2 the 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.110
 mono masks that also have to be 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.209
 together it's walfer crisis there are 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.500
 Bulgarian so they decided that if I 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.970
 croisais it would make a beautiful fight modo 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.079
 robidas cost so dance like I 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.049
 starts to find a lot of stuff 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.840
 it's huge for a start it 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.090
 the guardian it's just fake james so 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.260
 I kill you the advances and I see to my 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.280
 command the pyramid is a guy who 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.710
 goes up I tell you he 's having a 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.030
 fight and apparently it's actually the 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.979
 team of motorbikes and bikes crisis and wolf 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.990
 so I decide to attack them for 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.820
 mission because it's the game so 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.139
 started to attack wallpaper diam's him 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.400
 more then then the richard look 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.440
 and want to beat easily thanks to my 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.620
 sword I'm eating a golden apple I 'm getting 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.160
 Reattach quite a lot and I finish 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.160
 effect to serious this collar 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.860
 the wild turkey six days not and he 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.169
 wanted to go bankrupt and then I 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.040
 2've Nickel 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.690
 a little later I see someone 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.820
 I see someone and I seeing that I have 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.140
 jihadists offers eight ways I will be 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.240
 still the latex attacked the tec 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.320
 I always rely on the car like that 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.750
 it puts me almost no blow and 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.390
 watch him beat him 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.660
 these faults he was following lozÃ¨re 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.310
 and actually and their reasons 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.729
 I'm really great stuff like he 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.169
 mean in a few seconds 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.580
 it's really lucky to find 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.210
 a pair diem this beginning as well as the 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.210
 rest of the staff I have 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.890
 a little bit later I meet a guy 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.289
 I am your poor only to know 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.689
 play the guys 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.489
 and look at my apology lol 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:30.229
 so here it is a kit more and then 

00:05:28.489 --> 00:05:34.409
 so here is more than two 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.710
 people study those game games 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:37.120
 so suddenly 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.850
 I look for to search the night 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.610
 fell I find them it's a team is 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.050
 so the fight launched I have some good stuff 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:47.200
 eat a golden apple and it's gone 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.490
 the first person to arrive 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.729
 and the fight 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.169
 and I'm still coming 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.520
 to the way relatively easily and my 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.409
 little more than mr blood rocks and 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.569
 I manage to get around it and get around it 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:00.860
 understands nothing and I deny them he and 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:02.240
 here 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.840
 so two body parts were pretty 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.729
 nice all the accountants the fines at 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.819
 kilo start since 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:11.809
 in both parts I kill motorcycles 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:15.139
 finally a team of words each 

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:15.800
 end of the staff and so suddenly it 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.900
 is a beautiful part 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.300
 here I hope the video will have you 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.469
 more so there would be a lot of action 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.050
 my body my tahrir were maybe 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:25.189
 not great but it's because it's hard 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.270
 of posts you will make a video like 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:30.189
 especially because it is severe and so 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.189
 here we go hi to all
