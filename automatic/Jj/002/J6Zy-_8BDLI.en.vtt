00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.880
 hello girls in today's video we're going to 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.700
 Learn how to create a wax for your 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.330
 eyebrows to make them look super cool 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.369
 this wax is very very easy to make the 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.220
 You really only need a shady 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.710
 of the color you want to paint your eyebrow and 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.869
 a little bit of the base of 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.909
 makeup that you use 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.470
 I had seen that water is made 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:30.720
 do not really try water and the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.759
 result was frightening then I 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.489
 I only did it with these two things the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.490
 I was really impressed because I 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.800
 he paints his eyebrows in a very beautiful way 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.960
 I painted it a very light color 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.970
 because the combinations that I used 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.640
 they were to make it clear that 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.720
 it looked so strong or so exaggerated 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.840
 I wanted something more natural and you take 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:59.040
 nice you know I told them that I liked it 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.320
 much the sidewalk because despite 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.820
 have the street several times do not run 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.860
 and it lasted all day impeccable and if girls 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.020
 I hope you like them this 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.420

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.680

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.180
