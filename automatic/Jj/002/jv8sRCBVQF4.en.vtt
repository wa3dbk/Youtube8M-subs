00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.340
 we are fed on this somewhere in between so about feyenoord by the way was a 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.710
 controversial gig 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.920
 hopefully consultations about the first game will still be discussed and there are 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.029
 Editors 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:15.819
 However, there were broadcasters that didn't make anything but then nothing 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:17.869
 on full support 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.060
 part of the ring last night 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.279
 moving images 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.279
 I had that incident that turned out surprisingly on Wednesday 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.300
 it was found some broadcasters get years 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:30.269
 not at all 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.100
 still come 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.770
 absolutely that man who 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.480
 had to get rid of the channel 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.450
 and they never had to go back 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.670
 Broadcasters not at all like everyone else 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.100
 suggested 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.610
 the TV or radio spoke the shame of decline very nice broadcasters 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.740
 herdgang condoms received with a leaf 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.800
 and with the champagne taste and a cap 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.540
 where still a taste 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.000
 and he wanted to test in it 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.320
 but the way there he also called the Palestinians after such an escort agency 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.460
 step to hear that lady 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.510
 we have we are good at taking oral exams 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.189
 was on the radio and that makes it fantastic in Halle Vilvoorde 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.450
 important questions and is in that of her new soldiers and I would like one 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.150
 trader put into service 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.899
 real has had a few years in an email 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.249
 I don't know how I've never done it I have no idea how we do that 

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:30.640
 then know via email 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.940
 the ret got into a fight over a driver's license 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.600
 you could do the studio 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.730
 as your partner gaal 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.880
 and that shows a long traffic jam on the radio there lately 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.250
 and I know I spoke to him I believe three hours before the game was around three 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.570
 one very late hour 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.380
 I say I will go with it 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.280
 a little nervous 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.180
 he reads you know why 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.320
 a 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.160
 I don't understand 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.550
 and third hit 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.820
 and then I hear it again 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.640
 and you 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.970
 the 2 years 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.369
 he did 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.789
 that is sitting down and by hand 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.009
 it's the first to do incredible people who already have the 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.089
 final 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:19.529
 I didn't think I was in the studio of course to do a very special job 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:21.089
 state 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:25.149
 this year anyway a little fresh are all interest at the moment that's one 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:28.079
 Quarter to 3 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.769
 raised in a nearby hospital, completely cared for pipe is empty 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.539
 has since been leaked 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:35.189
 the decision taken 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.189
 called my work yesterday 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:41.649
 I think it's a joke the beer for members 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:44.729
 the death toll is still heading for the gas to go straight the faster 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:46.899
 for years 

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:48.119
 work 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:50.049
 when I arrived here 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.049
 fantastic 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.359
 k 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.759
 up to now all the yard had been propped on the radio in the Netherlands 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:09.819
 but that is something he starts from his own this she will not do 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.229
 so that the radio also helped and went much further 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:17.699
 and then who himself will go into real life 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.119
 everything that happens there 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:22.619
 he didn't come up with anything 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:26.349
 And of course and just like in life you never know exactly what is going on 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:27.289
 to happen 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:29.749
 but creates 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:33.079
 the constant giving he creates a situation 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:36.369
 he controls someone else 

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:38.399
 confrontation 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:41.419
 and he thought about it very well 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.109
 Did you think in advance what he would want to do with it? 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.599
 but then he could let go so quickly 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.689
 It is not the size of the red 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:53.670
 a three-point dollar, no reason to spend seven hours in the tent is great 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.229
 called 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:56.670
 have the jury 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.240
 one of them too 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.310
 I have left a full-fledged you must be the legislator like a breath of fresh air 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:03.749
 employees also at six o'clock 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:06.909
 not to happen but we know that of course 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.729
 the school decided with an eye on 

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:11.259
 maybe wanted 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:12.679
 in the text 

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:16.119
 and now she figured out what is in bed wagonists are talking about 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.789
 and that was the only reason for me to do that 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.229
 year nice day you can shop should you like what I found whole 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:23.900
 world 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.480
 the key word fÃ©lix murga sekera I used to do so many good things in the past 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:28.280
 what about it 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.710
 not really a bit better than for the radio 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.020
 but he really did it
