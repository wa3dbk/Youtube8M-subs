00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
out a little bit now once again you can

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.090 
out a little bit now once again you can
actually<00:01:27.390> see<00:01:27.810> them<00:01:28.020> I'm<00:01:28.409> gonna<00:01:28.680> figure<00:01:28.950> out

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
actually see them I'm gonna figure out

try<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:33.990> figure<00:01:34.200> out<00:01:34.320> which<00:01:34.590> one<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.860> these

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
try and figure out which one of these

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.340 
try and figure out which one of these
was<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.490> letter<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.329> think<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.200> waved

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350
