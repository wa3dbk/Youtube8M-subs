couple of guilty-pleasure Harry Potter

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.130

nemesis Draco means dragon and I think

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.219

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:34.260 
it's really cool but I would never use
it<00:06:32.440> because<00:06:32.620> it's<00:06:33.520> going<00:06:33.850> to<00:06:33.940> be<00:06:34.030> associated

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.270 
it because it's going to be associated

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.330 
it because it's going to be associated
with<00:06:34.690> Draco<00:06:35.050> Malfoy<00:06:35.500> for<00:06:35.560> a<00:06:35.770> long<00:06:35.979> time<00:06:36.310> I
