00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.410
 hello friends and welcome to another tuto 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:17.830
 Tuesday llosa leonardo pÃ©rez grandson and today 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.529
 let's draw a hare with strokes 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.529
 loose we start flipping the shape 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.690
 I'm doing it with a pencil 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.869
 white on a black paper of those 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:32.230
 preparations that are called scratch like 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:36.220
 scratch since we have the slap shape 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.280
 we review them we correct it and we give it 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.590
 details 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.760
 the head takes a more or less shape 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.480
 so we make the nose the eye 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.730
 etc 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.610
 at the beginning I was drawing very 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.750
 Now I'm pressing a little bit 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.050
 plus 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.060
 I think the ears were left 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.340
 too large will trim a the 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.190
 little bit 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.790
 with the moldable eraser clarified all the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.280
 stroke so you can barely see this is 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.130
 actually a white paper painted from 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.920
 black then and we scrape the paint 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.590
 black with a punch or with any 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.130
 metallic tip let's discover the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.910
 white on each line that we do well 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.070
 here we start to scrape with the pulse 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.800
 this technique does not allow you to erase if you 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.390
 you wrong that's why the first is the stroke 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.479
 with white pencil 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.870
 based on small lines we are taking out 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.659
 the lights here we are drawing in 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.990
 negative instead of putting the shadows 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.090
 we put the lights 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:49.539
 already begins to give a very special effect 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.090
 we are doing it little by little and 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.780
 be necessary we go back and increase the 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.390
 intensity 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.040
 remember that the fur is not totally 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.590
 uniform but there is tuft quoted 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.310
 carefully we make the whiskers that 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.750
 obviously they will be white 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.349
 well the whiskers on the other side and a little 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.080
 more than light on the face this thing that is 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.390
 funny 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.820
 I want the left side to have a little 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.819
 more than light therefore we do more 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.660
 hairline 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.360
 all right 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.680
 when sitting the hind leg will go 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.110
 around here and those ahead 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.140
 Y 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.530
 we give a little more detail to the 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.530
 ears 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.770
 I want you to curve in the 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.960
 illuminate more on the sides 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.660
 the center of the one in front is 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:51.340
 obviously jealous 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.520
 we give you the final details and ready 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.010
