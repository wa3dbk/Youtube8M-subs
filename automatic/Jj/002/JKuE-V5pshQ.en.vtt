nirvana

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.499 
nirvana
I<00:04:44.270> think<00:04:44.660> Nirvana<00:04:44.960> was<00:04:45.169> real

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.870 
I think Nirvana was real
definitely<00:04:47.509> one<00:04:47.990> of<00:04:48.020> the<00:04:48.229> 90s<00:04:48.650> groups<00:04:48.979> I<00:04:49.340> think

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
definitely one of the 90s groups I think

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.550 
definitely one of the 90s groups I think
they<00:04:50.270> were<00:04:50.330> just<00:04:50.569> a<00:04:50.780> big<00:04:50.960> influence<00:04:51.259> on<00:04:51.500> a
