00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
it easier to sell short the bombs

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.440 
it easier to sell short the bombs
because<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.799> other<00:01:40.920> words<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.640> sell<00:01:42.180> short

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
because in other words to sell short

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.560 
because in other words to sell short
bonds<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.649> need<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.189> have<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.970> float<00:01:45.210> has<00:01:45.420> to

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
bonds you need to have the float has to

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.499 
bonds you need to have the float has to
be<00:01:45.720> sufficient<00:01:46.229> enough<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.799> effectively

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
be sufficient enough to effectively

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.510 
be sufficient enough to effectively
attack<00:01:48.509> using<00:01:49.290> short<00:01:49.710> sales<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.189> make<00:01:50.399> it

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
attack using short sales and make it

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.719 
attack using short sales and make it
short<00:01:50.759> sales<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.689> by<00:01:51.869> floating<00:01:52.290> this

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
short sales so by floating this

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.420 
short sales so by floating this
increased<00:01:53.729> cost<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.350> bonds<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.799> makes<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.399> that

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
increased cost of bonds it makes it that

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.920 
increased cost of bonds it makes it that
much<00:01:56.729> easier<00:01:56.790> because<00:01:57.270> remember<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.750> Greek

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
much easier because remember the Greek

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.679 
much easier because remember the Greek
economy<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.500> not<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.799> big<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.329> order<00:02:00.540> for

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
economy is not that big so in order for

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.959 
economy is not that big so in order for
the<00:02:01.170> large<00:02:01.409> hedge<00:02:01.680> funds<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.369> really<00:02:02.700> to

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
the large hedge funds to really to

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.550 
the large hedge funds to really to
attack<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.479> sufficiently<00:02:04.020> there<00:02:04.200> has<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.439> be<00:02:04.500> a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
attack it sufficiently there has to be a
