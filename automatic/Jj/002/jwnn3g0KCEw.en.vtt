00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
start adamantium in him and like blades

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.009 
start adamantium in him and like blades
came<00:04:10.040> out<00:04:10.250> which<00:04:11.239> doesn't<00:04:11.690> really<00:04:11.750> make<00:04:11.959> any

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
came out which doesn't really make any

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.839 
came out which doesn't really make any
sense<00:04:12.500> because<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:12.919> reason<00:04:13.099> Wolverine<00:04:13.669> has

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
sense because the reason Wolverine has

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.949 
sense because the reason Wolverine has
blades<00:04:14.239> is<00:04:15.039> because<00:04:16.039> it's<00:04:16.250> part<00:04:16.489> of<00:04:16.549> his<00:04:16.700> a

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
blades is because it's part of his a

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.969 
blades is because it's part of his a
mutation<00:04:17.959> out<00:04:18.049> of<00:04:18.200> three<00:04:18.380> blades<00:04:18.650> and<00:04:18.919> they

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
mutation out of three blades and they

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:19.539 
mutation out of three blades and they
get<00:04:19.130> cut

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
get cut

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.670 
get cut
battle<00:04:19.819> but<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.269> don't<00:04:20.599> know<00:04:20.690> they<00:04:21.289> took<00:04:21.470> some

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
battle but I don't know they took some

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.879 
battle but I don't know they took some
his<00:04:21.799> DNA<00:04:22.190> but<00:04:23.199> assumed<00:04:24.199> it<00:04:24.560> would<00:04:24.650> just<00:04:24.770> take

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
his DNA but assumed it would just take

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.140 
his DNA but assumed it would just take
the<00:04:25.099> hill<00:04:25.280> of<00:04:25.370> fact<00:04:25.550> you're<00:04:25.729> not<00:04:25.759> the<00:04:26.000> bone

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
the hill of fact you're not the bone

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.800 
the hill of fact you're not the bone
part<00:04:26.509> right<00:04:26.659> there<00:04:27.879> anyway<00:04:28.879> he's<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.470> he's<00:04:30.470> a

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
part right there anyway he's a he's a

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.140 
part right there anyway he's a he's a
pool<00:04:32.810> of<00:04:32.840> different<00:04:33.620> powers<00:04:34.009> and<00:04:34.550> just

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
pool of different powers and just

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.510 
pool of different powers and just
ridiculous<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:35.990> I<00:04:36.139> and<00:04:36.409> really<00:04:37.129> that's<00:04:37.280> not

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
ridiculous and I and really that's not

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.659 
ridiculous and I and really that's not

even everything transmitted via it
doesn't<00:04:41.389> it<00:04:41.569> doesn't<00:04:41.690> fit<00:04:42.289> in<00:04:42.530> to<00:04:43.340> even<00:04:43.699> the<00:04:43.729> it

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
in his brain why did professor egg see

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.050 
in his brain why did professor egg see
that<00:05:07.969> but<00:05:08.870> uh<00:05:09.159> but<00:05:10.159> I<00:05:10.219> understand<00:05:10.759> why<00:05:10.879> they

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
that but uh but I understand why they

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.200 
that but uh but I understand why they
didn't<00:05:11.330> know<00:05:12.490> that<00:05:13.490> nobody<00:05:13.879> knew<00:05:13.969> there<00:05:14.120> was

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
didn't know that nobody knew there was

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.909 
didn't know that nobody knew there was
like<00:05:14.360> a<00:05:14.389> hole<00:05:14.750> right<00:05:14.780> there<00:05:15.020> and<00:05:15.469> his<00:05:15.560> head<00:05:15.770> is

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
like a hole right there and his head is

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.439 
like a hole right there and his head is
one<00:05:16.129> eye<00:05:16.280> because<00:05:16.580> it<00:05:16.610> had<00:05:16.729> have<00:05:17.030> gone<00:05:17.210> through

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
one eye because it had have gone through

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.089 
one eye because it had have gone through
the<00:05:17.509> bone<00:05:17.690> and<00:05:17.990> maybe<00:05:18.289> the<00:05:18.440> bone<00:05:18.620> could<00:05:18.830> heal

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
the bone and maybe the bone could heal

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:21.189 
the bone and maybe the bone could heal
but<00:05:19.250> it<00:05:19.400> still<00:05:19.639> was<00:05:19.789> a<00:05:19.819> metal<00:05:20.180> out<00:05:20.270> there<00:05:20.509> so<00:05:20.750> so

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
but it still was a metal out there so so

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:24.899 
but it still was a metal out there so so
vulnerable<00:05:22.069> spot<00:05:22.599> which<00:05:23.599> doesn't<00:05:24.050> really

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
vulnerable spot which doesn't really

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:27.719 
vulnerable spot which doesn't really
make<00:05:25.909> sense<00:05:25.969> if<00:05:26.389> you<00:05:26.449> think<00:05:26.479> about<00:05:26.779> it<00:05:26.960> because

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
make sense if you think about it because

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:29.860 
make sense if you think about it because
even<00:05:28.729> a<00:05:28.789> part<00:05:29.029> through<00:05:29.300> that<00:05:29.479> thing<00:05:29.659> with<00:05:29.840> the

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
even a part through that thing with the

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.330 
even a part through that thing with the
where<00:05:30.500> he<00:05:30.590> was<00:05:30.710> walking<00:05:30.889> about<00:05:31.039> to<00:05:31.190> Jean

x-men 1 what the hell happened did did
he<00:05:59.690> did<00:06:00.379> his<00:06:00.529> mutation<00:06:00.919> get<00:06:01.250> worse<00:06:01.430> like<00:06:01.669> bees

he did his mutation get worse like bees
that's<00:06:02.330> that's<00:06:02.629> something<00:06:02.990> that's<00:06:03.169> a<00:06:03.319> logical

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
that's that's something that's a logical

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.300 
that's that's something that's a logical
thing<00:06:03.979> i<00:06:04.099> can<00:06:04.279> assume<00:06:05.289> but<00:06:06.289> it<00:06:06.469> was<00:06:06.590> ridiculous

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
thing i can assume but it was ridiculous

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.439 
thing i can assume but it was ridiculous
and<00:06:07.729> and<00:06:08.719> i<00:06:09.409> didn't<00:06:10.400> like<00:06:10.430> that<00:06:10.759> part<00:06:11.060> all<00:06:11.270> in

and and i didn't like that part all in
and<00:06:11.690> I<00:06:12.139> kind<00:06:12.409> of<00:06:12.500> felt<00:06:12.710> like<00:06:12.770> a<00:06:12.889> lot<00:06:13.159> of
