00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 Hello everyone today I want to talk about 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.529
 bait who already catch a very long time 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.110
 probably the very moment of her appearance in 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.540
 which there is a certain magic this 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.949
 lure from very well known 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:21.720
 Firm lucky john which is called 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:24.000
 from the beginning of the usa let's go for some 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.269
 specifications as I have 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.160
 said this bait is called and the united states 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.900
 produced on i think known on 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.210
 this moment to many spinning 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.320
 company lucky john and represents from 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.520
 yourself here is such a worm or even 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:45.420
 leech and as far as I remember she is 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.090
 copy whether Raines tule key 3 whether 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.690
 In general, chocolate is not so important 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.980
 Thought it is produced in different sizes 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:58.469
 as far as I remember 2 and 8 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.570
 well and accordingly 3:08 this year in 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.930
 shad family has been replenished and 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.250
 additional varieties appeared 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.820
 which are called with gave means 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.290
 what did you eat it on the tail 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.390
 so i am 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.080
 I do not know how much it is justified and necessary 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.360
 but nevertheless , such 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.880
 modification I already bought myself not 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.390
 I resist and bought myself in carrot color 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.229
 and by the way I caught a carrot 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.030
 pike perch now you see the photo itself 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.350
 interesting from the cap demanding 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.650
 winding like other servants 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.130
 he needs special pod equipment 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.490
 friends sho 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.930
 and bypass well and the like you understand 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.390
 although it may be on them of course at the console 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.030
 to work at times better but I'm on it 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.670
 I catch just a banal step without 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.649
 any frills excesses it is clear that 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.869
 I vary the wiring 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.840
 there are no active elements 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.540
 so it seems that on the classic 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.700
 jig it is not as effective but 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.320
 practice suggests otherwise I promised 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.430
 tell what the magicians of this bait 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.290
 yes figs knows him 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.259
 she just catches and sometimes heads like that 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.870
 Well that log Japanese kulik not believe 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.940
 google many on 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.250
 many people on the internet confirm this 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.980
 And also, in general, it is unclear why this 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.640
 happens bought her more for the sake of interest 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.500
 because of the low price in general, then immediately 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.540
 tried set and lure literally 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.480
 from the first casts of sleep showed that on 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.640
 workers began to catch and I have it 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.670
 would be on a subconscious list 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.370
 some kind of suspiciously catchy future 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.379
 I, too, and in general not often put in 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.450
 mostly only on asset science minus 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:45.410
 Aim at the fact that perches and lives well 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.900
 but no tears on the heels of the tail when he 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.239
 active you know that heels threes 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.390
 strong enough here there is no heel and 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.069
 accordingly, there is no problem but take a look 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.849
 on this bait with somewhat under another 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.340
 by the corner 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.599
 I made father cases when we 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.549
 were fishing with him 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.409
 my father is very conservative 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.840
 spinning fishing spinning 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.609
 leaves in about a year and this time 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.129
 He catches on proven if fights on 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.650
 proven turntables well that's fishing time 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.540
 almost no fish 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:19.669
 refused to take anything at all 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:21.829
 small fluff dad pecked at the phone father 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:23.900
 I saw and you asked to put it 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.630
 silicone him silicone bait and 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.579
 explain the basis of jig wiring what 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.209
 I actually did not know the reason 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:34.069
 legs caught me and shot and 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.829
 actually his father began to catch him 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.340
 literally from the very first casting I started 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.120
 fall behind 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:44.959
 play it rush while i'm so 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.720
 say thought how to catch a woman 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.849
 how he tried to find analogues 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.549
 from usa to some kind of japanese bait 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:55.879
 different sorrows want to be far gone 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:59.510
 in the gap that as a result of our unspoken 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:02.269
 the competition ended so that the father 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.480
 the end of the fishing was three very protective 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:08.299
 pike rsa and a bunch of, let's say so a dozen 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.299
 perch I will decide to set only 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.299
 near the end you managed to just a little bit 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:16.370
 wrestle here I really don't know why but 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:18.739
 other bait that day fish 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.440
 for some reason refused to take although I 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.599
 left the google google shakers about 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.080
 something like maybe from what was 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:30.050
 but the tears would still it's the United States 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.650
 became like a number one bait on that 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.750
 fishing 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.240
 the next story happened already in this 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.219
 year comrade asked to advise him 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.130
 any good inexpensive catchy 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:41.139
 bait since those angles are needed I catches in 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.450
 general, without a twinge of conscience 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:47.300
 advised him with a shot now and from this 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:50.330
 Comrade periodically receive feedback from 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.820
 This bait is literally just 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.250
 happened this year after melting ice 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.360
 immediately was fishing called and said 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:01.219
 listen i have been swimming all day today 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.599
 no reciprocity from the fish did not achieve 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:06.020
 one that is all was silent 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:09.260
 already wanted to swim out set and reel 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.779
 in my opinion in green bright green 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.539
 acid color and burning began to peck 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:17.300
 small perch and says caught a few 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:19.070
 tails in general bites were evil and to 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.099
 this in the same place that is in this 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:25.250
 water area geon there barked at the rest 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:27.349
 fish bait was silent in particular in 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.900
 the courts well and the last story which 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:32.120
 happened just a couple of weeks ago 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.340
 was fishing with an eye on a perch like 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.830
 in such cases, perch well, bad 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.320
 responded 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.360
 fishing was extremely labor accounted for 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.180
 swim a lot with a point 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.280
 either did not work or did not work well than 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.620
 I was even going to fish out phoning 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.710
 the same friend who was fishing in 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.020
 another place and said so and so 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.060
 again you have worked 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.400
 why everything is checked and his favorite is not 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.470
 the shade works I also remembered that 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.080
 I have it and decided to put 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.080
 try and find well I sure 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.870
 no beautiful started 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.970
 actually the video was that with this 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.630
 fishing you saw at the beginning of the movie but 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.600
 not less 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:16.120
 Okushok began peck much more cheerful 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.160
 respond and in general I was still late 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.910
 somewhere for an hour and a half fishing and well 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.990
 let's say so little but caught that is with 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:28.360
 shot allowed to increase efficiency 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.940
 let's say fishing at the moment 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.920
 and if I still enjoyed the flood 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.710
 snap and would put at that moment 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:38.080
 its on tap or carolina I think that 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.540
 could in principle be considered this 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:44.530
 fishing day even well but by 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:46.480
 at least I assume that the review 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.420
 time to finish apologize a little bit 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.790
 I started talking like a conclusion I want to say 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.920
 what's the price quality of this bait on my 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:57.460
 the look is on a very, very 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:00.040
 a good level out of my wife’s personal experience 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.870
 three seasons of catching her shows that 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.240
 the bait is quite effective by 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.780
 least i can safely without some 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.670
 conceit to recommend her 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.450
 try and i think that you won't 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.810
 disappointed 

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:16.270
 if anything happens you can google and 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:19.750
 as I said, I recall very, very 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:21.340
 many people have a very good, well 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.410
 I hope this review was useful to you 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:26.460
 Thanks for attention 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:28.690
 fingers up with fingers down 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:31.180
 I will be pleased to subscribe 

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:35.280
 see works will be happy to see new people 

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.280
 see you soon bye
