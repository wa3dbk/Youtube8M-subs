me<00:05:02.279> to<00:05:02.520> this<00:05:02.939> is<00:05:03.120> really<00:05:03.330> hard<00:05:03.599> guys<00:05:03.900> my<00:05:04.770> theory

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
me to this is really hard guys my theory

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.790 
me to this is really hard guys my theory
is<00:05:05.189> the<00:05:05.669> last<00:05:05.909> NCS<00:05:06.539> group<00:05:06.900> that<00:05:07.199> did<00:05:07.379> this<00:05:07.560> and

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
is the last NCS group that did this and

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.339 
is the last NCS group that did this and
found<00:05:08.009> the<00:05:08.129> geocache<00:05:08.370> has<00:05:09.360> now<00:05:09.599> hidden<00:05:09.900> in<00:05:10.139> a

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
found the geocache has now hidden in a

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:12.260 
found the geocache has now hidden in a
really<00:05:10.590> difficult<00:05:10.860> like<00:05:11.729> under<00:05:11.969> lives<00:05:12.150> and

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
really difficult like under lives and

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.879 
really difficult like under lives and
leaves<00:05:12.389> or<00:05:12.599> something<00:05:12.900> I<00:05:13.110> just<00:05:13.469> want<00:05:13.620> to<00:05:13.650> find
