 once a minute 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.420
 and we've also found ham I think I still have it 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.000
 of something that it really is 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.520
 really really good 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.930
 Let's see what I'm doing or is already a black hole in 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.660
 the Wall 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.050

 are already huge women that is really the madness of this world 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.060
 just really use kind of thought and do not destroy it 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.650
 I installed everything myself 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.650

 of course also make big windows in our huge house 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.569
