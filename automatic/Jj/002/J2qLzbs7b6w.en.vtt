throughout<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.280> building<00:02:06.400> in<00:02:07.180> all<00:02:07.390> honestly

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
throughout the building in all honestly

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.650 
throughout the building in all honestly
the<00:02:07.960> organization<00:02:08.710> truly<00:02:09.130> is<00:02:09.220> unique<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:09.880> if

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
the organization truly is unique and if

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.840 
the organization truly is unique and if
you<00:02:10.840> take<00:02:11.110> that<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:11.800> layer<00:02:12.130> it<00:02:12.160> over<00:02:12.430> the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
you take that and you layer it over the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.300 
you take that and you layer it over the
notion<00:02:13.240> that<00:02:13.360> there<00:02:13.570> was<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.870> vision<00:02:14.380> to<00:02:15.160> do<00:02:15.280> a

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
notion that there was the vision to do a

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.130 
notion that there was the vision to do a
project<00:02:15.640> like<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.090> where<00:02:16.600> you<00:02:16.630> started

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
project like this where you started

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.070 
project like this where you started
early<00:02:17.590> enough<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:18.790> build<00:02:19.180> your<00:02:19.450> own<00:02:19.510> building

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
early enough to build your own building

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.030 
early enough to build your own building
to<00:02:20.770> have<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.910> designed<00:02:22.600> specifically<00:02:23.500> for<00:02:23.650> you

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
to have it designed specifically for you

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.400 
to have it designed specifically for you
we<00:02:24.670> first<00:02:25.510> introduced<00:02:25.870> this<00:02:25.960> idea<00:02:26.110> of

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
we first introduced this idea of

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.870 
we first introduced this idea of
connecting<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:27.040> indoors<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.520> outdoors

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
connecting the indoors and the outdoors

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.420 
connecting the indoors and the outdoors
at<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.570> ground<00:02:28.870> plane<00:02:29.440> level<00:02:29.890> with<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.220> water

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
at the ground plane level with the water

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.950 
at the ground plane level with the water
you<00:02:30.910> have<00:02:31.000> this<00:02:31.090> water<00:02:31.360> feature<00:02:31.660> which

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
you have this water feature which

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.170 
you have this water feature which
extends<00:02:32.680> visually<00:02:33.190> through<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:33.550> glass<00:02:33.790> into

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
extends visually through the glass into

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.230 
extends visually through the glass into
the<00:02:34.930> park<00:02:35.200> from<00:02:35.470> inside<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.100> building<00:02:36.280> then

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
the park from inside the building then

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.180 
the park from inside the building then
as<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:37.450> go<00:02:37.570> up<00:02:37.600> inside<00:02:37.960> the<00:02:38.140> building<00:02:38.560> we

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
as you go up inside the building we

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.460 
as you go up inside the building we
continue<00:02:39.970> this<00:02:40.090> idea<00:02:40.510> in<00:02:40.960> several<00:02:41.350> places

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
continue this idea in several places

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.470 
continue this idea in several places
wherever<00:02:42.130> we<00:02:42.400> have<00:02:42.520> open<00:02:42.640> spaces<00:02:43.150> because<00:02:43.390> a

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
wherever we have open spaces because a

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.150 
wherever we have open spaces because a
very<00:02:43.690> strong<00:02:43.930> sense<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.320> continuity<00:02:44.680> from

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
very strong sense of continuity from

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.030 
very strong sense of continuity from
outdoors<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.790> indoors<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:47.230> wasn't<00:02:47.620> is<00:02:47.740> it<00:02:47.920> the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
outdoors to indoors it wasn't is it the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.740 
outdoors to indoors it wasn't is it the
culture<00:02:48.400> has<00:02:48.550> your<00:02:48.700> ship<00:02:48.880> we<00:02:49.120> simply<00:02:49.390> needed

to<00:02:49.990> design<00:02:50.500> space<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.340> reflected<00:02:52.150> the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
to design space that reflected the

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.580 
to design space that reflected the
culture<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.810> culture<00:02:53.230> is<00:02:53.380> very

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
buildings which is a members lounge we

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.530 
buildings which is a members lounge we
felt<00:03:23.020> it<00:03:23.350> would<00:03:23.440> be<00:03:23.500> good<00:03:23.800> both<00:03:24.130> for<00:03:24.190> AMC<00:03:25.030> and

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
felt it would be good both for AMC and

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.350 
felt it would be good both for AMC and
good<00:03:26.019> for<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.320> city<00:03:26.560> if<00:03:27.280> we<00:03:27.340> could<00:03:27.730> pick<00:03:28.239> up

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
good for the city if we could pick up

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.910 
good for the city if we could pick up
all<00:03:28.540> these<00:03:28.690> buildings<00:03:28.959> and<00:03:29.440> essentially

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
all these buildings and essentially

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.560 
all these buildings and essentially
assemble<00:03:30.370> them<00:03:30.489> together<00:03:30.640> to<00:03:30.910> create<00:03:31.090> the

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
assemble them together to create the

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.570 
assemble them together to create the
streetscape<00:03:32.019> so<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:32.920> really<00:03:33.100> have<00:03:33.220> a<00:03:33.340> sense

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
streetscape so you really have a sense

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.660 
streetscape so you really have a sense
for<00:03:33.760> what<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.959> site<00:03:35.350> was<00:03:36.040> like<00:03:36.310> what<00:03:36.550> this

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
for what the site was like what this

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.520 
for what the site was like what this
part<00:03:36.940> of<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.060> city<00:03:37.209> was<00:03:37.420> like<00:03:37.600> at<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.320> turn<00:03:38.500> of

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
part of the city was like at the turn of

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.090 
part of the city was like at the turn of
the<00:03:38.650> century<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:40.420> building<00:03:40.810> will<00:03:41.200> achieve<00:03:41.769> a

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
the century the building will achieve a

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.030 
the century the building will achieve a
very<00:03:43.030> high<00:03:43.239> level<00:03:44.110> of<00:03:44.910> sustainability<00:03:45.910> rating

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
very high level of sustainability rating

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.130 
very high level of sustainability rating
efficiency<00:03:48.040> use<00:03:48.700> of<00:03:48.880> space<00:03:49.120> this<00:03:49.870> is<00:03:49.989> going<00:03:50.080> to

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
efficiency use of space this is going to

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.590 
efficiency use of space this is going to
be<00:03:50.260> a<00:03:50.290> long<00:03:50.590> term<00:03:50.830> home<00:03:51.100> for<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.940> Association

I consider this to be we know one of the
best<00:03:56.290> things<00:03:56.560> I've<00:03:56.739> ever<00:03:56.769> gotten<00:03:57.160> work<00:03:57.489> on<00:03:57.700> I
