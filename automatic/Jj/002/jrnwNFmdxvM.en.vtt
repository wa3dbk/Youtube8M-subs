00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
draw a connecting ring you see now this

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.549 
draw a connecting ring you see now this
is<00:00:35.880> planted<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> ground<00:00:36.690> right<00:00:36.960> down<00:00:37.260> here

is planted in the ground right down here

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.990 
is planted in the ground right down here
then<00:00:37.739> later<00:00:37.980> I'll<00:00:38.100> put<00:00:38.250> some<00:00:38.399> grass<00:00:38.610> around

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
then later I'll put some grass around

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.910 
then later I'll put some grass around
that<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.300> hide<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.800> can

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
that and hide that this is you can

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.650 
that and hide that this is you can
imagine<00:00:41.160> how<00:00:41.430> huge<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.000> connecting<00:00:42.390> ring<00:00:42.480> is

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
imagine how huge this connecting ring is

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.959 
imagine how huge this connecting ring is
compared<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:44.010> small<00:00:44.309> little<00:00:44.550> living<00:00:44.820> Hut

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969

right<00:00:45.149> here<00:00:45.360> see<00:00:45.980> what<00:00:46.980> art<00:00:47.399> word<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.730> that

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
right here see what art word is that

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.229 
right here see what art word is that
proportion<00:00:49.230> makes<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.309> look<00:00:50.520> huge<00:00:50.910> if<00:00:51.090> this

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
proportion makes this look huge if this

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.590 
proportion makes this look huge if this
is<00:00:51.390> small<00:00:51.690> proportion<00:00:52.789> using<00:00:53.789> symmetry<00:00:54.329> that

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
is small proportion using symmetry that

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.240 
is small proportion using symmetry that
we<00:00:54.690> learned<00:00:54.870> today<00:00:55.020> I'm<00:00:55.199> going<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.440> draw<00:00:55.739> the

side<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.500> my<00:01:40.619> ring<00:01:40.860> right<00:01:41.070> down<00:01:41.310> here<00:01:42.290> we'll

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
side of my ring right down here we'll

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.800 
side of my ring right down here we'll
call<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.649> secret<00:01:44.100> city<00:01:44.299> drawing<00:01:45.299> mania

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
call it the secret city drawing mania

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.929 
call it the secret city drawing mania
okay<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.640> that

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
okay I like that

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.480 
okay I like that
that's<00:01:48.420> not<00:01:48.689> catchy<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:51.649> figure<00:01:52.649> if<00:01:52.799> everybody

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
that's not catchy I figure if everybody

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.969 
that's not catchy I figure if everybody
gets<00:01:53.729> into<00:01:53.909> B<00:01:54.210> as<00:01:54.329> an<00:01:54.960> enthusiastic<00:01:55.290> mood

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
gets into B as an enthusiastic mood

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.590 
gets into B as an enthusiastic mood
drawing<00:01:56.340> with<00:01:56.520> their<00:01:56.640> pencil<00:01:57.000> as<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.210> do<00:01:57.450> then

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
drawing with their pencil as I do then

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.050 
drawing with their pencil as I do then
we'll<00:01:58.530> be<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.680> lot<00:01:59.040> better<00:01:59.310> off<00:01:59.460> we<00:01:59.850> start

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
we'll be a lot better off we start

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.990 
we'll be a lot better off we start
smiling<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.780> I'll<00:02:01.320> draw<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.740> back<00:02:02.040> chain

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
smiling and I'll draw this back chain

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.389 
smiling and I'll draw this back chain
the<00:02:03.479> thickness<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.200> see<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.950> try<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.250> be

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
the thickness of it see I try to be

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.889 
the thickness of it see I try to be
consistent<00:02:05.729> with<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.149> sides<00:02:06.420> all<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.780> way

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
consistent with the sides all the way

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.410 
consistent with the sides all the way
through

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.390 

now<00:02:10.420> I'm<00:02:10.600> going<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.810> let<00:02:10.930> you<00:02:11.110> decide<00:02:11.590> what

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
now I'm going to let you decide what

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.250 
now I'm going to let you decide what
pattern<00:02:12.880> of<00:02:13.000> shading<00:02:13.360> I<00:02:13.450> should<00:02:13.660> use<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.110> use

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
pattern of shading I should use so I use

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.280 
pattern of shading I should use so I use
dots<00:02:14.560> on<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.980> chain<00:02:15.250> or<00:02:15.520> cross<00:02:16.150> hatching<00:02:16.840> or

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
dots on the chain or cross hatching or

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.260 
dots on the chain or cross hatching or
what<00:02:17.440> kind<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.680> texture<00:02:18.160> I<00:02:18.220> should<00:02:18.550> use<00:02:18.760> on<00:02:18.970> on

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
what kind of texture I should use on on

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.030 
what kind of texture I should use on on
the<00:02:19.570> design<00:02:19.930> range<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:20.230> can<00:02:20.260> use<00:02:20.530> small<00:02:20.800> little

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
the design range I can use small little

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.850 
the design range I can use small little
circles<00:02:21.520> or<00:02:21.670> squares<00:02:25.230> all<00:02:26.230> we<00:02:26.560> need<00:02:26.680> another

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
circles or squares all we need another

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.990 
circles or squares all we need another
connecting<00:02:27.340> ring<00:02:27.520> so<00:02:27.730> we<00:02:27.760> have<00:02:27.910> the

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
connecting ring so we have the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.940 
connecting ring so we have the
connecting<00:02:28.390> ring<00:02:28.510> connecting<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.560> bottom

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
connecting ring connecting the bottom

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.280 
connecting ring connecting the bottom
part<00:02:30.160> of<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.280> chain<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.150> inhabitant<00:02:32.020> area

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
part of the chain to the inhabitant area

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.370 
part of the chain to the inhabitant area
so<00:02:32.440> we<00:02:32.680> need<00:02:32.830> something<00:02:33.070> from<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.310> roof<00:02:37.380> I'll

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
so we need something from the roof I'll

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.170 
so we need something from the roof I'll
draw<00:02:38.620> another<00:02:38.650> connecting<00:02:39.340> ring<00:02:39.550> this<00:02:39.940> gets

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
draw another connecting ring this gets

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.580 
draw another connecting ring this gets
tricky<00:02:40.420> in<00:02:40.690> here<00:02:40.900> because<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.200> start<00:02:41.380> getting

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
tricky in here because you start getting

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.820 
tricky in here because you start getting
really<00:02:42.160> detailed<00:02:42.550> and<00:02:42.959> then<00:02:43.959> we'll<00:02:44.650> have<00:02:44.740> some

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
really detailed and then we'll have some

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.280 
really detailed and then we'll have some
rope<00:02:45.160> coming<00:02:45.430> down<00:02:45.670> here<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.390> in<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.870> circle<00:02:47.230> in

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
rope coming down here and in a circle in

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.600 
rope coming down here and in a circle in
the<00:02:47.320> middle<00:02:47.380> connected<00:02:48.100> that's<00:02:48.310> kind<00:02:48.550> of

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
the middle connected that's kind of

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.180 
the middle connected that's kind of
interesting<00:02:48.880> something<00:02:49.420> different

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.160 

okay<00:02:56.030> have<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.480> decided<00:02:56.780> what<00:02:56.930> kind<00:02:57.050> of

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
okay have you decided what kind of

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.280 
okay have you decided what kind of
shading<00:02:57.500> you<00:02:57.590> want<00:02:57.770> you<00:02:57.890> want<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.100> use<00:02:58.190> dots<00:02:58.490> or

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
shading you want you want to use dots or

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:07.150
