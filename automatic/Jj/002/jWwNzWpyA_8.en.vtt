00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.980 

looking<00:00:02.610> forward<00:00:02.969> what<00:00:03.360> do<00:00:03.540> we<00:00:03.689> envisage

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
looking forward what do we envisage

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.290 
looking forward what do we envisage
happening<00:00:04.560> with<00:00:04.710> cars<00:00:05.040> well<00:00:05.670> I<00:00:05.819> think<00:00:05.970> that

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:06.300 
happening with cars well I think that

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.969 
happening with cars well I think that
small<00:00:06.599> cars<00:00:06.930> which<00:00:07.170> are<00:00:07.349> cleverly<00:00:07.710> designed

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:07.979 
small cars which are cleverly designed

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:09.709 
small cars which are cleverly designed
will<00:00:08.429> be<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.580> very<00:00:08.849> important<00:00:09.360> part<00:00:09.540> of

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
will be a very important part of

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.020 
will be a very important part of
motoring<00:00:10.200> in<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.379> next<00:00:10.650> century<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.669> costs

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
motoring in the next century the costs

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.909 
motoring in the next century the costs
of<00:00:12.120> running<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.480> car<00:00:12.690> are<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.169> course<00:00:13.349> rising

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:13.919 
of running a car are of course rising

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:15.589 
of running a car are of course rising
all<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.099> time<00:00:14.459> and<00:00:14.700> it's<00:00:14.969> not<00:00:15.150> going<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.360> stop

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
all the time and it's not going to stop

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.080 
all the time and it's not going to stop
so<00:00:16.320> cars<00:00:16.680> which<00:00:16.950> are<00:00:17.220> relatively<00:00:17.700> cheap<00:00:18.060> to

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
so cars which are relatively cheap to

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.960 
so cars which are relatively cheap to
buy<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.750> first<00:00:19.050> place<00:00:19.350> are<00:00:19.590> attractive<00:00:20.280> we

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
buy in the first place are attractive we

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.090 
buy in the first place are attractive we
look<00:00:21.180> for<00:00:21.450> innovative<00:00:21.840> designs<00:00:22.410> capable<00:00:22.980> of

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
look for innovative designs capable of

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.920 
look for innovative designs capable of
carrying<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.520> family<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.090> all<00:00:24.240> its<00:00:24.480> luggage

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
carrying a family and all its luggage

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.250 
carrying a family and all its luggage
but<00:00:25.230> which<00:00:25.440> merely<00:00:25.740> sips<00:00:26.070> fuel<00:00:26.460> along<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.910> way

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
but which merely sips fuel along the way

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.510 
but which merely sips fuel along the way
personally<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.380> like<00:00:28.650> designs<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.190> vehicles

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
personally I like designs of vehicles

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.790 
personally I like designs of vehicles

summer 2000 what makes the a2 different

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.450 
summer 2000 what makes the a2 different
is<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.379> first<00:00:40.589> volume<00:00:41.190> production

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
is that it's the first volume production

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:52.999 
fuel which for a car of its size is
truly<00:01:52.439> remarkable

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
truly remarkable

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.940 
truly remarkable
so<00:01:54.000> why<00:01:54.210> haven't<00:01:54.570> our<00:01:55.020> makers<00:01:55.409> gone<00:01:55.590> down<00:01:55.799> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
so why haven't our makers gone down the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.469 
so why haven't our makers gone down the
same<00:01:56.189> route<00:01:56.340> as<00:01:56.520> Aldi<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.000> producing

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
same route as Aldi in producing

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.929 
same route as Aldi in producing
aluminium<00:01:58.109> cars<00:01:58.380> well<00:01:59.189> it's<00:01:59.429> difficult<00:01:59.670> to

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
aluminium cars well it's difficult to

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.999 
aluminium cars well it's difficult to
say<00:02:00.240> because<00:02:00.630> if<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> a2<00:02:01.109> is<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.439> success<00:02:01.979> and

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
say because if the a2 is a success and

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.310 
say because if the a2 is a success and
it<00:02:02.280> surely<00:02:02.640> will<00:02:02.850> be<00:02:03.060> perhaps<00:02:03.749> others<00:02:04.140> will

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
it surely will be perhaps others will

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.959 
it surely will be perhaps others will
decide<00:02:04.679> that<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.039> form<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.429> vehicle<00:02:05.789> is

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
decide that this form of vehicle is

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.210 
decide that this form of vehicle is
viable<00:02:06.299> there's<00:02:07.079> no<00:02:07.320> doubt<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.799> development

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
viable there's no doubt that development

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.160 
viable there's no doubt that development
costs<00:02:08.610> for<00:02:08.759> both<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:09.030> original<00:02:09.300> aluminium

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
costs for both the original aluminium

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.790 
costs for both the original aluminium

car the a8 and the new

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.340 
car the a8 and the new
to<00:02:12.130> have<00:02:12.340> been<00:02:12.520> substantial<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:13.390> perhaps<00:02:14.020> is

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
to have been substantial and perhaps is

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.050 
to have been substantial and perhaps is
why<00:02:14.500> other<00:02:14.770> manufacturers<00:02:15.550> have<00:02:15.700> been<00:02:15.820> put

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
why other manufacturers have been put

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.050 
why other manufacturers have been put
off<00:02:16.410> also<00:02:17.410> in<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.920> next<00:02:18.160> century<00:02:18.340> expect<00:02:18.970> to

off also in the next century expect to

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.300 
off also in the next century expect to
see<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:19.330> cars<00:02:19.600> laden<00:02:20.200> with<00:02:20.350> gadgets<00:02:20.620> becoming

more standard at the moment it's really

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.440
