00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 
design now it's really fun to do and

it's<00:06:59.110> sort<00:06:59.260> of<00:06:59.410> it<00:06:59.560> it<00:06:59.770> kind<00:07:00.100> of<00:07:00.160> feeds<00:07:00.370> into

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
it's sort of it it kind of feeds into

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.370

the<00:07:00.820> clothes<00:07:01.090> as<00:07:01.270> well<00:07:01.449> so<00:07:01.750> which<00:07:01.900> is<00:07:02.050> very

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:02.380 
the clothes as well so which is very

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:36.400 
the clothes as well so which is very
exciting<00:07:02.500> for<00:07:03.010> me

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:36.410 

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.870 

you<00:07:37.410> know<00:07:37.500> I<00:07:37.530> think<00:07:37.710> it's<00:07:37.980> about<00:07:38.070> ease<00:07:38.430> I<00:07:38.670> think

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 
you know I think it's about ease I think

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.440 
you know I think it's about ease I think
it's<00:07:38.970> about<00:07:39.060> causality<00:07:39.390> I<00:07:39.990> think<00:07:40.320> it's<00:07:40.470> about

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:41.450 
it's about causality I think it's about

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.360 
it's about causality I think it's about
constructivism<00:07:42.450> for<00:07:43.080> me<00:07:43.200> but<00:07:43.470> doing<00:07:43.980> it<00:07:44.130> in<00:07:44.310> a

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:44.370 
constructivism for me but doing it in a

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:49.070 
constructivism for me but doing it in a
in<00:07:44.720> plastic<00:07:45.720> fresh<00:07:46.620> attitude
