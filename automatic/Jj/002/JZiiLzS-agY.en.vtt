is<00:00:25.140> when<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.380> opposing<00:00:25.859> team<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.849> between

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
is when the opposing team is in between

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.060 
is when the opposing team is in between
you<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.510> your<00:00:27.599> player<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.590> get<00:00:28.740> them<00:00:28.920> to

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070

pass over the other team stick and
there's<00:00:31.230> less<00:00:31.439> chance<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.800> them<00:00:31.859> picking<00:00:32.189> the

right before a game and the warm up you
can<00:00:36.870> do<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.590> know<00:00:37.620> if<00:00:37.800> your<00:00:37.950> coach<00:00:38.160> doesn't

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
have a set warm up right when you get on

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.990 
have a set warm up right when you get on
the<00:00:40.020> ice<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.829> work<00:00:41.010> with<00:00:41.219> your<00:00:41.340> teammate

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.270 
the ice you can work with your teammate
on<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.329> but<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.050> know<00:00:43.140> saucer<00:00:43.649> passes<00:00:44.070> at<00:00:44.190> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
on it but you know saucer passes at the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.369 
on it but you know saucer passes at the
higher<00:00:44.460> levels<00:00:44.820> are<00:00:45.059> very<00:00:45.600> important<00:00:46.200> because

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
higher levels are very important because

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.950 
higher levels are very important because
they<00:00:46.680> happen<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.100> lot<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.300> offensive

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
they happen a lot and in the offensive

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.420 
they happen a lot and in the offensive
zone<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> defensive<00:00:49.890> zone<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
zone and the defensive zone and the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.970 
zone and the defensive zone and the
neutral<00:00:50.789> zone<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.480> now<00:00:51.629> watch<00:00:51.870> as<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.379> we<00:00:52.770> pass

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
neutral zone so now watch as we we pass

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:35.260 
neutral zone so now watch as we we pass
it<00:00:53.190> back<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.370> forth<00:00:53.579> okay

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.140 

okay<00:01:36.740> you<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.890> try<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.310> skill<00:01:38.580> when<00:01:39.030> you're

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
okay you can try this skill when you're

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.730 
okay you can try this skill when you're
standing<00:01:39.420> further<00:01:39.810> away<00:01:40.110> or<00:01:40.140> closer<00:01:40.440> together

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
standing further away or closer together

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.190 
standing further away or closer together
as<00:01:41.160> you<00:01:41.730> get<00:01:41.910> closer<00:01:42.150> together<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.870> gets<00:01:42.960> more

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
as you get closer together it gets more

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.400 
as you get closer together it gets more
difficult<00:01:43.260> so<00:01:44.510> to<00:01:45.510> wrap<00:01:45.660> this<00:01:45.900> up<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.320> know

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
difficult so to wrap this up you know

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.320 
difficult so to wrap this up you know
you<00:01:46.860> can<00:01:47.010> do<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.250> anywhere<00:01:47.580> on<00:01:47.730> the<00:01:47.940> ice<00:01:48.120> you
