00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
didn't think I was gonna have a lot of

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.690 
didn't think I was gonna have a lot of
difficulty<00:00:05.700> adjusting<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.379> language

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
difficulty adjusting to the language

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.070 
difficulty adjusting to the language
differences<00:00:08.700> here<00:00:08.970> compared<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.480> Taiwan<00:00:09.840> I

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
differences here compared to Taiwan I

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.410 
differences here compared to Taiwan I
remember<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:11.010> was<00:00:11.280> like<00:00:11.429> in<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.670> cab<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:12.300> was

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
remember I was like in a cab and I was

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.240 
remember I was like in a cab and I was
discussing<00:00:13.320> with<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.710> cab<00:00:13.889> driver<00:00:14.130> like

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
discussing with the cab driver like

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.740 
discussing with the cab driver like
where<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.670> go<00:00:14.790> how<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.000> get<00:00:15.210> there<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.509> he<00:00:15.630> was

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
where to go how to get there and he was

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.240 
where to go how to get there and he was
like<00:00:15.929> tell<00:00:16.109> me<00:00:16.139> know<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:17.100> was<00:00:17.190> like

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
like tell me know and I was like

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.040 
like tell me know and I was like
discussing<00:00:17.670> back<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.150> anything<00:00:18.720> can<00:00:18.840> be<00:00:18.930> such

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
discussing back so anything can be such

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.570 
discussing back so anything can be such
a<00:00:19.140> huge<00:00:19.289> issue<00:00:20.180> but<00:00:21.180> here<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.750> like<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.439> okay<00:00:23.310> so

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
a huge issue but here is like I okay so

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.670 
a huge issue but here is like I okay so
one<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.210> huge<00:00:24.480> differences<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
one of the huge differences is the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.839 
one of the huge differences is the
retroflex<00:00:26.490> RR<00:00:27.390> that's<00:00:28.260> what<00:00:28.410> an<00:00:28.500> R<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.849> but

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
retroflex RR that's what an R is but

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.990 
retroflex RR that's what an R is but
they<00:00:30.320> it's<00:00:31.320> usually<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.940> it's<00:00:32.940> a

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
they it's usually like a it's a

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.490 
they it's usually like a it's a
characteristic<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.780> Beijing<00:00:34.110> dialect

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
characteristic of the Beijing dialect

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.979 
characteristic of the Beijing dialect
and<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:35.520> know<00:00:35.610> that's<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.510> prestige

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
and you know that's that is the prestige

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.080 
and you know that's that is the prestige
dialect<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.860> country<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.969> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
dialect in this country this is the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.760 
dialect in this country this is the
standard<00:00:39.390> dialect<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.050> people<00:00:40.410> are<00:00:40.710> obviously

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
standard dialect so people are obviously

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.510 
standard dialect so people are obviously
trying<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.280> imitate<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:42.420> very

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
trying to imitate it it's very

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.310 
trying to imitate it it's very
pronounced<00:00:44.520> at<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.090> end<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.360> sentence<00:00:45.780> I

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
pronounced at the end of the sentence I

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.810 
pronounced at the end of the sentence I
noticed<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.800> lot<00:00:46.980> whenever<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:47.579> at<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
noticed it a lot whenever it's at the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.650 
noticed it a lot whenever it's at the
end<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.420> phrase<00:00:48.649> so<00:00:49.649> for<00:00:49.860> example<00:00:50.660> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
end of a phrase so for example the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.270 
end of a phrase so for example the
reason<00:00:51.750> why<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.140> hard<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.680> because<00:00:53.039> there's

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
reason why it's hard is because there's

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.189 
reason why it's hard is because there's
already<00:00:53.550> very<00:00:53.969> little<00:00:54.239> shape<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> Mandarin

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
already very little shape to a Mandarin

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.720 
already very little shape to a Mandarin
syllable<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:55.949> usually<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:58.440> starting<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
syllable it's usually the starting the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.880 
syllable it's usually the starting the
start<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.149> syllable<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.780> either<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.590> vowel

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
start of the syllable is either a vowel

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.390 
start of the syllable is either a vowel
or<00:01:02.660> one<00:01:03.660> consonants<00:01:04.350> never<00:01:04.589> are<00:01:04.739> clustered<00:01:05.159> in

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
or one consonants never are clustered in

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.859 
or one consonants never are clustered in
the<00:01:06.150> end<00:01:06.650> and<00:01:07.650> there's<00:01:07.830> always<00:01:08.010> one<00:01:08.479> vowel<00:01:09.479> or

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
the end and there's always one vowel or

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.929 
the end and there's always one vowel or
maybe<00:01:10.049> two<00:01:10.439> you're<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> diphthong<00:01:11.700> and

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
maybe two you're like a diphthong and

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.080 
maybe two you're like a diphthong and
then<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:13.350> either<00:01:13.500> ends<00:01:13.830> with<00:01:13.950> an<00:01:14.070> N<00:01:14.310> aren't<00:01:14.850> um

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
then it either ends with an N aren't um

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.310 
then it either ends with an N aren't um
so<00:01:15.780> there's<00:01:16.530> not<00:01:16.710> much<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.360> coda<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.960> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
so there's not much of of a coda of a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.590 
so there's not much of of a coda of a
closing<00:01:19.770> or<00:01:19.860> whatever<00:01:20.150> you<00:01:21.150> look<00:01:21.360> at<00:01:21.479> my

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
closing or whatever you look at my

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.330 
closing or whatever you look at my
linguistics<00:01:22.200> vocabulary<00:01:25.220> but<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
linguistics vocabulary but the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.410 
linguistics vocabulary but the
problem<00:01:26.729> with<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.060> R<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:28.460> deletes<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.880> lot

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
problem with the R is it deletes a lot

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.450 
problem with the R is it deletes a lot
of<00:01:31.250> that<00:01:32.250> diphthong<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.920> it<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.430> just

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
of that diphthong and it just it just

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.240 
of that diphthong and it just it just
gets<00:01:35.759> rid<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.240> final<00:01:36.689> consonant<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
gets rid of that final consonant so the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.740 
gets rid of that final consonant so the
one<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.299> example<00:01:39.829> ba-bong<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.189> bon<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:42.540> all

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
one for example ba-bong and bon can all

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.200 
one for example ba-bong and bon can all
be<00:01:42.899> bar<00:01:43.290> xiang<00:01:44.280> thong<00:01:44.310> chun<00:01:45.119> bar<00:01:47.030> Q<00:01:48.229> here<00:01:49.229> I

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
be bar xiang thong chun bar Q here I

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.020 
be bar xiang thong chun bar Q here I
know<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.659> kind<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.049> annoying<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.520> I

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
know it's just kind of annoying and so I

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.300 
know it's just kind of annoying and so I
remember<00:01:54.869> we<00:01:55.170> were<00:01:55.439> getting<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.829> cab<00:01:56.040> and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
remember we were getting in the cab and

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.480 
remember we were getting in the cab and

asking us what gate did we want us to be

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.459 
asking us what gate did we want us to be
dropped<00:02:06.360> off<00:02:06.479> at<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.110> could<00:02:07.320> not
