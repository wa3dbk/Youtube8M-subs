I like to throw either a black or a
white<00:00:42.540> frog<00:00:42.930> now<00:00:43.380> it's<00:00:43.560> important<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.980> fish

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
white frog now it's important to fish

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160 
white frog now it's important to fish
this<00:00:44.310> on<00:00:44.490> the<00:00:44.580> right<00:00:44.820> tackle<00:00:45.150> I<00:00:45.450> like<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.960> throw

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
this on the right tackle I like to throw

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.770 
this on the right tackle I like to throw
this<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.560> 7-foot<00:00:47.190> heavy<00:00:47.700> action<00:00:47.940> rod<00:00:48.150> this

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
this on a 7-foot heavy action rod this

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.290 
this on a 7-foot heavy action rod this
is<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.990> st.<00:00:49.350> Croix<00:00:49.530> Legend<00:00:49.950> elite<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.400> I<00:00:50.940> like

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
is a st. Croix Legend elite and I like

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.390 
is a st. Croix Legend elite and I like
to<00:00:51.450> throw<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.840> on<00:00:52.020> 20<00:00:52.470> pound<00:00:52.740> monofilament

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
to throw this on 20 pound monofilament

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.890 
to throw this on 20 pound monofilament
line<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.240> reason<00:00:54.480> for<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.870> because

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
line the reason for that is because

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.170 
line the reason for that is because
unlike<00:00:55.200> fluorocarbon<00:00:55.829> monofilament<00:00:56.579> floats

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
unlike fluorocarbon monofilament floats

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.819 
unlike fluorocarbon monofilament floats
so<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.450> going<00:00:57.540> to<00:00:57.630> keep<00:00:57.720> that<00:00:57.780> frog<00:00:58.230> higher

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
so it's going to keep that frog higher

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.650 
so it's going to keep that frog higher
on<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> surface<00:00:59.640> if<00:00:59.790> you<00:01:00.000> don't<00:01:00.360> throw<00:01:00.600> them

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
on the surface if you don't throw them

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.110 
on the surface if you don't throw them
on<00:01:00.810> a<00:01:00.840> filament<00:01:01.200> I<00:01:01.440> recommend<00:01:02.190> braid<00:01:02.489> 50<00:01:02.910> pound

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
on a filament I recommend braid 50 pound

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.119 
on a filament I recommend braid 50 pound
braid<00:01:03.360> is<00:01:03.510> also<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.900> very<00:01:04.350> good<00:01:04.439> choice<00:01:04.799> for

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
braid is also a very good choice for

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.919 
braid is also a very good choice for
frogs<00:01:05.429> the<00:01:06.030> retrieves<00:01:06.420> would<00:01:06.569> like<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.780> keep

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:06.929 
frogs the retrieves would like to keep

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:09.499 
frogs the retrieves would like to keep
very<00:01:07.200> simple<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.829> calm<00:01:08.429> days<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.999> like<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.299> very

very simple on calm days I like a very
slow<00:01:09.990> retrieve<00:01:10.560> whereas<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.280> windy<00:01:11.609> days<00:01:11.819> or

rod tip pointed down towards the water

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.209 
rod tip pointed down towards the water
now<00:01:18.569> it's<00:01:18.749> very<00:01:18.929> important<00:01:19.409> when<00:01:19.469> you<00:01:19.979> get<00:01:20.159> a

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219 
now it's very important when you get a
