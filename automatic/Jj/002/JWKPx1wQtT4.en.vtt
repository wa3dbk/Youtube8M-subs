reporters being sent out today and the

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.080 
reporters being sent out today and the
regimen<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.309> Premier<00:00:11.580> League<00:00:11.610> house<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.059> just

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
regimen the Premier League house is just

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.780 
regimen the Premier League house is just
from<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.599> two<00:00:12.870> billion<00:00:13.500> pounds<00:00:13.920> like<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.460> so

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
from the two billion pounds like that so

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.269 
from the two billion pounds like that so
much<00:00:15.030> money<00:00:15.269> but<00:00:16.020> if<00:00:16.529> you<00:00:16.650> compare<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.130> the

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
much money but if you compare it to the

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.439 
much money but if you compare it to the
Italian<00:00:17.670> league<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:17.970> Spanish<00:00:18.270> league

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
Italian league of the Spanish league

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.349 
Italian league of the Spanish league
they<00:00:18.990> revenue<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.380> only<00:00:19.529> 1.5<00:00:19.770> billion<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:21.180> our

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
they revenue is only 1.5 billion so our

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.269 
they revenue is only 1.5 billion so our
wages<00:00:21.630> are<00:00:21.960> higher<00:00:22.170> if<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:23.010> look<00:00:23.100> at<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
wages are higher if you look at the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.269 
wages are higher if you look at the
whole<00:00:23.369> report<00:00:23.699> than<00:00:24.119> Europe<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.720> general<00:00:25.279> but

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
whole report than Europe in general but

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.920 
whole report than Europe in general but
that's<00:00:26.519> better<00:00:26.880> for<00:00:27.180> our<00:00:27.300> game<00:00:27.539> because<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
that's better for our game because the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.359 
that's better for our game because the
Premier<00:00:28.260> League<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.710> had<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.099> believe<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.340> best

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
Premier League I had to believe the best

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.220 
Premier League I had to believe the best
league<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.029> world<00:00:30.060> purely<00:00:30.810> because<00:00:30.990> our

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
league in the world purely because our

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.650 
league in the world purely because our
wage<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.920> higher<00:00:32.250> which<00:00:32.730> attracts<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
wage is a higher which attracts so the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.120 
wage is a higher which attracts so the
