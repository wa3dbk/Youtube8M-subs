you<00:02:08.520> know<00:02:08.550> I'm<00:02:08.729> scared<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.119> saying<00:02:09.530> he<00:02:10.530> goes

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
you know I'm scared of saying he goes

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.930 
you know I'm scared of saying he goes
for<00:02:11.009> sources<00:02:11.940> again<00:02:12.180> I'm<00:02:12.540> think

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
for sources again I'm think

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.270 
for sources again I'm think
he<00:02:13.000> probably<00:02:13.270> has<00:02:13.630> a<00:02:13.660> leftover<00:02:14.110> sucker<00:02:15.040> punch

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
he probably has a leftover sucker punch

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.920 
he probably has a leftover sucker punch
being<00:02:15.460> provided<00:02:15.880> that<00:02:16.120> he<00:02:16.240> only<00:02:16.390> did<00:02:16.630> two<00:02:16.690> I

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
being provided that he only did two I

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.110 
being provided that he only did two I
guess<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.830> that<00:02:17.980> eliminates<00:02:18.220> for<00:02:18.790> because<00:02:19.090> I

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
guess so that eliminates for because I

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.550 
guess so that eliminates for because I
have<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.330> pressure<00:02:19.570> ability<00:02:19.930> so<00:02:20.140> I'll<00:02:20.230> go<00:02:20.380> for

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
have the pressure ability so I'll go for

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.890 
have the pressure ability so I'll go for
the<00:02:20.620> substitute<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:22.180> got<00:02:22.420> super<00:02:22.690> quick

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
the substitute and I got super quick

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.930 
the substitute and I got super quick
right<00:02:22.930> i<00:02:23.350> brace<00:02:23.800> myself<00:02:23.830> so<00:02:24.250> my<00:02:24.370> thinking<00:02:24.580> okay

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
right i brace myself so my thinking okay

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.510 
right i brace myself so my thinking okay
my<00:02:25.240> option<00:02:25.690> his<00:02:25.870> moves<00:02:26.140> now<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:27.160> I'm<00:02:27.220> thinking

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
my option his moves now so I'm thinking

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.580 
my option his moves now so I'm thinking
like<00:02:27.670> we<00:02:27.820> go<00:02:27.970> for<00:02:28.120> another<00:02:28.210> substitute<00:02:28.960> so<00:02:29.290> he

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
like we go for another substitute so he

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.140 
like we go for another substitute so he
