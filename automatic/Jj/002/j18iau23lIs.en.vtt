00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.160
 or the family of what's new this year 2014 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.990
 is finalizing and precisely for that reason 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.850
 let's say which have been the 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.110
 best mobile phones of the year according to our 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.110
 opinion and our experience 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.619
 ok let's start talking about the mobile 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.810
 which has probably been the biggest 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.360
 market revolution in 2014 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.759
 the one plus one the mobile of which for 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.039
 We talked to you a few weeks ago about the 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.169
 which we did an extensive review and 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.059
 that I would highlight basically the 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.850
 value for money we are talking 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:35.890
 of a terminal of 300 euros with a 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.649
 64 gigabyte capacity with some 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.660
 very powerful features maybe not the 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.300
 best of the year because the truth is that 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.829
 have come out much more powerful things but 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.230
 yes it is true that for the price that 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.420
 we have the relationship is very good in 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.370
 As for the quality highlighting Now that 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.440
 as we said in the video yes it has 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.570
 some small software problems 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.190
 because obviously the brand still does not 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.289
 is settled and has a few 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.109
 problems but hopefully facing 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.969
 future this new this new brand can 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.820
 take out a much more complete terminal and 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.490
 really much more balanced in all 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.080
 in all its aspects after speaking 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.850
 of this one plus one I think that 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.770
 we should also talk about the two 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.290
 mobile phones that have revolutionized the market 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.540
 in quotation marks regarding systems 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.970
 operatives if they speak 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.640
 of uncles obviously we should talk 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.160
 of iphone 6 is to say a terminal then 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.140
 that has finally taken that little jump 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.960
 I needed in terms of size because 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.180
 we have two terminals one of 4.7 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.770
 inches and another 5.5 something that we're 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.170
 waiting after having stalled 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.450
 a tad apelan terminal is maybe 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.940
 too small for the time in the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.400
 that we were already on the other hand highlighting 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.680
 also from these iphone 6 your improvements in 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.260
 As for design we already have a terminal 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.570
 with a larger screen and also you 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.090
 we add a more refined design more 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.710
 polished with rounded edges that 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.930
 Incidentally remember a little to 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.729
 the first iphones of the market we leave 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.490
 well sideways those gridded forms 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.410
 that in my opinion they began to repeat 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.720
 a lot in the latest apple terminals 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.060
 on the other hand say that although the iphone 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.679
 6 be one of the best mobiles of this 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.290
 year because it is evident is one of the 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.060
 better terminals the truth is that I think 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.890
 that continue to maintain a line a 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.150
 tedious continuist as to 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.310
 benefits, it is true that the 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.590
 they are improving slightly but still 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.989
 missing that little boom 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.030
 jolin what piece of mobile they have currado 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.040
 this year the apple ones lack that little 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.500
 detail some improvement I do not know which but 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.090
 missing that little detail that yes for 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.610
 many of you surely the 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.080
 Use experience will remain unique 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.379
 unequaled because it is true that 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.870
 we all have a very user experience 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.910
 own very very different from the android 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.129
 and it is true that this is a point very close to 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.319
 please, but also maybe facing 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.480
 mobile futures would have to hit him 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.510
 a little twist so that 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.579
 tell us is the milk and if we start 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.140
 talk about an android terminal 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.989
 I think I would highlight especially the 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.390
 samsung galaxy note 4 a device that 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.370
 it really peta in every way 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.730
 has a brutal camera has a 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.440
 screen very good in terms of response 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.360
 as for colors in terms of 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.549
 definition resolution is to say a 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.620
 very good screen also highlights its 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.319
 autonomy we have a terminal with a 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.299
 5.7 inch screen that should suck 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.370
 a lot of battery and the truth is that 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.829
 it responds very well has an autonomy 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.810
 that draws much attention by another 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.770
 side also highlight two aspects by 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.810
 one side 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.520
 since it is a terminal that has come out in 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.680
 The last quarter of the year has 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.920
 the best hardware that exists so far 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.110
 in the market and on the other hand the design 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.320
 we already came from a samsung galaxy no 3 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.330
 with a very striking design with its its 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.030
 leather back cover and the truth is that 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.980
 this year with those metallic edges what 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.230
 true is that they have improved it a lot 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.120
 and it's very nice to have the phone in the 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.190
 hand said that although we have 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.900
 commented that with iPhone 6 we would have 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.880
 a unique user experience 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.860
 following the continuation line a little 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.660
 that we have commented neither can we 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.880
 stop saying that with the galaxy not out 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.340
 4 and your android would also have a 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.410
 experience with its own charm like 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.570
 you know android is very customizable and 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.430
 offers many options for 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.770
 modify the terminal of our whim 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.350
 especially thanks to the lunches of the 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:21.030
 which by the way you speak in brief 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.120
 anyway, if you do not want a terminal 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.800
 so gigantic for its 5.7 screen 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.140
 inches and with such a performance 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.950
 brutal and for a price that 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.220
 obviously it will hurt us in the 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.170
 We can offer you the motorcycle x a 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.310
 somewhat cheaper terminal and with a 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.710
 4 screen 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.050
 to 7 inches well arrived at this point 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.630
 and considering that this has been 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.820
 rather a personal analysis I os 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.920
 I encourage you to leave in the comments a 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.440
 small ranking with the terminals that 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.240
 more you have liked in this year 2014 that 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.910
 most have caught your attention and the 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.560
 why explain to tell us giving 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.820
 all kinds of feedback because we are 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.010
 aware that we have also 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.840
 left some of the more mobile 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:04.830
 powerful this year as for example the 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.050
 nexus 6 the lg 3 or even the htc m 8 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.120
 but obviously if you do not want to be 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.400
 listening to me for three hours because no 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.770
 we have been able to fit them so we hope 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.420
 your comments and all kinds of 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.280
 feedback so we can continue 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.460
 iterating over what have been the 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.740
 best mobile of the year 2014 said this 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.360
 and to not extend more I leave you already 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.010
 although not without saying before that 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.990
 subscribe jce to our channel that you give 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.480
 like to this video that you comment that 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.200
 comment a lot and see you in the 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.200
 next video
