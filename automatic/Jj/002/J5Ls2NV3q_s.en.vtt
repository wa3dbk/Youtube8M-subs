that's over fifteen hundred miles and
I've<00:00:18.660> been<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.990> mass<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.320> couple<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.830> times

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
I've been to mass a couple of times

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.130 
I've been to mass a couple of times
brought<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.820> turnpike<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.779> really

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
brought in the turnpike and I really

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.660 
brought in the turnpike and I really
haven't<00:00:22.320> had<00:00:22.500> any<00:00:22.560> major<00:00:22.830> problems<00:00:23.400> with<00:00:23.519> it

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.269 
things that were my fault I just had a
couple<00:00:30.390> bolts<00:00:30.929> loosen<00:00:31.170> up<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.619> these<00:00:31.920> ones

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
couple bolts loosen up like these ones

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.400 
couple bolts loosen up like these ones
must<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.210> forgot<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.450> put<00:00:33.660> Loctite<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.260> them

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
must have forgot to put Loctite on them

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.990 
must have forgot to put Loctite on them
you<00:00:34.920> want<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.160> make<00:00:35.280> sure<00:00:35.309> when<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.730> put<00:00:35.880> these

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
you want to make sure when you put these

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.360 
you want to make sure when you put these
together<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.540> torque<00:00:37.050> them<00:00:37.230> all<00:00:37.320> down<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
together you torque them all down the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.910 
together you torque them all down the
bolts<00:00:38.670> down<00:00:38.730> lock<00:00:39.180> tight<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:40.260> cam<00:00:40.530> moves<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
bolts down lock tight this cam moves the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.040 
bolts down lock tight this cam moves the
heat<00:00:41.070> shield<00:00:41.340> here<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.790> also<00:00:42.270> painted<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.840> like

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
heat shield here I also painted it like

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.260 
heat shield here I also painted it like
this<00:00:43.200> charcoal<00:00:43.680> color<00:00:43.920> because<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.030> did<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
this charcoal color because I did the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.600 
this charcoal color because I did the
wheels<00:00:45.510> black<00:00:45.840> makes<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.980> look<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.280> bit<00:00:47.430> nicer

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
wheels black makes it look a bit nicer

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.020 
wheels black makes it look a bit nicer
like<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> SM<00:00:49.200> setup<00:00:49.649> I've<00:00:50.219> deleted<00:00:50.670> this

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
like the SM setup I've deleted this

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.549 
like the SM setup I've deleted this
little<00:00:51.329> la<00:00:52.579> fuel<00:00:53.579> jet<00:00:53.969> pump<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:55.230> weird

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
little la fuel jet pump that it's weird

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.490 
little la fuel jet pump that it's weird
device<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.160> takes<00:00:56.370> fresh<00:00:57.059> air<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.570> fuel<00:00:57.870> and

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
device it takes fresh air and fuel and

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.900 
device it takes fresh air and fuel and
it<00:00:58.620> pumps<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.949> little<00:00:59.160> bit<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.430> resonator

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
it pumps a little bit in a resonator

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.939 
it pumps a little bit in a resonator
that<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.420> guess<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.020> give<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.469> pass<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
that I guess I give this to pass the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.090 
that I guess I give this to pass the
emissions<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.609> California<00:01:03.619> I'm<00:01:04.619> surprised

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
emissions in California I'm surprised

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.710 
emissions in California I'm surprised
because<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.519> isn't<00:01:05.820> showing<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.270> lot<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.420> rust

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
because this isn't showing a lot of rust

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.250 
because this isn't showing a lot of rust
at<00:01:07.110> all<00:01:07.350> I've<00:01:07.890> left<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.310> outside<00:01:08.900> you<00:01:09.900> can<00:01:10.049> see

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
at all I've left it outside you can see

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.899 
at all I've left it outside you can see
this<00:01:10.439> spot<00:01:10.799> right<00:01:10.830> here<00:01:11.010> that's<00:01:11.580> only<00:01:11.760> because

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
this spot right here that's only because

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.859 
this spot right here that's only because
of<00:01:12.060> my<00:01:12.210> tool<00:01:12.420> bag<00:01:12.740> fell<00:01:13.740> off<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.189> melted<00:01:14.869> kind

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
of my tool bag fell off and melted kind

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.899 
of my tool bag fell off and melted kind
of<00:01:15.960> made<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.409> finish<00:01:17.009> come<00:01:17.220> off<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.549> exhaust

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
of made the finish come off the exhaust

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.469 
of made the finish come off the exhaust
there<00:01:19.490> I've<00:01:20.490> lost<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.000> little<00:01:21.150> backing

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
there I've lost this little backing

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.570 
there I've lost this little backing
plate<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> piece<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.650> flat<00:01:23.040> bar<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.490> he

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
plate I have a piece of flat bar and he

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.690 
plate I have a piece of flat bar and he
right<00:01:23.790> now<00:01:23.970> -<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.140> chain<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.430> was<00:01:26.520> my

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
right now - just a chain but that was my

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.399 
right now - just a chain but that was my
fault<00:01:27.030> because<00:01:27.150> when<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.450> went<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.900> adjust<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
fault because when I went to adjust the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.800 
fault because when I went to adjust the
chain<00:01:28.759> like<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.909> need<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
chain like you need to

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.950 
chain like you need to
I<00:01:30.900> forgot<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> torque<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.979> guy<00:01:32.159> back<00:01:32.340> down

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
I forgot the torque that guy back down

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.450 
I forgot the torque that guy back down
so<00:01:33.960> that's<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.259> temporary<00:01:34.770> till<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.070> gets<00:01:35.310> um

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
so that's just temporary till it gets um

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.830 
so that's just temporary till it gets um
another<00:01:36.210> part<00:01:36.600> like<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.170> side<00:01:37.610> um<00:01:38.840> I

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
another part like on that side um I

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.200 
another part like on that side um I
changed<00:01:41.119> this<00:01:42.119> rear<00:01:42.570> sprocket<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:44.060> 37<00:01:45.060> -

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
changed this rear sprocket to a 37 -

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.660 
changed this rear sprocket to a 37 -
from<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.899> 50<00:01:46.799> -<00:01:46.950> if<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> 428<00:01:48.119> chain<00:01:48.920> I<00:01:49.920> did

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
from a 50 - if this is a 428 chain I did

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.310 
from a 50 - if this is a 428 chain I did
have<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.000> modify<00:01:51.299> because<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.990> spread

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
have to modify because the spread

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.639 
have to modify because the spread
between<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.710> bolts<00:01:53.720> were<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.780> little<00:01:55.290> bit<00:01:55.470> off

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
between the bolts were a little bit off

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.740 
between the bolts were a little bit off
so<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:55.950> simply<00:01:56.250> use<00:01:56.549> my<00:01:56.729> old<00:01:56.909> sprocket<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:57.689> a

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
so I simply use my old sprocket in a

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.690 
so I simply use my old sprocket in a
drill<00:01:58.079> press<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.829> made<00:01:59.009> perfect<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
drill press that made perfect the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.639 
drill press that made perfect the
template<00:02:00.630> for<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.960> new<00:02:00.990> holes<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.530> be<00:02:01.560> drilled

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
template for the new holes to be drilled

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.270 
template for the new holes to be drilled
and<00:02:02.270> it<00:02:03.270> worked<00:02:03.600> out<00:02:03.750> pretty<00:02:04.020> good<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.680> got<00:02:05.189> it

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
and it worked out pretty good I got it

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.310 
and it worked out pretty good I got it
pretty<00:02:05.399> centered<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.540> cruises<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> lot

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
pretty centered and it cruises a lot

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.979 
pretty centered and it cruises a lot
better<00:02:07.610> if<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:09.000> get<00:02:09.209> one<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.420> these<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.780> go<00:02:09.869> on

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
better if you get one of these and go on

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:10.790 
better if you get one of these and go on
the<00:02:10.110> road<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.319> lot

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
the road a lot

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.640 
the road a lot
I'd<00:02:11.009> recommend<00:02:11.910> changing<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.569> gear<00:02:12.959> because

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
I'd recommend changing the gear because

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.369 
I'd recommend changing the gear because
before<00:02:14.239> this<00:02:15.239> bike<00:02:15.510> was<00:02:15.780> like<00:02:16.049> Reverend

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
before this bike was like Reverend

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.289 
before this bike was like Reverend
Wright<00:02:16.680> out<00:02:16.860> of<00:02:17.010> 50<00:02:17.280> miles<00:02:17.459> an<00:02:17.640> hour<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.000> with

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
Wright out of 50 miles an hour and with

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.589 
Wright out of 50 miles an hour and with
this<00:02:18.420> motor<00:02:18.720> setup<00:02:19.080> it's<00:02:19.890> uh<00:02:20.580> it's<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.209> square

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
this motor setup it's uh it's a square

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.289 
this motor setup it's uh it's a square
bore<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.080> stroke<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:22.709> you<00:02:22.769> want<00:02:23.069> to<00:02:23.370> have

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
bore and stroke so you want to have

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.059 
bore and stroke so you want to have
taller<00:02:24.599> gearing<00:02:25.049> because<00:02:25.260> this<00:02:25.470> can<00:02:25.709> propel

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
taller gearing because this can propel

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.089 
taller gearing because this can propel
itself<00:02:26.370> at<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.670> lower<00:02:26.970> rpm<00:02:27.510> using<00:02:28.440> its<00:02:28.590> inertial

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
itself at a lower rpm using its inertial

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.580 
itself at a lower rpm using its inertial
torque<00:02:29.280> because<00:02:29.549> this<00:02:29.700> kind<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:30.000> motor<00:02:30.209> it<00:02:30.420> is

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
torque because this kind of motor it is

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.220 
torque because this kind of motor it is
well<00:02:31.590> now<00:02:31.829> I'm<00:02:32.040> like<00:02:32.280> using<00:02:32.519> like<00:02:32.900> almost<00:02:33.900> no

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
well now I'm like using like almost no

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.630 
well now I'm like using like almost no
throttle<00:02:34.500> kick<00:02:34.950> compared<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.489> like

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
throttle kick compared to like

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.080 
throttle kick compared to like
two-thirds<00:02:36.090> throttle<00:02:36.540> at<00:02:36.629> 50<00:02:36.989> I<00:02:37.250> put<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.579> little

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
two-thirds throttle at 50 I put a little

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.990 
two-thirds throttle at 50 I put a little
cup<00:02:39.329> holder<00:02:39.690> here<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:40.730> something<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.790> charge

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
cup holder here and something to charge

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.970 
cup holder here and something to charge

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.610 
my phone I'm working on the heat heated
grips<00:02:44.190> here<00:02:44.459> these<00:02:44.610> are<00:02:44.790> just<00:02:44.909> cheap<00:02:45.000> ones

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620

grips here these are just cheap ones
this<00:02:46.620> actually<00:02:47.129> killed<00:02:47.370> my<00:02:47.549> battery<00:02:47.910> because

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
this actually killed my battery because

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.869 
this actually killed my battery because
I<00:02:48.420> forgot<00:02:48.989> which<00:02:49.200> way<00:02:49.349> was<00:02:49.530> on<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:49.859> off<00:02:49.950> my

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
I forgot which way was on and off my

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.030 
I forgot which way was on and off my
fault<00:02:51.120> again<00:02:51.269> I<00:02:51.629> still<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.290> kick<00:02:52.500> start<00:02:52.799> but

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
fault again I still the kick start but

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.890 
fault again I still the kick start but
I'm<00:02:53.220> going<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.549> get<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.730> new<00:02:53.879> battery<00:02:54.120> because

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
I'm going to get a new battery because

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.690 
I'm going to get a new battery because
it<00:02:54.930> does<00:02:55.230> run<00:02:55.470> better<00:02:55.859> without<00:02:56.160> one<00:02:56.459> although

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
it does run better without one although

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.630 
it does run better without one although
it<00:02:56.879> will<00:02:57.209> still<00:02:57.450> run<00:02:57.629> with<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:57.959> one

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
it will still run with that one

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.990 
it will still run with that one

was<00:03:48.569> getting<00:03:48.840> into<00:03:49.019> my<00:03:49.049> buddy's<00:03:49.470> truck<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:49.980> I

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
was getting into my buddy's truck and I

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.509 
was getting into my buddy's truck and I
had<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.340> switch<00:03:51.090> in<00:03:51.269> my<00:03:51.359> pocket<00:03:51.810> here<00:03:52.049> and<00:03:52.519> I

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
had the switch in my pocket here and I

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.220 
had the switch in my pocket here and I
must<00:03:53.669> have<00:03:53.819> hit<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.090> electric<00:03:54.599> start<00:03:54.900> button

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
must have hit the electric start button

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.069 
must have hit the electric start button
and<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:55.530> was<00:03:55.620> in<00:03:55.769> here<00:03:56.480> probably<00:03:57.480> my<00:03:57.810> fault

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
and it was in here probably my fault

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.020 
and it was in here probably my fault
again<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.919> bikes<00:03:59.129> fault<00:03:59.459> I<00:03:59.699> mean<00:03:59.849> that's

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
again and the bikes fault I mean that's

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.509 
again and the bikes fault I mean that's
really<00:04:00.329> not<00:04:00.569> a<00:04:00.599> good<00:04:00.810> design<00:04:01.160> they<00:04:02.160> had<00:04:02.310> for

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
really not a good design they had for

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.309 
really not a good design they had for
this<00:04:02.669> bike<00:04:02.910> they<00:04:03.359> do<00:04:03.419> have<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:03.780> little<00:04:03.959> shield

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
this bike they do have a little shield

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.610 
this bike they do have a little shield
that<00:04:04.530> come<00:04:04.739> across<00:04:05.840> but<00:04:06.840> still<00:04:07.199> it's<00:04:07.440> not<00:04:07.560> the

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
that come across but still it's not the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.780 
that come across but still it's not the
best

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
best

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.240 
best
I<00:04:09.290> did<00:04:10.290> a<00:04:12.109> 9006<00:04:13.109> headlight<00:04:13.530> conversion<00:04:14.099> like

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
I did a 9006 headlight conversion like

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.969 
I did a 9006 headlight conversion like
it's<00:04:14.400> one<00:04:14.519> of<00:04:14.609> them<00:04:14.699> hid<00:04:15.180> wannabes<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:16.079> don't

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
it's one of them hid wannabes I don't

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.759 
it's one of them hid wannabes I don't
get<00:04:17.099> the<00:04:17.190> depth<00:04:17.459> right<00:04:17.760> so<00:04:18.150> it<00:04:18.449> isn't<00:04:18.750> it<00:04:19.560> isn't

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
get the depth right so it isn't it isn't

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.529 
get the depth right so it isn't it isn't
focused<00:04:20.400> Lieb<00:04:20.609> right<00:04:20.820> it's<00:04:21.060> just<00:04:21.269> kind<00:04:21.479> of

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
focused Lieb right it's just kind of

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.040 
focused Lieb right it's just kind of
bright<00:04:21.750> all<00:04:21.900> around<00:04:22.229> gonna<00:04:22.890> change<00:04:23.219> that<00:04:23.550> and

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
bright all around gonna change that and

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.860 
bright all around gonna change that and
other<00:04:25.050> than<00:04:25.289> that

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
other than that

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.430 
other than that
I've<00:04:26.620> just<00:04:26.889> done<00:04:27.100> oil<00:04:27.639> changes<00:04:28.450> he's<00:04:29.169> the

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
motorcycle oil changes like within the

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.320 
motorcycle oil changes like within the
first<00:04:31.630> like<00:04:31.780> thousand<00:04:32.320> kilometers<00:04:32.830> I<00:04:33.180> did<00:04:34.180> it

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
first like thousand kilometers I did it

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.210 
first like thousand kilometers I did it
three<00:04:34.750> times<00:04:34.780> because<00:04:35.410> you<00:04:35.800> know<00:04:35.919> I<00:04:35.950> didn't

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
three times because you know I didn't

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.600

designed<00:05:00.010> for<00:05:00.100> I<00:05:00.430> notice<00:05:01.150> it<00:05:01.270> did<00:05:01.419> burn<00:05:01.690> a

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
designed for I notice it did burn a

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.170 
designed for I notice it did burn a
little<00:05:02.020> bit<00:05:02.229> of<00:05:02.350> oil<00:05:02.820> because<00:05:03.820> you<00:05:03.970> know<00:05:04.090> if

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
little bit of oil because you know if

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.760 
little bit of oil because you know if
you're<00:05:04.300> just<00:05:04.330> holding<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:04.870> throttle<00:05:05.290> at<00:05:05.710> a

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
you're just holding the throttle at a

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.830 
you're just holding the throttle at a
higher<00:05:06.160> rpm<00:05:06.790> you<00:05:07.210> know<00:05:07.300> it's<00:05:07.450> going<00:05:07.540> to<00:05:07.600> burn<00:05:07.810> a

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
higher rpm you know it's going to burn a

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.950 
higher rpm you know it's going to burn a
little<00:05:08.110> bit<00:05:08.290> of<00:05:08.410> oil<00:05:08.700> but<00:05:09.700> not<00:05:10.690> anything

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
little bit of oil but not anything

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.250 
little bit of oil but not anything
problematic<00:05:12.330> will<00:05:13.330> not<00:05:13.479> burn<00:05:13.720> oil<00:05:13.900> if<00:05:14.110> you're

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
problematic will not burn oil if you're

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.650 
problematic will not burn oil if you're
I'm<00:05:14.440> like<00:05:14.760> 4550<00:05:15.760> but<00:05:15.940> if<00:05:16.030> you're<00:05:16.150> pushing<00:05:16.389> it

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
I'm like 4550 but if you're pushing it

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.140 
I'm like 4550 but if you're pushing it
like<00:05:17.530> 60<00:05:18.100> 65<00:05:20.040> it'll<00:05:21.040> definitely<00:05:21.639> burn<00:05:22.120> a

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
like 60 65 it'll definitely burn a

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.500 
like 60 65 it'll definitely burn a
little<00:05:22.360> oil<00:05:22.630> over<00:05:22.960> a<00:05:22.990> long<00:05:23.290> trip<00:05:23.860> you<00:05:24.389> just<00:05:25.389> got

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
little oil over a long trip you just got

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.420 
little oil over a long trip you just got
to<00:05:25.570> keep<00:05:25.690> an<00:05:25.870> eye<00:05:25.990> it's<00:05:26.200> easy<00:05:26.500> the<00:05:26.919> bike<00:05:27.130> has<00:05:27.400> a

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
to keep an eye it's easy the bike has a

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.029 
to keep an eye it's easy the bike has a
little<00:05:27.760> window<00:05:28.210> here<00:05:28.240> for<00:05:28.660> the<00:05:28.750> oil<00:05:28.930> so<00:05:29.500> it's

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
little window here for the oil so it's

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:30.659 
little window here for the oil so it's
not<00:05:30.160> a<00:05:30.220> problem

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
not a problem

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.230 
not a problem
