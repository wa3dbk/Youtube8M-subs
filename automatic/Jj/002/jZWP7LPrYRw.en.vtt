00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.550
 it's time to look for a car sometimes 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:10.650
 It takes a lot of patience that the 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.650
 skilled hunters have to spare 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.999
 the scenery and half rural globe but here the 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.890
 chickens are only extras for the 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:23.489
 object of real interest of the other 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.489
 sport 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:30.249
 was in very similar conditions that 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:32.920
 this f-1000 was reborn thanks to reginaldo 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:35.949
 who is a car hunter 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.170
 my job is to look for age as well 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:41.710
 Marcelo the car the less he went 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.420
 better scoured it is that like felipe 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.109
 has a right car for each type of 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.460
 person 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.460
 each in its specialty 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.690
 Filipe meets the clientele in the big 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.300
 SÃ£o Paulo, the order is now 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.910
 with a maximum of ten years of use 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.190
 for up to R $ 25 thousand 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.859
 it selects the best offers by 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.590
 internet and make personal visits 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.580
 the documentation check to the state 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.250
 of the car 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.120
 wheel wear 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.120
 pedals, right? 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.550
 wear of shift knob 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.350
 the overall wear and tear of the car has 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.110
 with that mileage and 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.820
 are more than 150 items that I evaluate the 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.460
 cars a test drive that is also easy 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.630
 with the car to see the condition of the engine 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.550
 change the structure of the car 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.590
 gabriel looks for Felipe when 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.710
 decided to sell a hatch and buy a 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.140
 sedan to better accommodate the two daughters 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.250
 but in the end the sedan stayed for another 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.740
 opportunity 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.080
 I sold the car only in the meantime to 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.570
 We knew our third son was a blessing. 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.070
 It's going to be born now, I talked to him. 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.780
 Felipe, we can not put three 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.850
 chairs behind which I wanted very early 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.590
 No, Gabriel, you will not be able to stay. 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.330
 very comfortable to your family 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.310
 So he suggested a car with 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.750
 third row of banks and then the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.070
 People leave to look for this 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.680
 profile 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.420
 gabriel preferred to pay 800 reais for 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.610
 the car hunter than to take a risk 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.700
 alone and I was afraid to get a 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.370
 used car and suddenly I discovered that the 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.140
 Do not mess with the problem 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.140
 problems think they are expensive things
