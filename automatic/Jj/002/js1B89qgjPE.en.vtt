Westinghouse brake compressor picked it
up<00:00:08.250> today<00:00:08.400> out<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.849> scrap<00:00:09.120> pile<00:00:09.559> seems<00:00:10.559> to

up today out of the scrap pile seems to

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.990 
up today out of the scrap pile seems to
have<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.769> good<00:00:10.889> compression<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.550> sounds<00:00:11.790> pretty

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
have a good compression it sounds pretty

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.170

good when you turn it over red bells are
working<00:00:18.539> quite<00:00:18.690> well

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570

it's a - you - a fellow 400 series and
it's<00:00:25.890> got<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.099> bottom<00:00:26.369> end<00:00:26.519> openness<00:00:27.060> I

it's got the bottom end openness I

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.670 
it's got the bottom end openness I
wanted<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.510> see<00:00:27.689> what<00:00:27.840> its<00:00:27.990> lubrication

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
wanted to see what its lubrication

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.919 
wanted to see what its lubrication
system<00:00:29.039> was<00:00:29.189> like<00:00:29.420> it's<00:00:30.420> pretty<00:00:30.539> much<00:00:30.689> what<00:00:30.900> I

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
system was like it's pretty much what I

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.530 
system was like it's pretty much what I
expected<00:00:30.990> it's<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.949> feed<00:00:32.730> from<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> engines

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540

a truck or something like that and I'm

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.780 
a truck or something like that and I'm
sort<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.290> total<00:00:40.649> loss<00:00:40.829> back<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.460> engine

lubrication<00:00:48.840> system<00:00:49.700> so<00:00:50.750> to<00:00:51.750> make<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:51.960> work<00:00:52.289> as

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
lubrication system so to make it work as

lubrication system so to make it work as
a<00:00:53.280> standalone<00:00:53.789> compressor<00:00:54.660> I'm<00:00:55.649> thinking<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
a standalone compressor I'm thinking the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.319 
a standalone compressor I'm thinking the
only<00:00:56.190> way<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.489> do<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:57.109> is<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.260> block<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.680> off

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
only way to do it is to block this off

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.939 
only way to do it is to block this off
put<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> drain<00:01:00.660> plug<00:01:00.870> there<00:01:01.199> block<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.739> off

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
put a drain plug there block this off

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.109 
put a drain plug there block this off
completely<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:03.199> maybe<00:01:04.199> attach<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.680> little

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
completely and maybe attach a little

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.340 
completely and maybe attach a little
slinger<00:01:06.119> paddle<00:01:06.750> or<00:01:06.869> something<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
slinger paddle or something to the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.500 
slinger paddle or something to the
bottom<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.680> each<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.860> these<00:01:08.040> rod<00:01:08.310> bolts<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
bottom of each of these rod bolts the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.620 
bottom of each of these rod bolts the
two<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.900> them<00:01:10.020> one<00:01:10.409> there<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:10.830> there<00:01:11.630> so

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
two of them one there and one there so

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.690 
two of them one there and one there so
that<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.960> can<00:01:13.110> swing<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.530> bit<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.770> oil<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.250> way

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
that it can swing a bit of oil that way

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.060 
that it can swing a bit of oil that way
and<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.659> way<00:01:15.869> towards<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.409> bearings<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
and that way towards the bearings and

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.929 
and that way towards the bearings and
just<00:01:18.000> general<00:01:18.360> splash<00:01:19.430> bring<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> oil<00:01:20.729> level

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
just general splash bring the oil level

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.289 
just general splash bring the oil level
up<00:01:21.210> high<00:01:21.420> enough<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.320> rod<00:01:22.500> ends<00:01:23.299> slap

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
up high enough that the rod ends slap

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.719 
up high enough that the rod ends slap
into<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.680> hopefully<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.460> will<00:01:26.670> be

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
into it and hopefully that will be

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.120 
into it and hopefully that will be
enough<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.600> problem<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:28.020> getting<00:01:28.200> oil<00:01:28.530> into

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
enough the problem is getting oil into

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.210 
enough the problem is getting oil into
the<00:01:29.159> crankshaft<00:01:30.380> so<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.439> may<00:01:31.619> even<00:01:31.860> require<00:01:32.009> a

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the crankshaft so it may even require a

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.390 
the crankshaft so it may even require a
cross<00:01:32.520> drilling<00:01:33.409> this<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.619> designed<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.189> feed

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
cross drilling this is designed to feed

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.429 
cross drilling this is designed to feed
oil<00:01:35.700> right<00:01:35.909> through<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> crankshaft<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:37.140> to

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
oil right through the crankshaft and to

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.370 
oil right through the crankshaft and to
the<00:01:37.500> bearings<00:01:39.920> bit<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.070> problem<00:01:41.930> but<00:01:42.930> then<00:01:43.170> I

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the bearings bit of a problem but then I

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.410 
the bearings bit of a problem but then I
could<00:01:43.590> probably<00:01:43.770> reroute<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.640> hose<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.390> that

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
could probably reroute this hose so that

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.560 
could probably reroute this hose so that
it<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:46.140> pulses<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:47.149> crankcase<00:01:48.149> pressure

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
it the pulses in crankcase pressure

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.940 
it the pulses in crankcase pressure
might<00:01:48.930> actually<00:01:49.290> force<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.619> bit<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.799> oil

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
might actually force a bit of oil

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.550 
might actually force a bit of oil
through<00:01:50.220> as<00:01:50.369> well<00:01:50.549> with<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.170> thing

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
through as well with and it's a thing

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.310 
through as well with and it's a thing
bit<00:01:52.740> optimistic<00:01:52.890> at<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.520> moment<00:01:57.320> everything

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
bit optimistic at the moment everything

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.249 
bit optimistic at the moment everything
else<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.890> there<00:01:59.070> though<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.369> works<00:01:59.579> fine<00:02:00.259> I'm

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
else is there though it works fine I'm

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.319 
else is there though it works fine I'm
guessing<00:02:01.619> that's<00:02:01.710> an<00:02:01.890> oil<00:02:02.040> trap<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.759> returned

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
guessing that's an oil trap and returned

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.620 
guessing that's an oil trap and returned
from<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.750> discharge<00:02:03.960> side<00:02:04.560> and

now<00:03:44.730> I'll<00:03:44.910> taking<00:03:45.240> the<00:03:45.300> oil<00:03:45.510> lines<00:03:45.750> office<00:03:46.290> and

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
now I'll taking the oil lines office and

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.890 
now I'll taking the oil lines office and
that's<00:03:47.640> actually<00:03:47.820> not<00:03:48.090> an<00:03:48.180> oil<00:03:48.450> line<00:03:48.660> that

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
that's actually not an oil line that

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.350 
that's actually not an oil line that
didn't<00:03:49.200> have<00:03:49.320> oil<00:03:49.530> through<00:03:49.860> it<00:03:50.010> I'm<00:03:50.940> guessing

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
didn't have oil through it I'm guessing

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.860 
didn't have oil through it I'm guessing
it<00:03:51.510> was<00:03:51.690> air<00:03:52.650> or<00:03:52.950> water<00:03:53.190> or<00:03:53.370> something<00:03:53.870> but

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
it was air or water or something but

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
more vacuum no can't be vacuum that's

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.400 
more vacuum no can't be vacuum that's
pressure<00:04:14.480> or<00:04:15.480> is<00:04:15.570> it<00:04:15.660> now<00:04:15.810> that's<00:04:16.020> vacuum

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410

that's<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.680> vacuum<00:04:16.980> side<00:04:17.280> so<00:04:17.580> for<00:04:17.760> your<00:04:17.910> vacuum

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
that's a vacuum side so for your vacuum

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.220 
that's a vacuum side so for your vacuum
governor<00:04:19.010> and<00:04:20.010> that's<00:04:20.160> a<00:04:20.220> vacuum<00:04:20.610> line

governor and that's a vacuum line
this<00:04:22.230> is<00:04:22.410> discharge<00:04:22.890> that's<00:04:23.160> high<00:04:23.310> pressure

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
this is discharge that's high pressure

this is discharge that's high pressure
side<00:04:24.440> this<00:04:25.440> would<00:04:25.620> a<00:04:25.650> cue

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
side this would a cue

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.070 
side this would a cue
I'll<00:04:26.490> phrase<00:04:26.730> a<00:04:26.760> vacuum<00:04:27.210> pump<00:04:27.510> and<00:04:27.750> the

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
I'll phrase a vacuum pump and the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.770 
I'll phrase a vacuum pump and the
compressor<00:04:30.230> made<00:04:31.230> up<00:04:31.350> a<00:04:31.410> gasket<00:04:32.150> new<00:04:33.150> material

just<00:04:33.960> did<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:34.980> old<00:04:35.100> hammer<00:04:35.310> tech<00:04:35.580> making<00:04:35.970> it

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
just did the old hammer tech making it

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.910 
just did the old hammer tech making it
carefully<00:04:37.860> tapped<00:04:38.130> out<00:04:38.310> a<00:04:38.340> new<00:04:38.520> gasket<00:04:39.920> should

have<00:04:41.010> done<00:04:41.130> a<00:04:41.160> video<00:04:41.310> on<00:04:41.580> how<00:04:41.730> to<00:04:41.790> do<00:04:41.970> that<00:04:42.210> it's

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
have done a video on how to do that it's

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.830 
have done a video on how to do that it's
quite<00:04:42.930> easy<00:04:43.520> just<00:04:44.520> hold<00:04:45.090> it<00:04:45.240> steady<00:04:45.450> on<00:04:45.720> the

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
quite easy just hold it steady on the

use<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.720> ball<00:04:48.900> end<00:04:49.940> don't<00:04:50.940> try<00:04:51.120> it<00:04:51.150> on

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
use the ball end don't try it on
