00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.960 

all<00:00:00.599> right<00:00:00.750> so<00:00:00.960> here<00:00:01.530> I<00:00:01.709> just<00:00:02.220> kind<00:00:02.730> of<00:00:02.790> want<00:00:02.939> to

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
all right so here I just kind of want to

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:03.949 
all right so here I just kind of want to
go<00:00:03.120> over<00:00:03.360> this

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
go over this

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.380 
go over this
whenever<00:00:04.680> you're<00:00:04.890> saving<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.279> scene<00:00:05.580> you<00:00:06.270> have

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
whenever you're saving a scene you have

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.629 
whenever you're saving a scene you have
the<00:00:06.480> choice<00:00:06.690> between<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:07.109> Maya<00:00:07.710> binary<00:00:08.370> and

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
the choice between a Maya binary and

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.419 
the choice between a Maya binary and
ASCII<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.530> people<00:00:10.530> always<00:00:10.650> ask<00:00:10.980> me<00:00:11.099> what<00:00:11.309> the

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
ASCII and people always ask me what the

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.150 
ASCII and people always ask me what the
difference<00:00:11.759> between<00:00:11.849> those<00:00:12.269> things<00:00:12.599> are<00:00:13.160> so

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
difference between those things are so

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.400 
difference between those things are so
along<00:00:15.030> with<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.360> workflow<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.870> kind<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.260> want

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
along with this workflow I kind of want

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.650 
along with this workflow I kind of want
to<00:00:16.440> go<00:00:16.590> over<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.830> let's<00:00:17.550> see<00:00:17.699> if<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.090> save<00:00:18.539> it

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
to go over that let's see if I save it

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.470 
to go over that let's see if I save it
as<00:00:18.750> my<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> binary<00:00:19.529> file<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.100> put<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.119> somewhere

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
as my a binary file and put it somewhere

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:30.320 
as my a binary file and put it somewhere
on<00:00:21.840> my<00:00:21.990> desktop<00:00:22.470> called<00:00:22.920> ax<00:00:25.640> B<00:00:27.830> and<00:00:29.179> then<00:00:30.179> I

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
on my desktop called ax B and then I

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:42.110 
on my desktop called ax B and then I
save<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.840> also<00:00:31.080> as<00:00:32.030> ASCII<00:00:33.030> file

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.930 

now<00:00:42.540> if<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.990> was<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.200> go<00:00:43.500> on<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.710> desktop<00:00:44.190> I'll

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
now if I was to go on the desktop I'll

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.440 
now if I was to go on the desktop I'll
show<00:00:45.630> you<00:00:45.720> the<00:00:45.870> two<00:00:46.080> difference<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.800> got<00:00:49.160> xaxb

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
show you the two difference I got xaxb

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.380 
show you the two difference I got xaxb
now<00:00:51.450> the<00:00:51.510> difference<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:53.309> ascii<00:00:53.910> language

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
now the difference is the ascii language

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.310 
now the difference is the ascii language
is<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:56.130> actually<00:00:56.270> decrypt<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.170> it's

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
is you can actually decrypt it and it's

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.610 
is you can actually decrypt it and it's
pretty<00:00:58.680> easy<00:00:58.830> so<00:00:59.489> if<00:01:00.000> i<00:01:00.330> choose<00:01:00.629> other<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.290> open

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
pretty easy so if i choose other to open

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.820 
pretty easy so if i choose other to open
this<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:02.010> any<00:01:02.850> machine<00:01:03.059> like<00:01:03.449> if<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.110> was<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> pc

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
this on any machine like if it was a pc

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.219 
this on any machine like if it was a pc
i<00:01:04.860> would<00:01:05.129> choose<00:01:05.430> notepad<00:01:06.119> if<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.810> was<00:01:07.050> this

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
i would choose notepad if it was this

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.580 
i would choose notepad if it was this
one<00:01:07.290> i've<00:01:07.619> used<00:01:07.950> text<00:01:08.369> editor<00:01:09.229> but<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.410> can

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
one i've used text editor but you can

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.190 
one i've used text editor but you can
see<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.520> can<00:01:11.790> read<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.660> it's<00:01:12.990> not

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
see that I can read this it's it's not

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.550 
see that I can read this it's it's not
too<00:01:13.530> bad<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.490> kind<00:01:14.759> of<00:01:14.930> confusing<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.440> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
too bad it is kind of confusing but the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.700 
too bad it is kind of confusing but the
Maya<00:01:16.740> binary<00:01:17.310> structure<00:01:17.810> if<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.990> if<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.440> chose<00:01:19.680> to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
Maya binary structure if I if I chose to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:27.320 
Maya binary structure if I if I chose to
open<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:25.520> so<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:26.759> see<00:01:26.910> that<00:01:27.119> it's

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
open that so you can see that it's

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.330 
open that so you can see that it's
totally<00:01:27.780> unreadable<00:01:28.190> okay

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
totally unreadable okay

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.260 
totally unreadable okay
now<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:31.800> advantage<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.940> let's

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
now the the advantage of this is let's

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.999 
now the the advantage of this is let's
say<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.509> was<00:01:33.869> using<00:01:34.130> Maya<00:01:35.570> 2011<00:01:36.570> at<00:01:36.690> home<00:01:36.930> but<00:01:37.830> at

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
say I was using Maya 2011 at home but at

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.850 
say I was using Maya 2011 at home but at
school<00:01:38.520> or<00:01:39.000> somewhere<00:01:39.960> else<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.410> didn't<00:01:40.740> had

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
school or somewhere else I didn't had

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.210 
school or somewhere else I didn't had
2011<00:01:41.580> and<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.789> had<00:01:42.000> only<00:01:42.149> 2008<00:01:42.869> all<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.590> do<00:01:43.830> is<00:01:44.070> had

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
2011 and I had only 2008 all I do is had

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.279 
2011 and I had only 2008 all I do is had
to<00:01:44.340> really<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.270> doesn't<00:01:45.660> really<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:46.020> make

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
to really and it doesn't really to make

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.740 
to really and it doesn't really to make
too<00:01:46.470> much<00:01:46.619> sense<00:01:46.679> because<00:01:47.209> here<00:01:48.209> all<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.479> do<00:01:48.600> is

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
too much sense because here all I do is

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.719 
too much sense because here all I do is
have<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.959> change<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.410> 208<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.280> all<00:01:50.550> of<00:01:50.670> a

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
have to change this 208 and all of a

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.699 
have to change this 208 and all of a
sudden<00:01:50.759> it'll<00:01:51.270> work<00:01:51.509> ok<00:01:52.080> that's<00:01:53.039> it<00:01:53.450> now

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
sudden it'll work ok that's it now

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.550 
sudden it'll work ok that's it now
that's<00:01:55.709> an<00:01:56.069> older<00:01:56.520> way<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.729> thinking<00:01:57.560> another

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
that's an older way of thinking another

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.580 
that's an older way of thinking another
way<00:01:58.880> of<00:01:59.880> doing<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.539> is<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:00.869> into<00:02:01.259> Maya

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
way of doing that is going into Maya

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.730 
way of doing that is going into Maya
itself<00:02:02.929> let's<00:02:03.929> say<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.140> open<00:02:06.110> 2008<00:02:07.110> or<00:02:07.319> 9<00:02:07.349> I

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
itself let's say I open 2008 or 9 I

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.440 
itself let's say I open 2008 or 9 I
forget<00:02:08.069> which<00:02:08.190> one<00:02:08.250> I'm<00:02:08.700> glad<00:02:08.940> they<00:02:09.119> change

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
forget which one I'm glad they change

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.999 
forget which one I'm glad they change
the<00:02:09.599> icon<00:02:10.020> because<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.349> was<00:02:10.530> getting<00:02:10.800> sick<00:02:10.979> of

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
the icon because it was getting sick of

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.199 
the icon because it was getting sick of
red<00:02:11.340> Maya<00:02:11.730> icons<00:02:12.360> everywhere<00:02:13.400> 2009<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:15.000> what<00:02:15.180> I

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
red Maya icons everywhere 2009 so what I

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.890 
red Maya icons everywhere 2009 so what I
want<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.450> do<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.750> open<00:02:15.990> this<00:02:16.349> ax<00:02:16.650> in<00:02:16.890> 2009<00:02:17.900> even

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
want to do is open this ax in 2009 even

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.230 
want to do is open this ax in 2009 even
though<00:02:18.990> I'm<00:02:19.140> modeling<00:02:19.440> in<00:02:19.620> 2011<00:02:20.340> I'll<00:02:21.060> show

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
though I'm modeling in 2011 I'll show

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.520 
though I'm modeling in 2011 I'll show
you<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.390> way<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.569> do<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:22.050> without<00:02:22.170> even

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.610 
you a way to do that without even
changing<00:02:22.890> any<00:02:23.310> lines<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.760> code<00:02:24.030> it's<00:02:24.900> file

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
changing any lines of code it's file

if the Maya ASCII or a binary in fact
I'll<00:02:41.819> just<00:02:42.060> choose<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.540> binary<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:45.420> it'll

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
I'll just choose to binary and it'll

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.720 
I'll just choose to binary and it'll

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
have a little bit of errors of going

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.750 
have a little bit of errors of going
across<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.360> but<00:02:48.870> then<00:02:49.680> all<00:02:49.830> in<00:02:49.950> all<00:02:50.099> there's<00:02:50.549> my

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
across it but then all in all there's my

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.880 
across it but then all in all there's my
axe<00:02:50.969> and<00:02:51.329> if<00:02:51.689> I<00:02:51.810> had<00:02:51.930> 6<00:02:52.170> on<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.379> keyboard<00:02:52.739> there

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
axe and if I had 6 on the keyboard there

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.070 
axe and if I had 6 on the keyboard there
it<00:02:52.980> is

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
it is

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.710 
it is
now<00:02:55.030> that<00:02:56.030> works<00:02:56.510> only<00:02:56.990> in<00:02:57.910> cases<00:02:58.910> modeling

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
now that works only in cases modeling

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.930 
now that works only in cases modeling
works<00:02:59.960> great<00:03:00.260> let's<00:03:00.860> say<00:03:01.070> I<00:03:01.100> had<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:01.430> character

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
works great let's say I had a character

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.460 
works great let's say I had a character
that<00:03:02.360> was<00:03:02.540> all<00:03:02.690> rigged<00:03:02.990> skinned<00:03:05.020> had<00:03:06.020> all<00:03:06.260> the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
that was all rigged skinned had all the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.410 
that was all rigged skinned had all the
bells<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:06.830> whistles<00:03:07.220> going<00:03:07.400> across<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:08.030> the

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
bells and whistles going across the the

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.800 
bells and whistles going across the the
entire<00:03:08.690> mesh<00:03:09.490> you<00:03:10.490> wouldn't<00:03:10.910> be<00:03:11.180> able<00:03:11.330> to<00:03:11.600> get

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
entire mesh you wouldn't be able to get

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.620 
entire mesh you wouldn't be able to get
everything<00:03:12.290> with<00:03:12.800> that<00:03:12.860> workflow<00:03:13.580> so<00:03:14.180> don't

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
everything with that workflow so don't

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.050 
everything with that workflow so don't
don't<00:03:15.080> count<00:03:15.500> on<00:03:15.680> it<00:03:15.740> to<00:03:16.100> have<00:03:16.310> everything<00:03:16.700> if

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
don't count on it to have everything if

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.480 
don't count on it to have everything if
you<00:03:17.630> got<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.840> whole<00:03:18.110> bunch<00:03:18.320> of<00:03:18.470> stuff<00:03:18.770> dynamics

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
you got a whole bunch of stuff dynamics

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.610 
you got a whole bunch of stuff dynamics
if<00:03:20.150> you've<00:03:20.420> got<00:03:20.630> a<00:03:20.660> whole<00:03:20.990> bunch<00:03:21.050> of<00:03:21.380> things

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
if you've got a whole bunch of things

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.460 
if you've got a whole bunch of things
that<00:03:21.740> are<00:03:22.010> in<00:03:22.160> 2011<00:03:23.150> but<00:03:23.420> not<00:03:23.570> in<00:03:23.720> 2009

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
that are in 2011 but not in 2009

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.280 
that are in 2011 but not in 2009
especially<00:03:25.370> with<00:03:25.520> skinning<00:03:26.000> now<00:03:26.290> there's

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
especially with skinning now there's

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.320 
especially with skinning now there's
some<00:03:27.590> very<00:03:28.100> colorful<00:03:28.340> skin<00:03:28.880> weights<00:03:29.090> that

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
some very colorful skin weights that

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.680 
some very colorful skin weights that
occur<00:03:29.660> in<00:03:29.900> Maya<00:03:30.640> 2011<00:03:31.640> that<00:03:31.820> do<00:03:31.970> not<00:03:32.120> transfer

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
occur in Maya 2011 that do not transfer

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.220 
occur in Maya 2011 that do not transfer
over<00:03:32.930> quite<00:03:33.380> well<00:03:33.620> with<00:03:33.830> 2009<00:03:34.810> so<00:03:35.810> that's<00:03:36.050> what

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
over quite well with 2009 so that's what

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.780 
over quite well with 2009 so that's what
I<00:03:36.260> just<00:03:36.350> wanted<00:03:36.740> to<00:03:36.830> show<00:03:36.980> you<00:03:37.010> before<00:03:37.280> we<00:03:37.640> go

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
I just wanted to show you before we go

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.880 
I just wanted to show you before we go
on<00:03:37.970> to<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.270> with<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.720> handle<00:03:39.230> modeling<00:03:39.740> is

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
on to the with the handle modeling is

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.440 
on to the with the handle modeling is
just<00:03:40.490> my<00:03:40.970> ascii<00:03:41.480> versus<00:03:41.840> my<00:03:41.990> biner
