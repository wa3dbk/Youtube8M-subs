my experience most companies now limit

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.710 
my experience most companies now limit
your<00:01:17.100> data<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.939> if<00:01:18.090> you're<00:01:18.240> only<00:01:18.360> getting<00:01:18.600> like

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
your data so if you're only getting like

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.899 
your data so if you're only getting like
two<00:01:19.170> gigabytes<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.799> data<00:01:19.979> than<00:01:20.310> half<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.729> that

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
two gigabytes of data than half of that

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.719 
two gigabytes of data than half of that
or<00:01:21.150> maybe<00:01:21.840> even<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.259> whole<00:01:22.290> thing<00:01:22.650> will<00:01:23.610> be

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
or maybe even the whole thing will be

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.510 
or maybe even the whole thing will be
used<00:01:23.970> up<00:01:24.180> by<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.390> movie<00:01:24.780> you're<00:01:24.960> watching
