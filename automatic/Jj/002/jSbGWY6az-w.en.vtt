00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.409
 What we should do is put a block 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.990

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.300

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.460

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.060
 it will serve them and in it we have coal 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.910

 that's why, as you know, here we have the 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.100
 song is so I went on vacation and 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.030
 that's why it could not be video does not have 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.130
 internet then and atrocious to school 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.230
 and I went into high school as they do not know between 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.850
 the good preparatory and that's why I wanted them 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.770
 say more than I could but but since 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.810
 we enter the school already can I do not feel 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.070
 for those dogs barking difficult good 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.890

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:05.150
 diamonds very well are five diamonds 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:08.900

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.600
 to tell the other that I really liked 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.190
 that for me is one I do not think the best 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.800
 is that I like it because it has a 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.810
 biome of those that I like and then there are 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.920
