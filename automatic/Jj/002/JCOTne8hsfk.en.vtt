00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.720
 beautiful mustard fashion welcome to this 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.970
 new spot light 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.890
 today we are talking about a mod that allows us 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.360
 to be camping on minecraft 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.309
 thanks to the use of objects 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.500
 just add the mod 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.690
 moreover, fashion also includes NPCs 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.220
 that we can find in the various campsites 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.660
 around the world 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.390
 we can also interact with these 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.609
 npc thanks to the tools it adds 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.050
 the maul ore faces of all objects 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.140
 which adds the mod 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.630
 the most useful thing though is the separate menu 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.010
 through the separate menu we can find 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.440
 all the objects they will add to 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.600
 duty camping staff and so do we 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.130
 we have to go looking for them in the search 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.440
 items where all the items are from 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.090
 so minecraft is a ball 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.980
 Here we find first of all 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.059
 fires each a different feature 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.489
 because thanks to these fires we can 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.410
 let's say interact example burning i 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.140
 marshmallow then kitchen and bar i 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.780
 marshmallow is in everyone we can 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.699
 cook it faster for example with 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.189
 this is the santanna then immediately that 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.409
 we cook then we have a tent with the 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.179
 which we can only sleep thanks 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.189
 to the use of the bed however we must 

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:14.520
 while the bed under the tent 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.039
 then we then have the marshmallows i 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.450
 cooked marshmallows and so on roots 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:22.349
 then we have the camper tool that is 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.659
 let's say the tools with which we can 

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:26.729
 interact with campers and trams in 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.649
 around the bag world in which 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.349
 we can put the beds and so on 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.310
 objects we say and there are different 

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:34.649
 size 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.700
 the guides then the armor more or less 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.159
 we say are my instincts from 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.669
 flashing and easy b we can 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.090
 sow to have roots 

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:46.709
 all this good we also find the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.149
 npc as I said before around the 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:50.369
 world and I'll show you a little 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.099
 marshmallow items we can 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.639
 eat these we have to cook on 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:58.289
 fire as it must be cooked then 

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:00.809
 we have the tent that we have to place in 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.799
 we put the bed under the tent 

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:04.259
 or what we showed 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.090
 first then we have these that are i 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.220
 camping bag or backpack type 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.390
 I have already talked about above us 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.930
 we can put within the 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.730
 objects 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.459
 we have several grids as you see 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.950
 This is the largest for months that 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.650
 we can place then we have the two 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.940
 guide the two guides yes we say exists in 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.190
 this way we clicked the button 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.190
 right and we must as you see already done 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.470
 it really felt very good 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.849
 camping and you have to click on each one 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.319
 to see how these are treated 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.610
 example objects this one comes in 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.099
 this way 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.560
 and so on go back see how 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.560
 treat others then this instead 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.230
 is used to see how they are treated 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.370
 example objects we want kraft is the 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.319
 here we see how to tent the tent 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.000
 then we go back and so we see 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.040
 how to treat other objects e 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.470
 we also see their functionality 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.340
 where is written here how to use them 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.849
 and so on 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.060
 really a fashion a mod oddio uno 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:08.060
 once again very beautiful fashion 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.790
 it's good advice because it's done 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.230
 really very well also in the suit 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.660
 from campers as we can network 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.139
 jump higher and we can run 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.940
 faster then another thing I tell you 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:21.079
 is that you have to unload the force 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.720
 because this fashion is really a lot 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.760
 it deserves much more than other wives 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.099
 which are famous this is not so much 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.989
