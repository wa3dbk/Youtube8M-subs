00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.620
 said that even his todays 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.049
 The starting lineup surprised you 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.049
 yes did not stop 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.509
 the back 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:18.949
 liberal 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.169
 sorska armenia composition of the mission we went in 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.529
 we played and star in it 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.269
 signs of criminal 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.310
 we will proceed precisely from 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.689
 first win of the Champions League 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.180
 more important is this victory 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.200
 percent 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.070
 what will the prices say as when then what is it now 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.859
 to wait 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.199
 such a long-awaited victory well yes this 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.280
 victory was forced 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.690
 a strict point of view we needed 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.200
 sure to win 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.180
 I think the return match will come true 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.060
 also very hard to try to be 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.550
 us to some degree not 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.400
 lose 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.140
 after what happened in Makhachkala 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.269
 in general was m 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.089
 with Slovaks restructure and already 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:58.650
 think about this match 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.910
 the process represents with sediment remained but 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.980
 I think Mikheev 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.590
 with benfica therefore 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.420
 I think I managed to restructure 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.710
 now you beat benfick already know 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.119
 probably worth the team understand yay 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.420
 what will be the game 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.549
 response what to expect and is it possible to fight for 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.200
 victory in their field 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.540
 we can of course 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.430
 the team is very technical 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.900
 we had an advantage field 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.230
 Here they say there will be much harder 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.180
 harder but with him and fight 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.040
 nevertheless looking at winning all that type 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.410
 what unhappy in today's game 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.410
 he needs to realize the moment of the country 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.220
 and the last piece was very difficult 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.770
 gai there spartaka cowgirls often ball 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.740
 losing strength 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.399
 fashion on just not talking about what if 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.460
 would we score the beginning of the second half 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.990
 increased production 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.409
 we already had a lot less at the end already 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.980
 I understand that they are tired 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.750
 here and I do not cling with on went forward 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.980
 started to catch 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.970
 so he explained 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.530
 what she told her that game 4 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.530
 April, when they led in the bill and after 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.529
 before the game said that you need to 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:13.369
 win and play to win by winning 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:14.660
 made football 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.959
 and the doors 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.789
 well basically 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:20.559
 we led in the bill therefore 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:22.639
 said play your football then there is more 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:23.859
 control the ball 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:25.529
 basically so 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:28.529
 8 6 square 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.279
 key to cng 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:34.809
 Well, naturally it was a key game 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:37.809
 great get situation 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:40.329
 novatek 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:41.949
 but I think that 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:44.719
 the fact that we won this game is good 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:45.299
 in two years
