00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.439

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:10.820
Hi everyone. So today we're taking a look at the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.049
Avantek 20,000mAH

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.510
high capacity external battery pack. When
I say this thing is a beast of a 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.030
power-pack I am not exaggerating. At 20,000 mAH

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.550
it's capable of charging two tablets simultaneously

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.710
both up to full power, or one tablet twice

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.120
or four smartphones, two of them
simultaneously

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.460
because yes this battery pack can charge
two devices

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.309
at the same time. Now packing in such a large battery does have one

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.530
down side. This device is certainly heavy.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.129
Heavier than you might expect from another battery pack but when you look at the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.980
size of this thing for its capacity

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.489
it's still quite portable. It's not the sort of thing you could slip in your pocket but it

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.569
is the kind of thing you can easily throw into an overnight case

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:02.079
or your carry-on luggage - whatever you
happen to be carrying with you at the

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.679
time.

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.350
Now we found that the Avantek 20,000mAh power

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.910
high capacity battery was more than
capable of juicing-up

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.250
an Nvidia Shield tablet twice to full
power or

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.390
just simply plug the battery in and let
the tablet run off the battery pack.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.790
By doing this we were able to extend
the battery life out to

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.650
nearly 12 hours of continuous use. Now that obviously is a mixture of different type of

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.400
use cases,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.790
so everything from doing some browsing
on wifi, gaming

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.880
to simply just using some basic apps as
well as watching movies and listening to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.440
music,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.820
a kind of average as it were for most normal users.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.850
Now overall we couldn't find any major
problems with this

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.220
device at all. It takes around six hours to
charge the battery pack

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.430
up to full charge which is actually
pretty good when you consider the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.800
capacity we're dealing with here.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.510
It's more than capable of charging even
high drain devices like tablets or

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.100
the very top end smartphones

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.760
and being able to charge those devices
twice rather than just once

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.210
as you would normally get with most
battery packs. The addition of two

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.600
USBs to allow you to charge two devices
simultaneously

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.240
is very welcome and quite a useful
addition to this product, I have

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.220
to say. With such a large battery
capacity you kind of want the ability to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.970
charge multiple devices ideally.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.440
As an added bonus there is also an LED
flashlight included as well. That

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.940
seems to have become the standard almost on external battery packs.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.150
It's bright enough and it does the job. If you're interested you can pick up

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.920
the Avantek 20,000mAH power battery on

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.150
Amazon for Â£34.99. Does mean it's coming
in

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.320
slightly more expensive than many other
battery packs but

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.060
the feature set here and the huge
capacity of this battery more than makes up

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.680
for it.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.110

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.349
