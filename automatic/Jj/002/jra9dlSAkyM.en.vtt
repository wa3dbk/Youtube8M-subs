 the first thing we would have to do what 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.030
 that the first thing we would have to do 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.949
 First of all, it would be to come to this 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.330
 part ok once we have reached 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.940
 this part that we are going to see this guy 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.650
 alley let's go in and here it's okay 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.750
 game well we're all going to get on the 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.460
 first staircase we see ok we 're going 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.110
 to go up this building we're going like this 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.400
 normal everything quiet we here 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.070
 let's go up 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.800
 your art goes up goes up goes up you are you 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.530
 in you 'young 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.850
 to get up ok once we have 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.950
 up we're going to climb the ladder 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.480
 bigger not for the little one that 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.340
 it's there next we're going to go up 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.290
 the biggest one here is another one 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.910
 in the same way so we can spend 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.050
 to the building next door as it is 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:31.500
 doing here my little friend who 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:34.200
 really not good sorry sorry in this 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.000
 country because I already see the exercise if not 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.820
 It comes out because now I fell down 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.280
 moment but I hope I tripped here 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.130
 well of and match so that it gets to this 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.080
 hour yes no no now highlights good I think 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.720
 that this is going to be easier than they should 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.850
 give us ok ok once we have 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.710
 come to this part of the building the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.900
 building what we would have to do 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.270
 here in this part would be to hit us in 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.100
 this corner so with the lb I think if 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.990
 is good with the r &amp; b to stick us like that 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.490
 the wall to take cover and we 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.990
 let's stick to the wall as much as 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.820
 we can what we are going to put it again 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.590
 just as we are and we are going to 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.390
 try to be moving your eyes towards 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.370
 the building once we have this 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.530
 let's let go of the r &amp; b and as we see 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.870
 we have transported transported that to 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.590
 magic art inside the building and already 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.230
 we would be in whatever the wire 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.150
 from here unfortunately we can not 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.800
 shoot we can not shoot but then 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.510
 we can shoot with the sniper that is 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.310
 an advantage that we can shoot with the 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.050
 sniper this can be done I do not know for sure 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.209
 they want in this hiding there is a good 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.920
 reward if they want to troll a 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.080
 friend if they want to hide from someone 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.000
 I think this is a very perfect spot 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.459
 good very perfect water but what is 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.349
 what that guy has in his head 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.120
 who knows how to make a robot this is a 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.980
 very good spot so why hide 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.330
 here of the compasses but I want then 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.250
 also tell them to be careful there 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.650
 because you can fall down like I think 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.090
 be that my friend did not fall down fall 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.220
 well if it makes you too for her to fall 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.810
 this and then they are going to appear outside that yes 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.849
 so, well, this is practically 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.920
 it would be all a little weybridge so that 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.060
 well so that they hide from 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.310
 a good reward for you to 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.780
 hide from a friend of someone and can 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.129
 to be practically would be all that so 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.260
