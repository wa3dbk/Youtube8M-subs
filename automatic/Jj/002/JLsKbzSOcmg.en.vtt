 the water the port is at very little water or 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.290
 almost because of the dry 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.060

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.950
 coach mold to caramel is 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.840

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.939
 opening a cooking breakage and it's 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.200
 party 145 245 of amiens have ice cream 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:45.689
 aggressively the cream one lowers the fire 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.310
 in short a whole club and their various funds 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.619
 and yeah, you like that thoroughly 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.600
 early balloons the music is true that at 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.030
 what temperature 117 118 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.500
 we are at 117 and I'm going to turn off 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.000
 couple wants to name time in es6 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.350
 it's really a pastry chef turning a 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.560
 message and never for purpose starts to 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.560
 walk 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.750
 either it's the difference we hold 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.229
 the ashen cook yes of course well 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.120
 sure of course it's promised it's beautiful 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.590
 the satim in cold said before 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.670
 slightly but that's what we mix 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.170
 so that the cooking is the same because 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.340
 that sometimes it can be hotter 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.680
 a place that another needs to improve 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.280
 super pans of compet 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.140
 yes I see that it's beautiful so the beginning 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.150
 a little crazy and especially not 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.280
 why do not we want to incorporate nerves and 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.960
 add the cocoa butter or 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.740
 white chocolate if he did not have any 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.810
 cocoa butter has the same weight yes and there 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.550
 we mix it's nice it's beautiful 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.400
 to one you see that you like pastry 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.860
 customs to hell the cook who 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.270
 is to decide at all is why 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:51.080
 you started to like joseph pastry 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:53.840
 slow food we still trade high 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.120
 of the world in austria could not south of the 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.920
 chalk flap of pistachios butter 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.190
 cocoa is good materials face you 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.260
 lose it here it is homogeneous it's beautiful 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.690
 it can live 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:10.599
 so there he went alone my opinion 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:15.459
 we're going to go on his plate at 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:18.520
 small because pesto so called silicone 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.069
 Here c is normally the hair cell 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.780
 recipe 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.630
 that's weighing with what talent by 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.420
 Chief Regis to cool temperatures 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.090
 fresh minimum two hours on the first 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.640
 it's long after we go from the frames and 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:39.630
 damien it's very cold well comes from a 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.630
 cold at which one dissolves the task 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.370
 it's way less soft caramels like 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:52.370
 I go there because I'm when 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.370
 even a little more signed tac 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:04.030
 a small cube would cost August 6 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.640
 register this charter of amiens 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.270
 is to make a caramel me is slack 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.890
 home 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:14.150
 it's ultra fluffy prague too good this 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.709
 little taste of pistachios but it sticks 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.140
 not in the top by set 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.140
 it's easy elected officials at rates
