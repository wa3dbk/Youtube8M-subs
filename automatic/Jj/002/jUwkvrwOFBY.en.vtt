landscapes or cityscapes it would

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.090 
landscapes or cityscapes it would
typically<00:00:15.809> start<00:00:16.139> with<00:00:16.199> satellite<00:00:16.740> imagery

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
typically start with satellite imagery

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.370 
typically start with satellite imagery
would<00:00:17.250> go<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.430> Google<00:00:17.820> Maps<00:00:17.940> or<00:00:18.300> Bing<00:00:18.869> Maps<00:00:19.109> and

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
would go to Google Maps or Bing Maps and

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.769 
would go to Google Maps or Bing Maps and
kind<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.560> scope<00:00:19.830> out<00:00:20.010> because<00:00:20.670> those<00:00:20.939> are<00:00:21.180> big

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
kind of scope out because those are big

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.359 
kind of scope out because those are big
pictures<00:00:22.320> you're<00:00:22.500> taking<00:00:22.710> pictures<00:00:22.830> with<00:00:23.039> big
