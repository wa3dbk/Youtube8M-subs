gigabytes<00:00:17.279> drive<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.360> an<00:00:18.510> SSD<00:00:19.080> drive<00:00:19.349> using

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
gigabytes drive it's an SSD drive using

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.280 
gigabytes drive it's an SSD drive using
the<00:00:20.040> mlc<00:00:20.900> architecture<00:00:21.900> it's<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.020> little<00:00:22.200> bit

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.290 
the mlc architecture it's a little bit

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.920 
the mlc architecture it's a little bit
more<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.650> cost-effective<00:00:23.630> solution<00:00:24.630> here

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
more of a cost-effective solution here

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.929 
more of a cost-effective solution here
on<00:00:25.110> the<00:00:25.259> chipset<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.860> it's<00:00:25.980> using<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.730> is

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
on the chipset that it's using it is

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.080 
on the chipset that it's using it is
using<00:00:27.270> the<00:00:27.360> latest<00:00:27.509> sandforce<00:00:29.090> processor

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
using the latest sandforce processor

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.729 
using the latest sandforce processor
though<00:00:30.239> the<00:00:30.360> controller<00:00:30.779> in<00:00:31.110> there<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.619> that's

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
though the controller in there so that's

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.819 
though the controller in there so that's
nice<00:00:32.040> but<00:00:32.850> what<00:00:33.540> we're<00:00:33.690> looking<00:00:34.079> for<00:00:34.110> here<00:00:34.320> is

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
nice but what we're looking for here is

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.130 
nice but what we're looking for here is
okay<00:00:35.219> how<00:00:35.640> much<00:00:35.820> does<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.120> thing<00:00:36.180> cost<00:00:36.390> so

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
okay how much does this thing cost so

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.410 
okay how much does this thing cost so
roughly<00:00:37.620> about<00:00:37.770> two<00:00:38.070> hundred<00:00:38.250> dollars<00:00:38.820> us

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
roughly about two hundred dollars us

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.180 
roughly about two hundred dollars us
okay<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.200> could<00:00:40.469> get<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.739> for<00:00:40.890> cheaper

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
okay you could get it for cheaper

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.650 
okay you could get it for cheaper
depending<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.610> where<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.820> shop<00:00:42.059> with<00:00:42.090> rebates

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
depending on where you shop with rebates

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.779 
depending on where you shop with rebates
and<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.020> forth<00:00:43.290> what<00:00:43.770> I'm<00:00:43.920> looking<00:00:44.280> for<00:00:44.550> though

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
and so forth what I'm looking for though

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.720 
and so forth what I'm looking for though
when<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.059> shop<00:00:45.420> or<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.780> test<00:00:46.109> the<00:00:46.230> drive<00:00:46.469> is

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
when I shop or I test the drive is

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.060 
when I shop or I test the drive is
quality<00:00:47.730> right<00:00:48.980> warranty<00:00:50.539> speed<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:52.070> support

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
quality right warranty speed and support

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.099 
quality right warranty speed and support
right<00:00:53.609> so<00:00:53.850> that's<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.449> main<00:00:54.629> thing<00:00:54.659> that<00:00:54.899> I'm

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
right so that's the main thing that I'm

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:56.720 
right so that's the main thing that I'm
looking<00:00:55.230> for<00:00:55.409> now<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.949> course<00:00:56.280> when<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.550> comes

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
looking for now of course when it comes

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.759 
looking for now of course when it comes
to<00:00:56.879> speed<00:00:57.179> you<00:00:57.390> might<00:00:57.539> not<00:00:57.659> even<00:00:57.719> notice<00:00:57.929> the

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
to speed you might not even notice the

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.250 
to speed you might not even notice the
difference<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.309> speed<00:01:00.019> depending<00:01:01.019> on<00:01:01.109> what

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
difference in speed depending on what

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.649 
difference in speed depending on what
you're<00:01:01.379> using<00:01:01.409> the<00:01:01.769> dry<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.399> right<00:01:02.999> now<00:01:03.030> here

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
you're using the dry for right now here

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.800 
you're using the dry for right now here
they're<00:01:04.320> claiming<00:01:04.670> 500<00:01:05.670> megs<00:01:05.940> per<00:01:06.210> second<00:01:06.690> on

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
they're claiming 500 megs per second on

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.390 
they're claiming 500 megs per second on
the<00:01:06.930> sequential<00:01:07.320> read<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.860> write<00:01:08.040> that's

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
the sequential read and write that's

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.120 
the sequential read and write that's
pretty<00:01:08.729> darn<00:01:08.909> fast<00:01:09.240> if<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.630> ask<00:01:09.780> me<00:01:10.050> now<00:01:10.440> there

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
pretty darn fast if you ask me now there

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.580 
pretty darn fast if you ask me now there
are<00:01:11.159> faster<00:01:11.729> drives<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.510> course<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.050> in<00:01:13.290> my

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
are faster drives of course and in my

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.980 
are faster drives of course and in my
benchmarks<00:01:14.250> these<00:01:14.820> came<00:01:15.150> out<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.420> be<00:01:15.510> bang<00:01:15.750> on

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
benchmarks these came out to be bang on

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.440 
benchmarks these came out to be bang on
for<00:01:16.649> the<00:01:16.799> type<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.189> architecture<00:01:17.790> for<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
for the type of architecture for the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.510 
for the type of architecture for the
type<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.659> drive<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.469> you're<00:01:19.590> getting<00:01:19.799> okay

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
type of drive that you're getting okay

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.639 
type of drive that you're getting okay
so<00:01:20.579> it<00:01:21.119> didn't<00:01:21.450> fall<00:01:21.659> short<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.320> was<00:01:22.439> pretty

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
so it didn't fall short it was pretty

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.230 
so it didn't fall short it was pretty
much<00:01:22.860> where<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:23.610> supposed<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:24.030> be

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
much where it's supposed to be

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.179 
much where it's supposed to be
especially<00:01:25.079> here<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> crystal<00:01:25.890> disk

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
especially here in the crystal disk

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.789 
especially here in the crystal disk
benchmarks<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> adil<00:01:27.990> benchmarks

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
benchmarks and in the adil benchmarks

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.520 
benchmarks and in the adil benchmarks
that<00:01:28.829> will<00:01:28.979> show<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.219> later<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:31.350> main

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
that will show you later on but the main

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.050 
that will show you later on but the main
thing<00:01:31.560> here<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.009> how<00:01:32.490> much<00:01:32.670> do<00:01:32.789> you<00:01:32.850> want<00:01:32.969> to

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
thing here is how much do you want to

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.910 
thing here is how much do you want to
spend<00:01:33.299> if<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:33.869> install<00:01:34.200> windows<00:01:34.560> 7

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
spend if you just can install windows 7

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.469 
spend if you just can install windows 7
on<00:01:35.039> there<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.030> have<00:01:36.149> boot<00:01:36.360> up

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
on there and just going to have boot up

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.230 
on there and just going to have boot up
windows<00:01:36.869> 7<00:01:37.799> well<00:01:38.310> you're<00:01:38.759> really<00:01:38.909> not<00:01:39.119> going

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
windows 7 well you're really not going

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.370 
windows 7 well you're really not going
to<00:01:39.329> notice<00:01:39.450> too<00:01:39.689> much<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.020> difference

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
to notice too much of a difference

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.370 
to notice too much of a difference
between<00:01:41.119> certain<00:01:42.119> SSD<00:01:42.719> drives<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.229> that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
between certain SSD drives for that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.310 
between certain SSD drives for that
right<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.640> case<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.479> would<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.229> get

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
right so in that case I would just get

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.830 
right so in that case I would just get
something<00:01:46.740> that's<00:01:46.950> using<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.840> architecture

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
something that's using the architecture

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.050 
something that's using the architecture
such<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.289> this<00:01:49.380> one<00:01:49.619> okay<00:01:50.130> for<00:01:50.399> two<00:01:50.909> hundred

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
such as this one okay for two hundred

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.349 
such as this one okay for two hundred
dollars<00:01:51.509> again<00:01:52.170> us<00:01:52.590> it's<00:01:52.890> not<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.340> bad<00:01:53.640> deal<00:01:53.939> the

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 
dollars again us it's not a bad deal the

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.330 
dollars again us it's not a bad deal the
performance<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.049> right<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.740> where<00:01:56.250> it's

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
performance is right on where it's

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.099 
performance is right on where it's
supposed<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.789> now<00:01:57.479> here<00:01:57.869> are<00:01:57.899> some

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
supposed to be now here are some
