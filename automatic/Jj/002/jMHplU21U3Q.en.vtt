00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.210
 hello dear friends with you as 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.649
 I always Artem Yushchenko site m stream point 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.510
 RU 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.599
 in this little video 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.590
 such a note so let's say I want to tell 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.730
 you about lines pisya express in these lines 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.619
 accordingly we are connected 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.960
 video cards here they look like 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.949
 these blue connectors are so bluish 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.949
 color and with the corresponding locks 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.990
 In this case, I have three lines here. 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.420
 pisya express here also possible 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:39.030
 connect various other devices 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:42.270
 except for video cards in this case there is food 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.180
 smaller express connectors 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.090
 accordingly I am often asked about 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:53.940
 whether it is possible to connect a volume for example 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:57.030
 graphics cards are more older so 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.850
 let's say standard pisya express to more 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.710
 new yes you can have all these connectors 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.040
 backward compatible ie for example y 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.290
 your video card has a standard pisyay 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.340
 express 2 1 and on the motherboard and 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.770
 for example 20 you can connect freely 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.080
 The same applies to new video cards with new 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.400
 interface pci express 30 can also 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:24.560
 install it with motherboards 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.049
 connector 20 and 21 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.369
 What about the work of several video cards 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.340
 have you see that we have a few here 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.860
 connectors exist accordingly 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.829
 each pisyay express connector has 16 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.630
 lines 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.470
 if you use multiple video cards 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.210
 at the same time of course 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.090
 all of these connectors for example two video cards 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.640
 will not work at full speed on 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:56.969
 16 lines they will break depending on 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.619
 motherboard breakdown various then 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:03.479
 If I connect, for example, here 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:08.090
 here are two video cards then in some slots 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:12.750
 they will work on x8 that is 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:17.880
 the connector will work in x8 mode 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:21.330
 and 2 vx 8 aggregate 16 lines this mode 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.660
 for example refer accordingly if y 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.740
 us and 3 connector something is busy then 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:33.440
 the number of lines will decrease therefore 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:40.400
 for example, here it will work in x8 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:41.850
 x4 for example is 12 and for example x4 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.870
 it turns out with us 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.610
 x16 that is, do not forget about it 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.740
 what a few video cards if you 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.600
 set they should work in 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.040
 top performance mode 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.280
 in those slots that give 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.230
 speed with two x8 video cards because 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:04.350
 that ik16 which give in each slot is 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:07.710
 big rarity is in the top various 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.020
 solutions can be used like this 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.120
 small note about reverse 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.600
 compatibility ie radio networks ourselves 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.790
 walls 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.610
 connect them video cards if you 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.080
 use several pieces in connectors with 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.120
 highest performance 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.580
 this is stated in the instructions for 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.930
 motherboard which of its 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.430
 connectors give maximum 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.550
 performance when using 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.840
 several video cards at the same time here 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.430
 all I wanted in this article 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.330
 tell subscribe to the channel 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.370
 put likes 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.650
 I mean, leave your finger up 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.780
