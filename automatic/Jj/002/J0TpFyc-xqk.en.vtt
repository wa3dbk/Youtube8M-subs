00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260 
playing soul with a bunch of you know
not<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.739> great<00:00:37.980> random<00:00:38.430> teammates<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.059> I

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
not so great random teammates so I

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.549 
not so great random teammates so I
thought<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.899> game<00:00:40.020> play<00:00:40.170> was<00:00:40.290> awesome

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
thought this game play was awesome

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.530 
thought this game play was awesome
because<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.040> ran<00:00:41.280> around<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.730> basically<00:00:41.969> jacked

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
because I ran around I basically jacked

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.090 
because I ran around I basically jacked
every<00:00:42.870> single<00:00:43.110> one<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.230> my<00:00:43.350> teammates<00:00:43.710> kills

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
every single one of my teammates kills

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.819 
every single one of my teammates kills
and<00:00:44.340> ended<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.090> dropping<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:45.600> 26<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.440> oh<00:00:46.530> and

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
and ended up dropping like 26 and oh and

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.229 
and ended up dropping like 26 and oh and
the<00:00:46.980> closest<00:00:47.399> kid<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.700> me<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:47.850> my<00:00:47.940> team<00:00:48.120> had

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the closest kid to me on my team had

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.459 
the closest kid to me on my team had
like<00:00:48.390> nine<00:00:48.570> kills<00:00:48.899> or<00:00:49.050> something<00:00:49.289> like<00:00:49.410> that

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
like nine kills or something like that

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.860 
like nine kills or something like that
so<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.070> think<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.760> six-man<00:00:51.180> cranked<00:00:51.510> kem<00:00:51.660> strike

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
so I think a six-man cranked kem strike

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.720 
so I think a six-man cranked kem strike
is<00:00:51.989> absolutely<00:00:52.649> awesome<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.610> know<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.699> was
