00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.710
 this 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.439
 hello everyone today we will talk in 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.619
 sleeve 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:30.140
 It means a feature of this sleeve in that 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.920
 that I performed his version of the cartridges 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.300
 easily replaceable internally sleeve in what 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.440
 its feature let's consider from 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.829
 what it is made of two flanges 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.690
 This cover is the same flange sleeve 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.989
 initial thickness 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.149
 diameter is 8 millimeters then this is ours 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.489
 There is a piston finger to understand 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.940
 marine engine 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.809
 its thickness is 14 millimeters 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.390
 finishes his sleeve 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.179
 only 6 millimeters thick 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.190
 simply means this part of us goes 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:07.250
 intake here we see a pipe 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.070
 Varina and plastinochki I now you 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.860
 I explain what this is all you need I 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.159
 meant according to my cartridge 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.050
 let's look at this sleeve inward 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.560
 here we are here we see the pipe effect 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.899
 in the tube 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.550
 that is, it is the thickness and it is the thickness here 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.619
 we have inserted six millimeter 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.140
 plain seamless pipe 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.470
 polished in the same way itself 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.690
 and the sleeve itself in its common part 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.280
 more precisely cartridge cartridge is ground under 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:43.459
 her why I did it explain our 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.840
 the shaft is made of steel 45 further 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:46.789
 heat treatment is not even more accurate 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.860
 heat treatment I further basically 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.550
 by cementation we need to cement it 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.739
 for longevity work so here by 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.050
 judge of the law where it is thin there breaks 

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:59.989
 it is clear that something should get from us 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.229
 wear either it will be snow or it will be 

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:04.640
 sleeve either it will be if the address is one 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.270
 the same metal screws and it will 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.340
 liner but do every time a new liner 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.140
 make each new time a new person 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.150
 it is inappropriate to simply 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.599
 so for this I came on like this 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.120
 opinion here we put inside 6 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.069
 millimeter ordinary pipe steel pipe 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.590
 3 means see my previous 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.780
 granulators 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.909
 gathered on the basis of such augers here 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.650
 this ready goes this goes worm 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:37.400
 from ship winches I shot them when 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.500
 long ago so that's why i decided to run 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.180
 length and I'll show you already in the process 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.799
 when we show how it all works 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.109
 how does it all spin some all 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.620
 spinning so here on this same 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:52.189
 card sleeve 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.620
 I have already performed this man 6 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:58.519
 tons of dry alfalfa through it 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.120
 grain and feed 6 tons and I still 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:05.510
 still not changed threatening sleeve 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.709
 let skeptics think about pressure many 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.739
 they write me about pellets 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:13.340
 guys wanna tell you this granulator 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.079
 for the manufacture of feed in the first place 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.510
 feed pellets 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.939
 peat what else do you want through it 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.590
 I do not know, I miscalculated him 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:27.200
 under pi years under pellets pellets yes you can 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.730
 do not argue but his goal is a little bit 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.569
 we have another destination from a little bit 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.220
 Other'll show you here again this 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.870
 the side 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.349
 here is our vtulochka and here I will show you this 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.750
 side from gawk our sleeves that 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.269
 us what is this place 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:49.099
 seat is a landing nest 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:53.260
 see you see us in the outside 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:55.870
 the part comes in very tightly snapped 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.310
 answer now show you the side to 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.669
 understand how our madrid comes in 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:05.509
 she is about seven millimeters stupid and 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:09.560
 closed here so stuck here for 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:12.139
 she has already made a special flange here 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.799
 we will still have this class 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:22.520
 thrust springs I will show you why 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:27.639
 see from this side we come our 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:33.800
 bearings bearings repeat again 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:34.610
 6205 ball socket over here 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.790
 pressed together 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.100
 and do not go there tight but comes 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.270
 if you wish, you can put this 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.610
 sample here are roller thrust rollers 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:50.810
 I will put 1 I will have to go about bushings 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.810
 Ball 2 will be already 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.460
 roller thrust bearing for removal 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.850
 loads 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:03.210
 which will receive our sleeves in 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.770
 the process of work means the usual inch 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.550
 trumpet 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:11.700
 tell me the thin give in to me 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.070
 she does not spontaneously mean by 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.540
 another delicate auger through a small 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.960
 my gearbox will be fed into it 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.870
 grain metered metered believe me here 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.060
 no need for her to do with the 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.890
 crushes as there are certain doses I already 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.720
 did it on the previous granulators 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.390
 checked it it works very well 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.490
 she under certain portions auger not 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.100
 overload does not reboot it she doesn't 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.810
 gives him too much let's say all the same even 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.610
 put a hole through such a hole 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.640
 put more does not matter she has 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.500
 you will then push madly who just 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.760
 in vain will do a couple of cue 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.590
 i don't need it i need from me 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.840
 constantly under a certain load 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.980
 this screw job now ask for 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.960
 What are these plates now I repeat 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.880
 thickness we have here in this place bushings 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.140
 bushings 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.550
 non-working sleeves which showed you with 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:04.470
 this side namely this sleeve 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:07.200
 ax and support for liner just 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:10.200
 six millimeters for which they are welded 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.900
 the plates here are the load pressure 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.700
 rather there is no well there is a load go to 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.290
 the one that leads him to break which 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.330
 will try to break this sleeve if 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.290
 we have where to go pellets she will 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.960
 try to stretch it 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:24.060
 over time this place if we have it so 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.800
 way no new straps she can 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.540
 just deform with us then 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:31.660
 having trouble extracting here 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:34.320
 this one with a replaceable sleeve 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:37.300
 for this, she exhibited immediately on it 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:40.030
 scald without these plates after which 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.500
 control already said with 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:46.150
 additional they are brewed only 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:49.210
 here and here they all work 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.670
 just do not give to tear the mechanism back 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.770
 flange flange and the master himself accordingly 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:58.660
 in a circle but also they give you 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:07:01.090
 additional gain means what else 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.160
 but the next video I'll show you already 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:06.550
 build it like it will look like us 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:09.670
 in the final form so already here on the shaft 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:12.940
 as I have said, and we age 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:15.220
 made mechanism now with this 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.560
 side show these here we have here 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.750
 worn under the shelf all this I you 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:23.710
 show already in our next video 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:25.660
 final assembly and will probably have 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.300
 we have one more video I compose 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.520
 honestly it just does not have time 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.000
 the work process will show myself how it all 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:36.900
 going on how it all works 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.900
 wait wait wait
