week<00:01:33.180> which<00:01:33.210> was<00:01:33.420> quite<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.630> nice<00:01:33.869> dough<00:01:34.110> ready

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
week which was quite a nice dough ready

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.690 
week which was quite a nice dough ready
which<00:01:34.439> was<00:01:34.590> actually<00:01:34.890> really<00:01:35.100> good<00:01:35.340> than<00:01:35.549> that

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
which was actually really good than that

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.149 
which was actually really good than that
I<00:01:35.909> did<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.960> bickering<00:01:37.320> between<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
I did like the bickering between the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.740 
I did like the bickering between the
doctor<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.579> Clara<00:01:38.850> after<00:01:39.270> say<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.600> was

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
doctor and Clara after say this was

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.170 
doctor and Clara after say this was
really<00:01:40.259> good<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:41.100> thought<00:01:41.340> Peter<00:01:41.670> Capaldi

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
really good and I thought Peter Capaldi

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.149 
really good and I thought Peter Capaldi
and<00:01:42.210> Jenna<00:01:42.899> actually<00:01:43.110> played<00:01:43.619> off<00:01:43.829> each<00:01:43.860> other

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
and Jenna actually played off each other

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.620 
and Jenna actually played off each other
really<00:01:44.399> well<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.880> think<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.240> kind<00:01:45.570> of

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
really well and I think it's kind of

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.359 
really well and I think it's kind of
interesting<00:01:45.960> note<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.380> see<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.040> cloud

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
interesting note to see that a cloud

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.999 
interesting note to see that a cloud
believes<00:01:47.880> hang<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.960> person<00:01:49.170> has<00:01:49.470> changed

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
believes hang on this person has changed

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.460 
believes hang on this person has changed
into<00:01:50.220> another<00:01:50.490> guy<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:51.060> don't<00:01:51.780> slightly<00:01:52.140> trust

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
into another guy I don't slightly trust

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.039 
into another guy I don't slightly trust
him<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.770> bit<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.520> don't<00:01:54.329> know<00:01:54.420> who<00:01:54.600> he<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.780> he

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
him a bit and I don't know who he is he

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.510 
him a bit and I don't know who he is he
might<00:01:55.229> not<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> same<00:01:55.799> guy<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.189> he<00:01:56.250> once

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
might not be the same guy that he once

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.639 
might not be the same guy that he once
was<00:01:56.790> doe<00:01:57.060> really<00:01:57.270> it's<00:01:57.600> all<00:01:57.780> about<00:01:57.990> judgment

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
was doe really it's all about judgment

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.520 
was doe really it's all about judgment
and<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.240> themes<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.420> judgement<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.110> actually

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
and the themes of judgement is actually

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.980 
and the themes of judgement is actually
faced<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.159> film<00:02:02.430> episode<00:02:03.360> quite<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> lot<00:02:03.810> I

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
faced in this film episode quite a lot I

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.450 
faced in this film episode quite a lot I
think<00:02:04.350> that's<00:02:04.469> quite<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.770> good<00:02:04.950> idea<00:02:05.310> though

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
think that's quite a good idea though

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.270 
think that's quite a good idea though
really<00:02:06.259> although<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.290> did<00:02:07.680> though<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.920> sometimes

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
really although I did though I sometimes

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.859 
really although I did though I sometimes
I<00:02:08.610> felt<00:02:08.819> like<00:02:08.910> some<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.270> dialogue<00:02:09.450> was<00:02:09.810> a

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
I felt like some of the dialogue was a

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.140 
I felt like some of the dialogue was a
bit<00:02:10.110> little<00:02:10.379> bit<00:02:10.500> patchy<00:02:11.069> at<00:02:11.400> times<00:02:11.670> but<00:02:11.879> it

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
bit little bit patchy at times but it

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.520 
bit little bit patchy at times but it
but<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.840> comedy<00:02:13.170> in<00:02:13.319> there

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
but the comedy in there

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.980 
but the comedy in there
I have<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.160> admit<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.459> was<00:02:14.670> solid<00:02:15.180> gold<00:02:15.209> there

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
I have to admit it was solid gold there

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.809 
I have to admit it was solid gold there
was<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.140> lot<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:16.440> touch<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.950> darkness<00:02:17.400> in<00:02:17.640> those

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819

that was in a previous Steven Moffat

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.229 
that was in a previous Steven Moffat
story<00:02:39.060> back<00:02:39.720> in<00:02:39.750> series<00:02:40.410> two<00:02:40.970> during<00:02:41.970> david

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
story back in series two during david

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.180 
story back in series two during david
tennant's<00:02:42.510> first<00:02:42.750> year<00:02:43.140> yeah<00:02:43.770> that's<00:02:43.980> all<00:02:44.069> I'm

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
tennant's first year yeah that's all I'm

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.340 
tennant's first year yeah that's all I'm
gonna<00:02:44.280> say<00:02:44.370> but<00:02:45.300> involves<00:02:45.750> some<00:02:45.870> droids<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:46.260> I

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
gonna say but involves some droids and I

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.990 
gonna say but involves some droids and I
thought<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.620> was<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.769> really<00:02:46.860> unique<00:02:47.400> idea

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
thought that was a really unique idea

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.759 
thought that was a really unique idea
although<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:48.720> did<00:02:48.989> find<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:49.350> out<00:02:49.590> from

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
although I did find this out from

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.290 
although I did find this out from
spoilers<00:02:50.340> though<00:02:50.550> really<00:02:50.790> which<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.090> bit<00:02:51.239> of

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
spoilers though really which is a bit of

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.699 
spoilers though really which is a bit of
a<00:02:51.330> shame<00:02:51.540> during<00:02:51.900> but<00:02:52.080> however<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.650> I've

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
a shame during but however that I've

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.949 
a shame during but however that I've
always<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:53.010> nice<00:02:53.190> little<00:02:53.430> touch<00:02:53.640> awful<00:02:53.970> oh<00:02:54.180> yeah

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
always a nice little touch awful oh yeah

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.490 
always a nice little touch awful oh yeah
it's<00:02:55.620> then<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:56.959> thought<00:02:57.959> it<00:02:58.050> was<00:02:58.110> really<00:02:58.380> nice

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
it's then I thought it was really nice

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.830 
it's then I thought it was really nice
though<00:02:58.830> really<00:02:59.150> it<00:03:00.150> hit<00:03:00.390> you<00:03:00.569> in<00:03:00.600> your<00:03:00.720> face

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
though really it hit you in your face

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.229 
though really it hit you in your face
and<00:03:01.050> all<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.650> it's<00:03:01.950> very<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.430> is<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.640> bit<00:03:03.000> more

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
and all that it's very it is a bit more

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.800 
and all that it's very it is a bit more
slower<00:03:03.780> than<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:05.220> previous<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.360> know<00:03:06.450> Doctor

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
slower than the previous you know Doctor

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.180 
slower than the previous you know Doctor
Who<00:03:06.930> years<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.319> that<00:03:07.410> but<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.590> don't<00:03:07.800> mind<00:03:07.980> that

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
Who years and that but I don't mind that

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.430 
Who years and that but I don't mind that
at<00:03:08.220> all<00:03:08.459> early<00:03:08.910> i<00:03:08.940> think<00:03:09.239> sometimes<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:10.050> does

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
at all early i think sometimes it does

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.740 
at all early i think sometimes it does
go<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:10.920> little<00:03:11.310> bit<00:03:11.459> too<00:03:11.640> quick<00:03:11.940> I<00:03:12.180> think<00:03:12.660> the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
go a little bit too quick I think the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.500 
go a little bit too quick I think the
length<00:03:13.080> of<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.380> episode<00:03:14.000> I'm<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.209> was<00:03:15.330> just

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
length of the episode I'm it was just

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.850 
length of the episode I'm it was just
right<00:03:15.690> though<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.110> they<00:03:16.230> can<00:03:16.560> be<00:03:16.769> a<00:03:16.800> little

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
right though that they can be a little

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.340 
right though that they can be a little
bit<00:03:17.130> slow<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.820> little<00:03:18.000> bit<00:03:18.120> more<00:03:18.720> touchy<00:03:19.049> on

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
bit slow and a little bit more touchy on

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.850 
bit slow and a little bit more touchy on
it<00:03:19.500> certain<00:03:19.829> things<00:03:20.040> as<00:03:20.190> well<00:03:20.370> I<00:03:20.610> think<00:03:21.269> Peter

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
it certain things as well I think Peter

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.020 
it certain things as well I think Peter
definitely<00:03:22.860> has<00:03:23.220> delivered<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.760> good

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
definitely has delivered a good

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.630 
definitely has delivered a good
performance<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:24.930> can<00:03:25.110> tell<00:03:25.470> he<00:03:25.799> really<00:03:26.130> cares

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
performance you can tell he really cares

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.130 
performance you can tell he really cares
about<00:03:26.790> how<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.150> put<00:03:27.480> into<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.750> character<00:03:28.049> he's

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
about how to put into the character he's

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.500 
about how to put into the character he's
mean<00:03:28.440> he's<00:03:28.590> got<00:03:28.920> so<00:03:29.280> much<00:03:29.459> experience<00:03:29.670> it's

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
mean he's got so much experience it's

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.000 
mean he's got so much experience it's
different<00:03:30.989> than<00:03:31.110> Matt<00:03:31.350> Smith<00:03:31.590> where<00:03:31.799> Matt

think<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:53.280> was<00:03:53.400> just<00:03:53.489> apt<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:53.820> was<00:03:54.060> good<00:03:54.269> and

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
think it was just apt to was good and

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.479 
think it was just apt to was good and
that<00:03:56.040> is<00:03:56.220> really<00:03:56.430> good<00:03:56.640> Ben<00:03:57.329> Wheatly<00:03:57.840> has

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
that is really good Ben Wheatly has

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.800 
that is really good Ben Wheatly has
direction<00:03:59.489> it's<00:03:59.670> actually<00:04:00.030> quite<00:04:00.180> good<00:04:00.299> it's

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
direction it's actually quite good it's

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.140 
direction it's actually quite good it's
very<00:04:01.170> very<00:04:01.470> he<00:04:02.160> adds<00:04:02.340> a<00:04:02.459> nice<00:04:02.640> little<00:04:02.850> touches

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
very very he adds a nice little touches

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.170 
very very he adds a nice little touches
but<00:04:03.570> I<00:04:03.890> don't<00:04:04.890> know<00:04:04.980> it<00:04:05.340> felt<00:04:05.609> a<00:04:05.730> bit<00:04:05.760> off<00:04:06.000> at

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
but I don't know it felt a bit off at

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.759 
but I don't know it felt a bit off at
certain<00:04:06.480> points<00:04:06.810> but<00:04:06.959> it<00:04:07.079> felt<00:04:07.290> kind<00:04:07.530> of<00:04:07.590> nice

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
certain points but it felt kind of nice

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.680 
certain points but it felt kind of nice
though<00:04:07.799> really<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.790> way<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.150> shots<00:04:09.480> were

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
though really the way the shots were

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.050 
though really the way the shots were
connected<00:04:10.170> in<00:04:10.260> that<00:04:10.440> as<00:04:10.829> well<00:04:10.890> I<00:04:11.280> think<00:04:11.790> more

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
connected in that as well I think more

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.090 
connected in that as well I think more
fair<00:04:12.299> it's<00:04:12.510> not<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:13.200> best<00:04:13.620> of<00:04:13.980> his

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
fair it's not the best of his

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.039 
fair it's not the best of his
introductory<00:04:14.640> scripts<00:04:15.120> I<00:04:15.209> think<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:15.930> the

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
introductory scripts I think that the

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.250 
introductory scripts I think that the
eleventh<00:04:16.470> hour<00:04:16.530> was<00:04:17.190> a<00:04:17.370> better<00:04:17.729> episode<00:04:18.539> but

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
eleventh hour was a better episode but

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.659 
eleventh hour was a better episode but
it's<00:04:19.410> still<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.620> very<00:04:19.890> very<00:04:20.100> good<00:04:20.280> start<00:04:20.489> before

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
it's still a very very good start before

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.760 
it's still a very very good start before

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
really cool I think as an episode I have

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.690 
really cool I think as an episode I have
to<00:04:58.479> say<00:04:58.630> it<00:04:58.720> was<00:04:58.750> a<00:04:58.840> nice<00:04:59.050> start<00:04:59.410> a<00:04:59.830> little<00:05:00.610> bit

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
to say it was a nice start a little bit

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.719 
to say it was a nice start a little bit
long<00:05:00.930> music<00:05:01.930> was<00:05:02.050> quite<00:05:02.290> good<00:05:02.370> chitin<00:05:03.370> kind<00:05:03.610> of

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
long music was quite good chitin kind of

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.930 
long music was quite good chitin kind of
atmospheric<00:05:04.330> we<00:05:04.600> recall<00:05:04.960> in<00:05:05.080> that<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:06.430> CGI<00:05:06.790> is

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
atmospheric we recall in that the CGI is

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.670 
atmospheric we recall in that the CGI is
not<00:05:07.270> too<00:05:07.450> bad<00:05:07.600> especially<00:05:07.750> on<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.200> t-rex

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
not too bad especially on the t-rex

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.469 
not too bad especially on the t-rex
which<00:05:08.889> was<00:05:09.010> actually<00:05:09.310> kind<00:05:09.490> of<00:05:09.520> cool<00:05:09.700> what<00:05:10.419> I

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
which was actually kind of cool what I

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.090 
which was actually kind of cool what I
did<00:05:10.750> find<00:05:10.930> it<00:05:11.110> a<00:05:11.139> bit<00:05:11.169> hard<00:05:11.500> to<00:05:11.590> believe<00:05:11.919> you

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
did find it a bit hard to believe you

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.400 
did find it a bit hard to believe you
that<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.520> t-rex<00:05:12.940> would<00:05:13.120> actually<00:05:13.479> be<00:05:13.660> behave

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
that the t-rex would actually be behave

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.710 
that the t-rex would actually be behave
I<00:05:14.710> thought<00:05:15.010> you'd<00:05:15.250> go<00:05:15.550> after<00:05:15.580> animals<00:05:16.389> just

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
I thought you'd go after animals just

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.779 
I thought you'd go after animals just
straight<00:05:17.110> away<00:05:17.380> that's<00:05:17.710> my<00:05:17.950> only<00:05:18.160> gripe<00:05:18.610> go

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
straight away that's my only gripe go

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.640 
straight away that's my only gripe go
with<00:05:18.940> the<00:05:19.000> t-rex<00:05:19.389> to<00:05:19.600> really<00:05:19.840> bother<00:05:20.380> than

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
with the t-rex to really bother than

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.050 
with the t-rex to really bother than
that<00:05:20.770> though<00:05:20.979> ready<00:05:21.190> it<00:05:21.400> wasn't<00:05:21.850> a<00:05:21.910> bad

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
that though ready it wasn't a bad

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.330 
that though ready it wasn't a bad
episode<00:05:22.270> and<00:05:22.780> I'm<00:05:22.900> not<00:05:23.139> bad<00:05:23.410> villano<00:05:23.889> to<00:05:23.950> start

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
episode and I'm not bad villano to start

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.430 
episode and I'm not bad villano to start
off<00:05:24.520> with<00:05:24.760> oh<00:05:24.789> really<00:05:25.180> and<00:05:25.360> if<00:05:26.050> you<00:05:26.260> actually

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
off with oh really and if you actually

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.750 
off with oh really and if you actually
watch<00:05:26.710> at<00:05:26.860> the<00:05:26.949> end<00:05:27.100> there's<00:05:27.310> a<00:05:27.340> nice<00:05:27.550> little

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
watch at the end there's a nice little

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.480 
watch at the end there's a nice little
cameo<00:05:28.210> from<00:05:28.479> a<00:05:28.600> previous<00:05:29.080> doctor<00:05:29.500> yep<00:05:30.220> you're

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
cameo from a previous doctor yep you're

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.129 
cameo from a previous doctor yep you're
probably<00:05:30.669> guess<00:05:30.880> who<00:05:31.000> that<00:05:31.150> is<00:05:31.330> and<00:05:31.479> there's

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
probably guess who that is and there's

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:33.810 
probably guess who that is and there's
also<00:05:32.289> a<00:05:32.410> nice<00:05:32.740> little<00:05:33.039> scene<00:05:33.370> though<00:05:33.580> at<00:05:33.700> the

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
also a nice little scene though at the

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.820 
also a nice little scene though at the
end<00:05:33.850> which<00:05:34.210> I<00:05:34.450> have<00:05:34.690> a<00:05:34.720> funny<00:05:35.080> feeling<00:05:35.229> it's

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
end which I have a funny feeling it's

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.550 
end which I have a funny feeling it's
going<00:05:36.070> to<00:05:36.160> be<00:05:36.250> an<00:05:36.340> ongoing<00:05:36.750> story<00:05:37.750> arc<00:05:38.139> in<00:05:38.380> my

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
going to be an ongoing story arc in my

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.830 
going to be an ongoing story arc in my
view<00:05:38.889> all<00:05:39.490> I<00:05:39.580> can<00:05:39.760> say<00:05:39.940> is<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.360> character

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
view all I can say is the character

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.540 
view all I can say is the character
Missy<00:05:41.849> so<00:05:42.849> do<00:05:43.120> remember<00:05:43.419> that<00:05:43.479> word<00:05:43.810> Missy<00:05:44.229> and

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
Missy so do remember that word Missy and

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.890 
Missy so do remember that word Missy and
if<00:05:45.550> you<00:05:45.639> know<00:05:45.789> a<00:05:45.820> form<00:05:46.180> photo<00:05:46.479> shoot<00:05:46.780> or

if you know a form photo shoot or

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.510 
if you know a form photo shoot or
whatever<00:05:47.169> you<00:05:47.349> probably<00:05:47.770> figure<00:05:48.039> out<00:05:48.190> that

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
whatever you probably figure out that

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.629 
whatever you probably figure out that
maybe<00:05:49.470> this<00:05:50.470> character<00:05:51.039> could<00:05:51.250> be<00:05:51.400> coming

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
maybe this character could be coming

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:53.760 
maybe this character could be coming
