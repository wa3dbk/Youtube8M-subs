Heya playas, writing is art that the heart
creates, with a pen in hand and an idea that's

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.890
great. April is National Poetry Month, where
tens of millions of readers, writers, students,

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:18.680
teachers, bloggers plots, artists and writers
come together to celebrate poetry and poets

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.680
just like you. This is The Josh Speaks. You're
watching The Josh Speaks. Writing is how we

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.500
express ourselves. It allows us to capture
the happy, the sad and the reflective moments

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.440
that we experience so we can look back on
them and reflect. Growing up I always found

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.320
myself writing short stories, poems, journal
entries and even spoken word on paper. And

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.170
in the last few years, I've transferred all
my written works to Google Docs but the problem

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.020
with that is that I don't get any feedback,
so they just kind of sit there and collect

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.110
digital dust. But now, there's WritingFloor;
a community for creative writers where you

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.309
can share your writing, connect with others,
and provide and receive feedback. What's really

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.060
cool about WritingFloor is that as an author
you can ask viewers to answer specific questions

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.579
about your work, did the theme make sense?
did it flow nicely? and in doing so readers

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.229
contribute more focused answers to the comments
section. The best part about having somebody

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.279
help you write is that it keeps you in that
writing mindset. You won't find the need to

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:27.389
slack off because you'll have a community
of people behind you encouraging you and supporting

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:32.009
you through life. And I know that a lot of
you guys write, which is exactly why I want

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.599
to connect with you on WritingFloor. If you
have a short story or poem that you want to

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:40.880
