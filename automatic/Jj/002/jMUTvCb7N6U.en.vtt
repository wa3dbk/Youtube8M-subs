00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.079
 thanks for continuing with us we are already in fiction the contents 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:15.189
 dollar and mérida to eduardo gonzález ramírez 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:19.109
 the former director of the pedagogical academic area of ​​the telegenio foundation 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.220
 well eduardo thank you for being with us I satiricos berto 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.269
 for being here 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.019
 this why you have invited us to your program 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.390
 many times the money and the rice 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.800
 Well, here we have a boy 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.059
 very, very special 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.730
 He is called Saúl Adrián Álvarez Tapia 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.970
 to know how are you gmm 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.460
 I believe that here according to 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.879
 then it's his he's a very talented boy 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:42.970
 that well percent and managed 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.930
 and extend percent leader's life write addition and other operations 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.100
 very advanced math for his age because he did it at three years of age 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.240
 is a boy who currently also practice 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.990
 very varied sports too 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.880
 and learn how to at a level that that level j 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.670
 i the day in which the theories that is level equivalent to the first high school 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.190
 and in which he feels very comfortable because 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.470
 exceeds by much 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.520
 the knowledge that the wind would bring if he were taking courses of 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.370
 primary 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.230
 how do you normally take 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.840
 then a very talented boy in all aspects of clear baroque art that 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.460
 yes so you know it clearly that if we do not get used to introducing you to I'm not 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.820
 by iva a saul 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.820
 This one would like first to know you 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.130
 and to ask you what your areas of interest are for the areas that you have 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.500
 what is calling your attention 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.340
 or that die 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.790
 certainly feelings to be able 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.630
 and dedicate yourself to 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.390
 do not 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.310
 mainly the siasia 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.479
 but with kills specifically in the colonies 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.750
 and put them here 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.130
 because you like astronomy math so much that it's what you call the most 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.070
 attention to grammar 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.650
 it strikes me 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.750
 two faces with which you can do 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.460
 I'm banned 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.709
 i how mathematics is explained 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:09.510
 vessel 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.900
 and for example percent I had the experience being with you in full 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.439
 this training partly this training because 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.290
 days somehow we have not been fighting the most or the foundation 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.099
 supporting 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.139
 i 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:25.229
 I'll have taken custom extracurricular math lessons 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:26.309
 advanced 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:30.139
 I discovered for example that you have a great interest in problems 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.580
 that have to do with what to go and the vic bank for example 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.469
 because that subject trembles 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:37.689
 because the head coach like this 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:43.390
 as he medelci the universe none even if it had happened that sabean 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:44.639
 we would be here 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.639
 and how will elber end 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:49.240
 3 who 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.709
 the ticket some form all this will help you stop at some given moment 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.630
 to be able to contribute to society in the future 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.079
 Yes I think so 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.019
 because if 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.459
 you can discover for example 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.359
 that some planets of the solar system for example Tuesday 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.649
 I in my life 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:13.629
 that would be a good place to erect when he the sun sticks an insulator 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.379
 red 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.379
 I took bankruptcy 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.930
 then percent in that sense per hundred 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.569
 There would be many aspects that we can ask ourselves about the future of 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:27.559
 Solar system 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:31.599
 and even of what it holds for plasencia truth now with this act the 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.200
 sports that report are the ones that you like most in character 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.200
 anjara soccer 

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:43.049
 on Saturdays there are not yet a fictional ships 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.469
 trina pond institution 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:47.809
 let it be an oasis chaos 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:50.629
 as a dessert that is a safe school 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.849
 with pump that would be with your tasks to make news ditch jocay 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:56.669
 i because 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.669
 you have what you would like to see there for example 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.149
 al asad boada 

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:04.159
 percent and a concept 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.930
 that those who presented we have worked with him 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.730
 which is the concept of the colossus that was invented by antonio rada that this 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.889
 feel the foundation 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.139
 in math ii that we have worked with him 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.669
 we work at the very very advanced in that sense of the cars 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.150
 to this joins that the tonalá company 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.939
 to fire him basic saul 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:28.259
 specifically the situation telegenia yes the one that activities the 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:32.210
 particularly done to be able to apply in terms of pedagogical technique 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.059
 in the other percent 

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:39.559
 we have tried to create new concepts with respect to what is 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:41.530
 certainly the tension 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.830
 in terms of ied 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.879
 I will go for example he the space where he zampó the classes 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:50.780
 It is a space where we will be taught classes 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.400
 locke we have echoes rename things for example 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:57.650
 Adela Lugo is no longer called Lumpur 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.599
 we call it I learned happy 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.289
 to give it a sense 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.460
 d the game earthquake 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.550
 where children can feel comfortable learning new things 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.529
 a kerik enjoyment that arrives to eta to have that enjoyment of learning 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:14.769
 On the other hand, to the teachers, let's say it's about having a 

00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:16.520
 greater knowledge in certain areas 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.190
 we have named two excited three creatives this means is 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.190
 as a combination of words do not seem even with a very game 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.050
 creative 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.540
 but that has to do with the fact that on the one hand they are per hundred teachers 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.289
 has the store or what is 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.879
 the one that knows more 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:37.330
 and on the other side of those who are creative and who are building and 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.529
 knowledge with children in a way 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:43.020
 I cohen playful and that they can also enjoy 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.020
 that is, we learn from them and they learn from us 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:49.339
 I would like to take something out in that eduardo way 

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:52.739
 well basically the fact that percent yes 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:58.099
 we want to attend this type of guys to this type of d the young man is 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:02.009
 you have to have a very open attitude to their proposals 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:06.209
 because they tend to be proposals that sometimes seem loquacious but in reality 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:09.240
 they have a great sense centuries 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.949
 p 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:12.169
 we have an adequate framework 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:16.550
 in this proper framework would be a framework of stimuli dv of things that call them 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.360
 attention 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.620
 and in which we can systematize a job because if there is no 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.750
 and they systematize an order in things these can not get very 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:25.379
 far 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:28.929
 but if we help each other they can get where they want they can reach 

00:06:28.929 --> 00:06:30.089
 be who they are 

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:31.260
 thanks to eduardo 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.839
 thanks to the support of the others 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:35.639
 we pause 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:36.189
 we came back
