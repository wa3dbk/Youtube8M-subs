00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.850
 yo everybody hello on meshuggah and 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.749
 today we will talk to you from and 82 this 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.950
 here's a little death bath but this 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:13.650
 anti-tank self-propelled gun 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.509
 erased light tank as you know erased 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.150
 enough disgusting tank this one 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.240
 the thing is truly beautiful at the moment 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.150
 comes with update 96 where is this thing 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.539
 Notably Appel saw off the review instead of 300 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.240
 70 what it is now will be h300 and 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.810
 this is a very, very serious nerve of this 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.260
 cars 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.540
 whether he is justified before completely justified 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.910
 completely and completely and I for both hands 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.550
 why I will show you now but by 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.890
 Traditions begin with a tool of course 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.840
 to put another thing here 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.210
 no point but it loses 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.550
 individuality of this machine 105 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.510
 millimeters howitzer m3 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.430
 we have landmines 53 punctures 410 damage 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.920
 and this is on the third level this 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.840
 the ultimate weapon is even on the fifth 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.690
 level is not ashamed to show and on the third 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.000
 it's just murder and there is also a godfather or 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.820
 101 breakdown 350 damage 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.220
 Molly's vodka is simply destroyed as you 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.470
 You can see already two tanks left. 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.050
 just for two shots well i mean 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.420
 one for each no more here on 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.390
 in fact cumulative I played too 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.340
 stage whether 2 whether the third battle report 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.620
 I threw on Enske I think and before I 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.080
 I 'll shoot with cumulatives see how she is 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.750
 In general, I looked and honestly 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.820
 a little horrified this thing suggests 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.540
 such rustling on the fourth level that 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.580
 just nobody dreamed of course 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.300
 machines have flaws this is absolute 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.590
 cardboard is only 160 kb that is 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.990
 even get a landmine 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.030
 landmine with a smaller caliber but not 100 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.220
 millimeters but much less anyway 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.620
 very painful machine gunners punch 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.659
 generally anywhere as long as the range 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.869
 enough for myself shooting from the guard 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.650
 quite normal okay kinda comfortable and 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.740
 2 seconds mixing in two or even three and 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.659
 range in 055 rate of fire also in 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.779
 okay i'm not here by the way rammer 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.690
 and there is a stereo tube repair box and 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:13.810
 masking net well 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.520
 shatsky set in general and recharge 11 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.830
 a half second recoverer would be 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.750
 ten with a little by the way now i'm 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.330
 I'll show you a little minus cumulative 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.500
 I aim the edge of the header mask and it does not 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.080
 punching because 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.000
 no cumulative normalization angle 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.710
 in general, that is, for bestiality to shoot 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.560
 cumulatively bad best 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.200
 sheer planes and of course 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.690
 avoid shots at the tracks in the mask in 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.850
 any other screens for this are better 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.380
 Of course, the land mines will not break but 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.870
 It takes much more damage than 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.230
 cumulative to the cartoon about him not to break through 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.650
 does not cause damage reminding you 350 this 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.240
 average alpha cumulative yes so i 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.090
 t-t-t here did not take it away after all 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.310
 enough and many hp premium for my 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.340
 guns but here allies joined 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.010
 in cm pak 40 thunderstorm third fifth levels 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.290
 leaves with a cumulative here a landmine would cover 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.570
 behind my eyes and now i will show you more 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.020
 one disadvantage is cumulative as you can 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.400
 see by 185 b don't say that 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.800
 smart guy but 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.989
 and he realized what my weakness to watch 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.510
 he stood behind the boxes the thing is not 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.160
 The landfill is not cumulative. The boxes are not punched and 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.320
 he calmly waited for me 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.840
 sold for 1 centner and then just 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.520
 shot me through the boxes respect on 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.590
 in fact, this guy did everything 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.910
 right and now we move on to the results 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.610
 it turned out here to put almost a half 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.650
 thousands of damage is I remind you the car 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.660
 level three we have some 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.600
 eight dozens of such damage can not 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.700
 stable carry and so this baby then 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.070
 oh what she does on city maps 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.200
 plus a little more light medals 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.690
 The main caliber and mark Laz Nasty masters 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.209
 if you look at the team but here 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.489
 it's all clear that fresh tank crews don't 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.470
 understands very much how to apply in this game 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.380
 damage therefore their results are much more modest 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.260
 my clean and got 1027 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.260
 experience and this is for a second level 3 machine 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.030
 Sorry it's very, very much of course 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.160
 it turned out to give a little silver 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.350
 wargaming good but considering that my 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.060
 shooting was effectively practically 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.970
 fully until only one cumulative 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.500
 struck and 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.750
 would go in plus even without a premium account 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.560
 that is, without primo 93 stafplyus 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:27.950
 with prem 18 653 and in my opinion this 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.390
 very fat for such a screaming naked food 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.750
 and farm it somehow a little bit 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.670
 unfairly on the whole car like you 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.160
 could see the gameplay is just an ax 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.960
 lower shoot converge yes shoot 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.710
 kill the enemy roll back to 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.230
 recharge 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.330
 the whole difficulty is that on the gameplay on 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.700
 low levels totally unpredictable 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.670
 you can make two shots your whole 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.320
 the team is already somewhere in the middle of it 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.330
 feeling just around the corner 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.640
 you and here they hop all died suddenly 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.650
 there is a small feature in it 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.410
 still have time to shoot a lot of damage 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.170
 but in general, I supported such a hard 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.450
 nerve giving definitely both hands 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.490
 I'll show you some videos to 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.040
 more complete picture of this 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.530
 car you had but it is very ancient 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.490
 imba and i'm glad that finally her 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.710
 will finish 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.020
 I hope the video was interesting was my own 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.620
 meshuggah good luck in randomness and see you soon 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.280
 meeting 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.280
 happily
