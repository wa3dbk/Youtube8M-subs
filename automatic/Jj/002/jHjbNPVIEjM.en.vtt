00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:04.009 
i'm doing a tutorial on how to make a

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.349 
i'm doing a tutorial on how to make a
really<00:00:05.009> fun<00:00:05.220> pro<00:00:05.490> match<00:00:05.700> class<00:00:06.000> which

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
really fun pro match class which

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.610 
really fun pro match class which
basically<00:00:08.330> makes<00:00:09.330> your<00:00:09.660> guy<00:00:09.870> run<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.380> little

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
basically makes your guy run a little

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.709 
basically makes your guy run a little
bit<00:00:10.769> fast<00:00:11.010> normal<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.790> have<00:00:12.059> super<00:00:12.480> steady

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
bit fast normal and have super steady

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.000 
bit fast normal and have super steady
aim<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.620> it's<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.769> bit<00:00:13.799> like<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.099> cod4<00:00:14.849> promod<00:00:15.059> and

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
aim so it's a bit like a cod4 promod and

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.910 
aim so it's a bit like a cod4 promod and
hit<00:00:17.010> i<00:00:17.160> do<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:18.109> general<00:00:19.109> options<00:00:19.230> basically

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
hit i do it so general options basically

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.939 
hit i do it so general options basically
keeping<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.460> same<00:00:20.670> killcam<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.949> different

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
keeping the same killcam on different

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.609 
keeping the same killcam on different
options<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:24.330> will<00:00:24.480> blow<00:00:24.750> out<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.109> lives

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
options and a it will blow out the lives

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.720 
options and a it will blow out the lives
and<00:00:25.769> health<00:00:25.859> thing<00:00:26.160> that's<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:26.609> because

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
and health thing that's just because

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.910 
and health thing that's just because
you're<00:00:27.029> going<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.240> change<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.990> different

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
you're going to change it in a different

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.429 
you're going to change it in a different
way<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.490> put<00:00:30.330> tunnel<00:00:30.660> on<00:00:30.750> them<00:00:30.900> didn't<00:00:31.199> school

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
way I put tunnel on them didn't school

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.889 
way I put tunnel on them didn't school
them<00:00:31.590> on<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.769> 1<00:00:32.340> 500<00:00:32.940> s<00:00:33.059> that's<00:00:33.630> just<00:00:33.780> a

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
them on a 1 500 s that's just a

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.430 
them on a 1 500 s that's just a
preference<00:00:35.570> schools<00:00:36.570> are<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.809> same<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.260> then

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
preference schools are the same and then

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.840 
preference schools are the same and then
this<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.920> important<00:00:38.280> thing<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.520> do<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.760> you

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
disable all these classes and just make

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.240 
disable all these classes and just make
one<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.040> uh<00:00:42.230> yeah<00:00:43.230> health<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.739> fifty<00:00:44.010> percent

mountain<00:00:55.050> lightweight<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.649> steady<00:00:55.890> aim<00:00:56.070> and

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
mountain lightweight and steady aim and

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.080 
mountain lightweight and steady aim and
in<00:00:56.670> l<00:00:56.789> 96<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.829> if<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.039> toggle<00:00:59.309> pro<00:00:59.789> you<00:01:00.000> can

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
in l 96 and if you toggle pro you can

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.420 
in l 96 and if you toggle pro you can
pawn<00:01:00.329> pro<00:01:00.719> perks<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:02.010> I've<00:01:02.070> done<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.340> with

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
pawn pro perks so I've done that with

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.830 
pawn pro perks so I've done that with
math<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.640> pro<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.120> light<00:01:03.239> approaches<00:01:03.690> here

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
math and pro and light approaches here

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.870 
math and pro and light approaches here
and<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.710> important<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.309> said<00:01:05.549> anyone

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
and it's important to have said anyone

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.190 
and it's important to have said anyone
because<00:01:06.090> that's<00:01:06.240> how<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.450> make<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.840> rescue

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
because that's how you make the rescue

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.590 
because that's how you make the rescue
already<00:01:07.439> small<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:09.030> everything<00:01:09.330> else<00:01:09.479> is

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
already small and everything else is

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.200 
already small and everything else is
just<00:01:09.630> really<00:01:09.960> up<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:11.450> so<00:01:12.450> go<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:14.210> custom

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
just really up to you so go to a custom

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.109 
just really up to you so go to a custom
classes<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:16.110> think<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.619> nice<00:01:16.979> perk<00:01:17.610> editor

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
classes I think it is nice perk editor

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.020 
classes I think it is nice perk editor
and<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.990> want<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.350> edit<00:01:20.280> lightweight<00:01:20.790> pro

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
and you want to edit lightweight pro

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.080 
and you want to edit lightweight pro
from<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.600> one-point<00:01:22.200> not<00:01:22.380> seven<00:01:22.770> times<00:01:23.189> 12.2

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
from a one-point not seven times 12.2

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.260 
from a one-point not seven times 12.2
times<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.630> make<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> little<00:01:25.049> bit<00:01:25.259> faster

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
times to make it a little bit faster

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.490 
times to make it a little bit faster
steady<00:01:27.270> aim<00:01:27.390> pro<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.689> important<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.320> take

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
steady aim pro is important you take

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.080 
steady aim pro is important you take
that<00:01:28.710> down<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.130> weapons<00:01:29.460> ready<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.820> five

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
that down the weapons ready to five

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.620 
that down the weapons ready to five
percent<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.409> it's<00:01:31.530> really<00:01:31.770> thin<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.509> even<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
percent so it's really thin and even to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.910 
percent so it's really thin and even to
on<00:01:33.810> as<00:01:33.990> important<00:01:35.000> and<00:01:36.350> then<00:01:37.350> mouth<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.799> pro

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
on as important and then mouth and pro

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.800 
on as important and then mouth and pro
you<00:01:37.979> can't<00:01:38.220> change<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:39.240> that's<00:01:39.509> basically

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
you can't change so that's basically

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.940 
you can't change so that's basically
what<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.680> need<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.890> do<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:42.619> turn<00:01:43.619> on<00:01:43.649> game

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
what you need to do and I turn on game

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.109 
what you need to do and I turn on game

recording so you can watch our things

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.630 
recording so you can watch our things
back<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.390> theater<00:01:45.750> mode<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.250> make<00:01:47.250> sure<00:01:47.280> you

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.550 
back in theater mode and make sure you
put<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.240> your<00:01:48.270> file<00:01:48.840> share<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.380> you

put it in your file share so that you
don't<00:01:49.740> have<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.979> make<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.460> every<00:01:50.790> time<00:01:51.060> you

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
don't have to make that every time you

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.319 
don't have to make that every time you
er<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:52.130> know<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.280> want<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.700> use<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.000> and

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329
