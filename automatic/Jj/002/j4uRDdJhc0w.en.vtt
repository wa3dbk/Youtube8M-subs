let it go and like apply pressure and
then<00:01:50.270> not<00:01:50.479> you<00:01:51.080> want<00:01:51.229> to<00:01:51.350> keep<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.649> same

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
pressure the whole time and then you

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.990 
pressure the whole time and then you
come<00:01:55.009> down<00:01:55.039> and<00:01:55.520> you're<00:01:55.610> going<00:01:55.729> to<00:01:55.759> want<00:01:55.940> to

both<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.600> better<00:02:02.780> is<00:02:02.960> going<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.229> be<00:02:04.030> now<00:02:05.030> this

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
both the better is going to be now this

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.540 
both the better is going to be now this
is<00:02:05.539> a<00:02:05.569> wall<00:02:06.440> split<00:02:06.800> what<00:02:07.069> you're<00:02:07.159> going<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.310> do

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
is a wall split what you're going to do

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.660 
is a wall split what you're going to do
is<00:02:07.850> they're<00:02:08.630> going<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:08.899> be<00:02:08.959> this<00:02:09.200> split<00:02:09.670> most

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
is they're going to be this split most

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.430 
is they're going to be this split most
likely<00:02:11.150> people<00:02:11.480> are<00:02:11.569> not<00:02:11.780> going<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.019> be<00:02:12.140> flat

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
likely people are not going to be flat

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.620 
likely people are not going to be flat
like<00:02:12.650> this<00:02:12.890> so<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.880> first<00:02:14.120> part<00:02:14.300> is<00:02:14.420> going<00:02:14.569> to

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
like this so the first part is going to

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.320 
like this so the first part is going to
be<00:02:14.720> just<00:02:14.989> enough<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:16.190> back<00:02:16.430> leg<00:02:16.760> your<00:02:17.030> knee<00:02:17.180> is

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
be just enough the back leg your knee is

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.150 
be just enough the back leg your knee is
going<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.510> touch<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.930> wall<00:02:18.110> you're<00:02:18.980> going<00:02:19.100> to

going to touch the wall you're going to

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.670 
going to touch the wall you're going to
pull<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.519> foot<00:02:19.700> straight<00:02:20.120> up<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.480> down<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:21.470> it

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
pull the foot straight up and down so it

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.680 
pull the foot straight up and down so it
like<00:02:22.040> actually<00:02:22.579> go<00:02:22.760> straight<00:02:23.120> down<00:02:23.360> don't

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
like actually go straight down don't

this you're going to pull it all the way
over<00:02:26.630> you're<00:02:27.410> going<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.620> hold<00:02:27.829> it<00:02:27.980> if<00:02:28.190> they're

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
over you're going to hold it if they're

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.460

flat like this they're going to lean

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.920 
flat like this they're going to lean
straight<00:02:30.799> back<00:02:30.980> as<00:02:31.730> far<00:02:32.060> as<00:02:32.209> they<00:02:32.360> can<00:02:32.420> to

straight back as far as they can to
there<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:33.470> wall<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.980> lot<00:02:34.940> of<00:02:35.090> us<00:02:35.269> are<00:02:35.540> going

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
there to the wall a lot of us are going

there to the wall a lot of us are going
to<00:02:35.720> be<00:02:35.959> in<00:02:36.290> a<00:02:36.560> split<00:02:36.920> come<00:02:37.549> up<00:02:37.700> from<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:37.940> little

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
to be in a split come up from a little

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.210 
to be in a split come up from a little
bit<00:02:38.360> will<00:02:38.870> be<00:02:39.019> like<00:02:39.200> this<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.530> be<00:02:39.950> barely

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
bit will be like this and be barely

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.030 
bit will be like this and be barely
there<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:40.940> this<00:02:41.269> is<00:02:41.450> going<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.690> be<00:02:41.840> enough<00:02:42.170> but

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
there and this is going to be enough but

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.949 
there and this is going to be enough but
the<00:02:43.250> more<00:02:43.489> you<00:02:43.670> do<00:02:43.850> this<00:02:44.000> one<00:02:44.299> the<00:02:44.570> better<00:02:44.780> is

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
the more you do this one the better is

to do a scorpion this against the wall
your<00:02:58.400> chest<00:02:58.730> goes<00:02:59.000> against<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.540> wall<00:02:59.750> the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
your chest goes against the wall the

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.410 
your chest goes against the wall the
best<00:03:00.680> kind<00:03:00.950> is<00:03:01.160> like<00:03:01.340> when<00:03:01.850> you're<00:03:02.000> against

best kind is like when you're against
the<00:03:02.540> wall<00:03:02.780> sometimes<00:03:03.140> it's<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.560> little<00:03:03.739> harder

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
the wall sometimes it's a little harder

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.099 
the wall sometimes it's a little harder
when<00:03:04.370> they're<00:03:04.549> little<00:03:04.790> so<00:03:05.420> I<00:03:05.480> always<00:03:05.780> try<00:03:06.079> to

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
when they're little so I always try to

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.660 
when they're little so I always try to
use<00:03:06.260> like<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:06.650> piece<00:03:07.010> that's<00:03:07.190> like<00:03:07.370> sticking

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
use like a piece that's like sticking

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.099 
use like a piece that's like sticking
out<00:03:07.940> from<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:08.299> wall<00:03:08.480> makes<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.870> little<00:03:08.989> bit

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
out from the wall makes it a little bit

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.530 
out from the wall makes it a little bit
easier<00:03:09.470> she's<00:03:10.459> going<00:03:10.609> to<00:03:10.670> push<00:03:10.880> her<00:03:11.000> chest<00:03:11.299> up

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
easier she's going to push her chest up

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.870 
easier she's going to push her chest up
I'm<00:03:12.320> going<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.620> take<00:03:12.769> her<00:03:12.920> leg<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:13.430> I'm<00:03:13.700> going

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
to push all the way until it's pretty

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.140

the<00:03:21.460> best<00:03:21.730> way<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.000> do<00:03:22.450> this<00:03:22.630> is<00:03:22.960> to<00:03:23.620> really

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
the best way to do this is to really

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.590 
the best way to do this is to really
think<00:03:23.980> about<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.670> fact<00:03:24.880> that<00:03:24.970> your<00:03:25.180> hand

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
think about the fact that your hand

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.890 
think about the fact that your hand
needs<00:03:26.350> to<00:03:26.440> go<00:03:26.680> above<00:03:27.580> their<00:03:27.880> knee<00:03:28.150> which<00:03:28.870> is

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
needs to go above their knee which is

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.390 
needs to go above their knee which is
more<00:03:29.200> like<00:03:29.290> their<00:03:29.470> thigh<00:03:29.740> when<00:03:30.250> you're

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
more like their thigh when you're

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.630 
more like their thigh when you're
pushing<00:03:30.640> back<00:03:30.850> and<00:03:31.360> then<00:03:32.080> your<00:03:32.290> other<00:03:32.920> hand<00:03:33.370> is

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
pushing back and then your other hand is

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.000 
pushing back and then your other hand is
holding<00:03:34.210> on<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:34.690> their<00:03:34.840> stomach<00:03:35.350> so<00:03:35.800> you<00:03:35.890> can

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
holding on to their stomach so you can

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.160 
holding on to their stomach so you can
make<00:03:36.190> sure<00:03:36.340> they<00:03:36.580> stay<00:03:36.640> Square<00:03:37.270> and<00:03:37.570> don't<00:03:37.990> end

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
make sure they stay Square and don't end

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.590 
make sure they stay Square and don't end
up<00:03:38.320> going<00:03:38.500> out<00:03:38.680> there<00:03:38.950> or<00:03:39.340> over<00:03:39.400> there

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
up going out there or over there

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.320 
up going out there or over there
so<00:03:41.380> with<00:03:42.190> Emily<00:03:42.580> she's<00:03:42.880> really<00:03:43.210> really

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
so with Emily she's really really

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.960 
so with Emily she's really really
flexible<00:03:43.870> so<00:03:44.590> it's<00:03:44.980> a<00:03:45.220> little<00:03:45.460> bit<00:03:45.580> harder<00:03:45.940> to

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
flexible so it's a little bit harder to

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.270 
flexible so it's a little bit harder to
understand<00:03:46.690> well<00:03:47.440> a<00:03:47.470> lot<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:47.650> us<00:03:47.890> are<00:03:48.070> going<00:03:48.160> to

be<00:03:48.430> like<00:03:48.610> right<00:03:48.820> here<00:03:49.300> but<00:03:50.080> being<00:03:50.500> that<00:03:50.680> she's

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
be like right here but being that she's

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.500 
be like right here but being that she's
flexible<00:03:51.070> I<00:03:51.340> go<00:03:51.490> to<00:03:51.550> here<00:03:51.910> and<00:03:51.940> then<00:03:52.240> I<00:03:52.270> just
