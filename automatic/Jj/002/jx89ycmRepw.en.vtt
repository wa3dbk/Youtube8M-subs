 great success winning several 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.809
 regional championships he did find

 suicide attempt he was arrested at 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.239
 time by Gilbert of the sky director of the

 the space between France and Peru 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.520
 norman having nothing left that the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.899
 hold on land he accepted the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.100
 post of human guinea pigs towards 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.460
 the planet march for a go without 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.469
 return 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.699
 so it's 29 years later in 2040 that 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.899
 norman was the first man to pose the 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.549
 walk on march with this sentence which

 slips whore it's a breed of 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.880
 extraterrestrial shells of which we do not 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.080
 did not even suspect the existence 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.939
 at the same time all the throws of his 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.350
 have been drilled since 2000 23 to 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.880
 cause of jean-marc a disabled motor 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.810
 engaged in the preliminary calculations of 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.680
 dark launches because it does not 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.450
 did not know these tables of 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.070
 multiplication thanks to his talents of 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.150
 field hockey norman managed the throw 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.680
 a representative of the breed of 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.180
 mollusks directly headquarters of nasa 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.009
 by an impromptu chance due to the 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.450
 Lunar gravitational deviation 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.770
 scientists from NASA not finding 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.420
 of utility to this new form of life 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.040
 carbonaceous they decided on the clown and 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.780
 then the market as of 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.860
 support vintage so that all 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.110
 the foci of the planet and then without 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.880
 own in 2050 the species ended by 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.290
 get out of his hibernation extended for 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.729
 to attack the humanity that has 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.200
 forced for years to endure 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.909
 liquid charges contained in 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.909
 Translucent dr containers 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.090
 in 2080 humanity has totally disappeared 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.140
 from the surface of the planet 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.150
 norman is therefore the last representative 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.840
 of humanity alone on March at the age of 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.250
 90 years 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.750
 he managed to survive during all this 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.130
 time in a small cavity ddrrr 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.480
 breathable eating shellfish 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.790
 who caused the end of our species 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.070
 ironically in conclusion if norman 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.580
 had never done video we would have all 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.580
 been killed 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.520
 Oh
