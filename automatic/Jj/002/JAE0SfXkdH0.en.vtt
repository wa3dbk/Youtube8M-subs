where do I put my fingers part of the
lesson<00:01:54.650> so<00:01:55.650> this<00:01:55.800> is<00:01:55.920> GT<00:01:56.280> control<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:56.760> there's

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
lesson so this is GT control so there's

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.330 
lesson so this is GT control so there's
some<00:01:57.030> software<00:01:57.540> right<00:01:58.140> correct<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.740> we<00:01:59.250> have

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
some software right correct and we have

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.010 
some software right correct and we have
a<00:01:59.370> foot<00:01:59.700> switch<00:01:59.910> that<00:02:00.360> connects<00:02:00.720> into<00:02:00.930> the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
a foot switch that connects into the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.510 
a foot switch that connects into the
software<00:02:01.500> our<00:02:01.650> front<00:02:01.920> light<00:02:02.070> dual<00:02:02.280> foot

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
software our front light dual foot

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.920 
software our front light dual foot
switch<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.060> what<00:02:03.180> can<00:02:03.330> you<00:02:03.390> do<00:02:03.510> at<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.720> foot

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
switch and what can you do at the foot

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.540 
switch and what can you do at the foot
switch<00:02:04.110> well<00:02:04.650> with<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.800> foot<00:02:04.980> switch<00:02:05.190> what<00:02:05.520> I

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
switch well with the foot switch what I

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.250 
switch well with the foot switch what I
can<00:02:05.760> do<00:02:05.940> is<00:02:06.120> paint<00:02:06.420> mode<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:06.900> is<00:02:07.050> great

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
can do is paint mode and this is great

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.060 
can do is paint mode and this is great
for<00:02:07.410> scales<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:11.450> see<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:13.080> you're<00:02:13.290> painting<00:02:13.920> that

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
course back to real-time mode and

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.729 
course back to real-time mode and
anything<00:02:59.519> you<00:02:59.670> play<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.000> right<00:03:00.330> there<00:03:00.739> so

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
that's GT control the software is really

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.380 
that's GT control the software is really
a<00:03:03.930> pass<00:03:04.200> through<00:03:04.470> again<00:03:05.250> remember<00:03:05.700> any<00:03:05.940> guitar

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
a pass through again remember any guitar

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.270 
a pass through again remember any guitar
with<00:03:06.570> with<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.050> Fishman<00:03:07.470> triple<00:03:07.830> play<00:03:08.010> or<00:03:08.160> any

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
with with the Fishman triple play or any

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.920 
with with the Fishman triple play or any
any<00:03:08.580> MIDI<00:03:08.850> controller<00:03:09.300> but<00:03:09.510> this<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:09.810> the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
any MIDI controller but this is the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.259 
any MIDI controller but this is the
latest<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.800> greatest<00:03:10.830> in<00:03:11.519> it<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:11.820> it's

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
latest and greatest in it and it's

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.990 
latest and greatest in it and it's
instantaneous<00:03:12.870> isn't<00:03:13.350> it<00:03:13.410> so<00:03:14.130> I<00:03:14.400> mean<00:03:14.790> play

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
instantaneous isn't it so I mean play

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.110 
instantaneous isn't it so I mean play
play<00:03:15.269> something<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:16.019> know<00:03:16.550> yeah<00:03:17.580> the

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
play something you know yeah the

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.560 
play something you know yeah the
reaction<00:03:18.750> time<00:03:18.959> is<00:03:19.290> instantaneous

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
reaction time is instantaneous

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.350 
reaction time is instantaneous
so<00:03:22.350> it's<00:03:22.530> reacting<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.100> decay<00:03:23.459> it's<00:03:23.820> reacting

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
so it's reacting to decay it's reacting

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.890 
so it's reacting to decay it's reacting
to<00:03:24.510> Ben's<00:03:24.750> show<00:03:25.440> us<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.650> Ben<00:03:26.630> alright<00:03:27.630> so<00:03:27.870> I

to Ben's show us a Ben alright so I

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.550 
to Ben's show us a Ben alright so I
actually<00:03:28.200> see<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:29.130> pitcher<00:03:29.640> bending<00:03:30.030> up<00:03:30.180> to

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
actually see the pitcher bending up to

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.740 
actually see the pitcher bending up to
now<00:03:31.560> that's<00:03:31.769> incredibly<00:03:32.310> helpful<00:03:32.550> to<00:03:33.300> explain

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
now that's incredibly helpful to explain

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.440 
now that's incredibly helpful to explain
to<00:03:34.050> a<00:03:34.080> student<00:03:34.650> how<00:03:34.830> far<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.370> bend<00:03:35.610> right<00:03:35.850> so

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
to a student how far to bend right so

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.060 
to a student how far to bend right so
let's<00:03:36.780> show<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:36.989> student<00:03:37.380> a<00:03:37.410> half<00:03:37.590> step<00:03:37.860> Bend

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
let's show a student a half step Bend
