00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:04.939
 i 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.760
 good guys he was trying several 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.579
 little things and finally discover how to make a 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.000
 good glitch should work more or less 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.199
 similar to what is the xbox version 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.449
 I've been using it right for a long time 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.610
 as you save to the xbox about a year ago 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.979
 year and a half and they work exactly 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.719
 equal the slate lic I did not think that 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.250
 it was going to work but I found a 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.440
 way to make it much easier and 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.390
 much simpler well done than my 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.760
 carnal el monte to upload a tutorial 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.560
 but he got it up with a program that 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.659
 It's why inventor but good I 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.820
 I found a faster way to do it 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.110
 no programs that are directly here 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.050
 in minecraft here I am in a world 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.580
 normal I'm just created and as 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.990
 man I am in the mega size that I play 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.220
 it's enough for the language but good 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.100
 in that we are not here to see what 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.409
 is this the tutorial to see is to sell 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.850
 distance to the perfect and good maximum 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.729
 teaches how it is done we make two of 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.979
 depth we put a rail we put a 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.610
 tmt I put a mine cart a 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.960
 tmt and we got on the minecraft and ready 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.900
 As you can see it's very easy there I get 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.409
 perfect if they want to leave simply 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.729
 they press whoever is missing 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.590
 but we can do it inclusive 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:50.600
 so deeper so we can see 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.190
 a little better what is this the former king and 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.940
 well, make us a little better, I would not say 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.520
 for example here we do 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.450
 and we put the TNT to see where it is going to have 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.060
 from there ride and as you can see then 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.280
 the gray works quite well 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.200
 obviously it has its small flaws 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.819
 This is like saying that the rivers of 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.609
 lava do not look all right 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.040
 and they can load in but that's failures 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:18.060
 of the build I'm not sure but 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.349
 good speeches on the desk 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.859
 basically I hope you liked it 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.730
 and for easy to do and nothing complicated 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.730
 done can break the sleeve 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.409
 there when breaking facebook group m here 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.269
 I can be moving if they jump 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.220
 obviously they leave but it is here 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.799
 moving with the main card as they can 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.439
 see I already broke it and then the gray is still 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:44.930
 working even by breaking the path and 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:47.450
 it continues to work as it is very easy and 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.640
 over the world here more things to be 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:56.150
 a lava river there to my magazine 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:57.650
 life and more than anything else I hope that you 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.030
 I liked the tutorial if it was like that 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.739
 forget to give me a like and not 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.889
 we make another video I love them a lot 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.889
 bye
