00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.000
 HOW DO THE REFUGEER WORK? 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Device and way of working 

00:00:11.993 --> 00:00:15.000
 Compressor 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.500
 It consists of an electric motor and a compressor element. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Stator winding 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Rotor 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Carter 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Kolyanov shaft 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Biela 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 Piston 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Compressor element 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.740
 The valves in the compressor element are small metal plates, 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.000
 which open and close the suction and discharge lines of the compressor element 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.640
 When the current flows through the stator windings, the rotor rotates and the piston starts to move 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.140
 when the movement is back, a vacuum is created, which in turn opens the suction valve 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.080
 In this way, a freon from the suction line enters the cylinder 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.380
 When the piston moves forward, the freon in the cylinder is pushed, closes the suction valve and opens the pressure. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 The freon entering the compressor is gaseous at a low pressure of about 0.6 bar, 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:38.000
 When depressing the compressor element, the pressure of the refrigerant is raised to about 8 bar, 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.260
 and its temperature reaches + 100 ° C 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.580
 It goes out of the compressor high pressure line and reaches the refrigerator's CONDENSOR. 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.720
 As it passes through, its temperature decreases to about 55 ° C 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.480
 At the end of the condenser, the freon is cooled and is in the liquid phase. 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.700
 Entering the capillary tube of the refrigerator, the temperature is about 45 ° C at about 8 bar 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.480
 Getting out of it, the refrigerant enters the BUYER with a larger pipe diameter. 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.380
 In this way its pressure drops sharply from 8 bar to 0.6 bar 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.660
 and its temperature is -23 ° C 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.300
 The refrigerant absorbs the heat and begins to boil inside the tube 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.840
 This process leads to an increase in the temperature of the freon 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.740
 and changing its aggregate state from liquid to gaseous 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.960
 At the end of the BUYER the temperature is about 25 ° C and the pressure is 0.6 bar. 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.020
 The refrigerant returns to the compressor via the suction line 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.060
 to repeat the process. 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.840
