00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.440
 there were things to chivas the girls to 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.570
 people people I extract another mod 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.410
 this time it is a super call 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:32.110
 plus 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:33.610
 in English or a little weird the truth in 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.280
 what does this amount consist of, let's see 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.470
 now when creating a new world we will see 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.480
 this new button that is the most superflat 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.400
 more apart from this we can put 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.380
 all the tricks and all this that is 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.329
 new from the 1.3 point one good new 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.720
 it depends when you are watching and if it is 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:53.460
 here you can see that you have this wall 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:57.040
 height when we have our world 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.490
 extra flat what happens is that it has 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.230
 3 I think four blocks that if you give for 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.180
 down you will fall to the ground 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.530
 unlike that now we can 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.220
 put what you give us the win to put 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.930
 for example 180 because yes and block type 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.280
 let's put the one we want as you see 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.040
 there is a lot 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.380
 this time 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:24.119
 a lot of misery melons 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.180
 stone cobblestone harem sandstone 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.130
 plates the woods we have clay 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.770
 we have video we have the balloon we have 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.810
 the villa we have and we have it 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.090
 in Obsidian what is that of the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.829
 hell we have pumpkins we have 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.110
 quite and let's put this men 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.800
 they would be stone bricks and kind of 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.800
 world that put that extra flat 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.300
 if you put and bigger we are not served 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.430
 I do not know why he is 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.090
 We had great and does not serve you put is 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.680
 plane and you give to create a new world and what 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.690
 that are you will create you will not see 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.690
 not to see when they get married 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.659
 a whole world is loaded 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.459
 extra long what would be the extra long 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.680
 and what it does is that you can choose the 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.860
 material that can be very useful for 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.010
 some recreational we will see if 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.069
 there is really 180 this is very useful for 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.950
 some maps and for example want that 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.860
 you can only 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.450
 is going to do gigantic things with 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.269
 this mode can put for example that 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.750
 than from an extra-flat map of 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:37.430
 they 320 up you just heard a 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.430
 as strange noise 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.950
 I know you can not leave the site as 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.950
 who says yes it seems that yes 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.810
 if I have put 182 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.770
 that's the text that gives me that detects me 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.770
 the keys of these rare 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.120
 today I think there are 180 in sheets for 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.290
 work all the installation is very 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.409
 simple 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.390
 execute is the ms to be if you see there is 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.740
 180 and then we have the petro that falls 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.420
 to infinity and beyond 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.530
 so what are you seeing this would be the 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.470
 trox time and the 180 that we have destroyed 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.140
 a moment ago and you can put this 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.580
 with the materials they offer us for 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.840
 be the very simple download vais from 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.170
 dmc to be that you have it the 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.970
 description 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.220
 and it's very easy to install, you have 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.480
 also a tutorial in the description 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.010
 and the only thing you have to do is 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.750
 download that link from the description and 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.870
 instead of putting what comes out in the video 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.090
 which is redirected to the description then 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.030
 you put the superflat plus plus so 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.620
 nothing guys is typical of this mod smoot 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.150
 the truth is not very useful as he says 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.200
 for people who want to play at 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.700
 minecraft but there are people who want 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.210
 make maps and all this because you can 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.600
 be useful and it's quite interesting 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.070
 consigned guys 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.260
 given hope you do not forget to give 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.650
 Favorite lay is already coming 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.650
 goodbye
