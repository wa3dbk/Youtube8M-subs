foundation single crochet I know I've
already<00:00:05.430> made<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.000> video<00:00:06.359> on<00:00:06.600> how<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.960> do<00:00:07.259> that

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
already made a video on how to do that

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.860 
already made a video on how to do that
but<00:00:08.189> there<00:00:08.400> are<00:00:08.519> two<00:00:08.700> ways<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.150> do<00:00:09.330> it<00:00:09.360> just

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
but there are two ways to do it just

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.049 
but there are two ways to do it just
like<00:00:10.110> there<00:00:10.380> are<00:00:10.410> several<00:00:10.769> ways<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.519> work<00:00:11.759> into

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
like there are several ways to work into

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.049 
like there are several ways to work into
a<00:00:12.090> foundation<00:00:12.750> chain<00:00:13.049> now<00:00:13.740> this<00:00:14.009> sample<00:00:14.880> right

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
a foundation chain now this sample right

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.109 
a foundation chain now this sample right
here<00:00:15.240> I've<00:00:15.839> made<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> regular<00:00:17.279> normal

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119

foundation<00:00:18.330> chain<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:20.220> worked<00:00:20.490> into<00:00:20.939> the

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
foundation chain and I worked into the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.320 
foundation chain and I worked into the
chain<00:00:21.359> for<00:00:22.170> these<00:00:22.289> first<00:00:22.650> six<00:00:23.220> stitches

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
I worked into the back bump on the chain

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.580 
I worked into the back bump on the chain
making<00:00:28.890> these<00:00:29.099> little<00:00:29.279> fees<00:00:29.929> then<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.109> second

six<00:00:31.859> stitches<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.640> did<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.149> worked<00:00:33.450> under

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
six stitches that I did I worked under

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.580 
six stitches that I did I worked under
two<00:00:34.079> loops<00:00:34.410> which<00:00:35.280> left<00:00:35.640> only<00:00:35.910> one<00:00:36.780> loop<00:00:37.350> on

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
two loops which left only one loop on

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.959 
two loops which left only one loop on
the<00:00:37.950> edge<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:39.079> the<00:00:40.079> piece<00:00:40.350> depending<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.670> what

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
the edge of the piece depending on what

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.760 
the edge of the piece depending on what
you<00:00:42.239> were<00:00:42.600> making<00:00:44.570> it<00:00:45.570> depends<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.230> how<00:00:46.710> you

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
you were making it depends on how you

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.910 
you were making it depends on how you
want<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.280> work<00:00:47.430> these<00:00:47.700> stitches<00:00:48.590> now<00:00:49.590> for<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
want to work these stitches now for the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.260 
want to work these stitches now for the
foundation<00:00:51.350> single<00:00:52.350> crochet<00:00:55.550> in<00:00:56.550> my<00:00:56.850> first

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
foundation single crochet in my first

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.080 
foundation single crochet in my first
original<00:00:57.870> video<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.620> don't<00:00:59.460> think<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.879> showed

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
original video I don't think I showed

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.689 
original video I don't think I showed
you<00:01:00.300> how<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.690> start<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.980> didn't<00:01:02.550> really

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
you how to start it I didn't really

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.410 
you how to start it I didn't really
focus<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.799> so<00:01:04.799> how<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.220> start<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.970> you

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
focus on that so how to start it you

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.620 
focus on that so how to start it you
should<00:01:06.600> make<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.930> loose<00:01:07.320> Slipknot<00:01:08.360> some<00:01:09.360> people

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
should make a loose Slipknot some people

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.490 
should make a loose Slipknot some people
yarn<00:01:10.020> up<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.920> their<00:01:11.070> finger<00:01:11.340> twice<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:13.200> do<00:01:13.380> it

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
yarn up for their finger twice and do it

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.120 
yarn up for their finger twice and do it
this<00:01:13.680> way<00:01:15.110> and<00:01:16.110> they<00:01:16.290> pull<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.619> loop<00:01:16.830> tight

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
this way and they pull that loop tight

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.160 
this way and they pull that loop tight
but<00:01:17.670> instead<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.150> pulling<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.600> loop<00:01:18.840> tight

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
but instead of pulling that loop tight

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.420 
but instead of pulling that loop tight
flip<00:01:20.070> your<00:01:20.310> chain<00:01:20.610> over<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:22.280> there's<00:01:23.280> your

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
flip your chain over and there's your

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.130 
flip your chain over and there's your
loose<00:01:23.610> Slipknot<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.540> would<00:01:24.689> work<00:01:24.900> into

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
loose Slipknot and you would work into

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.050 
loose Slipknot and you would work into
that<00:01:25.880> okay<00:01:27.229> my<00:01:28.229> way<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:28.950> do<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.939> a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
that okay my way I do it it's just a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.690 
that okay my way I do it it's just a
little<00:01:30.299> different<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.470> me<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:31.860> easier<00:01:32.369> I

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
little different and to me it's easier I

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.429 
little different and to me it's easier I
go<00:01:33.329> behind<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:35.460> working<00:01:35.880> yarn<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.509> do<00:01:36.570> 180

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
go behind the working yarn and I do 180

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.780 
go behind the working yarn and I do 180
degree<00:01:37.770> twist<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.579> then<00:01:39.329> with<00:01:39.509> my<00:01:40.610> thumb<00:01:41.610> and

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
degree twist and then with my thumb and

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.870 
degree twist and then with my thumb and
middle<00:01:41.880> finger<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.329> hold<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.110> twist

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
middle finger I hold on to that twist

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.510 
middle finger I hold on to that twist
and<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.000> make<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> chain<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.229> then<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.040> turn<00:01:47.340> it

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
and I make a chain and then I turn it

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.660 
and I make a chain and then I turn it
over<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.380> it's<00:01:49.380> not<00:01:49.500> twisted<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.369> then<00:01:50.549> you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
over so it's not twisted and then you

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.969 
over so it's not twisted and then you
can<00:01:50.880> see<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.570> little<00:01:52.110> twist<00:01:52.470> down<00:01:52.710> there

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
can see that little twist down there

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.090 
can see that little twist down there
that's<00:01:53.759> important<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.329> keep<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> hold<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.990> that

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
that's important to keep a hold of that

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.719 
that's important to keep a hold of that
then<00:01:56.100> for<00:01:56.280> single<00:01:56.640> crochet<00:01:57.060> chain<00:01:57.960> one<00:01:58.729> then

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
then for single crochet chain one then

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.380 
then for single crochet chain one then
we're<00:01:59.939> going<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.210> work<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.899> chain<00:02:01.829> into<00:02:02.820> that

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
we're going to work a chain into that

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.959 
we're going to work a chain into that
Slipknot<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:05.070> I'm<00:02:05.189> going<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.430> go<00:02:05.520> into<00:02:05.729> that

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
Slipknot so I'm going to go into that

through<00:02:19.250> two<00:02:20.379> now<00:02:21.379> if<00:02:21.739> we're<00:02:21.980> going<00:02:22.099> to<00:02:22.159> make

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
through two now if we're going to make

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.309 
through two now if we're going to make
it<00:02:22.400> look<00:02:22.790> like<00:02:23.030> we<00:02:23.239> worked<00:02:23.450> into<00:02:23.780> that<00:02:23.930> back

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
it look like we worked into that back

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.770 
it look like we worked into that back
bump<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.220> chain<00:02:25.519> we<00:02:26.299> need<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:26.629> go

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
bump of the chain we need to go

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.670 
bump of the chain we need to go
underneath<00:02:27.140> two<00:02:28.010> loops<00:02:28.579> of<00:02:28.879> that<00:02:29.269> chain<00:02:29.720> if

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
underneath two loops of that chain if

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.809 
underneath two loops of that chain if
you<00:02:30.799> look<00:02:32.170> okay<00:02:33.170> this<00:02:33.439> is<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:34.099> chain<00:02:34.519> that<00:02:34.790> I

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
you look okay this is the chain that I

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.780 
you look okay this is the chain that I
made<00:02:35.120> this<00:02:35.299> is<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.659> Slipknot<00:02:36.459> this<00:02:37.459> is<00:02:37.640> the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
made this is the Slipknot this is the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.690 
made this is the Slipknot this is the
chain<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:39.230> go<00:02:39.349> under<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:39.890> front<00:02:40.159> loop<00:02:40.280> there

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
chain you go under the front loop there

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.559 
chain you go under the front loop there
and<00:02:41.000> then<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.299> one<00:02:41.510> behind<00:02:41.870> it<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:44.120> draw<00:02:44.389> up

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
and then the one behind it and draw up

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.470 
and then the one behind it and draw up
your<00:02:44.599> loop<00:02:45.019> and<00:02:46.810> chain<00:02:47.810> one<00:02:49.090> then<00:02:50.090> you<00:02:50.269> yarn

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
your loop and chain one then you yarn

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.970 
your loop and chain one then you yarn
over<00:02:50.989> and<00:02:51.230> draw<00:02:51.950> through<00:02:52.250> two<00:02:53.799> gonna<00:02:54.799> make

okay<00:03:50.510> those<00:03:50.750> are<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:51.080> six<00:03:51.470> that<00:03:51.860> I<00:03:51.890> made<00:03:52.190> to

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
okay those are the six that I made to

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.910 
okay those are the six that I made to
look<00:03:52.700> like<00:03:53.090> I<00:03:53.540> worked<00:03:54.080> in<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.380> back<00:03:54.590> bump

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
look like I worked in the back bump

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:03.340 
look like I worked in the back bump
homely<00:03:56.920> and<00:03:58.450> there's<00:03:59.450> your<00:03:59.690> bottom<00:04:00.020> edge<00:04:02.350> and

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
homely and there's your bottom edge and

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.790 
homely and there's your bottom edge and
then<00:04:03.680> here's<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.220> back<00:04:05.200> now<00:04:06.200> this<00:04:06.560> still

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
then here's the back now this still

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.130 
then here's the back now this still
looks<00:04:06.980> walking<00:04:07.550> here<00:04:07.750> so<00:04:08.750> what<00:04:08.900> you're<00:04:09.050> going

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
looks walking here so what you're going

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.770 
looks walking here so what you're going
to<00:04:09.200> do<00:04:09.290> is<00:04:09.410> hold<00:04:09.650> on<00:04:09.890> to<00:04:10.070> that<00:04:10.250> be<00:04:11.209> at<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.600> top

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
to do is hold on to that be at the top

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.040 
to do is hold on to that be at the top
of<00:04:11.810> your<00:04:12.110> first<00:04:12.350> single<00:04:12.590> crochet<00:04:13.840> pull<00:04:14.840> that

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
of your first single crochet pull that

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.340 
of your first single crochet pull that
tight<00:04:15.700> that<00:04:16.700> makes<00:04:17.090> your<00:04:17.299> slipknot<00:04:17.750> actually

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
tight that makes your slipknot actually

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.180 
tight that makes your slipknot actually
a<00:04:18.380> knot<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:20.780> that<00:04:20.989> evened<00:04:21.530> it<00:04:21.620> up<00:04:21.829> nicely

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
a knot and that evened it up nicely

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.610 
a knot and that evened it up nicely
because<00:04:22.760> you<00:04:23.000> still<00:04:23.270> have<00:04:23.480> that<00:04:23.660> chain<00:04:24.290> one<00:04:24.500> on

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
because you still have that chain one on

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.490 
because you still have that chain one on
the<00:04:24.770> end<00:04:25.010> here<00:04:25.310> and<00:04:28.480> it<00:04:29.480> doesn't<00:04:30.080> look<00:04:30.290> like

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
the end here and it doesn't look like

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.840 
the end here and it doesn't look like
you<00:04:30.620> have<00:04:30.740> two<00:04:30.890> stitches<00:04:31.310> on<00:04:31.340> one<00:04:31.640> at<00:04:31.760> the

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
you have two stitches on one at the

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.780 
you have two stitches on one at the
beginning<00:04:32.560> so<00:04:33.560> now<00:04:33.860> if<00:04:34.100> you<00:04:34.250> want<00:04:34.430> to<00:04:34.520> make<00:04:34.669> it

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
beginning so now if you want to make it

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.420 
beginning so now if you want to make it
look<00:04:34.940> like<00:04:35.120> it<00:04:35.330> worked<00:04:35.510> through<00:04:35.780> two<00:04:36.080> loops<00:04:36.440> on

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
look like it worked through two loops on

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.510 
look like it worked through two loops on
my<00:04:37.870> when<00:04:38.870> I<00:04:38.900> actually<00:04:39.470> work<00:04:39.890> into<00:04:40.130> a<00:04:40.160> chain

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
my when I actually work into a chain

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.600 
my when I actually work into a chain
wanna<00:04:41.090> work<00:04:41.360> for<00:04:41.660> two<00:04:41.840> loops<00:04:42.110> it<00:04:42.830> gets<00:04:43.100> really

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
wanna work for two loops it gets really

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.960 
wanna work for two loops it gets really
tight<00:04:44.320> but<00:04:45.320> for<00:04:45.650> my<00:04:45.830> foundation<00:04:46.070> single

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
tight but for my foundation single

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.480 
tight but for my foundation single
crochet<00:04:47.600> working<00:04:48.440> through<00:04:48.680> two<00:04:48.919> loops<00:04:49.130> it's

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
crochet working through two loops it's

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.900 
crochet working through two loops it's
really<00:04:50.060> loose<00:04:50.380> so<00:04:51.520> that's<00:04:52.520> something<00:04:52.820> that

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
really loose so that's something that

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.610 
really loose so that's something that
comes<00:04:53.150> with<00:04:53.300> practice<00:04:53.630> I'm<00:04:54.020> getting<00:04:54.350> it<00:04:54.470> the

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
comes with practice I'm getting it the

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.360 
comes with practice I'm getting it the
way<00:04:54.740> in<00:04:54.890> one<00:04:55.100> so<00:04:55.910> what<00:04:56.510> we're<00:04:56.660> going<00:04:56.780> to<00:04:56.840> do<00:04:57.020> is

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
way in one so what we're going to do is

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.010 
way in one so what we're going to do is
opposite<00:04:58.370> okay<00:04:59.180> if<00:04:59.360> you<00:04:59.479> want<00:04:59.660> it<00:04:59.750> to<00:04:59.840> look

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
opposite okay if you want it to look

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.480 
opposite okay if you want it to look
like<00:05:00.080> it<00:05:00.380> works<00:05:00.530> through<00:05:00.710> two<00:05:00.919> loops<00:05:01.100> you<00:05:01.310> work

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
like it works through two loops you work

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.790 
like it works through two loops you work
through<00:05:01.760> one<00:05:02.000> because<00:05:02.990> we're<00:05:03.169> working<00:05:03.500> on<00:05:03.650> the

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
through one because we're working on the

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.730 
through one because we're working on the
other<00:05:03.950> side<00:05:04.400> of<00:05:04.640> the<00:05:04.790> chain<00:05:05.120> then<00:05:05.600> what<00:05:05.840> you

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
other side of the chain then what you

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.810 
other side of the chain then what you
would<00:05:08.650> insert<00:05:09.650> your<00:05:09.800> hook<00:05:09.950> draw<00:05:10.190> up<00:05:10.430> a<00:05:10.580> loop

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
would insert your hook draw up a loop

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.580 
would insert your hook draw up a loop
under<00:05:11.390> one<00:05:11.890> chain<00:05:12.890> one<00:05:13.870> yarn<00:05:14.870> over<00:05:15.350> draw

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
under one chain one yarn over draw

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.370 
under one chain one yarn over draw
through<00:05:16.010> two<00:05:16.310> then<00:05:16.750> you<00:05:17.750> want<00:05:17.960> to<00:05:18.020> go<00:05:18.140> into

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
through two then you want to go into

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.130 
through two then you want to go into
that<00:05:18.560> chain<00:05:19.040> again<00:05:19.630> under<00:05:20.630> one<00:05:20.900> drop<00:05:21.890> a<00:05:21.919> loop

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
that chain again under one drop a loop

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.800 
that chain again under one drop a loop
chain<00:05:24.140> one<00:05:24.910> and<00:05:25.910> draw<00:05:26.240> through<00:05:26.479> two

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
chain one and draw through two

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.869 
chain one and draw through two
under<00:05:28.810> one<00:05:29.050> whip<00:05:29.669> trouble<00:05:30.669> live<00:05:31.139> chain<00:05:32.139> one

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:32.879 
under one whip trouble live chain one

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:38.779 
under one whip trouble live chain one
draw<00:05:33.879> 30<00:05:35.039> after<00:05:36.039> one<00:05:36.389> all<00:05:37.389> the<00:05:37.659> loop<00:05:37.930> chain<00:05:38.710> 1

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
draw 30 after one all the loop chain 1

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:46.050 
draw 30 after one all the loop chain 1
draw<00:05:39.789> sir<00:05:40.029> -<00:05:42.719> and<00:05:43.719> you<00:05:43.990> can<00:05:44.229> do<00:05:44.439> that<00:05:44.680> for<00:05:45.400> how

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
draw sir - and you can do that for how

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.700 
draw sir - and you can do that for how
many<00:05:46.300> of<00:05:46.479> our<00:05:46.569> stitches<00:05:47.020> you<00:05:47.169> want<00:05:47.349> to<00:05:47.469> make

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.950 

and<00:05:52.590> it<00:05:53.789> now<00:05:54.789> you<00:05:54.849> see<00:05:55.180> there's<00:05:55.389> just<00:05:55.449> one

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
and it now you see there's just one

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.730 
and it now you see there's just one
strand<00:05:56.560> on<00:05:57.279> the<00:05:57.340> bottom<00:05:57.759> edge<00:05:57.969> and<00:05:58.539> it's<00:05:59.169> much

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
strand on the bottom edge and it's much

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.959 
strand on the bottom edge and it's much
looser<00:06:00.689> then<00:06:01.689> when<00:06:01.930> I<00:06:01.960> actually<00:06:02.319> worked

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:02.969 
looser then when I actually worked

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:06.420 
looser then when I actually worked
through<00:06:03.969> both<00:06:04.180> loops<00:06:04.830> on<00:06:05.830> a<00:06:05.860> regular

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
through both loops on a regular

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.529 
through both loops on a regular
foundation<00:06:08.400> chain<00:06:09.400> here<00:06:09.729> and<00:06:09.759> got<00:06:10.060> it<00:06:10.180> upside

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
foundation chain here and got it upside

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:14.999 
foundation chain here and got it upside
down<00:06:10.779> here<00:06:11.729> so<00:06:12.729> that<00:06:13.349> this<00:06:14.349> is<00:06:14.409> where<00:06:14.770> I<00:06:14.800> worked

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:15.009 
down here so that this is where I worked

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:16.890 
down here so that this is where I worked
through<00:06:15.370> two<00:06:15.610> loops<00:06:15.849> and<00:06:16.210> it<00:06:16.330> made<00:06:16.479> it<00:06:16.629> really

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
through two loops and it made it really

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.230 
through two loops and it made it really
tight<00:06:17.529> and<00:06:17.919> it's<00:06:18.159> not<00:06:18.430> near<00:06:18.819> it's<00:06:19.060> not

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
tight and it's not near it's not

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.980 
tight and it's not near it's not
stretchy<00:06:19.569> at<00:06:19.779> all<00:06:20.219> whereas<00:06:21.219> on<00:06:21.520> this<00:06:21.879> one<00:06:22.449> it's

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
stretchy at all whereas on this one it's

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.929 
stretchy at all whereas on this one it's
a<00:06:23.439> lot<00:06:23.740> stretchier<00:06:24.490> and<00:06:24.699> this<00:06:25.509> loop<00:06:25.810> is<00:06:26.020> looser

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:26.939 
a lot stretchier and this loop is looser

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:32.369 
a lot stretchier and this loop is looser
so<00:06:27.939> those<00:06:28.180> are<00:06:30.180> tips<00:06:31.180> for<00:06:31.539> your<00:06:31.689> foundation

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:32.379 
so those are tips for your foundation

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:36.899 
so those are tips for your foundation
