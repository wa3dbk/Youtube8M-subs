00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.570
 the banda agreement will undergo a total change for the new year the very 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.569
 popular mid-size sedan has undergone a facelift 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.120
 and the 2008 version is entirely new 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.120
 with the lack of new dimensions with a new motorization 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.870
 physically first of all its dimensions have become significantly more imposing the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.050
 gold length all of the new generation now reaches 76 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.060
 millimeters more than the 2007 version 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.880
 in addition to its dimensions the new honda agreement benefits from a remodeling 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.690
 complete of these lines 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.569
 in the front 

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:40.019
 we have a profile is more the hood lengthening the front part and removing 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.910
 slightly fardc in the lateral edges the objective 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.690
 to make the nose of the car sharper 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.140
 finally gives it a more aggressive look and a distinct presence 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.590
 stronger on the road 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.720
 a very successful exercise especially thanks to the addition of the 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.600
 chrome grille that looks like it's borrowing directly from the corner of the table 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.570
 on the other hand from the back part and less successful 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.229
 the arrangement of the trunk headlights pdg strangely gold it fits worse 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.090
 in this new personality 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.090
 but like two drops and colors we do not discuss 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.150
 we can not, however, to put later 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.070
 in kinship with that of the acura been obvious 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.480
 the whole is quite loaded and gives the impression that we wanted to gather the 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.350
 maximum of commands in a small space for the driver a single flat 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.400
 the central panel of the dashboard becomes too complex and uniform 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.480
 fails to identify the right switches when we roll 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.670
 why do complex 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.200
 when one is hansen master than the cities 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.670
 it will be necessary to distinguish palette of colors and forms the various 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.670
 commands to make driving more user-friendly 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.410
 our test vehicle and to be equipped with a navigation system 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.229
 his manipulation as well as his consultation 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.260
 have proved quite easy 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.150
 to avoid harming driving 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.370
 last word on seats they offer immediate lateral comfort 

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.139
 even under the most demanding conditions 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.879
 and the rear passengers also benefits from this space and this 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:16.629
 comfort 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.819
 while having easier access to the interior 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:20.620
 in front 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.870
 not insignificant detail the loading space allows to transport all 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.570
 the luggage of the little family while the hood finally the easy space to 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.819
 mechanical components 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.399
 but the agreement has also grown in power since the new engines 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:38.529
 honda some of which are not adaptations of the older generation 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:41.249
 we can also strongly progress 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:43.219
 in basic l ex version 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.909
 the tuner sedan receive a 4-cylinder engine of 2 10 and 2 4 liters 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.629
 inspired by last year's motor and an adaptation of that same 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.679
 engine without increasing power on the version it passes 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:59.179
 all this motorization what it takes for between accelerations 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.950
 frank the effective occasions 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.339
 and comfortable daily rolling 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:08.659
 the new agreement has a few defects but in 4-cylinder version 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.639
 continues to dominate the pack
