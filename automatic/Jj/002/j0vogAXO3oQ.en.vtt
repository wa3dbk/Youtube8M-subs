00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.970
 and now greetings of xativa and good 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.850
 well speaking a little about the image or 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.070
 hand first that nothing that photo 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.409
 he showed politico.com the medals 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.299
 I had seen it somewhere in 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:16.279
 white and as you see is in this part of 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:21.080
 every in this vision that is television 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:23.840
 I think that when mason escapes from his 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.440
 aggressors and just from the same image as 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:31.039
 it's like a war hero in his hand 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.440
 the image that is in this gameplay 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.940
 collective plague is the same or that there 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.640
 thank you very much asked that hand of 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.649
 who is that hand of those who come from 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.050
 who love or who leaves on the page 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.870
 of call of duty dotcom good as you see 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.120
 the image many told me that the hand 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.350
 of webs that search for websites 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.030
 and good 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.969
 I'm not assuring that the hand of 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.339
 books but I could do it because bush 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.260
 also this is a supposedly hero 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.030
 of war in what is the tops and also 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.539
 we assume that he has medals what 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.350
 we could assume that supposedly 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.690
 black ops 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.160
 batanga book I may not remember that 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.080
 it's a video game suddenly there's a 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.390
 bullet I do not know 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.250
 and did not kill him or do not give you a news 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.830
 but the theory that many of you 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.290
 say is very good so I decided 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.060
 record this part of view and gameplay of 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.460
 the dead to see the medals 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.180
 there and on the other hand to compare if it is 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:31.670
 books or I'm not betting 90% of 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.890
 that maybe we'll see books in two and 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.240
 well then we can learn more what 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:42.380
 it happened because some I'm very excited 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.960
 but suddenly it's only 90% of christ 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.270
 jacobs since we are going to see what happens 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.580
 we are not going to see what happens and it is not 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.810
 masochist is not mason is called the 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.030
 books so I say goodbye xÃ tiva suite 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.670

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.340

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.450

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.770
 tattoo of books is from the og 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.840

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.759
