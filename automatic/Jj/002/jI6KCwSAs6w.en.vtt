00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.370
 noticed in previous releases of all of them 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.069

 priests were considered the same or thousands of people 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.849
 perhaps the most interesting of all for 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:49.220
 he covers himself with a huge shield 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.729

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.229
 use combat magic to destroy 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:57.379

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.810
 norm in gloomy worlds made by 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.330
 the image and likeness of the well-known 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.130
 science fiction lovecraft also said that 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.840
 because of the unfriendly environment 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.550

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.170
 housemates who you want 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.910
 to acquire but also honestly 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.710
 prepare for trips because 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:45.510
 changing biomes can play 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:47.610
 character a cruel joke and here is a nice 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.860
 news for all tank lovers in the game 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.640
 war thunder as reported by gaijin 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.290
 entertainment 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.360
 they are currently developing 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.820
 special feature called instant 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.890
 that's because according to the majority of the community 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.830
 players inconvenient to manage simultaneously 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.150
 tank and aimed fire therefore 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.100
 the developers decided to create 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.080
 artificial intelligence included 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.419
 players at will who will 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.010
 fully follow the commands and it 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.140
 priority as fast as possible 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.940
 located at the desired point indicated 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.580
 a player according to the same developers 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.010
 it should simplify and diversify 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.080
 tank control besides that 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.870
 several recycled bombs for 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.300
 aircraft in arcade tank mode and 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.180
 Added old artillery system 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.080
 fire but again I repeat only for 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.080
 arcade mode 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.100
 but was appointed to release on March 18 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.500
 new addition for neverwinter 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.290
 which will be called the wrath of the elements 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.510
 in it the brave heroes have to stop 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.850
 plans of worship or mental evil 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.410
 who is trying to enslave the bank of swords 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.720
 will help the players 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.320
 heroes known for many works 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.610
 Minsk and his faithful hamster named 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.130
 the maximum level of pumping will grow 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.350
 up to 70 which means they will be available 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.630
 new job skills and many others 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.610
 adventures but if you are interested in 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.530
 details you have to wait until 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.030
 module outputs explicitly 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:14.040
 share all possible goodies 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.990
 well, at the end of the news agile wars 2 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.420
 and specifically about the new class which I 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.480
 mentioned in the previous issue called 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.800
 he is revenant and his main feature 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.650
 are literally from 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.050
 the absorption of the forces of any two heroes which 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.640
 he will choose on his own this way 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.800
 he can at almost any time 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.720
 change your conditional identity and 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.300
 use the abilities of one of the earlier 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.400
 absorbed forces while he has two 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.410
 racks each one or another 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.330
 way it affects him in battle 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.710
 for example demonic stand at 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.480
 accumulating a large amount 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.910
 debuffs turn into 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.620
 a certain avatar conveying all the negative 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.110
 effects on nearby enemies 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.300
 and the other dwarf stance on the contrary helps 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.340
 restrain women and act effectively 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.560
 in combat, the class is not tied to 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.840
 anyone weapons because each type of 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.440
 his own way works in the hands of this 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.960
 class 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.090
 changing not only external effects but also 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.610
 almost to destroy a large 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:11.430
 number of enemies or weaken them 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:13.800
 so far this is only an announcement of how will 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:17.360
 look class prerelease supplement 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.360
 only developers know 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.880
 that's all thanks for watching a
