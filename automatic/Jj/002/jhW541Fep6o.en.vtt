00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
their little optic in there is actually

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.930 
their little optic in there is actually
counting<00:02:40.480> where<00:02:40.870> all<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.140> records<00:02:41.530> are<00:02:42.010> and

counting where all the records are and

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.250 
counting where all the records are and
of<00:02:43.120> course<00:02:43.360> since<00:02:43.540> there's<00:02:43.720> 100<00:02:44.080> records

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
of course since there's 100 records

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.100 
of course since there's 100 records
there's<00:02:44.709> 100<00:02:45.129> notches<00:02:45.700> you<00:02:46.510> can<00:02:46.659> actually<00:02:46.959> see

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
there's 100 notches you can actually see

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.289 
there's 100 notches you can actually see
the<00:02:47.230> notches<00:02:47.409> here<00:02:47.830> against<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:49.060> notches

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
the notches here against the notches

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.759

really<00:02:50.290> clover<00:02:50.849> tracks<00:02:51.849> at<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.180> gram<00:02:52.540> this<00:02:53.410> arm

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
really clover tracks at a gram this arm

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.100 
really clover tracks at a gram this arm
is<00:02:54.010> just<00:02:54.040> floating<00:02:54.730> on<00:02:54.819> there<00:02:55.060> now<00:02:55.629> we<00:02:55.780> have<00:02:55.959> it

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
is just floating on there now we have it

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.890 
is just floating on there now we have it
bolted<00:02:56.530> down<00:02:56.709> you<00:02:56.980> see<00:02:57.160> these<00:02:57.280> two<00:02:57.549> notes<00:02:57.900> we

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
bolted down you see these two notes we

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.199 
bolted down you see these two notes we
loosen<00:02:59.349> them<00:02:59.500> up<00:02:59.620> so<00:02:59.890> it<00:03:00.010> floats<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:01.000> then

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
loosen them up so it floats and then

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.649 
loosen them up so it floats and then
your<00:03:01.629> base<00:03:01.870> won't<00:03:02.230> fire<00:03:02.860> into<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.310> machine
