00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.590
 I'm back to boxing again 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.990
 that's also how I'm going 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.450
 introduce yourself quickly 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.460
 that's it's done Slavic cosmetics then 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.270
 correa cosmetics cover you are 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.130
 all brands of cosmetics 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.250
 Korean that you can find on this 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.359
 website and that's a little bit it's 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.019
 much easier to use 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.939
 racket custom and so you have it in 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.109
 English completely 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.160
 you do not really have French lives 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.530
 in other languages â€‹â€‹though it's 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.420
 registered it's quite a great site in 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.090
 the meaning where if you ever seek to 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.530
 buy maybe a two products because 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.790
 you do not know too much about brands 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.070
 Korean and that it was still very 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.270
 very very want to try it worth more 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.920
 the blow in this case to go to this 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.969
 site there cars worried that's 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.719
 better if we make big fat 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.879
 orders 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.739
 because there this level report quality 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.329
 price is better even if the shots 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.579
 are expensive in cosmetics 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.899
 the offer is better still if you 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.640
 buy maybe some products for 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.870
 try to get to know you 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.640
 Korean brands 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.040
 again it's a lot more 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.290
 easy to use I would put you 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.390
 obviously links in info bar in 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.560
 goes a question is yes what to say 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.180
 else I like his sitcoms 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.939
 of elements not if the use is 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.369
 nice walks in the clear and 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.650
 simple it's a lot easier too 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.450
 to choose someone doubt that they are 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.590
 hours or that she chews between that in 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.259
 gmarket it's a lot easier 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.720
 of access the payment is done apparently 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.100
 with Paul I admit that I am not 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:40.550
 very fan but that's a question of 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:41.900
 taste it's clement see 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.270
 because they saw me what I 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:49.340
 ordered george gifts too no 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.430
 so I'm not against the eyes 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:02:05.030
 passage it's my own opinion that I 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:09.200
 you pass here wow 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.270
 and there it is super well packaged so it 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.120
 that's what I ordered from 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.310
 samples that will deliver from so 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.350
 I'm going right so yes the principle of 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.840
 at cosmetics love it's a product 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.150
 bought equals a sample if I come 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.880
 will conclude or two I know shorter you 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.740
 have samples checked cases so 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.140
 there the first one to songs I have is 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.490
 a royal jelly mask that you 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.520
 know honey there is a mask mask 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.090
 kind of masked ball were like that I 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.090
 think you'll see 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.160
 right now I have the phase destroy 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.270
 the black dots on the nose and threw 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.810
 absolutely all the products that 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.459
 since they can not exist and the 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.660
 coat 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.100
 I have something like that to remove the 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.420
 blackheads i think about i said to john 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.860
 in the packaging I find it really 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.720

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.010
