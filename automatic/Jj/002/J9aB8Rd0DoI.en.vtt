00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.479 
officially declared it's a good idea to
pause<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.900> way<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.709> can<00:02:16.890> sort<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.280> get<00:02:17.430> a

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
pause it that way you can sort of get a

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.300 
pause it that way you can sort of get a
good<00:02:18.709> good<00:02:19.709> arm<00:02:20.720> may<00:02:21.720> like<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.230> like<00:02:22.890> good

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
good good arm may like it like good

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.740 
good good arm may like it like good
timing<00:02:23.790> new<00:02:24.180> press<00:02:24.450> split<00:02:24.810> then<00:02:25.769> you<00:02:26.510> play<00:02:27.510> it

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
timing new press split then you play it

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.320 
timing new press split then you play it
and<00:02:27.959> then<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.349> pause<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.220> when<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.760> word<00:02:29.910> ends

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
and then you pause it when the word ends

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.270 
and then you pause it when the word ends
their<00:02:30.660> child<00:02:31.019> me<00:02:33.380> sometimes<00:02:34.380> I<00:02:34.530> say<00:02:34.709> too<00:02:34.769> fast

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
their child me sometimes I say too fast

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.479 
their child me sometimes I say too fast
and<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:36.720> got<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> really<00:02:38.420> tight<00:02:39.500> see<00:02:40.500> then

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
and you you got a really tight see then

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.000 
and you you got a really tight see then
you<00:02:41.730> then<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:43.130> delete<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.370> like<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.150> word

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
you then you delete that like the word

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.080 
you then you delete that like the word
that<00:02:47.010> was<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.160> put<00:02:47.430> that's<00:02:47.610> supposed<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.000> be

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
that was a put that's supposed to be

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.059 
that was a put that's supposed to be
sensitive<00:02:48.540> then<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.930> go<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:49.620> censored

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
sensitive then you go to the censored

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.559 
sensitive then you go to the censored
beep<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.579> you<00:02:50.670> have<00:02:50.849> there<00:02:51.030> then<00:02:51.239> you<00:02:51.329> drag

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
beep that you have there then you drag

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.240 
beep that you have there then you drag
it<00:02:51.630> all<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.870> way<00:02:52.079> there<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:54.590> sometimes<00:02:55.590> like

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
it all the way there and sometimes like

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.370 
it all the way there and sometimes like
for<00:02:56.849> example<00:02:56.940> with<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.690> bead<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:58.110> have

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
for example with the bead I have

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.100 
for example with the bead I have
sometimes<00:02:58.890> it's<00:02:59.069> too<00:02:59.310> long<00:02:59.549> and<00:02:59.880> it<00:02:59.970> makes<00:03:00.900> the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
sometimes it's too long and it makes the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.940 
sometimes it's too long and it makes the
audio<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.829> the<00:03:02.720> video<00:03:03.720> I'll<00:03:04.230> sink<00:03:04.620> so

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
audio and the video I'll sink so

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.390 
audio and the video I'll sink so
sometimes<00:03:05.579> you<00:03:05.790> would<00:03:05.940> have<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:07.069> shorten<00:03:08.069> the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
sometimes you would have to shorten the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.390 
sometimes you would have to shorten the
beep<00:03:09.230> that<00:03:10.230> way<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.709> video<00:03:11.069> and<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.370> audio

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
beep that way the video and the audio

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.520 
beep that way the video and the audio
would<00:03:12.209> be<00:03:12.329> on<00:03:12.420> track<00:03:13.609> so<00:03:14.609> and<00:03:14.940> then<00:03:15.350> just<00:03:16.350> keep

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
would be on track so and then just keep

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.809 
would be on track so and then just keep
on<00:03:16.709> doing<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.190> all<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.340> words<00:03:17.579> you<00:03:17.639> want

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
on doing that to all the words you want

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.420 
on doing that to all the words you want
a<00:03:17.880> sensor<00:03:18.329> and<00:03:18.569> then<00:03:18.980> there<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.040> go<00:03:20.130> that's<00:03:20.340> a

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
a sensor and then there you go that's a

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.770 
a sensor and then there you go that's a
sensor<00:03:20.760> video<00:03:21.060> here's<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.450> example<00:03:23.480> as<00:03:24.480> your

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
sensor video here's the example as your

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.170 
sensor video here's the example as your
president<00:03:24.989> I<00:03:25.290> officially<00:03:26.100> declare<00:03:26.250> marriage

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
president I officially declare marriage

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.410 
president I officially declare marriage
legal<00:03:27.840> see<00:03:28.549> okay<00:03:29.549> so<00:03:29.609> that's<00:03:29.910> how<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.120> make

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
legal see okay so that's how you make

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.509 
legal see okay so that's how you make
sense<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:30.930> videos<00:03:31.290> it's<00:03:31.470> pretty<00:03:31.739> easy<00:03:32.069> once

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
sense of videos it's pretty easy once

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.319 
sense of videos it's pretty easy once
you<00:03:32.700> get<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:32.880> hang<00:03:32.970> of<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.359> well<00:03:33.840> I'll<00:03:33.959> see<00:03:34.230> ya
