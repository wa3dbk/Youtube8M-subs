with<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.680> minute<00:02:19.310> or<00:02:19.519> two<00:02:19.549> to<00:02:19.760> go<00:02:20.180> in<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.510> fourth

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.640 
quarter he was on fire he was hitting
the<00:02:24.409> craziest<00:02:25.280> shots<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:26.269> even<00:02:26.840> fell<00:02:27.290> out<00:02:27.470> of<00:02:27.500> my

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
the craziest shots I even fell out of my

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.430 
the craziest shots I even fell out of my
chair<00:02:27.799> after<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.670> one<00:02:28.940> shot<00:02:29.299> where<00:02:29.720> he<00:02:30.290> was

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
chair after that one shot where he was

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.490 
chair after that one shot where he was
going<00:02:30.769> for<00:02:30.799> a<00:02:31.040> contested<00:02:31.970> three<00:02:32.180> pointer<00:02:32.780> but

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
going for a contested three pointer but

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.410 
going for a contested three pointer but
it<00:02:33.620> was<00:02:33.769> a<00:02:33.799> two<00:02:34.129> pointer<00:02:34.610> at<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:35.000> end<00:02:35.180> and

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
it was a two pointer at the end and

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.809 
it was a two pointer at the end and
after<00:02:35.989> that<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.200> thought<00:02:36.620> well<00:02:36.890> come<00:02:37.400> on<00:02:37.580> the

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
after that I thought well come on the

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.240 
after that I thought well come on the
Miami<00:02:38.150> Heat<00:02:38.450> they<00:02:38.840> have<00:02:39.110> this<00:02:39.500> game<00:02:39.769> locked

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
Miami Heat they have this game locked

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.910 
Miami Heat they have this game locked
down<00:02:40.579> it's<00:02:40.910> a<00:02:41.090> win<00:02:41.269> for<00:02:41.299> sure<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.260> all<00:02:42.680> of<00:02:42.709> a

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
down it's a win for sure and all of a

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.759 
down it's a win for sure and all of a
sudden<00:02:42.950> Devin<00:02:43.819> Harris<00:02:44.239> makes<00:02:44.780> this<00:02:45.140> miracle

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
sudden Devin Harris makes this miracle

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.210 
sudden Devin Harris makes this miracle
layup<00:02:46.760> floater<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:48.110> think<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.590> was<00:02:48.709> a<00:02:48.769> floater

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
layup floater I think it was a floater

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.360 
layup floater I think it was a floater
with<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.910> foul<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.629> the<00:02:50.660> Utah<00:02:51.620> Jazz<00:02:51.650> are<00:02:52.190> up

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
with the foul and the Utah Jazz are up

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.599 
with the foul and the Utah Jazz are up
by<00:02:52.640> one<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:53.450> Miami<00:02:53.870> Heat<00:02:54.200> took<00:02:54.560> a<00:02:54.590> timeout<00:02:54.950> and

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
by one the Miami Heat took a timeout and

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.270 
by one the Miami Heat took a timeout and
coming<00:02:56.329> out<00:02:56.450> of<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.660> timeout<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:57.379> was<00:02:57.680> so<00:02:57.920> sure

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
coming out of the timeout I was so sure

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.729 
coming out of the timeout I was so sure
that<00:02:58.310> LeBron<00:02:59.180> James<00:02:59.599> would<00:02:59.930> take<00:03:00.170> that<00:03:00.440> last

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
that LeBron James would take that last

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.940 
that LeBron James would take that last
shot<00:03:01.220> he<00:03:01.879> was<00:03:02.090> on<00:03:02.299> fire<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:03.109> whole<00:03:03.319> game<00:03:03.680> and

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
shot he was on fire the whole game and

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.300 
shot he was on fire the whole game and
then<00:03:04.519> as<00:03:04.819> you<00:03:05.150> may<00:03:05.540> have<00:03:05.569> seen<00:03:06.109> he<00:03:06.500> passes<00:03:07.129> the

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
then as you may have seen he passes the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.119

performances I really thought he would
take<00:03:43.160> that<00:03:43.430> shot<00:03:43.700> but<00:03:44.269> he<00:03:44.359> didn't<00:03:44.720> well<00:03:45.349> yeah

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.050 
tonight was that part of the strategy no

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.770 
tonight was that part of the strategy no
not<00:07:11.530> really<00:07:11.560> we<00:07:12.370> all<00:07:12.550> know<00:07:12.850> it<00:07:13.060> tends<00:07:13.390> to<00:07:13.510> slow

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.780 
not really we all know it tends to slow

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.420 
not really we all know it tends to slow

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.430 
down in the fourth quarter so our

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.790 
down in the fourth quarter so our
strategy<00:07:15.760> was<00:07:16.210> to<00:07:16.270> maintain<00:07:16.810> Dwyane<00:07:17.260> Wade<00:07:17.560> as

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 
strategy was to maintain Dwyane Wade as

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.640 
strategy was to maintain Dwyane Wade as
best<00:07:18.220> as<00:07:18.460> we<00:07:18.490> can<00:07:18.820> possibly<00:07:18.880> can<00:07:19.630> it<00:07:20.260> didn't

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:20.650 
best as we can possibly can it didn't

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.560 
best as we can possibly can it didn't
work<00:07:20.830> out<00:07:21.040> but<00:07:21.370> we<00:07:21.580> got<00:07:21.730> lucky<00:07:22.000> in<00:07:22.180> the<00:07:22.419> end

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:22.570 
work out but we got lucky in the end

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.110 
work out but we got lucky in the end
with<00:07:23.500> the<00:07:23.620> game-winning<00:07:24.130> shot<00:07:24.520> and<00:07:24.760> now<00:07:25.060> we
