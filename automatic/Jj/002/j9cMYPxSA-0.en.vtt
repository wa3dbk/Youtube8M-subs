00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:10.960
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.820
 second part of my big palma 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.219
 I would like to introduce you today 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.430
 product of valea imagine product is 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.420
 I think relatively new and I now times 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.190
 many of you do not have that yet 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:27.870
 So discovered standing in the very 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:33.460
 normal place care shelf just doing it and 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:35.560
 the packaging looks just as well 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.420
 packed in such a box and 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:42.550
 if you take that out then it is like this 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:47.079
 a tube just with yes the same pointy 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.720
 is incoming and the product costs so 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.860
 So around seven euros is already one 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.550
 a bit more expensive 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.850
 and I think it's worth it 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.670
 So the product is called perfection 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.920
 optical instant magic conceals immediately 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.710
 Drill wrinkles and hold and 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.720
 shine and bring a perfect 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.840
 the finish and is for all skin types 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:15.159
 suitable since there are 30 milliliters included 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.650
 and as an application is just the mood 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.710
 perfection optical before magic after 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.860
 day care on all facial areas 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.820
 einwÃ¤nden and gently einkÃ¶pfen 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.979
 I can knock that with the one 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.630
 So it really says so 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.659
 that the product really also in the 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.659
 skin can move in and I use it 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.869
 always just before I mean 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.640
 then apply foundation and I have to 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.380
 say when the product applies 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.110
 It's a bit like that in the beginning 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.030
 you feel so slippery then so 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.880
 think the backup might not hold 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.600
 so good but if you are really like that 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.040
 yes just starts this kaymer like that 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.840
 really a knock like it too 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.880
 it says it pulls relatively well 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.470
 there you should be so, so to speak 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.299
 my row minute is waiting for it 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.030
 moved in and then his foundation 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:07.259
 then it really is a lot 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.209
 easy primer so you can tell him already 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.040
 that's not really true now 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.060
 how a day care moves in completely 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.150
 but I 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:20.770
 it really is for the price 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:23.110
 very good product so wrinkles yes 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.030
 I always do not confirm so too 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.130
 If I am still young , it is so 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.989
 that I'm already dry here 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.680
 groves just got under the eyes and 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.720
 if it is already on the forehead so on 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.970
 already get a few wrinkles and 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.130
 yes, I do not think so now 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.230
 because a great can do that again 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.750
 So what's inside the hoard is in there 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.420
 as a rest as a product does not help 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.209
 but I just think it really 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.870
 especially the pores laminated very well 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.209
 and just went well 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.120
 Bumps affects the product 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.140
 also promises that the country 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.970
 I can reduce that and I can 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.400
 so it is not true now 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.709
 that is the skin completely degreased 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.620
 but I think it is for the price 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.040
 completely ok and I want you 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.269
 here at the place also again my 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.269
 show unvarnished face 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.120
 The product is very productive so me 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.610
 I have already used it several times and 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.520
 as you can see filter first 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.930
 little piece and I do not use 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.420
 like and i think i will too 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.860
 really buy it because it's easy 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.590
 not so difficult to get there 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.220
 and yes we are just those expensive ones 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.140
 primer yes that's not easy for me 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.060
 too bad so I am too ambitious for 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.160
 and I think it's really a great one 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.140
 product for that then it really does 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.140
 is available at the dm and not so 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.060
 is expensive and i really can 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.050
 recommend if i am to japan this 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.260
 perfection of her a little bit 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.210
 dream volt and just try it out 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.770
 wanted what is your skin makes 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.140
 i can just give you this product 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.350
 really as the first product 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.670
 recommend 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:12.950
 I was a bit skeptical at the beginning 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.740
 that it's just a balea, though 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.270
 product is never English now 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.739
 bad but I was still one 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.660
 bit skeptical that it really 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.230
 works but it leaves behind 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.270
 really a velvety feel and me 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.370
 can really recommend it to you 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.360
 Of course, other parts will be added 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:35.320
 great in the medium price and high 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.610
 Price category come and I hope you 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.580
 Turn on again and hope that 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.140
 it also interested you that's it then 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.370
 even me, but I would 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.690
 if you like the video one 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.820
 Dam burst because then I know too 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.130
 that you are already on the next one 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.080

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.680
 be glad if you give me an abo dallas the 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.790
