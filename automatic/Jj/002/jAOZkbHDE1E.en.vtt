00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.190

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.600

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.940

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.940
 the flight was pretty daring 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.480

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.780
 Rugged rocks through and Rosbacher 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.970

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.220

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.430

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.380

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.060
 the circling of a fat bumblebee 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.060
 reminded about a flowering 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:51.400
