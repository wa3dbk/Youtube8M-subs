00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
then plug into the device on the side

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.510 
then plug into the device on the side
here<00:01:51.869> or<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.680> charge<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.040> using<00:01:53.399> this

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
here or you can charge it using this

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.399 
here or you can charge it using this
included<00:01:54.000> car<00:01:54.210> adapter<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> nice

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
included car adapter so it's a nice

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.840 
included car adapter so it's a nice
touch<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.770> really<00:01:55.860> do<00:01:56.040> get<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.250> lot<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.460> options

here select which tip we're going to use
in<00:02:56.670> this<00:02:56.790> case<00:02:57.000> we'll<00:02:57.240> be<00:02:57.270> looking<00:02:57.450> for<00:02:57.870> the

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
in this case we'll be looking for the

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.340 
in this case we'll be looking for the
micro<00:02:59.459> B<00:02:59.640> USB<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.660> we<00:03:00.780> could<00:03:00.900> take<00:03:01.050> this

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
micro B USB so we could take this

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.820 
micro B USB so we could take this
adapter<00:03:01.740> tip<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.100> plug<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.490> into<00:03:02.610> any<00:03:03.709> micro<00:03:04.709> B

we can actually plug in the 30-pin

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.420 
we can actually plug in the 30-pin
connector<00:03:15.320> like<00:03:16.320> that<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.980> we'll<00:03:17.070> plug<00:03:17.190> it<00:03:17.340> in

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
connector like that and we'll plug it in

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.680 
connector like that and we'll plug it in
you'll<00:03:17.610> see<00:03:17.670> that<00:03:17.880> will<00:03:18.030> will<00:03:18.480> immediately

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
you'll see that will will immediately

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.490 
you'll see that will will immediately
start<00:03:19.620> getting<00:03:19.709> a<00:03:19.920> charge<00:03:20.570> now<00:03:21.570> it<00:03:21.690> has<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.840> 2000

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
start getting a charge now it has a 2000

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.100 
start getting a charge now it has a 2000
milliamp<00:03:22.800> hour<00:03:22.980> battery<00:03:23.300> inside<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.570> inside

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
milliamp hour battery inside the inside

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.590 
milliamp hour battery inside the inside
the<00:03:25.260> solar<00:03:25.440> charger<00:03:25.920> so<00:03:26.370> for<00:03:26.910> contacts<00:03:27.360> the

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
the solar charger so for contacts the

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.960 
the solar charger so for contacts the
battery<00:03:28.019> inside<00:03:28.320> an<00:03:28.470> iPhone<00:03:28.830> is<00:03:29.070> 1,150

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
battery inside an iPhone is 1,150

battery inside an iPhone is 1,150
milliamp<00:03:30.150> hours<00:03:30.630> so<00:03:30.690> that<00:03:30.750> basically<00:03:30.930> means

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
milliamp hours so that basically means

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.479 
milliamp hours so that basically means
you'll<00:03:31.410> be<00:03:31.440> able<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.739> charge<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.070> one<00:03:32.220> plus

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
you'll be able to charge it one plus
