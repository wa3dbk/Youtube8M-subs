00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.560
 recommendable 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.980
 It does not seem good to be touched for the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.410

 I signed up yes it's very important 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.800

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.810
 asanas or exercises or postures that 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.669
 we have in yoga they are not really 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.500
 specifically for something if it's not in 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.719
 post you have to practice everything but what 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.940
 we want to prove today is that we can 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.070
 be please be in your kitchens or 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.750
 in your living room or in your dining room in a 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.539
 space is not necessary a carpet 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.680
 yoga to practice in this case and let's 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.820
 to do something that is going to help us 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.680
 strengthen our peoples 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.980
 beloved buttocks that nobody wants 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.870
 everything else and that nothing falls 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.449
 nothing then let's make a position 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.820
 which is the chair will be called chair very 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.430
 well this is like that first let's do 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.229
 an oriental variant that is very good 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.359
 not to 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.109
 opening tantito well the legs from side 

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:14.950
 at 45 degrees we open our hips 

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:16.929
 we become aware of our 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.969
 breathing we raise our shoulders 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:23.560
 they turned them we rotated them a little bit towards 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:27.000
 back we inhale when we exhale we raise the 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.549
 arms to heaven and we put palms together 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.490
 inhale when we exhale, we will lower a 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.590
 little bending knees 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.840
 with inhalation we can do this 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.670
 movement of the waist for one side 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.490
 for the other olga I invite you to almost like 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.110
 that we dance grandfather a lot my teacher 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.110
 meet with a teacher who gives us 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.630
 yogi yoga art with martial art 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.630
 we inhale and exhale do not lose the 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.869
 concentration if it's very easy because 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.890
 I'm doing this I'm heating the 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.990
 knees for those people who have 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.750
 hearing problems this is a 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.640
 little bit not intense but they go little by little 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.619
 they will be able to achieve the posture 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.080
 international 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:13.900
 ok we exhale we make covers we raise 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.710
 when we inhale we lower our arms together 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.440
 hands in a teacher 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:23.190
 the importance of this type of postures 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.500
 is that you have to make them 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.500
 about 34 minutes each time 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.440
 keep breathing inhaling and exhaling 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.000
 they will go down to where they could be and 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.120
 let's go something more fun still 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.560
 then we raise our arms to heaven not 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.150
 we move our legs and how they are 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.560
 we bend our knees we exhale 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:49.710
 we inhale 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.470
 we inhale 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.570
 it's a lot more fun this is not 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.270
 becoming aware of our muscles 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:01.530
 of our thighs of our legs and 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:04.050
 of our chamorros because now 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.630
 we raise and lower our hands towards 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:11.130
 sides 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:14.190
 we inhale let's go a little bit more intensively 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.230
 now we have the legs at 45 degrees 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.010
 now let's put them at the height of 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.799
 our hips 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.569
 and right now it 's a little bit more intense 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.420
 only that was the previous one to the previous one 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.780
 then we inhale raise the arms 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.879
 to heaven we put our hands together and go to 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.900
 bend your knees a bit what is 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:37.599
 important is that your knees do not go 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.640
 later on the tip of the fingers and 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.920
 if we have to open the fingers of the 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.489
 well open feet always tell me that 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.400
 I look like a little monkey when my fingers 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.620
 the feet is very difficult and look and now 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.109
 What you can do also is to put your 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.109
 hands here to have a rest 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:58.480
 we inhale when we exhale we raise our arms 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.010
 to the sky the head can not be 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.720
 hanging the head does not have to be 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.690
 up here to the head goes straight with the 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.250
 arms we inhale and exhale inhale 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.950
 by the nose 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.380
 we exhale through our mouth what we do 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.320
 we become aware of our bands 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.200
 we close all the energy and the stomach 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.420
 goes inwards if we are going to leave 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.990
 here very easy we put our hands in 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:26.039
 the knee and we rise 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.039
 and greet them 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.069
 then and we swim we raise our arms 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.680
 to the sky we put our hands together we go down 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:37.750
 our knee little by little we take 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.849
 consciousness that is not in our 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.139
 hips and tail out is not a 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.139
 little this movement 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.189
 we inhale 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.539
 we exhale 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:53.240
 we inhale exhale what should we do 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:56.330
 ten times if they get tired we can put 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.189
 our hands on the knees we inhale 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.719
 and exhale in this position 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:02.060
 the important thing is to feel a little the 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:03.770
 strength here in our eyes and that that 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.129
 is going to make them hold our 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.129
 future 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:11.810
 and we can get out of this position of another 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:13.969
 way that is when we are here 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.980
 we bend the knee we drop the 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:18.890
 arms 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.660
 we put our hands to the waist and 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:24.450
 from here we climb slowly 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.810
 In this way what we are going to do is a 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.910
 exercise or a healthy posture in which 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.280
 we are going to have a lot of movement 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.380
 cardiovascular all this whole exercise 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.930
 what we are doing is really going to 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.790
 last about 5 hours our 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.120
 body will be in this position to your 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:44.730
 now now the position that although you see 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.260
 very easy it's very strong now we go for 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.140
 those who want a little stronger 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:53.070
 because we put our feet together 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:55.650
 We open our fingers very well if so 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.380
 putting together the fat events we put together 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.660
 knees 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.710
 we raise the shoulders back back 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.430
 straight we inhale 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.220
 and on exhaling 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.910
 down in this chair pose 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.910
 It is the original 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:18.670
 Do not be fooled, because on the other side 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.310
 they wanted to begin the first to 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:24.220
 start was the pre and mariana I te 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.590
 I want to ask one thing you are a chef and 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.170
 I have not seen a dish of yours yet 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.090
 here you have not seen but here we have not 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:33.130
 seen then I want you to us 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.790
 you will cook a delicious day 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:39.070
 let's make it so good that when you exhale 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.800
 we can lower our arms we fold the 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.410
 knees straighten the knees 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.720
 let's go down let's take a moment to 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:49.380
 loosen our neck take out all kinds 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.380
 tensile 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:55.020
 and now at this moment we are 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:57.000
 our hands at the waist this serves 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:01.280
 so as not to force our lower back like this 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.280
 and we raise slowly inhaling 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:08.410
 very well rich is formidable because the 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.060
 truth is that you nothing else is 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.040
 watching but you have to feel it because 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.990
 you have to feel all the work that goes 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.750
 from the toenail to the 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:19.240
 little tip of the hair we sweat but it is 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.310
 a lot of force is very balanced so 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.590
 which many muscles intervene although 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.570
 we're not jumping help like jumping 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.460
 but it is very necessary that we 

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.870
 put to practice and fits mariana
