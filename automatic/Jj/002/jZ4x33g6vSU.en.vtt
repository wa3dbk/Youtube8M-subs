00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.219
 one month after the end of the first 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.410
 beta weekday wargaming company again 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.930

 everyone to plunge into the world of marine 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.510
 battles if you for any reason 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.210
 no luck and you could not enjoy 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.849
 playing it yourself especially for you i 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.669
 prepared a video report from the second betta 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.120
 weekend and all I also called Michael 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.969
 shvetsov and I am the author of the wicked fan channel 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.280
 I remind you that in the first report I told 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.140
 in almost all classes of ships and 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.020
 a little about features 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.989
 world of warships if you haven't 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.289
 watched the first video then here it 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.870
 abstract it is useful to you because 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.989
 Now I will not tell all myself 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.469
 begin I will continue the story started yet 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.860
 then the second beta weekend pleased 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.390
 players new gaming chips as well 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.240
 aircraft carrier class 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.270
 and the gameplay which was previously extremely 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.259
 little is known about this type of review 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.409
 ships will be dedicated to this video 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.990
 aircraft carriers 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.020
 at the time of the beta weekend only available in 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.909
 American development branch first experience 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.200
 games on them can be obtained only on 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.659
 fourth level 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.869
 gaining enough experience on 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.360
 saint luis after buying langley 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.570
 so called aircraft carrier on the fourth 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.119
 level in the port will wait for us a huge 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.880
 by its dimensions the combat vehicle which 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.579
 can not boast of any powerful principal 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.420
 caliber no armor is not good 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.299
 speedy 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.549
 or maneuverable data the strength of this 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.009
 class of technology is the ability 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.710
 manage air groups capable 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.810
 perform various combat missions of all 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.759
 the aircraft carrier is capable of carrying three 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.630
 types of aircraft each 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.790
 unique and performs its task 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.560
 bombers can practically 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.020
 guaranteed damage however for 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.080
 of this they need to fly up to such 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.870
 mother ship 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.480
 tally damage from these planes 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.030
 not very big but very much from him 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.280
 difficult to dodge torpedo 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.940
 much more dangerous for the enemy 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.270
 ships 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.800
 one successful blows able to inflict 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.230
 huge damage to any ship 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.630
 but ideally you need 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.850
 100% hit of all torpedoes 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.430
 considering that torpedoes come out with 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.770
 more advance than bomb chance 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.230
 miss quite big because 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.650
 successful visits will be obtained only 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.810
 after getting a gaming experience 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.880
 fighters can serve you and your 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.430
 team eyes fulfilling the role 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.830
 intelligence officers but their main goal 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.260
 destruction of enemy aircraft and 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.930
 cover allied bombers and 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.700
 torpedo in the module tree of each 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.160
 aircraft carrier you can suit your taste 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.560
 select the number of air group type 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.940
 airplanes opening and installing 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.060
 corresponding module 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.950
 so here we go back to langley in his 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.170
 disposal initially only available 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.480
 one air group 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.850
 fighters and torpedo bombers modest by 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.459
 its size the army will give the opportunity 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.220
 gradually adapt to the specific 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.290
 gameplay if you have not been before 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.980
 familiar with the genre real strategy 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.100
 of time 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.200
 it will adapt to what of course 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.769
 you were ready for the world 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.980
 warships 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:38.739
 this game is tied to tactics but by playing 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.660
 for all your small aircraft carriers 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.420
 the action will proceed on the map 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.300
 during the battle you practically will not 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.100
 time to enjoy the juicy picture so 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.180
 how is your task not only to see 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.250
 map situation 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:56.110
 but also to predict its development 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:59.230
 time it takes enough yours 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.080
 floating r about that without the support of allies 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.260
 vulnerable target but that doesn't mean you need 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.570
 cosplay island on spawn site than 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.519
 farther away from you the more time 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.850
 planes will spend on flying 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.200
 and this in turn will drastically reduce your 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.150
 combat effectiveness 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.580
 because during the battle you should always 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.310
 find time to move your 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.670
 the ship so as not to be very far 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.700
 from allied support 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.270
 but the main thing of course is to give orders 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.370
 each of its air group any change 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.580
 minimap leads adjustments 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:38.270
 orders and so on until the battle is up 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.610
 end for example give for starters 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.310
 light in this square fighter jets 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.310
 and here to get ahead of the situation 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.700
 ship torpedo but already 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.640
 a fight ensued because the course of the ship is better 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:56.450
 adjust until everything goes according to 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.490
 not bad but it's time to predict 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.580
 action reds and give a punch 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.610
 torpedoes at this time your fighters 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.800
 Fold already attacking air defense group 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.160
 enemy torpedo bombers go the other way 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.030
 square immediately respond to 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.700
 it's sending fighters to intercept 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:20.290
 it's time to torpedoes hope a little on 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.370
 good luck and then issue new orders 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.580
 fighter and captain 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.670
 during this time, the torpedo will have time to sit down 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.530
 on the ship and after replenishment 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.960
 ammunition we send them again 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.310
 back into battle 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.110
 We are checking fighter cases at 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.620
 need to return them for 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:42.950
 ammunition need so much to catch 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.350
 that with unaccustomed eyes run to 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.980
 don't forget that the quantity 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.040
 airplanes 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:51.980
 we have limited because unnecessary 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.350
 risk is not worth it in a few 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.140
 minutes you can lose your whole army 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.800
 without which the carrier will no longer 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.560
 scary 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.870
 and with increasing number of levels 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.170
 the air group of each aircraft carrier will be 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:09.080
 only grow and it will bring us more 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:13.160
 more tasks and more responsibilities 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.800
 These are actually quite aircraft carriers 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:19.430
 not one-button and rather complicated 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.680
 support and attack ships will be honest 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.080
 not everyone will like so much 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.650
 specific and rather complicated 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.500
 gameplay 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.980
 however, those who can figure it out 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:33.590
 chaos will be like conductors in battle with 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.400
 help the team play unforgettable 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.790
 party 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.370
 except aircraft carriers 2 batt weekend brought 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.259
 many more innovations for example appeared 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.900
 squad search squad 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:48.350
 ship improvement modules as well 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.720
 captain mechanics it's all different from 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.270
 of what we could see in other games 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.610
 from wargaming because not 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.949
 load you finally the story about 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.460
 These innovations I continued in the following 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:01.820
 video 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:04.580
 and with this release I will round out everything 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.650
 thanks for watching if the video was for 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:10.039
 you do not be too lazy to put 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:13.250
 like subscribe to the channel and my group 

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:16.820
 in contact and in the comments tell 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:21.169
 what do you think about aircraft carrier class 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:23.470
 that's all 7 pounds under keel and good luck 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:23.470
 you
