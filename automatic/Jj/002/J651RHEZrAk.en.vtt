00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello everyone today it's 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.569
 speedy sprinters 13 and we end up 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.670
 for a tutorial like no other since 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.320
 it's not about video games it's about 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.790
 a little something not so intimate and 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.330
 which is nice enough to do when we 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.330
 Another boring 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.859
 so that's about making smoke 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.850
 in a pack of cigarettes 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.010
 yes it's stupid but I like it 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.600
 so here you go with a pack of cigarettes 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.760
 like that so I've already done 1 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.560
 but I do it my way with 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.399
 normally paper this with a butt of 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.960
 cigarette and I tried the plastic 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.520
 to better see the smoke well i'm going 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.260
 just play to show how to put 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.640
 the paper so it's easy on a 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.290
 impact is normal we barely go out the 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.430
 plastic 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:49.530
 good after we blow in for the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.379
 master well so that's why for that he 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.239
 need a little piece of paper 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:01:00.059
 here we drove right I knew that my 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:03.030
 take off a piece of paper so are 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:13.140
 here is the mount he is sent back to burn 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:15.600
 language or like that I barely 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.350
 burn your fingers short so that's it 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.500
 still hot enough and you're barely going 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:26.220
 do something in like that but a whole 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.579
 little hole that you turn it off so 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:34.470
 not that it burns them here and you 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:37.970
 see what makes it good to link you 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.970
 a little bit so that it does not fit 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.930
 Well, it's okay, it gives me that 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.950
 I was the paper like that we'll see 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.250
 better smoke we will see what it 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.780
 give and I've already done one but I 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.490
 lit the paper I did not blow on the 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.659
 paper and I saw on other videos 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.009
 youtube that when we suffer on the 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.470
 paper it's even more smoke so 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.119
 we'll see that so I'll leave you 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.869
 see that good we'll put something 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:12.440
 to make more authors here so we 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:17.360
 will have what it gives good I leave you 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:24.380
 enjoy the warm fire in one brand 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.819
 suffering that it makes my agreement that 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.970
 do a little trick I think we 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.930
 did not even see we're going to take me anymore 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.930
 lower down the fire 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.970
 so you see by blowing that makes 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.930
 a lot more smoke and saw that 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.330
 behind these blacks we see a lot 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.540
 better smoke while in a package 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.310
 of conventional cigarettes without markers 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.150
 we will not see the end to the smoke less 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.940
 although if behind is black so 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.340
 this is not so useful but 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.450
 when we get bored there is a bunch of 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.760
 cigarettes on hand is fun to 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.250
 do it so that's spd sprinters 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.720
 thesis for a tutorial how to do the 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.720
 smoke in a pack of cigarettes very
