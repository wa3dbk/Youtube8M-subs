hi I'm Gary from black optical and we're
here<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.490> find<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.030> perfect<00:00:03.240> carrot<00:00:03.689> aviator

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
here to find the perfect carrot aviator

here to find the perfect carrot aviator
shades<00:00:10.340> so<00:00:11.340> aviators<00:00:11.700> were<00:00:11.730> started<00:00:12.120> in<00:00:12.150> 1937

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
shades so aviators were started in 1937

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.690 
shades so aviators were started in 1937
by<00:00:13.259> Ray<00:00:13.440> Ban<00:00:13.650> back<00:00:14.099> then<00:00:14.280> they<00:00:14.370> were<00:00:14.429> made<00:00:14.639> in

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
by Ray Ban back then they were made in

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.410 
by Ray Ban back then they were made in
the<00:00:14.759> u.s.<00:00:15.030> in<00:00:15.980> upstate<00:00:16.980> New<00:00:17.100> York

the u.s. in upstate New York

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.210 
the u.s. in upstate New York
they're<00:00:18.420> specifically<00:00:18.930> designed<00:00:19.020> for<00:00:19.410> pilots

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
they're specifically designed for pilots

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.920 
they're specifically designed for pilots
it's<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.670> name<00:00:20.820> aviator<00:00:21.180> reason<00:00:21.750> for<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
it's the name aviator reason for the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.840 
it's the name aviator reason for the
shape<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.410> they<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.830> pilots<00:00:23.160> needed<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.519> deeper

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
shape is they the pilots needed a deeper

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.040 
shape is they the pilots needed a deeper
lens<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.210> they<00:00:24.300> could<00:00:24.420> see<00:00:24.570> their<00:00:24.720> control

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
lens so they could see their control

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.779 
lens so they could see their control
panels<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.680> see<00:00:26.039> all<00:00:26.160> their<00:00:26.279> instruments<00:00:26.519> as

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
panels and see all their instruments as

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:27.259 
panels and see all their instruments as
they're<00:00:26.910> flying

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
they're flying

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.750 
they're flying
but<00:00:27.779> still<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.080> enough<00:00:28.289> lens<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:29.010> see<00:00:29.189> out<00:00:29.369> to

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
but still have enough lens to see out to

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.330 
but still have enough lens to see out to
see<00:00:29.939> where<00:00:30.090> they're<00:00:30.240> flying<00:00:31.099> hence<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
see where they're flying hence the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.569 
see where they're flying hence the
teardrop<00:00:32.969> shape<00:00:33.800> here<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.829> have<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.160> now<00:00:35.340> is

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
teardrop shape here I have on now is

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.030 
teardrop shape here I have on now is
actually<00:00:35.910> from<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.180> 40s<00:00:36.719> back<00:00:37.559> when<00:00:37.739> Raven

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
actually from the 40s back when Raven

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.459 
actually from the 40s back when Raven
used<00:00:38.309> real<00:00:38.850> gold<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.329> make<00:00:39.450> their<00:00:39.600> frames<00:00:39.809> and

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
used real gold to make their frames and

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.110 
used real gold to make their frames and
then<00:00:40.559> over<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.829> years<00:00:41.160> aviators<00:00:41.670> started<00:00:42.000> to

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
then over the years aviators started to

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.660 
then over the years aviators started to
evolve<00:00:42.770> you<00:00:43.770> know<00:00:43.829> they<00:00:44.040> realize<00:00:44.370> not

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
evolve you know they realize not

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.250 
evolve you know they realize not
everybody<00:00:44.940> likes<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.450> teardrop<00:00:45.899> or<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
everybody likes the teardrop or the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.750 
everybody likes the teardrop or the
teardrop<00:00:46.590> shape<00:00:46.829> doesn't<00:00:47.129> fit<00:00:47.280> everybody's

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
teardrop shape doesn't fit everybody's

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.700 
teardrop shape doesn't fit everybody's
face<00:00:47.969> shape<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.960> there's<00:00:49.320> brands<00:00:49.649> like

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
face shape so there's brands like

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.740 
face shape so there's brands like
American<00:00:50.129> optical<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.700> started<00:00:51.120> squaring

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
American optical that started squaring

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.000 
American optical that started squaring
off<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.989> bottoms<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.500> get<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.680> little<00:00:52.890> more

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
off the bottoms to get a little more

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.920 
off the bottoms to get a little more
structured<00:00:53.460> tailored<00:00:54.329> look<00:00:54.510> for<00:00:54.690> somebody

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
structured tailored look for somebody

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.450 
structured tailored look for somebody
that<00:00:54.960> has<00:00:55.170> an<00:00:55.320> oval<00:00:55.590> oval<00:00:55.860> face<00:00:56.070> shape<00:00:56.100> and

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that has an oval oval face shape and

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.580 
that has an oval oval face shape and
then<00:00:56.760> they<00:00:56.910> started<00:00:57.180> introducing<00:00:57.590> Kabletown

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
then they started introducing Kabletown

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.349 
then they started introducing Kabletown
or<00:00:58.770> paddle<00:00:59.100> temples<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.940> little<00:01:00.270> bit

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
or paddle temples a little bit

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.939 
or paddle temples a little bit
straighter<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:00.930> they<00:01:01.020> fit<00:01:01.260> better<00:01:01.469> underneath

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
straighter so they fit better underneath

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.369 
straighter so they fit better underneath
the<00:01:02.250> head<00:01:02.579> sets<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.539> pilots<00:01:03.960> could<00:01:04.080> take<00:01:04.229> them

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the head sets and pilots could take them

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.580 
the head sets and pilots could take them
off<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:05.060> without<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.299> typical<00:01:07.020> paddles

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
off and on without the typical paddles

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.320 
off and on without the typical paddles
pulling<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.189> their<00:01:08.310> ear<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> headset<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
pulling on their ear in the headset and

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.399 
pulling on their ear in the headset and
then<00:01:09.630> from<00:01:09.840> there

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
then from there

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.980 
then from there
aviators<00:01:11.340> started<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.850> evolve<00:01:12.090> with<00:01:12.420> cable

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
aviators started to evolve with cable

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.770 
aviators started to evolve with cable
temples<00:01:13.350> as<00:01:13.650> technology<00:01:14.570> started<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.659> get

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
temples as technology started to get

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.140 
temples as technology started to get
quite<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> bit<00:01:16.170> better<00:01:16.549> and<00:01:17.549> these<00:01:17.729> made<00:01:18.030> them

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
quite a bit better and these made them

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.520 
quite a bit better and these made them
quite<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.390> bit<00:01:18.450> more<00:01:18.659> secure<00:01:19.200> when<00:01:19.380> they<00:01:19.470> were

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
quite a bit more secure when they were

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.859 
quite a bit more secure when they were
on<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.939> felt<00:01:21.270> quite<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> bit<00:01:21.780> more

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
on and just felt quite a bit more

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.510 
on and just felt quite a bit more
comfortable<00:01:22.259> if<00:01:22.470> you're<00:01:22.590> not<00:01:22.710> feeling<00:01:23.009> a

comfortable if you're not feeling a

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.980 
comfortable if you're not feeling a
sample<00:01:24.330> behind<00:01:24.600> your<00:01:24.720> ear

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
sample behind your ear

sample behind your ear
aviators<00:01:25.439> originally<00:01:25.830> started<00:01:26.130> all<00:01:26.310> with<00:01:26.430> a

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
aviators originally started all with a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.219 
aviators originally started all with a
brow<00:01:26.759> bar<00:01:27.030> at<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.240> very<00:01:27.390> top<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.900> kept<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
brow bar at the very top it kept the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.980 
brow bar at the very top it kept the
sweat<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.890> pilots<00:01:29.250> eyes<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.689> way<00:01:30.900> if

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
sweat out of pilots eyes so that way if

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.990 
sweat out of pilots eyes so that way if
they<00:01:31.110> were<00:01:31.170> flying<00:01:32.040> their<00:01:32.220> fighter<00:01:32.430> jet<00:01:32.759> there

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
they were flying their fighter jet there

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.380 
they were flying their fighter jet there
was<00:01:33.119> no<00:01:33.329> obstructions<00:01:33.930> interview

like<00:01:47.680> personal<00:01:48.160> style<00:01:48.430> doesn't<00:01:48.730> really<00:01:48.850> know

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
like personal style doesn't really know

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.730 
like personal style doesn't really know
those<00:01:49.240> rules<00:01:49.420> so<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.200> lot<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.500> it<00:01:50.590> is<00:01:50.710> just

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
those rules so a lot of it is just

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.500 
those rules so a lot of it is just
confidence<00:01:51.550> what<00:01:51.700> you<00:01:51.760> feel<00:01:51.940> comfortable<00:01:52.330> in

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
confidence what you feel comfortable in

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.610 
confidence what you feel comfortable in
and<00:01:52.720> what<00:01:52.870> kind<00:01:52.960> of<00:01:53.080> looking<00:01:53.380> you<00:01:53.440> want<00:01:53.500> to

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
and what kind of looking you want to

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.120 
and what kind of looking you want to
portray<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:55.570> classic<00:01:56.050> aviator<00:01:56.200> is<00:01:56.680> teardrop

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
portray the classic aviator is teardrop

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.580 
portray the classic aviator is teardrop
so<00:01:57.910> I<00:01:57.940> think<00:01:58.060> if<00:01:58.300> you<00:01:58.450> want<00:01:58.630> to<00:01:58.690> look<00:01:58.930> classic

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
so I think if you want to look classic

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.350 
so I think if you want to look classic
and<00:02:00.130> you're<00:02:00.250> buying<00:02:00.520> aviator<00:02:00.970> because<00:02:01.240> of<00:02:01.300> the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
heritage the standard teardrop is the

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.380 
heritage the standard teardrop is the
only<00:02:04.390> way<00:02:04.510> to<00:02:04.570> go<00:02:05.610> if<00:02:06.610> you<00:02:06.700> want<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:07.120> kind<00:02:07.300> of
