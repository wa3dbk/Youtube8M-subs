cutting plane now in order to decide

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.119 
cutting plane now in order to decide

symmetry always consider the currents or

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.229

in the case of permanent magnets
equivalent<00:00:58.020> currents<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.399> have<00:00:59.760> another

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
equivalent currents so I have another

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.709 
equivalent currents so I have another
model<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.629> which<00:01:01.820> I'm<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:03.180> showing<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.969 
model in which I'm just showing the
currents<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:05.600> here<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.689> can<00:01:06.869> see<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.560> coil

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
currents and here you can see the coil

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.560 
currents and here you can see the coil
currents<00:01:08.580> for<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.180> solenoid<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.010> also<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.820> Z

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
currents for the solenoid and also the Z

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.899

now<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.570> decide<00:01:16.020> what<00:01:16.200> kind<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.409> symmetry<00:01:16.860> you

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
now to decide what kind of symmetry you

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.050 
now to decide what kind of symmetry you
have<00:01:17.220> let's<00:01:17.700> just<00:01:17.759> change<00:01:18.180> our<00:01:18.450> view<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:20.100> now

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
have let's just change our view so now

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.899 
have let's just change our view so now
you<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.869> see<00:01:22.110> from<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> top<00:01:22.950> we're<00:01:23.640> looking

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
you can see from the top we're looking

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.429 
you can see from the top we're looking
down<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:24.810> can<00:01:24.960> see<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.950> x<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.000> z<00:01:27.439> cutting

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
down and we can see the x and z cutting

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.990 
down and we can see the x and z cutting
planes<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.490> across<00:01:30.180> x<00:01:30.990> equals<00:01:31.500> 0<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.700> x<00:01:32.850> equals

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
planes so across x equals 0 the x equals

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.060 
planes so across x equals 0 the x equals
0<00:01:33.570> cutting<00:01:34.020> plane<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.619> here<00:01:36.560> you'll<00:01:37.560> notice<00:01:37.770> on

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
0 cutting plane is here you'll notice on

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.690 
0 cutting plane is here you'll notice on
this<00:01:38.640> side<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.450> currents<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.799> elbow<00:01:41.310> are

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
this side the currents on this elbow are

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.450 
this side the currents on this elbow are
in<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.240> positive<00:01:42.689> direction<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.649> then

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
in the positive direction and then

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.499 
in the positive direction and then
they're<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.729> negative<00:01:45.000> direction<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
they're in the negative direction on the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.569 
they're in the negative direction on the
other<00:01:45.659> side<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.439> that's<00:01:46.619> clearly<00:01:47.009> anti

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
other side so that's clearly anti

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.060 
other side so that's clearly anti
symmetry<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.210> similarly<00:01:49.170> if<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.680> consider

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
symmetry and similarly if we consider

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.539 
symmetry and similarly if we consider
the<00:01:50.310> z<00:01:50.549> equals<00:01:50.909> 0<00:01:51.090> cutting<00:01:51.450> plane<00:01:51.689> well<00:01:52.680> above

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
the z equals 0 cutting plane well above

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.109 
the z equals 0 cutting plane well above
the<00:01:54.540> cutting<00:01:54.869> plane<00:01:55.110> they're<00:01:55.979> heading<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
the cutting plane they're heading in the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.359 
the cutting plane they're heading in the
negative<00:01:57.540> direction<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.079> below<00:01:58.439> their

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
negative direction and below their

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.130 
negative direction and below their
heading<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.700> positive<00:02:00.090> direction<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.689> in

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
heading the positive direction so in

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.969 
heading the positive direction so in
both<00:02:01.350> cases<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:02.189> have<00:02:02.490> anti<00:02:03.030> symmetry<00:02:03.979> the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
both cases you have anti symmetry the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.660 
both cases you have anti symmetry the
only<00:02:05.250> time<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:06.299> would<00:02:06.450> have<00:02:07.009> actual<00:02:08.009> positive

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
only time you would have actual positive

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.029 
only time you would have actual positive
symmetry<00:02:09.090> condition<00:02:09.629> would<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.200> if<00:02:10.590> you're

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
symmetry condition would be if you're

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.280 
symmetry condition would be if you're
cutting

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
cutting

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.640

the<00:02:12.530> coil<00:02:13.400> using<00:02:14.239> the<00:02:14.480> y<00:02:14.659> equals<00:02:15.110> zero<00:02:15.290> plane

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
the coil using the y equals zero plane

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.410 
the coil using the y equals zero plane
and<00:02:15.980> we<00:02:16.159> don't<00:02:16.340> have<00:02:16.519> that<00:02:16.730> because<00:02:16.940> of<00:02:17.330> the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
and we don't have that because of the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.920 
and we don't have that because of the
other<00:02:17.569> geometry<00:02:18.379> of<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:19.220> solenoid<00:02:19.459> so<00:02:20.450> now

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
other geometry of the solenoid so now
