00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.569
 an excellent initiative is happening 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.670
 in Honduras country that was unfairly 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.400
 condemned for Brazil after testifying 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.150
 correctly legally 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.940
 constitutionally its ex-president 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.109
 zelaya now a long per son with the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.150
 current president authorized the creation 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:23.670
 rogue devel- 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.880
 entirely and managed by 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.070
 private initiative will be city ​​state 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.529
 totally private 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.140
 you can compare for example with rum 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.670
 kong singapura are the two let's say so 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.040
 city-states the right to be a Singapore 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.040
 country but at last practically a city 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.070
 state to the freest economies in the world 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.190
 They will repeat this in Honduras. 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.289
 The_Board is on a distinguished road 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.989
 remembering that honduras today is only 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.960
 six points in the ranking of 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.730
 freedom poses in relation to Brazil 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.379
 but with this change they will surely go 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.780
 up or at least in those regions 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.220
 in these cities will greatly increase the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.170
 development and another city ​​will 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.110
 own laws in one's own police 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.610
 everything private justice will not have 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.240
 state bureaucracy 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:23.700
 little or no regulation very low 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.820
 taxes is a free market indeed 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.650
 so pay attention this is not not be 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.140
 for that is not in book 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.110
 anarcho-capitalism but it sure is 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.090
 much closer than it is today 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.400
 Meanwhile in Brazil, people. 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.799
 continue this delay we act if we 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.140
 try to implement this initiative 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.560
 here we would have to spend maybe a 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.720
 decade discussing zucchini reforming 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.500
 constitution to try to make a 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.920
 same experience as honduras 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.380
 quickly change your constitution already 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.710
 begins one of the partners there 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.960
 that they consider the Mauritius island that 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.860
 today the eighth freest economy of the 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.190
 world 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.660
 then you can bet save this video or 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.120
 It's me that's telling. 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.760
 I'll bet that in a while 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.769
 is importing much of these 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.500
 places and will have a lot of people going to 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.700
 to wash away the migratory flow in 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.950
 pasta 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.310
 so it's a good opportunity there a 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.129
 free market opportunity 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.819
 far better than the old ones 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.920
 archaic state solutions wormy 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.200
 Dusty Jurassic 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.989
 pay attention I put many links 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.510
 here nor a beautiful party attention than 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.900
 will be the future of Honduras after this 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.760
 Congratulations honduras and negative point 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.819
 Brazil that sits waiting 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.730
 as the world develops in the roma 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:58.019
 future there is a pioneer that Brazil 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.019
 Unfortunately, there is no
