00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
what's up doing McCallum fans I'm

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.920 
what's up doing McCallum fans I'm
starting<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.740> work<00:00:04.920> on<00:00:05.100> my<00:00:05.670> first<00:00:06.480> Commission

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
starting to work on my first Commission

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.070 
starting to work on my first Commission
which<00:00:07.320> will<00:00:07.470> be<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.800> necron<00:00:08.250> pile<00:00:08.610> on<00:00:08.849> this<00:00:09.780> was

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
which will be a necron pile on this was

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.440 
which will be a necron pile on this was
my<00:00:10.500> first<00:00:11.010> attempt<00:00:11.519> way<00:00:11.670> back<00:00:11.910> when<00:00:12.150> when<00:00:12.210> I

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
my first attempt way back when when I

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.750 
my first attempt way back when when I
was<00:00:12.599> just<00:00:12.809> starting<00:00:13.110> out<00:00:13.710> doing<00:00:14.099> polystyrene

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:14.760 
was just starting out doing polystyrene

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.210 
was just starting out doing polystyrene
projects<00:00:15.300> it's<00:00:16.019> pretty<00:00:16.199> nice<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.679> never<00:00:16.890> got

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
projects it's pretty nice I never got

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.890 
projects it's pretty nice I never got
around<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.519> actually<00:00:17.789> finishing<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.509> out<00:00:18.659> with

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
around to actually finishing it out with

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.689 
around to actually finishing it out with
the<00:00:19.679> monolith<00:00:20.460> gem<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.179> the<00:00:21.449> kind<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.699> things

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
the monolith gem and the kind of things

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.970 
the monolith gem and the kind of things
that<00:00:23.880> come<00:00:24.089> out<00:00:24.329> of<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.689> pile<00:00:25.140> on<00:00:25.349> from<00:00:25.649> here

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
that come out of the pile on from here

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.249 
that come out of the pile on from here
so<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:26.880> was<00:00:27.060> my<00:00:27.179> first<00:00:27.359> attempt<00:00:27.810> at<00:00:27.899> a<00:00:27.960> necron

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
so this was my first attempt at a necron

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.649 
so this was my first attempt at a necron
pylon<00:00:28.679> after<00:00:28.919> seeing<00:00:29.220> an<00:00:29.640> actual<00:00:30.210> forward

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:30.659 
pylon after seeing an actual forward

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.359 
pylon after seeing an actual forward
world<00:00:31.109> model<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.559> realized<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.160> was<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
world model I realized that this was a

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.560 
world model I realized that this was a
little<00:00:32.640> bit<00:00:32.759> small<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:34.530> started<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.450> for<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
little bit small so I started on for the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.540 
little bit small so I started on for the
commission<00:00:37.020> with<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.040> my<00:00:38.190> initial

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
commission with this is my initial

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.400 
commission with this is my initial
design<00:00:38.850> not<00:00:39.480> quite<00:00:39.660> sure<00:00:39.690> if<00:00:39.900> this<00:00:40.050> will<00:00:40.200> end

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
design not quite sure if this will end

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.810 
design not quite sure if this will end
up<00:00:40.620> being<00:00:40.650> the<00:00:40.890> final<00:00:41.070> piece<00:00:41.400> i<00:00:41.580> ended<00:00:41.790> up

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
up being the final piece i ended up

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.730 
up being the final piece i ended up
shipping<00:00:42.090> out<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:42.750> i<00:00:42.930> wanted<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.350> go<00:00:43.470> ahead

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
shipping out but i wanted to go ahead

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.000 
shipping out but i wanted to go ahead
and<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:44.700> kind<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.000> show<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.540> status<00:00:46.500> video<00:00:46.800> on

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
and just kind of show a status video on

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.530 
and just kind of show a status video on
where<00:00:47.310> i<00:00:47.340> am<00:00:47.520> at<00:00:47.820> least<00:00:47.940> from<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.240> design

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
where i am at least from a design

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.020 
where i am at least from a design
standpoint<00:00:48.870> i<00:00:49.320> wanted<00:00:50.310> to<00:00:50.430> go<00:00:50.610> ahead<00:00:50.850> and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
standpoint i wanted to go ahead and

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.590 
standpoint i wanted to go ahead and
start<00:00:51.180> adding<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.600> lot<00:00:51.900> of<00:00:53.000> designs<00:00:54.000> into<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
start adding a lot of designs into the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.210 
start adding a lot of designs into the
polystyrene<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:57.590> thing<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.740> I<00:00:58.770> noticed<00:00:59.100> was

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
polystyrene the thing that I noticed was

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.400 
polystyrene the thing that I noticed was
that<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.460> lines<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.480> were<00:01:00.660> was<00:01:01.079> drawing

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
that the lines I were was drawing

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.130 
that the lines I were was drawing
earlier<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.860> just<00:01:02.220> couldn't<00:01:02.430> make<00:01:02.760> them<00:01:03.329> happen

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
earlier I just couldn't make them happen

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.550 
earlier I just couldn't make them happen
at<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.670> thin<00:01:05.749> when<00:01:06.749> I<00:01:06.780> was<00:01:06.960> cutting<00:01:07.140> into<00:01:07.380> it

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
at that thin when I was cutting into it

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.550 
at that thin when I was cutting into it
so<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.249> might<00:01:08.520> end<00:01:08.640> up<00:01:09.539> redoing<00:01:09.929> the<00:01:10.140> outer<00:01:10.259> ring

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
so I might end up redoing the outer ring

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.319 
so I might end up redoing the outer ring
but<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.829> just<00:01:11.009> kind<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.219> like<00:01:11.939> i<00:01:11.999> said<00:01:12.179> i<00:01:12.210> wanted

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
but I just kind of like i said i wanted

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:15.700 
but I just kind of like i said i wanted
to<00:01:12.509> show<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.109> the<00:01:13.229> initial<00:01:13.350> design<00:01:13.829> i

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
to show you this is the initial design i

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.010 
to show you this is the initial design i
also<00:01:16.710> went<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.729> picked<00:01:18.479> up<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.689> couple<00:01:18.840> of

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
also went and picked up a couple of

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.800 
also went and picked up a couple of
these<00:01:19.319> to<00:01:19.770> replace<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.549> need<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.939> having<00:01:21.179> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
these to replace the need of having the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.830 
these to replace the need of having the
necron<00:01:22.740> monolith<00:01:23.249> power<00:01:23.520> gem<00:01:23.969> I<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.600> pick<00:01:24.749> up

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
necron monolith power gem I can pick up

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.230 
necron monolith power gem I can pick up
a<00:01:24.899> handful<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.289> these<00:01:25.530> for<00:01:25.829> the<00:01:25.950> same<00:01:26.639> prices

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
a handful of these for the same prices

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.069 
a handful of these for the same prices
one<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.350> those<00:01:28.499> necron<00:01:29.009> power<00:01:29.280> gem<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.119> think

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
one of those necron power gem so I think

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.539 
one of those necron power gem so I think
this<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.469> a<00:01:31.499> pretty<00:01:31.649> good<00:01:31.859> substitute<00:01:32.369> will

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
this is a pretty good substitute will

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.370 
this is a pretty good substitute will
probably<00:01:32.850> end<00:01:32.939> up<00:01:33.060> extending<00:01:33.749> this<00:01:33.840> out<00:01:34.049> here

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
probably end up extending this out here

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.989 
probably end up extending this out here
with<00:01:34.530> some<00:01:34.679> green<00:01:34.920> stuff<00:01:35.100> maybe<00:01:35.579> putting<00:01:35.880> a

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:35.999 
with some green stuff maybe putting a

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:39.169 
with some green stuff maybe putting a
little<00:01:36.179> bit<00:01:36.329> around<00:01:36.569> gem<00:01:37.139> itself<00:01:37.850> so<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:38.999> can

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
little bit around gem itself so we can

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.569 
little bit around gem itself so we can
actually<00:01:39.780> attach<00:01:40.319> it<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.829> necron<00:01:41.219> pilot

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
actually attach it to the necron pilot

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.819 
actually attach it to the necron pilot
lon<00:01:41.789> about<00:01:42.539> yay<00:01:43.670> out<00:01:44.670> here<00:01:44.939> maybe<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:46.139> one<00:01:46.799> of

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
lon about yay out here maybe so one of

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.319 
lon about yay out here maybe so one of
the<00:01:46.950> really<00:01:47.069> cool<00:01:47.159> things<00:01:47.340> about<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.819> design

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the really cool things about this design

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.230 
the really cool things about this design
is<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.079> actually<00:01:49.350> breaks<00:01:49.679> down<00:01:50.149> let<00:01:51.149> me

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
is that it actually breaks down let me

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.289 
is that it actually breaks down let me
show<00:01:51.389> you<00:01:51.420> what<00:01:51.719> the<00:01:52.020> outcome<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.299> prepared

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
show you what the outcome is prepared

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.709 
show you what the outcome is prepared
for<00:01:54.569> shipping<00:01:54.899> kind<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:56.240> breakdown<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.479> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
for shipping kind of breakdown of the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.529 
for shipping kind of breakdown of the
necron<00:01:58.310> pylon<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.609> want<00:02:00.209> to<00:02:00.240> make<00:02:00.329> sure<00:02:00.389> that

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
necron pylon I want to make sure that

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.849 
necron pylon I want to make sure that
this<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.079> stable<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.709> can<00:02:01.920> handle<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:04.740> know

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:04.859 
this is stable and I can handle you know

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:07.429 
this is stable and I can handle you know
managing<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.520> around<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.969> battlefield<00:02:06.569> but<00:02:07.380> I

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
managing it around the battlefield but I

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.839 
managing it around the battlefield but I
also<00:02:07.619> want<00:02:07.859> to<00:02:07.889> make<00:02:08.009> sure<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.429> we<00:02:08.670> could

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
also want to make sure that we could

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.609 
also want to make sure that we could
ship<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.060> for<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> fairly<00:02:09.720> inexpensive<00:02:10.410> cause

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
ship it for a fairly inexpensive cause

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.070 
ship it for a fairly inexpensive cause
so<00:02:11.580> if<00:02:12.390> we<00:02:12.480> need<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.900> we'll<00:02:13.080> add<00:02:13.260> some<00:02:13.290> magnets

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
so if we need to we'll add some magnets

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.430 
so if we need to we'll add some magnets
to<00:02:14.200> add<00:02:14.920> some<00:02:15.250> stability<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:16.440> but

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
to add some stability to it but

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.630 
to add some stability to it but
otherwise<00:02:18.510> it'll<00:02:19.510> be<00:02:19.660> all<00:02:20.020> put<00:02:20.380> together

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
otherwise it'll be all put together

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.110 
otherwise it'll be all put together
ready<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.760> be<00:02:21.880> shipped<00:02:22.090> out<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:23.880> I<00:02:24.880> guess

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
ready to be shipped out and I guess

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.460 
ready to be shipped out and I guess
that's<00:02:25.300> about<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.510> right<00:02:25.840> now<00:02:25.870> i'm<00:02:26.110> just<00:02:26.290> like

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.820 
taking a little while to send out a
another<00:02:30.850> video<00:02:31.240> about<00:02:31.300> this<00:02:31.780> but<00:02:32.080> pretty
