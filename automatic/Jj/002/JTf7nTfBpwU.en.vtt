this<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.250> overclocked<00:00:32.940> edition<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:33.960> we<00:00:34.170> do

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
this is the overclocked edition so we do

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.170 
this is the overclocked edition so we do
get<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.520> higher<00:00:35.730> core<00:00:36.239> clock<00:00:37.700> now<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:38.969> is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
get the higher core clock now this is

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.580 
get the higher core clock now this is
the<00:00:39.360> overclocked<00:00:39.930> edition<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:41.100> get<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:42.590> 1150

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
the overclocked edition so we get a 1150

megahertz core clock this is the
next-generation<00:00:46.730> Radeon<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.180> based

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
next-generation Radeon so it is based

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.799

the dual fan vapor-x cooling solution
for<00:01:13.979> ports<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.520> get<00:01:14.760> two<00:01:15.000> DVI<00:01:15.390> ports<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.590> DP<00:01:17.220> port

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
for ports we get two DVI ports a DP port

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.960 
for ports we get two DVI ports a DP port
and<00:01:17.729> an<00:01:17.939> HDMI<00:01:18.630> port<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.250> then<00:01:20.250> if<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:20.700> take<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
and an HDMI port and then if we take a

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.910 
and an HDMI port and then if we take a
look<00:01:21.270> around<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.229> powered<00:01:22.710> by<00:01:22.740> a

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
look around here this is powered by a

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.890 
look around here this is powered by a
