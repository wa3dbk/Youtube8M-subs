00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.760
 It is also suitable for those who 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.080
 now nothing to do with the challenge 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.020
 because that's really a thing 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.969
 recipe for that one really no 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.200
 unusual ingredients are needed 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.480
 really not expensive what is really 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.010
 Very quickly, what you do is good either 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.230

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.230
 it is a level 1 court that is 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.820
 You can eat it until 19 o'clock and 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.719

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.469
 stop for two portions we need 850 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.010
 grated tomatoes some olive oil salt 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.040
 pepper rice target group red onion 2 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.010
 garlic cloves about 20 grams of almonds 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.930
 nut and some dried oregano 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.909
 after we have washed the tomatoes 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.280
 they fed the strunk away 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.520
 we have to give her one on 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.590
 baking paper laid sheet and baking 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.170
 They then circulated at about 200 degrees 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.170
 for about 15 to 20 minutes 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.240
 We distribute tomatoes quite well now 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.360
 then take it now check 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.759
 in the meantime or after a short time 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.630
 we heat the olive oil in 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.820
 and give the small cut 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.490
 onions and the small cut 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.149
 Add garlic and leave with both 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.149
 reasonable 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.250
 Next we need a mixer 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.680
 which is also good with one 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.140
 courier starts and then comes as 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.299
 first the finished tomatoes from the 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.060
 then the onions and the oven 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:25.780
 garlic from the pan then two more 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.780
 tablespoons olive oil 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.850

 the walk I must have now so brown 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.380
 Now you can live quite well 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.800
 and then we squeeze the whole thing with salt 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.800
 and pepper 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.849
 then we turn the dental needs that 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.849
 Everything can be tasted very well 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.319
