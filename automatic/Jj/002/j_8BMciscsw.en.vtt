now<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.710> know<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.340> most<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.059> us<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.390> check<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
now I know that most of us can check the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.180 
now I know that most of us can check the
oil<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.170> replace<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.710> occasional

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
oil and replace the occasional

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.770 
oil and replace the occasional
burned-out<00:00:35.460> light<00:00:35.520> bulb<00:00:35.940> but<00:00:36.510> could<00:00:36.660> you

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
burned-out light bulb but could you

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.479 
burned-out light bulb but could you
check<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.079> fuel<00:00:37.320> injector<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> belts<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
check the fuel injector the belts the

hoses and know exactly what to look for

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.920 
hoses and know exactly what to look for
well<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.850> same<00:00:42.030> can<00:00:42.239> be<00:00:42.270> said<00:00:42.390> for<00:00:42.629> your

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
well the same can be said for your

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.930 
well the same can be said for your
furnace<00:00:43.260> most<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.010> us<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.370> wipe<00:00:44.670> down<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
furnace most of us can wipe down the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.580 
furnace most of us can wipe down the
outside<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.719> unit<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.170> change<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
filter that's something that should be

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.080 
filter that's something that should be
done<00:00:48.450> monthly<00:00:48.870> not<00:00:49.379> just<00:00:49.710> seasonally<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:50.969> how

rises so a poorly insulated attic means
