00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
so the science of our 12 actually

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.220 
so the science of our 12 actually
combines<00:00:42.670> a<00:00:42.910> few<00:00:43.300> different<00:00:43.690> things<00:00:43.750> when

you're looking at recovery beverages

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.930 
you're looking at recovery beverages
there<00:00:47.620> are<00:00:47.680> a<00:00:47.710> lot<00:00:47.890> of<00:00:48.100> different<00:00:48.190> approaches

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
there are a lot of different approaches

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.850 
there are a lot of different approaches
you<00:00:49.239> can<00:00:49.269> take<00:00:49.449> you<00:00:49.900> can<00:00:50.110> take<00:00:50.320> a<00:00:50.530> pure

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
you can take you can take a pure

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.670 
you can take you can take a pure
electrolyte<00:00:51.730> approach<00:00:52.270> where<00:00:53.050> you're<00:00:53.379> just

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
electrolyte approach where you're just

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.010 
electrolyte approach where you're just
adding<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:54.760> things<00:00:55.030> that<00:00:55.270> are<00:00:55.420> sweating<00:00:55.870> out

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
adding the things that are sweating out

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.689 
adding the things that are sweating out
of<00:00:56.199> your<00:00:56.410> body<00:00:56.590> the<00:00:56.920> things<00:00:57.129> like<00:00:57.309> potassium

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
of your body the things like potassium

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.470 
of your body the things like potassium
magnesium<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:59.320> can<00:00:59.530> take<00:00:59.770> a<00:01:00.270> carbohydrate<00:01:01.270> I

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
magnesium you can take a carbohydrate I

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.320 
magnesium you can take a carbohydrate I
just<00:01:01.719> ran<00:01:02.020> a<00:01:02.050> bunch<00:01:02.410> and<00:01:02.829> so<00:01:03.460> my<00:01:03.699> body<00:01:03.940> needs

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
just ran a bunch and so my body needs

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.380 
just ran a bunch and so my body needs
sugars<00:01:05.050> and<00:01:05.379> so<00:01:05.619> you<00:01:05.680> drink<00:01:06.070> sugars<00:01:06.789> what

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
sugars and so you drink sugars what

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.870 
sugars and so you drink sugars what
we've<00:01:07.600> done<00:01:07.869> with<00:01:08.259> our<00:01:08.560> 12<00:01:08.950> is<00:01:09.280> we've<00:01:09.610> given

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
we've done with our 12 is we've given

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.990 
we've done with our 12 is we've given
you<00:01:10.060> 10<00:01:10.690> grams<00:01:11.050> of<00:01:11.320> protein<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:12.039> a<00:01:12.550> unique

you 10 grams of protein and a unique
carbohydrate<00:01:13.840> blend<00:01:14.140> rather<00:01:14.500> than<00:01:14.800> just<00:01:15.009> give

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
carbohydrate blend rather than just give

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.779 
carbohydrate blend rather than just give
you<00:01:15.369> sugar<00:01:15.670> we've<00:01:16.479> given<00:01:16.780> you<00:01:16.990> a<00:01:17.490> special<00:01:18.490> kind

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
you sugar we've given you a special kind

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.690 
you sugar we've given you a special kind
of<00:01:19.090> slow<00:01:19.509> digestion<00:01:20.229> and<00:01:20.979> what<00:01:21.220> this<00:01:21.399> sugar

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
of slow digestion and what this sugar

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.240 
of slow digestion and what this sugar
does<00:01:22.060> is<00:01:22.390> it<00:01:22.690> helps<00:01:23.020> set<00:01:23.350> off<00:01:23.560> your<00:01:23.590> body's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
does is it helps set off your body's

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.639 
does is it helps set off your body's
fat-burning<00:01:24.660> because<00:01:25.660> it<00:01:25.840> digests<00:01:26.440> more

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
fat-burning because it digests more

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.400 
fat-burning because it digests more
slowly<00:01:27.009> it<00:01:27.610> helps<00:01:28.060> you<00:01:28.209> maintain<00:01:28.660> energy

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
slowly it helps you maintain energy

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.370 
slowly it helps you maintain energy
longer<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:30.369> helps<00:01:31.000> you<00:01:31.149> burn<00:01:31.420> more<00:01:31.660> fat<00:01:31.990> and

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
longer it helps you burn more fat and

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.740 
longer it helps you burn more fat and
which<00:01:33.009> is<00:01:33.190> why<00:01:33.369> we're<00:01:33.580> exercising<00:01:33.910> to<00:01:34.450> begin
