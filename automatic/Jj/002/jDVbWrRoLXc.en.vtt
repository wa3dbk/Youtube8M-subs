00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
here right I i originally thought that

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.460 
here right I i originally thought that
this<00:01:36.150> was<00:01:36.299> going<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> be<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.689> kind<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.079> pain<00:01:37.350> in

this was going to be a kind of pain in
the<00:01:37.590> ass<00:01:37.650> but<00:01:38.869> after<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.900> week<00:01:41.360> it<00:01:42.360> really

the ass but after a week it really
wasn't<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.020> bad<00:01:43.939> so<00:01:44.939> let's<00:01:45.060> take<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> look<00:01:45.420> at<00:01:45.509> it

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
wasn't so bad so let's take a look at it

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:53.320 
wasn't so bad so let's take a look at it
open
