it's very basically painted just pretty
much<00:00:36.090> primarily<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.600> red<00:00:36.719> plastic<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
much primarily the red plastic and the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.900 
much primarily the red plastic and the
symbol<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.649> little<00:00:37.829> safety<00:00:38.129> thing<00:00:38.340> really

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
symbol and a little safety thing really

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.729 
symbol and a little safety thing really
nothing<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.540> at<00:00:39.600> all<00:00:39.719> no<00:00:40.079> electronics<00:00:40.649> or

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
nothing to it at all no electronics or

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.639 
nothing to it at all no electronics or
anything<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.270> you<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:42.570> place<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.379> key

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
anything like that you can place the key

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.060 
anything like that you can place the key
or<00:00:43.950> any<00:00:44.280> key<00:00:44.550> really<00:00:44.989> into<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.980> will

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
or any key really into it and it will

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.180 
or any key really into it and it will
lock<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.520> there<00:00:47.930> no<00:00:48.930> sounds<00:00:49.320> or<00:00:49.379> anything<00:00:49.559> but

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
lock in there no sounds or anything but

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.040 
lock in there no sounds or anything but
it<00:00:50.340> does<00:00:50.460> stay<00:00:50.730> locked<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.870> way<00:00:51.989> you

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
it does stay locked and the way you

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.290 
it does stay locked and the way you
release<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.800> by<00:00:52.920> pressing<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.309> button<00:00:53.370> so

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
release it is by pressing this button so

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.000 
release it is by pressing this button so
I<00:00:54.629> guess<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.140> kind<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.379> neat<00:00:55.559> they<00:00:55.710> tried<00:00:55.980> to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
I guess it's kind of neat they tried to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.860 
I guess it's kind of neat they tried to
give<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.850> little<00:00:56.940> key<00:00:57.149> functionality<00:00:57.750> but

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
give it a little key functionality but

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.819 
give it a little key functionality but
it<00:00:57.960> kinda<00:00:58.140> doesn't<00:00:58.320> make<00:00:58.469> sense<00:00:58.680> without

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
it kinda doesn't make sense without

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.459 
it kinda doesn't make sense without
sounds<00:00:59.399> and<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.480> like<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.780> very<00:01:01.020> basic

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
sounds and this is like the very basic

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.900 
sounds and this is like the very basic
set<00:01:01.680> honestly<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.190> think<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.699> would<00:01:02.789> have<00:01:02.879> been

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
set honestly I think it would have been

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.160 
set honestly I think it would have been
better<00:01:03.180> if<00:01:03.300> they<00:01:03.390> would<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.629> included<00:01:03.840> some

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
better if they would have included some

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.050 
better if they would have included some
sound<00:01:04.379> versions<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.979> some<00:01:05.159> sort<00:01:05.750> and<00:01:06.890> then

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
sound versions of some sort and then

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.630 
sound versions of some sort and then
here<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.210> have<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.720> super<00:01:10.590> mega<00:01:10.740> saber<00:01:11.040> which

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
here we have the super mega saber which

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.789 
here we have the super mega saber which
all<00:01:11.790> yet<00:01:11.970> again<00:01:12.210> very<00:01:12.570> very<00:01:12.659> basic<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
all yet again very very basic the the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.830 
all yet again very very basic the the
bare<00:01:14.040> minimum<00:01:14.520> here<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.970> paint<00:01:15.659> and

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
bare minimum here of paint and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.200 
bare minimum here of paint and
everything<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.470> yet<00:01:16.920> again<00:01:17.130> no<00:01:17.369> sounds<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.060> it

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
everything and yet again no sounds on it

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.880 
everything and yet again no sounds on it
it<00:01:18.659> has<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> same<00:01:19.140> functionality<00:01:19.560> as<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
it has the same functionality as the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.800 
it has the same functionality as the
blade<00:01:20.220> where<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.610> can<00:01:20.820> place<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> key<00:01:21.720> in

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
blade where you can place the key in

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.870 
blade where you can place the key in
there<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.229> locks<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.460> won't<00:01:23.640> come<00:01:23.729> out

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
there and it locks so it won't come out

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.550 
there and it locks so it won't come out
I<00:01:23.939> guess<00:01:24.240> if<00:01:24.390> it's<00:01:24.540> kids<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.259> more<00:01:25.439> that

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
I guess if it's kids if it's more that

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.289 
I guess if it's kids if it's more that
excuse<00:01:26.130> me<00:01:26.280> got<00:01:26.549> tongue-tied<00:01:26.759> for<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> second

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
excuse me got tongue-tied for a second

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.050 
excuse me got tongue-tied for a second
if<00:01:27.390> it's<00:01:27.570> kids<00:01:27.780> want<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.920> know<00:01:29.070> if<00:01:29.790> kids

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.649 
no sounds the bare minimum here is the
comparison<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> one<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.329> comes<00:01:39.540> with

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
comparison of the one that comes with

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.480 
comparison of the one that comes with
the<00:01:39.990> deluxe<00:01:40.560> training<00:01:40.950> set<00:01:41.130> which<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.400> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the deluxe training set which is the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.639 
the deluxe training set which is the
regular<00:01:41.850> small<00:01:42.180> sound<00:01:42.450> version<00:01:42.840> which<00:01:43.530> is

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
regular small sound version which is

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.590 
regular small sound version which is
obviously<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.310> lot<00:01:44.369> better<00:01:44.700> quality<00:01:45.210> wise

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
obviously a lot better quality wise

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.210 
obviously a lot better quality wise
because<00:01:46.049> it's<00:01:46.170> got<00:01:46.320> sounds<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.829> also<00:01:46.920> just

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
because it's got sounds and also just

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.539 
because it's got sounds and also just
look<00:01:47.399> wise<00:01:47.610> too<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:49.170> then<00:01:49.380> just<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.430> hell

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
look wise too and then just for the hell

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.889 
look wise too and then just for the hell
of<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.790> here<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.210> next<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.689> deluxe

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
of it here it is next to the deluxe

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.780 
of it here it is next to the deluxe
version<00:01:52.020> which<00:01:52.979> was<00:01:53.070> obviously<00:01:53.250> gonna<00:01:53.700> be

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
version which was obviously gonna be

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.910 
version which was obviously gonna be
quite<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> bit<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.450> difference<00:01:54.720> there<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.649> it's

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
quite a bit of difference there so it's

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.069 
quite a bit of difference there so it's
it's<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.399> pretty<00:01:56.670> pretty<00:01:57.060> bad<00:01:57.240> version<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.930> it

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
it's a pretty pretty bad version of it

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.700 
it's a pretty pretty bad version of it
honestly<00:01:59.180> and<00:02:00.180> then<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.930> key<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.140> pretty<00:02:01.530> much

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
honestly and then the key is pretty much

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.679 
honestly and then the key is pretty much
the<00:02:01.829> same<00:02:02.040> super<00:02:02.310> Megaforce<00:02:02.700> red<00:02:02.850> key<00:02:03.090> you

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
the same super Megaforce red key you

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.160 
the same super Megaforce red key you
would<00:02:03.869> get<00:02:04.049> with<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.530> pack<00:02:04.710> or<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:06.170> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
would get with like the pack or the the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.630 
would get with like the pack or the the
Morpher<00:02:07.530> just<00:02:07.770> may<00:02:07.979> be<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.250> some<00:02:08.280> slight

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
Morpher just may be of some slight

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.190 
Morpher just may be of some slight
variations<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.509> might<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:09.750> be<00:02:09.929> seeing

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
variations that you might just be seeing

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.390 
variations that you might just be seeing
for<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.470> heck<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.770> but<00:02:10.950> it's<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.129> same

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
for the heck of it but it's the same

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.730 
for the heck of it but it's the same
thing<00:02:11.690> obviously<00:02:12.690> it's<00:02:13.050> gonna<00:02:13.140> make<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.349> same

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
thing obviously it's gonna make the same

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.590 
thing obviously it's gonna make the same
sounds<00:02:14.160> I'll<00:02:14.670> just<00:02:14.880> go<00:02:15.030> ahead<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.360> show<00:02:15.570> it

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
sounds I'll just go ahead and show it

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:34.790 
sounds I'll just go ahead and show it
just<00:02:16.020> for<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.530> hell<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:33.470> yeah<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:34.650> that's

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
just for the hell of it yeah so that's

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.860 
just for the hell of it yeah so that's
pretty<00:02:35.010> much<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.400> for<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.780> then

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
pretty much it for that and then

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.330 
pretty much it for that and then
obviously<00:02:36.990> you<00:02:37.350> do<00:02:37.470> get<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.800> mask<00:02:38.040> here

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
obviously you do get this mask here

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.890 
obviously you do get this mask here
which<00:02:38.490> is<00:02:38.670> identical<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.510> one<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.780> would

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
which is identical to the one you would

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.680 
which is identical to the one you would
get<00:02:39.990> in<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.170> deluxe<00:02:40.410> training<00:02:40.890> sets<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:42.120> I

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
get in the deluxe training sets and I

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.820 
get in the deluxe training sets and I
believe<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.050> one<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.260> just<00:02:43.350> get<00:02:43.500> on<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.620> so

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
believe the one you just get on it so

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.290 
believe the one you just get on it so
nothing<00:02:44.190> special<00:02:44.610> it's<00:02:44.850> pretty<00:02:45.030> bare-bones

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
nothing special it's pretty bare-bones

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.120 
nothing special it's pretty bare-bones
as<00:02:46.050> I<00:02:46.170> said<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.470> deluxe<00:02:46.650> trainings<00:02:47.010> that

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
as I said the deluxe trainings that

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.400 
as I said the deluxe trainings that
review<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.430> think<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:48.150> don't<00:02:49.050> think<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.350> know

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
review I think that I don't think I know

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.950 
review I think that I don't think I know
I<00:02:49.500> missed<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.950> black<00:02:50.490> visors<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.030> because<00:02:51.870> I

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
I missed the black visors and because I

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.600 
I missed the black visors and because I
made<00:02:52.170> like<00:02:52.410> halfway<00:02:52.620> decent<00:02:53.130> display<00:02:53.400> pieces

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
made like halfway decent display pieces

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.970 
made like halfway decent display pieces
and<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:54.330> know<00:02:54.420> even<00:02:54.570> when<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:54.870> was<00:02:55.080> little<00:02:55.110> I

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
and you know even when I was little I

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.770 
and you know even when I was little I
would<00:02:56.250> get<00:02:56.460> those<00:02:56.610> masks<00:02:57.060> from<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.330> costumes

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
would get those masks from the costumes

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.180 
would get those masks from the costumes
and<00:02:57.960> they<00:02:58.020> would<00:02:58.170> have<00:02:58.320> black<00:02:58.620> visors<00:02:58.830> they

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
and they would have black visors they

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.800 
and they would have black visors they
had<00:02:59.310> like<00:02:59.460> little<00:02:59.580> slats<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.510> I'm<00:03:00.630> so<00:03:00.720> you

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
had like little slats and I'm so you

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.480 
had like little slats and I'm so you
could<00:03:00.960> see<00:03:01.170> but<00:03:01.620> still<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.190> made<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.430> feel

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
could see but still it made you feel

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.940 
could see but still it made you feel
feel<00:03:03.450> more<00:03:03.630> like<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.780> Power<00:03:04.020> Ranger<00:03:04.290> than<00:03:04.410> these

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
feel more like a Power Ranger than these

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.580 
feel more like a Power Ranger than these
I<00:03:04.980> think<00:03:05.580> but<00:03:06.540> yes<00:03:06.690> it's<00:03:06.930> pretty<00:03:07.080> basic<00:03:07.290> it

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
I think but yes it's pretty basic it

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.020 
I think but yes it's pretty basic it
does<00:03:07.740> fit<00:03:07.950> on<00:03:08.070> me<00:03:08.190> I'll<00:03:08.280> just<00:03:08.430> show<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.850> same

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
does fit on me I'll just show the same

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.060 
does fit on me I'll just show the same
footage<00:03:09.270> from<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.450> other<00:03:09.540> review<00:03:09.810> Troy<00:03:10.440> do

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
footage from the other review Troy do

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.460 
footage from the other review Troy do
you<00:03:11.160> see<00:03:11.340> any<00:03:11.520> tears<00:03:11.820> do<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.780> mean<00:03:12.990> yeah<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.320> it

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
you see any tears do you mean yeah so it

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.200 
you see any tears do you mean yeah so it
does<00:03:13.620> fits<00:03:13.920> but<00:03:14.640> it's<00:03:14.790> really<00:03:15.000> nothing

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
does fits but it's really nothing

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.200 
does fits but it's really nothing
spectacular<00:03:15.860> mr.<00:03:16.860> overall<00:03:17.340> I<00:03:17.640> think<00:03:17.700> this<00:03:18.000> set

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
spectacular mr. overall I think this set

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.270 
spectacular mr. overall I think this set
is<00:03:18.330> pretty<00:03:18.540> bad<00:03:18.840> obviously<00:03:19.440> for<00:03:19.650> collectors<00:03:20.010> I

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
is pretty bad obviously for collectors I

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.440 
is pretty bad obviously for collectors I
really<00:03:20.550> don't<00:03:20.730> recommend<00:03:20.970> this<00:03:21.150> at<00:03:21.300> all

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
really don't recommend this at all

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.330 
really don't recommend this at all
unless<00:03:22.080> you're<00:03:22.260> on<00:03:22.380> a<00:03:22.410> super<00:03:22.770> budget<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.190> want

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
unless you're on a super budget you want

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
don't recommend this I mean just

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.710 
don't recommend this I mean just
thinking<00:03:35.130> back<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.460> my<00:03:35.550> like<00:03:35.790> child<00:03:36.030> mind<00:03:36.420> I

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
thinking back to my like child mind I

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.960 
thinking back to my like child mind I
wouldn't<00:03:37.230> think<00:03:37.320> it<00:03:37.470> was<00:03:37.530> very<00:03:37.800> fun<00:03:38.130> just

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
wouldn't think it was very fun just

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.340 
wouldn't think it was very fun just
considering<00:03:39.420> that<00:03:39.540> there's<00:03:39.750> no<00:03:39.900> sounds<00:03:40.290> or

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
considering that there's no sounds or

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.070 
considering that there's no sounds or
anything<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:40.890> they're<00:03:41.430> pretty<00:03:41.730> basic<00:03:42.000> if<00:03:42.810> I

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
anything and they're pretty basic if I

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.420 
anything and they're pretty basic if I
were<00:03:43.350> you<00:03:43.470> if<00:03:43.590> you're<00:03:43.710> looking<00:03:43.950> for<00:03:44.100> it<00:03:44.250> for<00:03:44.400> a

a<00:03:54.030> little<00:03:54.240> key<00:03:54.420> buckle<00:03:54.720> it's<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:54.930> little<00:03:55.140> more

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
a little key buckle it's a little more

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.680 
a little key buckle it's a little more
pricey<00:03:55.530> but<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.520> think<00:03:57.090> it's<00:03:57.180> more<00:03:57.330> worth<00:03:57.480> it

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
pricey but I think it's more worth it

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.090 
pricey but I think it's more worth it
for<00:03:57.810> a<00:03:57.870> lot<00:03:58.050> more<00:03:58.170> fun<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.440> think<00:03:58.560> this<00:03:58.800> is<00:03:58.920> just

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
for a lot more fun I think this is just

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.650 
for a lot more fun I think this is just
it's<00:03:59.550> I<00:03:59.790> think<00:03:59.850> it's<00:04:00.090> going<00:04:00.270> to<00:04:00.330> all-around

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
it's I think it's going to all-around

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.290 
it's I think it's going to all-around
bad<00:04:00.840> for<00:04:01.080> kids<00:04:01.260> or<00:04:01.440> collectors<00:04:02.060> yeah<00:04:03.060> that's

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300

bad for kids or collectors yeah that's
