00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
okay so the next step on this is we have

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.740 
okay so the next step on this is we have
to<00:00:03.629> release<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:05.009> tie<00:00:05.190> rod<00:00:05.430> end<00:00:05.670> this<00:00:06.509> is<00:00:06.720> a

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
to release the tie rod end this is a

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.259 
to release the tie rod end this is a
handy<00:00:07.170> dandy<00:00:07.319> little<00:00:07.500> tool<00:00:07.890> for<00:00:08.280> it<00:00:08.370> I<00:00:08.550> think<00:00:09.240> I

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
handy dandy little tool for it I think I

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.970 
handy dandy little tool for it I think I
got<00:00:09.300> this<00:00:09.540> thing<00:00:09.599> for<00:00:09.929> probably<00:00:10.170> about<00:00:10.260> $20

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
got this thing for probably about $20

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.020 
got this thing for probably about $20
$25<00:00:11.759> at<00:00:11.940> one<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:13.549> automotive<00:00:14.549> stores

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
$25 at one of the the automotive stores

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.019 
$25 at one of the the automotive stores
so<00:00:16.020> what<00:00:16.289> we're<00:00:16.440> going<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.590> do<00:00:16.770> here<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:20.000> put<00:00:21.000> a

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
so what we're going to do here is put a

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.359 
so what we're going to do here is put a
wrench<00:00:21.420> on<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.840> tighten<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.650> down<00:00:22.710> and

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
wrench on this tighten this down and

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.480 
wrench on this tighten this down and
this<00:00:23.810> will<00:00:24.890> force<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.949> tie<00:00:26.250> rod<00:00:26.519> end<00:00:26.930> out<00:00:27.930> of

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
this will force the tie rod end out of

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.730 
this will force the tie rod end out of
its<00:00:29.490> socket<00:00:29.960> so<00:00:30.960> here's<00:00:31.199> how<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.529> going

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
its socket so here's how this is going

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.590 
its socket so here's how this is going
to<00:00:31.800> go<00:00:33.170> hopefully<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.410> see<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.800> here

now let's actually get them tight enough
there<00:02:12.730> so<00:02:13.730> what's<00:02:13.910> going<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.120> happen<00:02:14.510> is<00:02:14.980> these

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
there so what's going to happen is these

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.850 
there so what's going to happen is these
two<00:02:16.430> parts<00:02:17.210> are<00:02:17.270> going<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.480> compress<00:02:17.860> and

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
two parts are going to compress and

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.720 
two parts are going to compress and
force<00:02:19.250> this<00:02:19.550> nut<00:02:20.530> bottom<00:02:21.550> pressure<00:02:22.550> on

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
force this nut bottom pressure on

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.650 
force this nut bottom pressure on
there's<00:02:22.880> nothing<00:02:23.150> in<00:02:23.210> the<00:02:23.300> bottom<00:02:23.420> of<00:02:23.600> the

this particular tie rod in and over
leather-like<00:02:34.250> happening<00:02:34.730> here<00:02:38.110> let's<00:02:39.110> go<00:02:39.260> to

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
leather-like happening here let's go to

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.990 
leather-like happening here let's go to
fifteen<00:02:39.710> sixteenths<00:02:40.450> soft<00:02:42.640> let<00:02:43.640> me<00:02:43.760> just

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
fifteen sixteenths soft let me just

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.910 
fifteen sixteenths soft let me just
start<00:02:44.920> tightening<00:02:45.920> this<00:02:46.250> up

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
move it well there's the bang I was

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.270 
move it well there's the bang I was
talking<00:04:58.960> about<00:05:00.180> so<00:05:01.180> there<00:05:01.330> that's<00:05:01.570> it<00:05:01.750> now<00:05:02.280> you

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
talking about so there that's it now you

see<00:05:03.520> that<00:05:03.730> I<00:05:04.080> remove<00:05:05.080> this<00:05:09.570> take<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.720> bolt

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
see that I remove this take the bolt

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.070 
see that I remove this take the bolt
above<00:05:11.230> the<00:05:11.290> bottom<00:05:11.770> here<00:05:12.720> I'm<00:05:13.720> just<00:05:13.900> going<00:05:14.050> to

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
above the bottom here I'm just going to

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.790 
above the bottom here I'm just going to
show<00:05:14.350> why<00:05:15.300> the<00:05:16.300> tie<00:05:16.480> rod<00:05:16.780> end<00:05:17.020> is<00:05:17.170> so<00:05:17.320> important

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
show why the tie rod end is so important

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.280 
show why the tie rod end is so important
and<00:05:18.160> potentially<00:05:18.940> dangerous<00:05:19.200> even<00:05:20.200> though

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
and potentially dangerous even though

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.650 
and potentially dangerous even though
that's<00:05:20.410> worn<00:05:20.830> that's<00:05:21.730> keeping<00:05:22.180> the<00:05:22.270> wheel<00:05:22.450> in

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
that's worn that's keeping the wheel in

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.270 
that's worn that's keeping the wheel in
place<00:05:23.700> if<00:05:24.700> somebody<00:05:25.060> kept<00:05:25.240> driving<00:05:25.510> this

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
place if somebody kept driving this

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.880 
place if somebody kept driving this
until<00:05:27.280> this<00:05:27.460> tire<00:05:27.790> run<00:05:28.030> and<00:05:28.500> failed<00:05:29.500> and

until this tire run and failed and

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:30.930 
until this tire run and failed and
popped<00:05:30.190> out<00:05:30.400> of<00:05:30.430> here

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
popped out of here

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.770 
popped out of here
this<00:05:31.870> will<00:05:32.080> be<00:05:32.230> hit<00:05:32.740> worn<00:05:33.070> failed<00:05:33.550> and<00:05:33.850> see

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
this will be hit worn failed and see

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.700 
this will be hit worn failed and see
that<00:05:35.310> all<00:05:36.310> of<00:05:36.490> a<00:05:36.580> sudden<00:05:37.200> your<00:05:38.200> wheel<00:05:38.410> is<00:05:38.440> just

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
that all of a sudden your wheel is just

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
that all of a sudden your wheel is just
moving<00:05:39.160> free<00:05:39.600> so<00:05:40.600> that's<00:05:40.720> why<00:05:41.400> you<00:05:42.400> don't<00:05:42.550> want

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:42.730 
moving free so that's why you don't want

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.230 
moving free so that's why you don't want
to<00:05:42.790> take<00:05:42.970> any<00:05:43.150> chances<00:05:43.540> of<00:05:43.660> the<00:05:43.750> bad<00:05:43.930> tire<00:05:44.200> on
