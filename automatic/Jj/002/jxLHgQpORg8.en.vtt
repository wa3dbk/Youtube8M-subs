can use this hint down here if I want
and<00:04:01.780> see<00:04:02.470> where<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.739> computer<00:04:03.220> tells<00:04:03.430> me<00:04:03.610> I

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
and see where the computer tells me I

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.910 
and see where the computer tells me I
should<00:04:03.910> go<00:04:04.060> so<00:04:04.989> that's<00:04:05.200> where<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.500> computer

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
should go so that's where the computer

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.199 
should go so that's where the computer
tells<00:04:06.100> me<00:04:06.250> I<00:04:06.310> should<00:04:06.489> place<00:04:06.730> mine<00:04:06.940> I'm<00:04:07.120> going

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
tells me I should place mine I'm going

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.610 
tells me I should place mine I'm going
to<00:04:07.269> go<00:04:07.390> ahead<00:04:07.420> and<00:04:07.570> place<00:04:07.780> mine<00:04:08.019> they're<00:04:08.320> also

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
to go ahead and place mine they're also

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.580 
to go ahead and place mine they're also
at<00:04:09.549> any<00:04:09.730> time<00:04:10.060> remember<00:04:10.570> that<00:04:10.750> I<00:04:11.140> can<00:04:11.410> actually

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590

use this back button to replay the last

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.199 
use this back button to replay the last
move<00:04:14.799> so<00:04:14.950> I<00:04:15.010> click<00:04:15.310> that<00:04:15.430> back<00:04:15.730> it's<00:04:16.000> going<00:04:16.150> to

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
move so I click that back it's going to

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.759 
move so I click that back it's going to

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
that move let's say go ahead and go here

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.490 
that move let's say go ahead and go here
in<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.040> middle<00:04:21.570> also<00:04:22.570> at<00:04:22.720> any<00:04:22.870> time<00:04:23.140> let<00:04:23.169> me

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
in the middle also at any time let me

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.339 
in the middle also at any time let me
select<00:04:23.740> a<00:04:24.040> few<00:04:24.250> more<00:04:24.430> points<00:04:24.729> here<00:04:25.090> and<00:04:25.349> show

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
select a few more points here and show

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.500 
select a few more points here and show
you<00:04:26.410> what<00:04:26.650> what<00:04:27.340> to<00:04:27.490> do<00:04:27.700> now<00:04:27.940> the<00:04:28.000> whole<00:04:28.300> point

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
you what what to do now the whole point
