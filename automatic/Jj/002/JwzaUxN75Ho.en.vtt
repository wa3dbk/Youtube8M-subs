00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.660 
thinking of a pentatonic scale almost I
kind<00:00:56.440> of<00:00:56.500> always<00:00:56.620> relate<00:00:56.950> everything<00:00:57.070> back<00:00:57.489> to

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
kind of always relate everything back to

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.000 
kind of always relate everything back to
a<00:00:57.700> minor<00:00:57.940> pentatonic<00:00:58.329> scale<00:00:58.840> and<00:00:59.559> it<00:00:59.680> makes

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
a minor pentatonic scale and it makes

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.210 
a minor pentatonic scale and it makes
life<00:01:00.220> easier<00:01:00.550> that<00:01:00.730> way<00:01:00.760> for<00:01:01.059> me<00:01:01.180> so<00:01:01.570> I've<00:01:02.440> got
