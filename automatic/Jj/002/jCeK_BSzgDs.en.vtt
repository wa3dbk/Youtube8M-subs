to extend sets we uncover any of that
muscle<00:00:42.670> fibers<00:00:43.180> as<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.510> key<00:00:43.720> to<00:00:43.840> growth

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
muscle fibers as the key to growth

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.870 
muscle fibers as the key to growth
finding<00:00:44.650> the<00:00:44.740> untapped<00:00:45.160> I'll<00:00:45.370> so<00:00:45.520> if<00:00:45.579> I<00:00:45.700> were
