the<00:02:03.740> advantage<00:02:04.250> of<00:02:04.400> that<00:02:04.460> is<00:02:04.910> so<00:02:05.570> that<00:02:05.810> the

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
the advantage of that is so that the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.770 
the advantage of that is so that the
saddle<00:02:06.890> pad<00:02:07.130> actually<00:02:07.760> doesn't<00:02:08.180> slip<00:02:08.509> back

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.860 
approximately given the length of this
particular<00:02:38.660> girth<00:02:40.180> then<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:41.270> pick<00:02:41.450> up<00:02:41.660> the

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
particular girth then I pick up the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.860 
particular girth then I pick up the
third<00:02:42.200> village<00:02:42.709> strap<00:02:43.070> and<00:02:43.400> also<00:02:44.330> put<00:02:44.600> it<00:02:44.720> in

third village strap and also put it in
whole<00:02:45.110> number<00:02:45.500> three<00:02:45.830> so<00:02:46.640> what<00:02:46.820> I<00:02:46.850> have<00:02:47.240> is<00:02:47.650> a

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
whole number three so what I have is a

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.330 
whole number three so what I have is a

complete side with the middle billet
strap<00:02:52.760> free<00:02:53.300> so<00:02:53.780> it's<00:02:54.020> not<00:02:54.200> pinching

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
strap free so it's not pinching

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
approximately one fist length to the

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.500 
approximately one fist length to the
gullet<00:03:14.170> behind<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.410> point<00:03:15.769> of<00:03:15.920> withers<00:03:16.510> which

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
gullet behind the point of withers which

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.210 
gullet behind the point of withers which
it<00:03:17.690> is<00:03:17.980> reach<00:03:18.980> underneath<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:20.800> gently<00:03:21.800> pull

it is reach underneath and gently pull

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.570 
it is reach underneath and gently pull
the<00:03:22.250> girth<00:03:23.050> into<00:03:24.050> position<00:03:24.650> in<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:25.040> girth

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
the girth into position in the girth

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.840 
the girth into position in the girth
groove<00:03:26.290> in<00:03:27.290> front<00:03:27.680> of<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:27.830> barrel<00:03:28.190> one<00:03:28.370> behind

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
groove in front of the barrel one behind

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.770 
groove in front of the barrel one behind
the<00:03:29.150> elbow<00:03:29.739> now<00:03:30.739> this<00:03:30.980> is<00:03:31.040> we<00:03:32.030> have<00:03:32.209> to<00:03:32.239> reverse

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
the elbow now this is we have to reverse

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.350 
the elbow now this is we have to reverse
it<00:03:33.019> so<00:03:33.260> this<00:03:33.500> comes<00:03:33.830> up<00:03:34.100> through<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:34.910> second

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
it so this comes up through the second

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.199 
it so this comes up through the second
keeper<00:03:35.840> and<00:03:36.410> goes<00:03:37.100> to<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.550> first<00:03:37.790> billet

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
keeper and goes to the first billet

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:44.290 
keeper and goes to the first billet
straps<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.870> then<00:03:42.310> middle<00:03:43.310> belt<00:03:43.489> strap<00:03:43.880> free

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
straps and then middle belt strap free

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.930 
straps and then middle belt strap free
third<00:03:45.290> billet<00:03:45.739> straps<00:03:45.920> picks<00:03:46.340> up<00:03:46.550> the<00:03:46.730> next

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
third billet straps picks up the next

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.360 
third billet straps picks up the next
one<00:03:47.180> now<00:03:48.019> you<00:03:48.080> can<00:03:48.350> see<00:03:48.590> that<00:03:48.800> there's<00:03:49.010> quite<00:03:49.340> a

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
one now you can see that there's quite a

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.690 
one now you can see that there's quite a
bit<00:03:49.459> of<00:03:49.640> slack<00:03:50.090> here<00:03:50.540> so<00:03:51.350> I<00:03:51.380> know<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:52.280> I<00:03:52.310> left

room on the off side of the right side

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.100 
room on the off side of the right side
to<00:03:56.630> tighten<00:03:56.840> up<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.350> girth<00:03:57.850> so<00:03:58.850> we<00:03:59.110> tighten

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
to tighten up the girth so we tighten

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.210 
to tighten up the girth so we tighten
this<00:04:00.260> up<00:04:00.320> here<00:04:01.310> to<00:04:01.670> let's<00:04:02.030> say<00:04:02.239> number<00:04:02.630> five

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
this up here to let's say number five

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.710 
this up here to let's say number five
with<00:04:04.220> this<00:04:04.400> whole<00:04:05.230> leave<00:04:06.230> it<00:04:06.470> a<00:04:06.620> little<00:04:06.950> loose

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
with this whole leave it a little loose

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.520 
with this whole leave it a little loose
go<00:04:08.720> back<00:04:09.080> to<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.560> other<00:04:09.709> side

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.140 

and<00:04:15.229> continue<00:04:16.229> the<00:04:16.380> process<00:04:16.680> this<00:04:17.549> has<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:17.970> be

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
and continue the process this has to be

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.319 
and continue the process this has to be
in<00:04:18.449> the<00:04:18.720> girth<00:04:19.380> group<00:04:19.680> behind<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.250> elbow<00:04:20.609> now

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
in the girth group behind the elbow now

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.580 
in the girth group behind the elbow now
tighten<00:04:21.810> this<00:04:22.310> right<00:04:23.310> up<00:04:23.630> to<00:04:24.630> where<00:04:24.960> it's

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
tighten this right up to where it's

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.860 
tighten this right up to where it's
comfortable<00:04:26.600> but<00:04:27.600> not<00:04:27.930> loose<00:04:29.660> so<00:04:30.660> that's

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
comfortable but not loose so that's

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.900 
comfortable but not loose so that's
comfortable<00:04:31.380> on<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.740> horse<00:04:31.979> it's<00:04:32.280> not<00:04:32.550> loose

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
comfortable on the horse it's not loose

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.490 
comfortable on the horse it's not loose
a<00:04:33.380> good<00:04:34.380> practice<00:04:35.100> to<00:04:35.430> make<00:04:36.300> sure<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.750> skin<00:04:37.199> is

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
a good practice to make sure the skin is

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.790 
a good practice to make sure the skin is
not<00:04:37.770> pinched<00:04:38.520> underneath<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.479> girth<00:04:39.720> is<00:04:39.960> to

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
not pinched underneath the girth is to

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.060 
not pinched underneath the girth is to
ask<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.280> horse<00:04:41.460> to<00:04:41.610> pick<00:04:41.940> up
