00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Oh I'm trying to leave the memories behind me.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:31.000
But you are always on my mind to remind me.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I know my mission is to learn to live without you.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But still I wish I had you here to wake up to.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And as tonight I saw you slowly walk in thru that door.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Never in my life I've wanted anything more.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Oh why, why are you so beautiful.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.500
And why, did you have to look that way.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:24.000
Oho tell me, why, why are you so beautiful.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
More than a million girls in the world.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And I just had to fall in love with you...

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Well, I don't even know how of all of this has started.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And how was I to know you'd leave me broken hearted.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Oh maybe I should try to never see your face again.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
'cos in so many ways you changed my life.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I'm a different man.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And I should know by now I'll never be the one for you.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And every other thought is bound to make my brown eyes bleu.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Oh why, why are you so beautiful.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And why,did you have to look that way.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Oho tell me, why, why are you so beautiful.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Of all the girls that I could get.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I fell in love with the one i'll never have.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Oho tell me, why, why are you so beautiful.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I'm noexception to the rule

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Where there's a beauty, there always is a fool.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
There always is a fool.
