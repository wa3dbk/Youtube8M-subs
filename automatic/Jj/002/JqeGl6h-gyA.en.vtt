00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
thing has shifted down how long has it

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.590 
thing has shifted down how long has it
been<00:01:15.690> like<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.440> say<00:01:17.370> about<00:01:17.400> five<00:01:17.760> years<00:01:18.120> five

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
huge gap well the gap up here isn't that

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.810 
huge gap well the gap up here isn't that
bad<00:01:46.260> you<00:01:46.700> know

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
bad you know

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.510 
bad you know
right<00:01:48.150> along<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.659> edge<00:01:49.020> it's<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.250> little

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
right along this edge it's it's a little

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.090 
right along this edge it's it's a little
it's<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:51.000> little<00:01:51.030> big<00:01:51.479> but<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:52.680> would<00:01:52.979> have

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
it's a little big but I would have

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.850 
it's a little big but I would have
expected<00:01:53.760> that<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.330> tight<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.140> huge<00:01:55.530> gap

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
expected that to be tight and a huge gap

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.789 
expected that to be tight and a huge gap
at<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.220> bottom<00:01:57.440> but<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:59.010> gap<00:01:59.280> at<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.549> bottom

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
at the bottom but the gap at the bottom

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.710 
at the bottom but the gap at the bottom
looks<00:02:01.799> fine<00:02:02.510> so<00:02:03.510> see<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.110> whole<00:02:04.350> thing<00:02:05.720> has

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
looks fine so see the whole thing has

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.699 
looks fine so see the whole thing has
shifted<00:02:07.080> vertically<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.899> what<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.560> can

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
shifted vertically and what you can

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.350 
shifted vertically and what you can
really<00:02:10.920> see<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.159> from<00:02:11.310> back<00:02:11.459> here<00:02:11.700> what<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.030> have

over to the right ever so slightly
that's<00:03:09.330> going<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.600> raise<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.930> door<00:03:10.110> up<00:03:10.350> a

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
that's going to raise the door up a

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.640 
that's going to raise the door up a
little<00:03:10.920> bit<00:03:11.160> but<00:03:11.430> not<00:03:11.730> enough<00:03:12.170> there's<00:03:13.170> no<00:03:13.440> way

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
little bit but not enough there's no way

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.130 
little bit but not enough there's no way
we're<00:03:13.860> going<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.010> raise<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.430> up<00:03:14.520> that<00:03:14.760> high

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.890 
we're going to raise it up that high
okay<00:03:16.140> because<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.740> whole<00:03:16.980> ground<00:03:17.900> has

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
okay because the whole ground has

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.210 
okay because the whole ground has
shifted<00:03:18.930> down<00:03:19.830> and<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:22.530> what<00:03:22.740> I<00:03:22.770> think<00:03:23.100> I'm

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
to new door jam chances are the same

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.230 
to new door jam chances are the same
things<00:06:32.390> going<00:06:32.600> to<00:06:32.660> happen<00:06:32.890> again

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
things going to happen again

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.499 
things going to happen again
because<00:06:34.449> your<00:06:34.660> arm<00:06:34.900> is<00:06:35.169> on<00:06:35.440> this<00:06:36.340> hill<00:06:36.669> and<00:06:38.430> the

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:39.509 
because your arm is on this hill and the

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:41.850 
because your arm is on this hill and the
the<00:06:40.509> ground<00:06:40.810> is<00:06:40.990> going<00:06:41.110> to<00:06:41.169> shift<00:06:41.500> some<00:06:41.710> more

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
the ground is going to shift some more

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.620 
the ground is going to shift some more
we've<00:06:42.069> got<00:06:42.190> some<00:06:42.400> shifting<00:06:42.849> going<00:06:43.150> on<00:06:43.300> over

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:43.630 
we've got some shifting going on over

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.170 
we've got some shifting going on over
here<00:06:43.660> see<00:06:44.530> there's<00:06:44.740> a<00:06:44.770> big<00:06:44.919> huge<00:06:45.190> crack<00:06:45.639> here

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
here see there's a big huge crack here

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.809 
here see there's a big huge crack here
and<00:06:46.870> there's<00:06:47.020> also<00:06:47.199> a<00:06:47.470> crack<00:06:47.860> over<00:06:48.160> on<00:06:48.669> the

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:48.819 
and there's also a crack over on the

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:51.360 
and there's also a crack over on the
right<00:06:49.060> side<00:06:49.419> of<00:06:49.599> the<00:06:49.690> door<00:06:49.870> too<00:06:50.229> so<00:06:50.620> when<00:06:51.280> the

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370 
right side of the door too so when the

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.529 
right side of the door too so when the
ground<00:06:51.669> shifts<00:06:52.300> it<00:06:52.630> actually<00:06:53.590> moves<00:06:53.889> the<00:06:54.729> door

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:55.539 
ground shifts it actually moves the door

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:59.659 
ground shifts it actually moves the door
down<00:06:56.080> or<00:06:57.039> it<00:06:57.370> moves<00:06:57.610> this<00:06:57.910> side<00:06:58.270> down<00:06:58.840> now<00:06:59.229> see

00:06:59.659 --> 00:06:59.669 
down or it moves this side down now see

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:02.520 
down or it moves this side down now see
with<00:07:00.669> this<00:07:00.880> big<00:07:01.120> gap<00:07:01.389> I<00:07:01.660> don't<00:07:01.930> think<00:07:02.199> it<00:07:02.349> moved

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:02.530 
with this big gap I don't think it moved

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.920 
with this big gap I don't think it moved
it<00:07:02.770> up<00:07:02.979> it<00:07:03.310> would<00:07:03.610> have<00:07:03.759> probably<00:07:04.000> shifted<00:07:04.810> it

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
it up it would have probably shifted it

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.559 
it up it would have probably shifted it
down<00:07:04.960> and<00:07:05.650> that's<00:07:06.370> why<00:07:06.669> this<00:07:06.849> is<00:07:07.180> like<00:07:07.360> this

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:07.569 
down and that's why this is like this

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:09.180 
down and that's why this is like this
I'm<00:07:07.780> going<00:07:07.870> to<00:07:07.930> put<00:07:07.990> a<00:07:08.110> level<00:07:08.380> across<00:07:08.860> there

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.190 
I'm going to put a level across there

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.710 
I'm going to put a level across there
and<00:07:09.400> see<00:07:10.650> what<00:07:11.650> we<00:07:11.680> got<00:07:12.130> so<00:07:12.520> if<00:07:12.610> you<00:07:12.759> if<00:07:13.449> you

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:13.720 
and see what we got so if you if you

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.589 
and see what we got so if you if you
live<00:07:14.169> on<00:07:14.440> it<00:07:14.740> on<00:07:14.919> a<00:07:14.979> hill<00:07:15.669> if<00:07:15.970> you<00:07:16.120> have<00:07:16.300> some

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:16.599 
live on it on a hill if you have some

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:18.379 
live on it on a hill if you have some
sort<00:07:16.810> of<00:07:16.930> problem<00:07:17.199> like<00:07:17.560> this<00:07:17.770> stick<00:07:18.099> around

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:18.389 
sort of problem like this stick around

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:21.240 
sort of problem like this stick around
because<00:07:19.389> I<00:07:19.509> might<00:07:19.780> be<00:07:20.050> able<00:07:20.409> to<00:07:20.590> give<00:07:20.860> you<00:07:21.069> a

wish I'd have been able to get it a

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.529 
wish I'd have been able to get it a
little<00:07:27.099> bit<00:07:27.310> more<00:07:27.610> Center<00:07:28.000> but<00:07:28.120> check<00:07:28.330> it<00:07:28.360> out
