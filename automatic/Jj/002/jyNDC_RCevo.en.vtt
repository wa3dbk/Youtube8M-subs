00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.939
 hi i'm giovanni bia without duty chef 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.770
 puntocom and in this video I'm going to 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.600
 talk about the electric tail sharpener 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.020
 the knife is one of the tools 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.940
 most important of a cook why 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.520
 It is very important to always keep it in 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.700
 perfect conditions and very well sharpened 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.280
 a disaffiliated knife is more dangerous 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.010
 that a sharp knife to sharpen 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.680
 well a knife the best is a good 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.600
 sharpening stone and a good fall but 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.220
 for that we need a certain technique and 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.950
 skill that not always all 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.690
 we get how it can be to keep the 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.540
 knife always at 20 degrees 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.670
 tilt that's why these operators 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.950
 electric will make it much easier for us 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.930
 homework we will avoid for example 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.840
 have to take them to a sharpener 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.660
 professional independently of with 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.210
 that we open our knives we should 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.610
 to always have a good start one 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.680
 exit not to row but wakes up and 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.030
 keeps the edge and we'll have to 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.030
 use it very often 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.680
 as we have told you the sharpener 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.020
 the core power gives us much 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.570
 work at home if we do not know well 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.580
 the technique of sharpening the stone of 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.710
 entrance has some slots that we 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.920
 allow to introduce the knife with the 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.730
 proper tilt we have three molars 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.490
 of different grammage the first high 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:46.090
 reactivity the second abrasiveness 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.770
 medium and the third of micro sharpening that 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.390
 We will use according to the state of the 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.460
 knife 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.950
 for example with a knife very 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.560
 out of tune we will start with the high 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.350
 reactivity later by the average 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.909
 abrasivity and finally the micro 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.710
 sharp 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.170
 with a medium challenged knife 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.630
 we will perform only the last two 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.910
 steps and with a serrated knife 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.840
 we will use the next wheel 3 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.840
 indicated on the machine 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.629
 Its use is very simple and also has 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.409
 of four suction cups that allow us 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:24.540
 Fix it securely avoiding scares 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:26.310
 we turn on the machine and introduce 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.830
 the knife as close to the handle 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.299
 possible and slip 'we have gently the 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.299
 knife towards the tip 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.070
 and we will repeat the operation for the other 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.070
 face of the knife 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.540
 we will do this according to the state of the 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.020
 knife on the right wheel 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.360
 ah 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.000
 The electric sharpener has a power 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.340
 80 watt its maintenance is so 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.440
 simple as its use in the part 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.750
 bottom has a magnet that deals with 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.630
 accumulate the chips generated during 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.530
 the sharpening to prevent them from being maintained 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.720
 inside the machine 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.660
 its maintenance is as simple as 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.110
 extract and clean the chip from time to time 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.110
 when 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.500
 this is all I hope you have been 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.490
 utility and until the next video of

 hyper chef puntocom 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.580
 ah 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.480
 now 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.480
 and today 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.330
 with the
