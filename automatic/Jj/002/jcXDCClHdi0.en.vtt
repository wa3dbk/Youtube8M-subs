up or down and then that goes down here
and<00:01:17.549> we<00:01:17.880> builded<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.509> flight<00:01:18.920> here<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.130> then

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
and we builded a flight here and then

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.359 
and we builded a flight here and then
again<00:01:21.780> faltered<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:24.830> simota<00:01:25.830> is

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
again faltered that on this simota is

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.480 
again faltered that on this simota is
just<00:01:26.640> another<00:01:26.880> box<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.420> we<00:01:27.659> cut<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:28.490> little

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
just another box that we cut a little

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.280 
just another box that we cut a little
stuff<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.030> would<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.420> grand<00:01:30.720> up<00:01:30.990> and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
stuff like that would be grand up and

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.570 
stuff like that would be grand up and
then<00:01:32.009> we<00:01:32.220> do

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
then we do

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.010 
then we do
put<00:01:33.580> up<00:01:33.730> I'm<00:01:34.000> screwed<00:01:34.450> on<00:01:34.570> with<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:34.750> mountain

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
put up I'm screwed on with the mountain

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.680 
put up I'm screwed on with the mountain
hawks<00:01:35.140> and<00:01:35.860> you're<00:01:36.070> not<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:36.340> same<00:01:36.580> down<00:01:37.480> there

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
hawks and you're not the same down there

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.620 
hawks and you're not the same down there
split<00:01:38.260> in<00:01:38.410> it<00:01:38.560> so<00:01:39.370> I<00:01:39.640> am<00:01:40.030> bikes<00:01:40.570> down<00:01:40.840> on<00:01:40.990> it

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
split in it so I am bikes down on it

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.969 
split in it so I am bikes down on it
that's<00:01:43.630> pretty<00:01:43.870> much<00:01:43.930> it<00:01:43.990> then<00:01:44.740> we<00:01:44.830> have

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
that's pretty much it then we have

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.010 
that's pretty much it then we have
another<00:01:45.010> bar<00:01:45.910> that<00:01:46.690> goes<00:01:46.810> down<00:01:47.020> here<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:49.119> then

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
another bar that goes down here and then

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.690 
another bar that goes down here and then
you<00:01:50.229> neither<00:01:50.410> world<00:01:51.310> that<00:01:51.490> on<00:01:51.630> or<00:01:52.630> just<00:01:53.700> drill

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
you neither world that on or just drill

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.210 
you neither world that on or just drill
it<00:01:54.820> on<00:01:54.910> we<00:01:55.060> water<00:01:55.270> them<00:01:55.570> because<00:01:56.190> after<00:01:57.190> we

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
it on we water them because after we

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.070 
it on we water them because after we
made<00:01:57.400> it<00:01:57.520> swivel<00:01:59.010> it's<00:02:00.010> off<00:02:00.130> to<00:02:00.250> enjoy<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.750> we

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
made it swivel it's off to enjoy so we

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.170 
made it swivel it's off to enjoy so we
don't<00:02:02.229> really<00:02:02.380> exhausted<00:02:02.860> anyway<00:02:02.950> we<00:02:03.910> just
