00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:07.920
 then we are inside a car with 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.650
 a six-speed gearbox and slowly the 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.160
 together we discover together 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.809
 together with our angel, hello guys 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.690
 hello everyone hello hello 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.080
 then we promised to make a video 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.480
 inside say no case at home at home 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.220
 let's try to tell it briefly 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.019
 it would be a lot to say, however, us 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.730
 let's try to give you an overview 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.859
 angel tried to give us an overview 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.460
 del within that model of 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.949
 bedlam 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.629
 tell us a little about what's in it 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.960
 particular in this in this 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:43.049
 inside now we start from here from 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.249
 framework we are from the dashboard of 

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:52.139
 central console ok so let's see here 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:55.709
 the new r link 2 with capacitive display 

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:57.329
 from 7 inches to 18 cm diagonal 

00:00:55.709 --> 00:01:00.299
 now it is fine set on the radio 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.170
 urania if there is a navigator also the 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:06.810
 navigator as you can see or not 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.549
 then okay also navigator there is the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.750
 phone function through which 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.740
 we can manage the of a voice of the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.960
 mobile phone do 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.939
 calls or answers to 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.600
 incoming calls 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:25.840
 even the law the incoming text messages 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.659
 or there is also the call function 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.780
 vocal by pressing the button on the 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:37.149
 steering wheel so I don't get distracted when 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:40.229
 i drive past that does that mirroring 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:43.179
 with music then the playlists I have 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.750
 in the mobile phone stored in the mobile 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:50.560
 I can listen to them with the radio of 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.479
 car audio system and others 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.850
 checks then eat there are both 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.060
 even here it controls me climate 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.750
 the quality also controls me 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.229
 exact tech air for quality 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.170
 even air and that the computer 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.769
 travel also here therefore in consumption 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.040
 as well as being reproduced on the tft 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.830
 central central tft display always from 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.530
 7 inches also this in consumption 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:25.329
 average speed between sky autonomy also 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.430
 here from here to place I can configure 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.769
 also that I am pressuring them 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.750
 tires 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.940
 clearly the system will warn me if 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.079
 the pressure that has the or here to 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.470
 example on this car it was 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:41.850
 intense has been mounted 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:46.540
 the parking assistance accessory 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.820
 there is the rear view camera of 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.670
 front and side parking 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.080
 rear 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.140
 then ok, there is the dyer function in Greek 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:00.660
 which tells me gives me a score depending on 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:04.420
 of the guided tour makes me a calculation 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:08.320
 let's say based on how much there was 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.660
 calculation brake is live score can 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.580
 help in short is yellow to save 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.690
 arigi talk be month march 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.940
 acceleration these are the kilometers 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.660
 that have been made 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.060
 average consumption is really the example e 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.380
 then he tells me you can also download 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.980
 possibly file that applies exact 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.670
 exact by registering on the website my name yes 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.670
 can can be accessed eg download 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.290
 of the applications to her we have here 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.880
 downloaded coyote which clearly must 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.550
 still being activated coyote is a 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:47.650
 speed camera detection system 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.980
 then I know how to go on twitter 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.150
 or 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.640
 downloading e-mail is a mini 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:01.500
 tablet mini tablets are made for the case 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.400
 diabolic wines is a capacitive tablet yes 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.140
 well 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.879
 good instead for what concerns 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.890
 in short, the interiors understood just like 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.260
 the steering wheel is fine as I see it as 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.379
 work now we have never flying of 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.390
 small size 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:17.970
 consider that I did I turned 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.519
 the car of 180 degrees practically in 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.699
 I think 20 seconds to make this shot 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:27.120
 it will be a fantastic electric power steering 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:28.350
 that is, I have a utilitarian is this one 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.250
 turning radius was probably 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.620
 better than my car then 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:39.360
 I have to change our car not 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.410
 they joke, however, I would gladly change a 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.660
 display 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.660
 all here there is a display no longer exists 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.520
 nothing analogical on this machine 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.250
 7 inch tft display also for 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.830
 regarding the temperature of the 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.990
 coolant the level of 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:05:00.110
 fuel i can 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:08.090
 let's see if I can live to change 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:08.090
 the color of the screen instrument panel 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:16.550
 a passenger compartment display 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:19.260
 Exactly, we enjoyed putting it on 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.660
 meanwhile from the other changes I can 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.810
 change colors or what 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.790
 show that I know tachometer there 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:31.030
 so this is what he tells me 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.380
 as I'm clearly driving there is the 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.180
 gear shift control 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.890
 so he tells me change indicator 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.400
 march basically tells me if I have to 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:42.070
 climb if I have to increase the gear for 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.620
 optimize consumption put 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.850
 this rose that will appeal to a lot 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.950
 our friends to the ladies brightness 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.290
 volume I can change I can tell about 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.390
 all that you can really enjoy and 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.940
 drive that you can even have fun not 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.130
 almost at the wheel clearly with the not 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.480
 recently then just to do so one 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.400
 small overview sees a little thing 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.910
 white over there what you then this 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.220
 here it is a mobile phone joking notes 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.260
 exact renault custom eh no is the 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.120
 key 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:16.570
 this is the key just now I've 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.150
 supported as they may have it in your pocket 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.280
 I open the car picking up the 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.430
 push button and then you 've fixed us 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.820
 on the handle ie the ignition col 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:31.660
 button on I turn off the button here 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.370
 very convenient then here the central because 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.010
 there is the discourse of the kind of 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.290
 electric parking 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:41.010
 here we have proposed cruise glasses 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.540
 control speed limiter 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:46.330
 directly here in the glove compartment 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:49.060
 the car is really comfortable to understand from 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.650
 time at 5 takes us maybe we enter 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.230
 also two half-liter bottles 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.960
 years it is very very roomy maybe 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.490
 shooting does not make five seats 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.650
 spacious lioness then we did 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.150
 have the other time and roll over 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.690
 seats 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.640
 but easybreak yes yes I wanted to do so 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:10.300
 there are even two usb ports here 

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.610
 aux input can also be seen 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.100
 things I had forgotten before 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:18.160
 tell you the photos on multimedia hand a 

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:21.430
 vehicle still clearly I can watch 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:24.610
 apart from the music I can watch 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:27.610
 of photos or videos 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.740
 selecting the usb port clearly 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:33.240
 how the stick is really without 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:35.970
 phones as well as listening to music 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:39.240
 but if there is really everything then oh well 

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:41.580
 for any other information the 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.370
 game drive also here is the thing 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:47.940
 best is good and we will have fun 

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:49.650
 they will definitely want to have them soon 

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:53.419
 angel thanks a lot to the buy-in practice 

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.419
 bye bye bye bye bye
