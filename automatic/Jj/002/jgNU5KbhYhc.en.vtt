 fancy white wine and fish fumet 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.320
 to bake the egg we have put a 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:13.750
 with cold water we have put the 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.649
 egg and when it started to boil 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.830
 gushes 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:20.770
 we have to count 10 minutes at 10 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.619
 minutes we will remove it and let 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.500
 it is tempered to be able to peel what we have 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.319
 chopped a little more than half onion to 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.360
 small pieces and now we're going to 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:35.440
 fry in a pan with a little bit of 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.690
 oil when it is fried we will continue 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.729
 once we had cooked the egg what 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.250
 we have peeled and we have traced it 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.440
 helping us with a fork so that it remains 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.380
 well shred and ccoo 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.630
 we also have prepared the parsley and 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.200
 a piece of preserved red pepper 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.719
 chopped also tiny 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.110
 we already fried the onion now the 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:02.190
 we are going to remove to add the 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.230
 later to the soup 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.300
 we have here already hot the smoke 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.020
 now we are going to add a little bit of 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.020
 Colorant 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:17.189
 little so that it has a prettier color 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.969
 the soup and we're going to incorporate the onion 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:22.230
 fried the parsley the red pepper and the 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:24.480
 cooked egg 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.629
 we have added all the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.799
 accompaniments now we add one 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.799
 white wine bullshit 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.170
 it's worth a little thing here we have 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.500
 our fish soup with all the 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.410
 ingredients we have tasted of salt 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:47.550
 is very good and now at the moment 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.320
 boil the broth we will add the pasta with 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.080
 the one that we want to make the soup me in my 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:57.110
 case will be semolina but you can put 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.940
 star noodles what they like the most 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.960
 then now wait for them to boil 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.870
 to add the pasta 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.870
 we already have boiling the soup so 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.030
 now we add the pasta me in my case 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.580
 I'm going to add 3 tablespoons of 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.670
 semolina 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:17.690
 I've been sewing hurt the 45 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.730
 minutes now it's already boiling 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.850
 and here we have our plate of 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.819
 fish soup to combat these 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.700
 cold days 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:34.090
 and you see that it is very simple if you want 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.040
 a more elaborate soup let's say more 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.150
