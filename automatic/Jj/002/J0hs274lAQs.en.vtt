00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello how are football friends for the 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.150
 I want to ask you something 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.160
 all of you of what play what position 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.150
 they play in the field all over the world 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.660
 respond well I play half I am 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.420
 defense and forward game I am 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.600
 crack I am the goalkeeper of my team I 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.910
 I did in the liguilla 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.890
 I mean, if it's okay, that's your 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.990
 position but you'll see yourself better if 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.390
 you answer this me in the game field of 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.760
 half recharged by right side that is 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.500
 as a flyer sometimes I go to attack 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.940
 and I help my forwards that come to me 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.950
 turning into an extreme 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.570
 clear without neglecting my functions 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.610
 defensive to help my lateral 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.570
 right all this be for a better 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.510
 team performance 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.650
 iway believe me any coach that 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.650
 you will see it like this 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.900
 but today we are going to focus 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.370
 only in one position is that everything 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.790
 the world wants to be on the straight are the 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.790
 husks 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.610
 or also known as a ram according to 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.930
 dictionary of the royal academy of 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.280
 language 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.860
 online battering ram means used weapon 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.630
 to break doors or walls 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.290
 fortified there are four things that to me 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.030
 it looks like you should have any forward 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.340
 four things must be a good auctioneer 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.229
 head must have good definition 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.360
 in front of the frame must know how to move in the 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.610
 area and look for the spaces and in many 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.260
 chances quite lucky because as 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.820
 there are forwards who have a shit 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.670
 luck and they do not play anything 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.979
 greetings kikin fonseca 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.330
 so let's look at these four 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.229
 characteristics to be a good 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.380
 Forward 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.509
 we started to finish well in the head 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.850
 indispensable for a striker 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.000
 example messi is a short forward 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.799
 but it ends very well of Christian head 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.690
 ronaldo is a sprinter on the court 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.200
 but he has committed quite a few goals 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.200
 head no 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:09.600
 and the 'chicharito' hernández is a 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:11.640
 finisher par excellence the definition 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.190
 is perhaps the most important part of a 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.860
 forward does not know how to define by more than 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.810
 run or move or be very lucky not 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.580
 will be a good striker say that the 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.980
 front are the most selfish or 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.530
 envious on the bone court they want 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.600
 define all of them in some way is 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.790
 well because that's his job to define 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.010
 I say I prefer a forward who 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.870
 try a forward that demarcates 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.540
 of their obligations and instead of defining 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.790
 give a wrong pass just for fear 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.920
 to be wrong many times a forward 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.590
 think better that the other is wrong 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.990
 that I'm wrong then if you fail 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.300
 the definition in front of the frame as it says 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.550
 a good sentence out there if you're facing 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.500
 the goal and do not know what to do you 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.530
 just drop it and then we discuss the 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.990
 options a forward must define how 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.610
 be and with whatever the point is to put it 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.860
 to move correctly in the area or 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.260
 out of it when you boots you should 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.480
 be one step ahead of your rival if 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.220
 you know move and look for spaces what 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.590
 The only thing you will have to do is give it a 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.690
 small push to the ball and celebrate your 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.060
 goal like the good tic arito or in 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.250
 their fault the pipita higuain them alone 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:37.800
 look for spaces and single balls 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:39.330
 have the feet to push the 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.850
 luck is also a very factor 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.680
 important for the front or also 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.680
 you could call it lucky as 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.180
 mistakes of the rival clear that the merit 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.950
 of the front is that it is always 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.950
 waiting for your chance to put it 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:41.340
 and I hope you liked this little 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.250
 tutorial to make a good kikin 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.780
 good fonseca forward and remember that 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.330
 the goalkeepers are the ones who have the best 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.610
 field vision defenses are the 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.590
 that come out playing with the ball the 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.630
 means are those who think and distribute the 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.430
 game and the forwards are the ones 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.230
 all these coming ideas culminate 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.700
 from the goal I say goodbye 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.500
 name is israel and see you next 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.280

 it's not life 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.980
 and 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:45.629
 this play serves minimum for screens 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:48.169
 to pretend you play well chingón 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:48.169
