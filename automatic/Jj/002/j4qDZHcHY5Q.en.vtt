00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.730
 tell you about fear 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.120
 new game with cool graphics and 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.820
 many interesting innovations to 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.359
 innovation in moba games big 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.760
 rarity 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.560
 because it is one of the most conservative 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.109
 computer games genres at the moment 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.310
 mova universe stands on three pillars lol 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.160
 dota 2 and hon 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.590
 by the way strife from the creators of hyung however 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.380
 all these games have been created for several years 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.960
 back and already had time to podnadoest as in 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.820
 virtually nothing changes yet 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.129
 would any change be checked 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.050
 time concept can significantly 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.170
 affect the fragile balance of the game 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.090
 that's why the creators of hyung games 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.489
 which became famous as the fastest 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.460
 aggressive mobs decided to create everything with 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.460
 scratch and kindled to create a mob 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.789
 the game of the second generation so appeared 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.559
 strife essence game concept inject 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.750
 innovation will keep everything 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.729
 the best that has already been created in the genre 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.920
 at first glance, the game seems like 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.010
 competitors but a lot of details do 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.619
 from Strife original and unique game 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.869
 the first thing that catches your eye is cool 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.030
 painted bright but not acidic 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.280
 Picture of the world is inhabited by funny 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.650
 characters are all seasoned with positive and 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.570
 humor including the hero of what only 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.460
 worth a chic cat 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.729
 playfully launching enemies electric 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.450
 clubs by the way about cats I'm a hero in general 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.250
 all heroes are not free donat rus when 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.610
 In this they are not as rags as in Lola 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.430
 not vanshot need tactics they just 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.259
 came for spam defeated heroes 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.110
 not much I really liked it 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.270
 I am enraged by hundreds of other moba heroes 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.909
 games, as long as you don't remember them all 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.009
 you will play weak fears less but a day 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.200
 tina no need to memorize hundreds of heroes 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.450
 Well, lovers of a large number 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.320
 heroes become too like one of 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.450
 important pieces of the game heroes customization yes 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.670
 the same hero can reveal himself 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.380
 in different qualities this is achieved by 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.720
 crafting can create items 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.520
 change enchanted outfit stats 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.040
 and so on contribute to giving your 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.530
 brethren and brothers our lesser fears 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.150
 Adding pets are added 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.860
 they replaced the universal system 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.080
 skills that were in other moba games 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.120
 kill poets can not they follow you 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.120
 how tails are so cute 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.150
 but as the pet level rises and also 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.370
 grow get new abilities and 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.960
 change shape 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.000
 strife very dynamic health 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.400
 recovers quickly go sl 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.130
 rarely do we need this 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.170
 courier carrying items from the store 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.850
 game card is reduced compared to 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.050
 other mobs games to eliminate 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.870
 too much running around 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.090
 and focus the action in one place in 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.550
 the forest has four different themes they are 2 like 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.560
 ordinary foresters will be interested in the apogee 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.480
 forestry favored edge tass 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.940
 giant gorilla you want 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.700
 release from captivity he is not 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.570
 leave a stone unturned from the enemy base 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.660
 and finally the developers decided to lime 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.090
 the main scourge of moba games namely skirmishes 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.060
 between the party members agree very 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.400
 wonderful that often people don't even swear 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.500
 with opponents and inside your team 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.260
 conflicts arise out of the blue who 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.440
 who stiletto gold in lane one and cancer 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.260
 who strife dad is trying to make moba 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.150
 team game is encouraged 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.020
 work there is no need to compete with your 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.270
 allies 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.280
 flipping hit that is when you kill creep 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.930
 gives all small party members 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.970
 radius in the end do not need to compete 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.459
 on line with their party members 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.590
 it gives a lot of nice bonuses 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.200
 finally support will be 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.610
 normally play help and party members 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.370
 they are just trying to cover 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.910
 Anyone let's live together well though 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.470
 would be within our team by the way chat with 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.870
 the opposite team is disabled until 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.209
 end of the match to again exclude 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.000
 skirmishes and swearing and play and not 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:07.000
 curse the social component 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.650
 is the karma system after the match you can 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.230
 report on the body to praise people 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.140
 teams so the players try to lead 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.390
 yourself adequately 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.100
 yes they praised the game so they praised 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.950
 let's add some tar 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.290
 a spoon as it seemed to me in this game 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.600
 not enough dina n that is, there can not be 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.850
 finish off your creeps to take away 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.890
 opponents gold is pretty small 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.500
 card cause high dynamics and 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.260
 If I introduce dina it seems to me 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.500
 more everything is hard interesting and dynamic 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.720
 for experienced players of the moba game strike 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.300
 may seem rustic just 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.540
 due to the lack of mechanics dan 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.060
 and 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.460
 Well, in general in the game a lot of all sorts 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.080
 chips I told not all nonsense exist 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.900
 free baths on the map you need 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.910
 open have single player on me company 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.260
 which introduces you to the game loro no 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.630
 there will be more and more new 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.680
 content along with new patches but in 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:04.080
 Overall let's summarize I 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.150
 nine strappado impressive mob with 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.390
 interesting system of heroes development 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.330
 this game is very friendly to newbies but 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.580
 and experienced players will find something to do 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.410
 before the developers strike plans 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.930
 develop cybersport component 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.840

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.640
