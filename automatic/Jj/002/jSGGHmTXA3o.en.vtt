00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
exactly those qualities for he sought to

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.500 
exactly those qualities for he sought to
purify<00:01:25.200> art<00:01:25.800> and<00:01:26.190> the<00:01:26.430> experience<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.180> it

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.750 
preparing this exquisite matte quality
paint<00:02:10.910> is<00:02:11.090> actually<00:02:11.959> involving<00:02:12.440> these<00:02:13.430> jars

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
paint is actually involving these jars

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.600 
paint is actually involving these jars
here<00:02:14.269> but<00:02:15.080> interestingly<00:02:15.319> his<00:02:15.950> materials

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
here but interestingly his materials

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.370 
here but interestingly his materials
despite<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.480> fact<00:02:17.660> that<00:02:17.720> his<00:02:17.840> paintings<00:02:18.260> look

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
despite the fact that his paintings look

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.589 
despite the fact that his paintings look
so<00:02:18.590> odd<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.610> unique<00:02:19.849> his<00:02:20.000> materials<00:02:20.480> are

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
so odd and unique his materials are

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.690 
so odd and unique his materials are
straight-up<00:02:21.110> classical<00:02:21.830> nothing<00:02:22.430> more<00:02:22.580> than

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
straight-up classical nothing more than

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.759 
straight-up classical nothing more than
oil<00:02:22.790> paint<00:02:23.090> out<00:02:23.209> of<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.360> tube<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.780> turpentine

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
oil paint out of the tube and turpentine

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.670 
oil paint out of the tube and turpentine
the<00:02:25.069> typical<00:02:25.400> solvent<00:02:25.610> for<00:02:26.569> all<00:02:26.750> oil<00:02:27.200> painting

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
the typical solvent for all oil painting

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.430 
the typical solvent for all oil painting
so<00:02:28.130> what<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:28.790> would<00:02:28.910> typically<00:02:29.180> do<00:02:29.390> is<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:30.230> use

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
so what you would typically do is to use

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.150 
so what you would typically do is to use
quite<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:30.980> bit<00:02:31.220> of<00:02:31.370> Mars<00:02:31.819> black<00:02:32.269> paint<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.380> that

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
quite a bit of Mars black paint to that

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.860 
quite a bit of Mars black paint to that
entire<00:02:34.430> quantity<00:02:34.700> he<00:02:35.180> would<00:02:35.269> add<00:02:35.390> just<00:02:35.690> a

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
entire quantity he would add just a

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.020 
entire quantity he would add just a
little<00:02:36.260> bit<00:02:36.440> of<00:02:36.650> one<00:02:36.950> of<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.250> three<00:02:37.580> colors<00:02:37.910> he

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
little bit of one of the three colors he

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.190 
little bit of one of the three colors he
painted<00:02:38.360> with<00:02:38.510> red<00:02:38.750> green<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.890> blue<00:02:41.110> next<00:02:42.110> a

painted with red green and blue next a

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.460 
painted with red green and blue next a
generous<00:02:42.680> dose<00:02:42.980> of<00:02:43.310> turpentine<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.569> what<00:02:45.380> I'm

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
generous dose of turpentine and what I'm

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.650 
generous dose of turpentine and what I'm
doing<00:02:45.769> now<00:02:45.920> is<00:02:46.190> making<00:02:46.459> sure<00:02:46.910> that<00:02:47.120> that<00:02:47.480> oil

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
doing now is making sure that that oil

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.870 
doing now is making sure that that oil
paint<00:02:47.989> is<00:02:48.230> dissolving<00:02:49.130> into<00:02:49.310> that<00:02:49.519> turpentine

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
paint is dissolving into that turpentine

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.449 
paint is dissolving into that turpentine
very<00:02:50.630> very<00:02:50.959> thoroughly<00:02:51.319> Reinhard<00:02:52.220> would<00:02:52.340> then

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
very very thoroughly Reinhard would then

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.220 
very very thoroughly Reinhard would then
leave<00:02:52.790> these<00:02:53.030> jars<00:02:53.330> on<00:02:53.540> his<00:02:53.690> shelves<00:02:53.930> in<00:02:54.140> his

leave these jars on his shelves in his

leave these jars on his shelves in his

perhaps a month and the reason for that

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.890 
perhaps a month and the reason for that
waiting<00:02:58.250> period<00:02:58.700> is<00:02:58.849> that<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.239> dense<00:02:59.510> part<00:02:59.840> of

waiting period is that the dense part of
