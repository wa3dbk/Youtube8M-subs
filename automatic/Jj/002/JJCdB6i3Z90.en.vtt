00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
can probably use that down quota very

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.860 
can probably use that down quota very
quickly<00:00:34.340> but<00:00:35.340> yeah<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.239> some<00:00:36.390> gameplay

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
quickly but yeah this is some gameplay

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.200 
quickly but yeah this is some gameplay
of<00:00:36.899> me<00:00:37.380> using<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.829> celestial<00:00:38.280> Nighthawk<00:00:38.670> it

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
of me using the celestial Nighthawk it

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.700 
of me using the celestial Nighthawk it
just<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:39.540> short<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.989> ogre<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.410> don't<00:00:40.590> know<00:00:40.649> if

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
just one short that ogre I don't know if

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.680 
just one short that ogre I don't know if
it<00:00:40.950> would<00:00:41.370> normally<00:00:41.550> die<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:41.940> one<00:00:42.030> shot<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.540> it

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
it would normally die in one shot but it

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.290 
it would normally die in one shot but it
does<00:00:42.870> one<00:00:43.110> shot<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> lot<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.649> stuff<00:00:43.829> and

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
does one shot a lot of stuff and

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.760 
does one shot a lot of stuff and
normally<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.600> golden<00:00:45.960> gun<00:00:46.079> isn't<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.559> good

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
normally the golden gun isn't that good

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.950 
normally the golden gun isn't that good
fifty<00:00:47.129> being<00:00:47.309> damaged<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.910> boss<00:00:48.090> but<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.629> does

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
fifty being damaged the boss but it does

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.110 
fifty being damaged the boss but it does
about<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.680> think<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.070> was<00:00:50.160> how<00:00:50.550> many<00:00:50.640> thousand

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
about I think it was how many thousand

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.380 
about I think it was how many thousand
was<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.440> 14,000<00:00:52.440> now<00:00:52.890> 11,000<00:00:53.730> damage<00:00:54.059> with

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
was that 14,000 now 11,000 damage with

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.779 
was that 14,000 now 11,000 damage with
one<00:00:54.600> shot<00:00:54.840> which<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.320> not<00:00:56.160> bad<00:00:56.190> when<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.550> think

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
one shot which is not bad when you think

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.970 
one shot which is not bad when you think
about<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:58.079> think<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.530> good<00:00:58.649> idea<00:00:58.770> to

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
about it so I think it's a good idea to

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.340 
about it so I think it's a good idea to
switch<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.670> this<00:00:59.820> helmet<00:01:00.600> right<00:01:00.960> at<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.199> end

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
switch to this helmet right at the end

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.540 
switch to this helmet right at the end
of<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.559> strike<00:01:01.859> when<00:01:02.070> you're<00:01:02.190> fighting<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
of a strike when you're fighting the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.939 
of a strike when you're fighting the
boss<00:01:02.789> but<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:03.989> case<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.589> you're

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
boss but in this case and you're

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.170 
boss but in this case and you're
fighting<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.250> boss<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.460> highway<00:01:05.820> through<00:01:06.030> in

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
fighting the boss the highway through in

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.140 
fighting the boss the highway through in
the<00:01:06.390> new<00:01:06.600> strike<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.670> yeah<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.970> does

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
the new strike so yeah but it does

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.690 
the new strike so yeah but it does
insane<00:01:09.689> amounts<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.409> damage<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.890> one<00:01:11.070> shot<00:01:11.369> so

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
insane amounts of damage in one shot so

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.070 
insane amounts of damage in one shot so
it's<00:01:11.939> not<00:01:12.030> good<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.270> taking<00:01:12.630> up<00:01:12.720> big<00:01:12.900> groups

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
it's not good for taking up big groups

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.410 
it's not good for taking up big groups
of<00:01:13.200> enemies<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.740> good<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.070> dealing<00:01:14.310> DPS<00:01:15.210> to

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
of enemies it's good for dealing DPS to

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.690 
of enemies it's good for dealing DPS to
a<00:01:15.450> boss<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.159> have<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> feeling<00:01:17.250> it's<00:01:17.610> going

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
a boss and I have a feeling it's going

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.609 
a boss and I have a feeling it's going
to<00:01:17.790> be<00:01:17.880> quite<00:01:18.030> good<00:01:18.299> two<00:01:18.420> down<00:01:18.630> protos<00:01:19.200> shields

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619
