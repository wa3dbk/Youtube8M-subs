00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
now I have no idea if this is actually

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.229 
now I have no idea if this is actually
working<00:00:57.190> or<00:00:57.489> not<00:00:59.520> basically<00:01:00.520> the<00:01:00.969> the

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
working or not basically the the

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.569 
working or not basically the the
brilliant<00:01:01.750> idea<00:01:01.989> that<00:01:02.559> I<00:01:02.590> came<00:01:02.710> up<00:01:02.950> with<00:01:03.160> for

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
the next episode of hack gh2 was to

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.840 
the next episode of hack gh2 was to
disprove<00:01:07.509> the<00:01:07.869> myth<00:01:07.899> that<00:01:08.410> if<00:01:09.160> the<00:01:09.369> only<00:01:09.640> thing

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850
