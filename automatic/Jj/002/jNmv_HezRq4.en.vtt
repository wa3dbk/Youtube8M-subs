00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
almost like a mix of Stratego and risk

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.940 
almost like a mix of Stratego and risk
there<00:01:33.870> a<00:01:33.900> little<00:01:34.110> bit<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.620> know<00:01:34.650> with<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
there a little bit you know with the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
I go after it but then the whole area

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.150 
I go after it but then the whole area
control<00:01:40.050> on<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.260> board<00:01:40.470> sort<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:40.860> sort

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.969 
control on the board sort of like sort
of<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.310> risk<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.380> give<00:01:43.380> me<00:01:43.410> a<00:01:43.530> quick<00:01:43.740> run

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
of like risk is so give me a quick run

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.620 
of like risk is so give me a quick run
through<00:01:44.010> how<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.520> game<00:01:44.850> actually<00:01:45.030> works

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
through how this game actually works

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.910 
through how this game actually works
okay<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.770> if<00:01:47.160> I<00:01:47.310> were<00:01:47.369> playing<00:01:47.640> against<00:01:48.030> you

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
okay so if I were playing against you

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.950 
okay so if I were playing against you
you<00:01:49.920> would<00:01:50.070> place<00:01:50.310> your<00:01:50.479> capital<00:01:51.479> city<00:01:51.720> and

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
you would place your capital city and

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.580 
you would place your capital city and
your<00:01:52.740> ruler<00:01:53.130> down<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> same<00:01:53.910> state<00:01:54.410> at<00:01:55.410> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
your ruler down on the same state at the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.320 
your ruler down on the same state at the
beginning<00:01:55.979> that's<00:01:56.130> considered<00:01:56.700> de<00:01:56.880> matically

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
beginning that's considered de matically

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.570

everybody<00:04:07.620> start<00:04:07.920> in<00:04:08.069> a<00:04:08.160> different<00:04:08.459> colored

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
everybody start in a different colored

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.340 
everybody start in a different colored
area<00:04:09.120> is<00:04:09.420> that<00:04:09.480> because<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.959> know<00:04:10.080> you<00:04:10.200> said

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
area is that because I know you said

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.070 
area is that because I know you said
something<00:04:10.530> about<00:04:10.650> States<00:04:11.040> earlier<00:04:11.459> our<00:04:12.080> look

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
something about States earlier our look

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.350 
something about States earlier our look
the<00:04:13.620> years<00:04:13.800> how<00:04:13.920> that<00:04:14.130> works<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:14.730> there's

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
the years how that works it there's

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.330 
the years how that works it there's
obviously<00:04:15.840> in<00:04:16.019> most<00:04:16.230> games<00:04:16.470> there's<00:04:16.859> going<00:04:17.160> to

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
obviously in most games there's going to

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.670 
obviously in most games there's going to
be<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.820> first<00:04:18.209> turn<00:04:18.389> advantage<00:04:18.810> so<00:04:19.410> how<00:04:19.530> I'm

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
be a first turn advantage so how I'm

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.560 
be a first turn advantage so how I'm
combating<00:04:20.310> that<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:20.910> you're<00:04:21.209> going<00:04:21.329> to<00:04:21.419> get<00:04:21.479> to

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
combating that is you're going to get to

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.879 
combating that is you're going to get to
place<00:04:21.750> your<00:04:21.900> capital<00:04:22.380> city<00:04:22.620> first<00:04:23.630> if<00:04:24.889> you're

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
place your capital city first if you're

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.670 
place your capital city first if you're
the<00:04:25.919> last<00:04:26.190> player<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:27.750> in<00:04:28.169> the<00:04:28.260> start<00:04:28.560> of<00:04:28.650> the

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
the last player and in the start of the

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.920 
the last player and in the start of the
game<00:04:28.860> you<00:04:29.130> get<00:04:29.250> to<00:04:29.370> draft<00:04:29.760> out<00:04:30.060> your<00:04:30.479> ruler

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
game you get to draft out your ruler

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.629 
game you get to draft out your ruler
first<00:04:31.200> as<00:04:31.410> well<00:04:31.590> that<00:04:31.919> happens<00:04:32.220> in<00:04:32.370> reverse

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
first as well that happens in reverse

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.020 
first as well that happens in reverse
order<00:04:32.850> so<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:34.080> last<00:04:34.320> player<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.740> move<00:04:35.040> gets<00:04:35.880> to
