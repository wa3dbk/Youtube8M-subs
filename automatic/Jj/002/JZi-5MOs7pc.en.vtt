00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
do if we're already paying for data

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.170 
do if we're already paying for data
don't<00:00:18.330> try<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.630> moderate<00:00:18.990> how<00:00:19.230> do<00:00:19.289> we<00:00:19.439> use<00:00:19.680> it

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
don't try to moderate how do we use it

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.370 
don't try to moderate how do we use it
in<00:00:21.180> my<00:00:21.300> personal<00:00:21.660> opinion<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.080> would<00:00:22.170> be<00:00:22.289> in

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
in my personal opinion it would be in

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.779 
in my personal opinion it would be in
their<00:00:22.529> best<00:00:22.560> interest<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.220> allow<00:00:23.310> us<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.760> use

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
their best interest to allow us to use

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.630 
their best interest to allow us to use
tethering<00:00:24.539> because<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.500> believe<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> lot<00:00:26.609> of

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
tethering because I believe a lot of

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.250 
tethering because I believe a lot of
people<00:00:26.880> would<00:00:26.970> end<00:00:27.180> up<00:00:27.240> having<00:00:27.420> overages<00:00:28.019> and

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
people would end up having overages and

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.259 
people would end up having overages and
paying<00:00:28.980> for<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> additional<00:00:29.640> money<00:00:29.760> anyhow

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
paying for the additional money anyhow

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.530 
paying for the additional money anyhow
so<00:00:30.660> anyways<00:00:32.059> today<00:00:33.059> we'll<00:00:33.210> show<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.390> how<00:00:33.480> to

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
but that's the best I can do for right

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.290 
but that's the best I can do for right
now<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> way<00:00:44.700> we're<00:00:44.879> going<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.059> do<00:00:45.149> this

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
now and the way we're going to do this

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.010 
now and the way we're going to do this
is<00:00:45.600> we're<00:00:45.719> going<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> add<00:00:46.050> an<00:00:46.440> additional<00:00:46.789> APN

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
is we're going to add an additional APN

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.660 
is we're going to add an additional APN
which<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.170> an<00:00:49.260> access<00:00:49.590> point<00:00:49.829> name<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.579> we

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
which is an access point name so we

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.850 
which is an access point name so we
click<00:00:50.879> settings<00:00:51.300> settings<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.590> then<00:00:52.710> we<00:00:52.770> go

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
click settings settings and then we go

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.430 
click settings settings and then we go
to<00:00:53.010> wireless<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.579> networks<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.480> then<00:00:55.320> we'll

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
to wireless and networks and then we'll

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.799 
to wireless and networks and then we'll
go<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.620> mobile<00:00:56.100> networks

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
go to mobile networks

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.569 
go to mobile networks
access<00:00:57.809> point<00:00:58.109> names<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.219> can<00:00:59.370> see<00:00:59.460> what

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
access point names and we can see what

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.729 
access point names and we can see what
we've<00:00:59.699> currently<00:00:59.879> got<00:01:00.620> currently<00:01:01.620> we<00:01:01.710> have

and<00:06:05.810> there<00:06:05.960> is<00:06:06.080> no<00:06:06.410> SIM<00:06:06.890> card<00:06:07.130> in<00:06:07.250> this<00:06:07.400> as<00:06:07.760> you

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
and there is no SIM card in this as you

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.660 
and there is no SIM card in this as you
see<00:06:08.300> right<00:06:08.330> there<00:06:08.750> up<00:06:08.840> top<00:06:09.050> that's<00:06:09.710> a<00:06:09.860> no<00:06:10.370> sim

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:10.670

see right there up top that's a no sim
card<00:06:10.940> logo<00:06:11.510> so<00:06:12.470> now<00:06:12.650> we'll<00:06:13.100> go<00:06:13.250> to<00:06:13.280> the

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
card logo so now we'll go to the

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.760 
card logo so now we'll go to the
wireless<00:06:16.100> things<00:06:16.610> on<00:06:16.790> this<00:06:16.970> and<00:06:17.470> we'll<00:06:18.470> see<00:06:18.680> if

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
wireless things on this and we'll see if

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.920 
wireless things on this and we'll see if
we<00:06:18.800> can<00:06:18.980> see<00:06:19.130> it<00:06:19.250> there<00:06:19.850> it<00:06:20.000> is<00:06:20.060> Josh<00:06:20.420> Atrix

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
we can see it there it is Josh Atrix

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.380 
we can see it there it is Josh Atrix
full<00:06:21.230> signal<00:06:21.940> and<00:06:22.940> it's<00:06:23.900> open<00:06:24.260> we'll<00:06:24.680> connect

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390 
full signal and it's open we'll connect

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.970 
full signal and it's open we'll connect
so<00:06:26.390> we're<00:06:26.630> going<00:06:26.720> to<00:06:26.780> obtain<00:06:27.170> an<00:06:27.530> IP<00:06:27.740> address

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:27.980 
so we're going to obtain an IP address

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.610 
so we're going to obtain an IP address
and<00:06:28.820> we<00:06:29.240> are<00:06:29.360> connected<00:06:29.870> now<00:06:30.350> if<00:06:30.440> you're<00:06:30.560> doing

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
and we are connected now if you're doing

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.730 
and we are connected now if you're doing
this<00:06:30.740> on<00:06:30.890> a<00:06:30.950> PC<00:06:31.340> for<00:06:31.370> the<00:06:31.550> first<00:06:31.850> time<00:06:32.620> keep<00:06:33.620> in

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 
this on a PC for the first time keep in

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.780 
this on a PC for the first time keep in
mind<00:06:33.919> that<00:06:33.979> it's<00:06:34.130> going<00:06:34.220> to<00:06:34.280> take<00:06:34.460> a<00:06:34.490> while<00:06:34.760> to

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:34.790 
mind that it's going to take a while to

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.400 
mind that it's going to take a while to
acquire<00:06:35.600> the<00:06:35.780> network<00:06:36.050> address

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
acquire the network address

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.170 
acquire the network address
validating<00:06:37.010> but<00:06:37.370> once<00:06:37.550> it<00:06:37.670> does<00:06:37.790> it'll<00:06:38.060> be

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
validating but once it does it'll be

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.030 
validating but once it does it'll be
very<00:06:38.330> quick<00:06:38.630> from<00:06:38.750> there<00:06:38.960> I'll<00:06:39.080> know<00:06:39.200> okay<00:06:39.980> so

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.040 
very quick from there I'll know okay so

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.640 
very quick from there I'll know okay so
we<00:06:40.340> have<00:06:40.580> now<00:06:40.880> obtained<00:06:41.390> an<00:06:41.480> IP<00:06:41.630> address<00:06:41.810> let's

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
we have now obtained an IP address let's

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.070 
we have now obtained an IP address let's
see<00:06:42.800> if<00:06:42.890> this<00:06:43.040> phone<00:06:43.250> can<00:06:43.760> get<00:06:44.240> two<00:06:44.510> things
