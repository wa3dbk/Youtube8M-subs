00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
available so that we could better

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
represent the the Dean guitar line what

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.060

can we expect in the music farm and Dean

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.550 
can we expect in the music farm and Dean
I<00:02:35.730> would<00:02:36.060> say<00:02:37.940> exclusive<00:02:39.410> probably<00:02:40.410> that's

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
I would say exclusive probably that's

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.410 
I would say exclusive probably that's
the<00:02:41.040> word<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.250> sums<00:02:41.609> it<00:02:41.730> up<00:02:41.850> or<00:02:42.450> exclusivity

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
the word that sums it up or exclusivity

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.550 
the word that sums it up or exclusivity
you<00:02:45.420> know<00:02:45.510> with<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.690> relationship<00:02:45.989> we<00:02:46.380> have

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
you know with the relationship we have

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.620 
you know with the relationship we have
with<00:02:46.590> Dean<00:02:46.920> now<00:02:47.540> we<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:49.260> lends<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.769> I<00:02:50.630> don't

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
with Dean now we it lends to I don't

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.690 
with Dean now we it lends to I don't
know<00:02:51.750> if<00:02:51.870> I'm<00:02:52.769> supposed<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.160> say<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.459> but<00:02:53.549> it

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
know if I'm supposed to say it but it

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.160 
know if I'm supposed to say it but it
does<00:02:54.000> lend<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.299> a<00:02:54.390> little<00:02:54.660> bit<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.870> special

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
does lend to a little bit of special

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.979 
does lend to a little bit of special
treatment<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:56.340> we're<00:02:56.880> honored<00:02:57.209> that<00:02:57.630> we<00:02:57.750> get

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
treatment and we're honored that we get

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.759 
treatment and we're honored that we get
that<00:02:58.170> but<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.459> think<00:03:00.319> exclusivity<00:03:01.319> will<00:03:01.650> be

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
that but I think exclusivity will be

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.470 
that but I think exclusivity will be
what<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:02.280> can<00:03:02.430> expect<00:03:02.760> from<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:03.030> music<00:03:03.299> arm

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
what you can expect from the music arm

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.930

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
mean small runs exclusive runs runs that

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.449 
mean small runs exclusive runs runs that

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
then we will take that put it in design

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.170 
then we will take that put it in design
put<00:03:21.390> it<00:03:21.480> in<00:03:21.540> production<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.110> offer<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.010> you
