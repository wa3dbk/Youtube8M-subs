reflection<00:02:10.899> like<00:02:11.140> because<00:02:11.440> as<00:02:12.130> I<00:02:12.190> said<00:02:12.370> we

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
reflection like because as I said we

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.520 
reflection like because as I said we
were<00:02:12.549> flustered<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:13.230> putting<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.320> into<00:02:14.410> the

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
were flustered and putting it into the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.560 
were flustered and putting it into the
rhythm<00:02:14.650> but<00:02:14.830> that's<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.100> air<00:02:15.340> no<00:02:15.489> had<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.420> good

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
rhythm but that's the air no had a good

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.449 
rhythm but that's the air no had a good
good<00:02:17.110> rhythm<00:02:17.380> probably<00:02:17.920> at<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.040> second<00:02:18.370> were

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
good rhythm probably at the second were

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:19.770 
good rhythm probably at the second were
lacking<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.850> front<00:02:19.030> tires<00:02:19.150> so<00:02:19.630> we're<00:02:19.720> not

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
lacking the front tires so we're not

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.770 
lacking the front tires so we're not
turned<00:02:20.019> in<00:02:20.220> plus<00:02:21.220> we<00:02:21.370> spawn<00:02:21.610> square<00:02:22.060> right<00:02:22.209> not

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
turned in plus we spawn square right not

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.110 
turned in plus we spawn square right not
far
