time<00:03:28.240> before<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.540> soccer<00:03:28.660> comes<00:03:28.990> outside<00:03:29.260> its

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
time before the soccer comes outside its

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.800 
time before the soccer comes outside its
kind<00:03:29.650> doubled<00:03:30.550> I'm<00:03:31.120> gonna<00:03:31.270> check<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.630> other

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
kind doubled I'm gonna check the other

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.650 
kind doubled I'm gonna check the other
base<00:03:32.050> first<00:03:32.940> just<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:33.970> make<00:03:34.060> sure<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.330> got<00:03:34.540> the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
base first just to make sure I got the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.510 
base first just to make sure I got the
position<00:03:34.780> correct<00:03:35.320> then<00:03:35.620> head<00:03:35.800> home<00:03:35.830> and<00:03:36.430> I

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
position correct then head home and I

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.100 
position correct then head home and I
want<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:36.850> decide<00:03:37.390> on<00:03:37.420> suicide<00:03:37.990> the<00:03:38.110> SUV<00:03:38.470> I

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
want to decide on suicide the SUV I

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:59.250 
want to decide on suicide the SUV I
don't<00:03:41.110> complete<00:03:50.310> add-on<00:03:51.310> complete<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:58.260> would

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
don't complete add-on complete I would

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.030 
don't complete add-on complete I would
say<00:03:59.380> is<00:03:59.500> there<00:03:59.650> okay<00:04:00.360> CB<00:04:01.360> ready<00:04:02.040> gateway

cigana<00:04:12.670> you<00:04:12.849> sweetie<00:04:18.269> so<00:04:19.269> I<00:04:19.329> guess<00:04:19.389> was<00:04:19.600> this

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
cigana you sweetie so I guess was this

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.120 
cigana you sweetie so I guess was this
really<00:04:19.959> it's<00:04:20.230> got<00:04:20.380> from<00:04:20.530> him<00:04:20.650> all<00:04:20.829> right<00:04:20.950> Scott

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
really it's got from him all right Scott

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.409 
really it's got from him all right Scott
across<00:04:21.340> him<00:04:21.549> at<00:04:21.639> first<00:04:21.880> seems<00:04:22.570> weird<00:04:24.419> anyway

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
across him at first seems weird anyway

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:36.200 
across him at first seems weird anyway
it's<00:04:25.540> time<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.690> push<00:04:25.870> out<00:04:27.419> Roger<00:04:28.419> that<00:04:29.580> job

here

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:19.330 

gateway<00:05:56.270> SCV<00:05:57.270> ready

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.220 

you<00:06:20.340> just<00:06:20.520> had<00:06:20.640> nothing<00:06:24.020> looks<00:06:25.020> like<00:06:25.140> you

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.230 
you just had nothing looks like you

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.020 
you just had nothing looks like you
ready<00:06:25.410> all<00:06:25.680> infrastructure<00:06:26.130> before<00:06:26.880> any

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
ready all infrastructure before any

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:33.680 
ready all infrastructure before any
units<00:06:29.420> so<00:06:30.950> often<00:06:31.950> if<00:06:32.430> you<00:06:32.730> push<00:06:33.300> it<00:06:33.510> with<00:06:33.630> your

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
units so often if you push it with your

units so often if you push it with your
first<00:06:33.960> Marauder<00:06:34.440> you<00:06:34.650> can<00:06:34.860> arrive<00:06:35.160> before<00:06:35.430> his

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
first Marauder you can arrive before his

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.760 
first Marauder you can arrive before his
warp<00:06:36.360> gate<00:06:36.600> teka<00:06:36.900> stem<00:06:37.290> which<00:06:37.440> means<00:06:37.650> you

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
warp gate teka stem which means you

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.310 
warp gate teka stem which means you
should<00:06:37.800> have<00:06:38.070> three<00:06:38.640> units<00:06:39.030> or<00:06:39.270> five<00:06:39.690> units<00:06:40.140> at

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
should have three units or five units at

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.700 
should have three units or five units at
that<00:06:40.440> point<00:06:41.150> it<00:06:42.150> looks<00:06:42.390> like<00:06:42.540> he<00:06:42.690> cut<00:06:43.260> units

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
that point it looks like he cut units

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.530 
that point it looks like he cut units
just<00:06:43.950> to<00:06:44.040> get<00:06:44.190> down<00:06:44.340> as<00:06:44.490> three<00:06:44.760> gates<00:06:44.970> and<00:06:45.180> robo

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
just to get down as three gates and robo

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.840 
just to get down as three gates and robo
quicker<00:06:48.110> um<00:06:49.370> normally<00:06:50.370> they<00:06:50.610> go<00:06:50.730> the<00:06:50.820> other

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:50.850 
quicker um normally they go the other

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.190 
quicker um normally they go the other
way<00:06:50.970> around<00:06:51.060> they<00:06:51.480> sacrificed<00:06:52.050> our

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
way around they sacrificed our

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.570 
way around they sacrificed our
infrastructure<00:06:52.710> to<00:06:52.860> get<00:06:53.010> an<00:06:53.100> expansion

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 
infrastructure to get an expansion

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.770 
infrastructure to get an expansion
faster<00:06:54.350> that's<00:06:55.350> why<00:06:55.470> I<00:06:55.500> was<00:06:55.620> trying<00:06:55.770> to<00:06:55.830> punish

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 
faster that's why I was trying to punish

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.350 
faster that's why I was trying to punish
but<00:06:57.780> now<00:06:58.470> we<00:06:58.530> sacrifice<00:06:59.100> Eunice<00:06:59.430> Lee<00:06:59.550> gets<00:06:59.790> a

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
but now we sacrifice Eunice Lee gets a

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:06.239 
but now we sacrifice Eunice Lee gets a
faster<00:07:00.960> tech<00:07:01.290> for<00:07:01.590> robotics<00:07:02.430> I<00:07:02.640> guess

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:06.249 

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:08.639 

so<00:07:06.789> it's<00:07:06.909> just<00:07:06.999> like<00:07:07.149> one<00:07:07.629> gay<00:07:07.869> Robo<00:07:08.319> into

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:08.649 
so it's just like one gay Robo into

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:22.019 
so it's just like one gay Robo into
three<00:07:08.859> gates<00:07:09.129> I<00:07:09.309> guess<00:07:19.679> yeah<00:07:20.679> so<00:07:21.669> the<00:07:21.759> Robo

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:22.029 
three gates I guess yeah so the Robo

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:24.029 
three gates I guess yeah so the Robo
isn't<00:07:22.239> actually<00:07:22.359> going<00:07:22.689> to<00:07:22.779> have<00:07:22.899> any<00:07:23.139> use

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.039 
isn't actually going to have any use

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:27.689 
isn't actually going to have any use
here<00:07:24.159> oh<00:07:24.519> wow<00:07:25.139> how<00:07:26.139> much<00:07:26.259> does<00:07:26.379> that<00:07:26.409> cost<00:07:26.699> so

00:07:27.689 --> 00:07:27.699 
here oh wow how much does that cost so

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:29.249 
here oh wow how much does that cost so
200<00:07:27.849> minerals<00:07:28.329> going<00:07:28.629> into<00:07:28.839> something<00:07:29.109> that's

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:29.259 
200 minerals going into something that's

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:34.949 
200 minerals going into something that's
completely<00:07:29.379> useless<00:07:33.389> and<00:07:34.389> you<00:07:34.479> only<00:07:34.629> ever<00:07:34.779> got

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:34.959 
completely useless and you only ever got

00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:36.839 
completely useless and you only ever got
the<00:07:35.049> one<00:07:35.169> stalker<00:07:35.439> so<00:07:35.859> even<00:07:36.099> this<00:07:36.219> existing

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:36.849 
the one stalker so even this existing

00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:39.869 
the one stalker so even this existing
gateway<00:07:37.149> wasn't<00:07:37.509> really<00:07:37.689> put<00:07:37.839> to<00:07:37.959> use<00:07:38.639> yeah<00:07:39.639> so

00:07:39.869 --> 00:07:39.879 
gateway wasn't really put to use yeah so

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:51.659 
gateway wasn't really put to use yeah so
easy<00:07:40.419> win<00:07:49.709> found<00:07:50.709> a<00:07:50.799> new<00:07:50.919> way<00:07:50.949> for<00:07:51.249> protoss<00:07:51.549> to

00:07:51.659 --> 00:07:51.669 
easy win found a new way for protoss to

00:07:51.669 --> 00:07:54.629 
easy win found a new way for protoss to
be<00:07:51.759> greedy<00:07:51.939> so<00:07:52.719> with<00:07:53.019> that<00:07:53.169> quick<00:07:54.069> game<00:07:54.309> will

00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 
be greedy so with that quick game will

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:56.399 
be greedy so with that quick game will
call<00:07:54.759> at<00:07:54.849> the<00:07:54.939> end<00:07:55.059> of<00:07:55.149> this<00:07:55.269> video<00:07:55.839> thank<00:07:56.349> you
