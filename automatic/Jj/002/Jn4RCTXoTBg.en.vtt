00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
to be tangled and then also sticky so I

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.710 
to be tangled and then also sticky so I
just<00:04:18.640> kind<00:04:18.820> of<00:04:18.880> went<00:04:19.090> ahead<00:04:19.150> and<00:04:19.480> lightly

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
just kind of went ahead and lightly

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.840 
just kind of went ahead and lightly
detangled<00:04:20.380> it<00:04:20.440> with<00:04:20.590> my<00:04:20.739> wide<00:04:20.920> tooth<00:04:20.950> comb<00:04:21.310> and

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
detangled it with my wide tooth comb and

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.110 
detangled it with my wide tooth comb and
then<00:04:22.360> I<00:04:22.390> do<00:04:22.600> run<00:04:23.230> my<00:04:23.800> bristle<00:04:24.520> brush<00:04:24.700> over<00:04:25.000> my

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
then I do run my bristle brush over my

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.270 
then I do run my bristle brush over my
hair<00:04:25.300> just<00:04:25.510> a<00:04:25.600> couple<00:04:25.810> of<00:04:26.020> times<00:04:26.260> I<00:04:26.530> find<00:04:27.100> that

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
hair just a couple of times I find that

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.030 
hair just a couple of times I find that
that<00:04:27.360> detangles<00:04:28.360> my<00:04:28.600> texturize<00:04:29.230> hair<00:04:29.590> much

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
that detangles my texturize hair much

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.330 
that detangles my texturize hair much
much<00:04:30.400> better<00:04:30.670> than<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.390> wig<00:04:31.990> brushes<00:04:32.470> or

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
much better than the wig brushes or

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.460 
much better than the wig brushes or
paddle<00:04:33.670> brushes<00:04:34.030> that<00:04:34.240> most<00:04:34.450> people<00:04:34.750> use<00:04:34.930> so<00:04:35.230> I

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
paddle brushes that most people use so I

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.130 
paddle brushes that most people use so I
just<00:04:36.100> go<00:04:36.280> ahead<00:04:36.430> and<00:04:36.910> I<00:04:37.030> start<00:04:37.450> to<00:04:37.660> apply<00:04:37.990> it

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
just go ahead and I start to apply it

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:53.770 
just go ahead and I start to apply it
section<00:04:38.830> by<00:04:38.890> section

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.990 

so<00:04:54.780> I<00:04:54.810> left<00:04:55.260> another<00:04:55.560> towel<00:04:55.919> because<00:04:56.340> my

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
so I left another towel because my

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.420 
so I left another towel because my
mixture<00:04:57.479> was<00:04:57.630> getting<00:04:57.870> everywhere<00:04:58.470> so<00:04:58.770> I<00:04:58.979> went

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
mixture was getting everywhere so I went

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.740 
mixture was getting everywhere so I went
ahead<00:04:59.490> and<00:04:59.639> put<00:04:59.820> a<00:04:59.850> towel<00:05:00.090> on<00:05:00.240> my<00:05:00.270> lap<00:05:00.510> which
