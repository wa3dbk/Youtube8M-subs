schematically and crocheting patterns
I've<00:00:11.550> also<00:00:11.759> done<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.059> tutorial<00:00:12.360> on<00:00:12.900> drawing

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
I've also done a tutorial on drawing

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.620 
I've also done a tutorial on drawing
schematics<00:00:13.889> in<00:00:14.099> Illustrator<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.030> if<00:00:15.360> you're

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
schematics in Illustrator and if you're

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.300 
schematics in Illustrator and if you're
comfortable<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.590> have<00:00:16.740> access<00:00:17.010> to

comfortable and have access to

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.550 
comfortable and have access to
illustrator<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.570> would<00:00:18.750> recommend<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.230> for

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
illustrator I would recommend that for

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.250 
illustrator I would recommend that for
slightly<00:00:19.770> more<00:00:19.920> professional<00:00:20.930> results<00:00:21.930> but

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
slightly more professional results but

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.349 
slightly more professional results but
then<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.710> can<00:00:22.890> absolutely<00:00:23.100> get<00:00:23.670> some<00:00:24.180> pretty

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
then you can absolutely get some pretty

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.509 
then you can absolutely get some pretty
decent<00:00:24.630> results<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.350> Microsoft<00:00:26.130> Word<00:00:26.340> if

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
decent results in Microsoft Word if

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.550 
decent results in Microsoft Word if
that's<00:00:26.670> what<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:27.060> available<00:00:27.380> I'm<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.529> a

on just a scrap piece of paper you go

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.399 
on just a scrap piece of paper you go
ahead<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.430> draw<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:36.000> rough<00:01:36.600> approximation<00:01:37.350> of

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
what you're aiming for and then go

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.280 
what you're aiming for and then go
through<00:01:39.900> your<00:01:39.960> pattern<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.130> write<00:01:41.939> all<00:01:42.540> of

width of the waist you also want to know

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.470 
width of the waist you also want to know
how<00:02:17.390> far<00:02:18.109> between<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.489> hips<00:02:19.700> moist<00:02:20.150> you're

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
how far between the hips moist you're

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.319 
how far between the hips moist you're
going<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.049> that's<00:02:21.500> all<00:02:21.709> going<00:02:21.829> to<00:02:21.920> become

going and that's all going to become

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.369 
going and that's all going to become
more<00:02:23.329> important<00:02:23.750> you'll<00:02:23.870> see<00:02:24.019> as<00:02:24.140> we're

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
more important you'll see as we're

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.599 
more important you'll see as we're
working<00:02:25.689> so<00:02:26.689> you<00:02:27.170> have<00:02:27.349> your<00:02:27.469> sketch<00:02:27.769> you've

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
working so you have your sketch you've

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:31.839 
working so you have your sketch you've
your<00:02:28.760> palates<00:02:29.299> up<00:02:30.370> now<00:02:31.370> we're<00:02:31.519> going<00:02:31.639> to<00:02:31.700> begin

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
your palates up now we're going to begin

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.250 
your palates up now we're going to begin
to<00:02:32.829> draw<00:02:33.829> our<00:02:34.129> schematic<00:02:34.459> first<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.480> turn<00:02:36.230> on

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
to draw our schematic first I turn on

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.640 
to draw our schematic first I turn on
grids<00:02:36.739> and<00:02:37.420> I<00:02:38.420> want<00:02:38.659> to<00:02:38.750> set<00:02:38.989> this<00:02:39.200> slightly

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
grids and I want to set this slightly

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.330 
grids and I want to set this slightly
smaller<00:02:40.719> these<00:02:41.719> are<00:02:41.900> going<00:02:42.079> to<00:02:42.340> basically

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
smaller these are going to basically

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.520 
smaller these are going to basically
mark<00:02:43.639> our<00:02:43.909> inch<00:02:44.299> increments<00:02:45.879> we<00:02:46.879> are<00:02:47.409> going<00:02:48.409> to

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
mark our inch increments we are going to

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.960 
mark our inch increments we are going to
turn<00:02:48.799> on<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:50.450> grid<00:02:50.659> lines<00:02:50.870> on<00:02:51.109> the<00:02:51.230> screen<00:02:51.470> and

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
turn on the grid lines on the screen and

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.210 
turn on the grid lines on the screen and
if<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.000> need<00:02:53.299> more<00:02:53.750> increments<00:02:54.530> you<00:02:55.040> would

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
if you need more increments you would

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.000 
if you need more increments you would
make<00:02:55.400> this<00:02:55.579> number<00:02:55.790> smaller<00:02:58.359> Walla<00:02:59.359> and<00:03:00.010> then

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
make this number smaller Walla and then

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.209 
make this number smaller Walla and then
in<00:03:01.400> our<00:03:02.260> formatting<00:03:03.260> palette<00:03:03.439> I<00:03:03.859> want<00:03:04.099> to

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:04.219 
in our formatting palette I want to

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:09.309 
in our formatting palette I want to
select<00:03:04.549> this<00:03:05.260> freeform<00:03:06.260> drawing<00:03:06.859> tool<00:03:08.319> I'm

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
select this freeform drawing tool I'm

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.399 
select this freeform drawing tool I'm
going<00:03:09.739> to<00:03:09.889> draw<00:03:10.099> half<00:03:10.669> of<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.299> shape<00:03:11.540> now<00:03:11.870> I'm

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
going to draw half of the shape now I'm

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:13.899 
going to draw half of the shape now I'm
going<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:12.799> do<00:03:12.919> that<00:03:13.099> just<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:13.400> I<00:03:13.430> know<00:03:13.549> that

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
going to do that just so I know that

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.490 
going to do that just so I know that
it's<00:03:14.090> completely<00:03:14.569> symmetrical<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:15.319> it's

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
it's completely symmetrical and it's

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.280 
it's completely symmetrical and it's
going<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:15.709> save<00:03:15.919> me<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:16.129> few<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.760> few<00:03:17.120> steps<00:03:17.659> I'm

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
going to save me a few a few steps I'm

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.500 
going to save me a few a few steps I'm
also<00:03:18.560> going<00:03:18.829> to<00:03:18.919> round<00:03:19.340> all<00:03:19.699> my<00:03:19.849> measurements

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
also going to round all my measurements

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.550 
also going to round all my measurements
to<00:03:20.659> the<00:03:20.780> closest<00:03:21.199> inch<00:03:21.470> because<00:03:21.859> unlike<00:03:22.400> in

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
to the closest inch because unlike in

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.439 
to the closest inch because unlike in
Illustrator<00:03:24.560> where<00:03:25.549> I<00:03:25.579> can<00:03:25.909> do<00:03:26.000> nice<00:03:26.209> big

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:26.449 
Illustrator where I can do nice big

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
grid lines this is going to be a little

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.740 
grid lines this is going to be a little
simpler<00:03:31.459> and<00:03:31.699> we're<00:03:31.819> just<00:03:31.939> going<00:03:32.120> to<00:03:32.209> snap<00:03:32.510> to

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
simpler and we're just going to snap to

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.659 
simpler and we're just going to snap to
one<00:03:32.930> inch<00:03:33.139> increments<00:03:33.769> I<00:03:33.949> want<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.489> make<00:03:34.639> sure

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
one inch increments I want to make sure

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.000 
one inch increments I want to make sure
that<00:03:35.150> you<00:03:35.449> can<00:03:35.840> see<00:03:36.169> what<00:03:36.290> I'm<00:03:36.379> doing<00:03:36.680> here<00:03:36.859> so

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
that you can see what I'm doing here so

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.740 
that you can see what I'm doing here so
I'm<00:03:37.069> going<00:03:37.159> to<00:03:37.220> zoom<00:03:37.519> in<00:03:38.180> just<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.479> little<00:03:38.510> bit

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
I'm going to zoom in just a little bit

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.300 
I'm going to zoom in just a little bit
more<00:03:39.169> and<00:03:40.870> maybe<00:03:41.870> we'll<00:03:42.199> make<00:03:42.409> that<00:03:43.239> 175<00:03:44.239> and

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
more and maybe we'll make that 175 and

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.170 
more and maybe we'll make that 175 and
that's<00:03:46.310> going<00:03:46.519> to<00:03:46.579> allow<00:03:46.729> you<00:03:46.790> to<00:03:46.970> see<00:03:47.150> a

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
that's going to allow you to see a

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.469 
that's going to allow you to see a
little<00:03:47.329> bit<00:03:47.540> more<00:03:47.599> of<00:03:47.870> what<00:03:48.049> I'm<00:03:48.169> doing<00:03:48.199> here

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:49.479 
little bit more of what I'm doing here

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:53.589 
little bit more of what I'm doing here
have<00:03:50.479> my<00:03:50.629> freeform<00:03:51.349> tool<00:03:51.650> selected<00:03:52.430> and<00:03:52.759> I'm

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
have my freeform tool selected and I'm

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.710 
have my freeform tool selected and I'm
going<00:03:53.689> to<00:03:53.989> begin<00:03:54.139> drawing<00:03:54.829> at<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.250> hem<00:03:55.669> my<00:03:56.449> hem

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
going to begin drawing at the hem my hem

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.539 
going to begin drawing at the hem my hem
is<00:03:57.069> 40<00:03:58.069> inches<00:03:58.250> around<00:03:58.819> so<00:03:59.269> that's<00:03:59.769> 20<00:04:00.769> inches

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
is 40 inches around so that's 20 inches

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.270 
is 40 inches around so that's 20 inches
wide<00:04:01.909> and<00:04:02.389> half<00:04:02.750> of<00:04:02.930> that<00:04:03.079> would<00:04:03.259> be<00:04:03.290> 10<00:04:03.769> so

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
wide and half of that would be 10 so

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.520 
wide and half of that would be 10 so
I'll<00:04:04.400> start<00:04:04.729> here<00:04:05.209> and<00:04:05.389> I'll<00:04:05.540> go<00:04:05.750> over<00:04:05.989> 10

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
I'll start here and I'll go over 10

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.900 
I'll start here and I'll go over 10
gridlines

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910

I<00:04:13.010> just<00:04:14.010> click<00:04:14.490> when<00:04:14.670> I<00:04:14.700> get<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.180> point

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
I just click when I get to the point

that I want to make my next grid line
and<00:04:18.360> just<00:04:19.140> as<00:04:19.290> a<00:04:19.320> warning<00:04:20.250> this<00:04:20.640> freeform<00:04:21.269> tool

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
and just as a warning this freeform tool

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.990 
and just as a warning this freeform tool
is<00:04:21.840> is<00:04:22.170> pretty<00:04:22.830> decent<00:04:23.460> but<00:04:23.640> it<00:04:23.760> sometimes

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
is is pretty decent but it sometimes

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.900 
is is pretty decent but it sometimes
throws<00:04:24.510> in<00:04:24.750> a<00:04:24.960> random<00:04:25.500> curvy<00:04:26.370> line<00:04:26.580> that<00:04:26.790> you

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
throws in a random curvy line that you

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.840 
throws in a random curvy line that you
don't<00:04:27.120> intend<00:04:27.510> and<00:04:27.810> when<00:04:28.470> that<00:04:28.590> happens<00:04:29.040> it's

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
don't intend and when that happens it's

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.300 
don't intend and when that happens it's
often<00:04:30.180> easier<00:04:30.510> just<00:04:30.690> to<00:04:31.170> start<00:04:31.770> fresh<00:04:32.070> though

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
often easier just to start fresh though

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.460 
often easier just to start fresh though
you<00:04:32.370> can<00:04:32.760> modify<00:04:33.180> those<00:04:33.510> points<00:04:34.050> after<00:04:34.230> the

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
you can modify those points after the

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.230 
you can modify those points after the
fact<00:04:34.800> so<00:04:34.950> we'll<00:04:35.220> we'll<00:04:35.550> look<00:04:35.730> at<00:04:35.880> that<00:04:36.000> if<00:04:36.120> it

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
fact so we'll we'll look at that if it

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.130 
fact so we'll we'll look at that if it
comes<00:04:36.360> up<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:37.530> next<00:04:37.560> step<00:04:38.010> is<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.340> go<00:04:38.490> up<00:04:39.140> six

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
comes up the next step is to go up six

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.960 
comes up the next step is to go up six
increments<00:04:41.130> and<00:04:42.260> then<00:04:43.260> go<00:04:43.500> into<00:04:43.830> and<00:04:44.730> that's

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
increments and then go into and that's

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.570 
increments and then go into and that's
going<00:04:45.240> to<00:04:45.300> be<00:04:45.480> our<00:04:45.750> waist<00:04:46.080> shaping<00:04:46.650> our<00:04:47.340> waist

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
going to be our waist shaping our waist

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.560 
going to be our waist shaping our waist
is<00:04:47.790> about<00:04:48.030> an<00:04:48.330> inch<00:04:48.870> and<00:04:49.320> then<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:50.280> have<00:04:50.610> nine

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
is about an inch and then I have nine

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.810 
is about an inch and then I have nine
inches<00:04:52.080> up<00:04:52.320> to<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.620> bust<00:04:52.920> and<00:04:53.280> I'm<00:04:53.460> only<00:04:53.610> going

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
inches up to the bust and I'm only going

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.600 
inches up to the bust and I'm only going
to<00:04:53.850> come<00:04:54.060> out<00:04:54.240> one<00:04:54.540> increment<00:04:54.990> so<00:04:55.620> I'll<00:04:56.430> draw

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
to come out one increment so I'll draw

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.800 
to come out one increment so I'll draw
that<00:04:56.640> now<00:04:59.510> click<00:05:00.510> and<00:05:00.720> then<00:05:01.610> my<00:05:02.610> arms<00:05:03.090> I<00:05:03.300> comes

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
that now click and then my arms I comes

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.860 
that now click and then my arms I comes
in<00:05:04.110> about<00:05:04.950> three<00:05:05.400> inches<00:05:05.730> total<00:05:06.180> so<00:05:06.600> what<00:05:06.750> I'll

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
in about three inches total so what I'll

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.730 
in about three inches total so what I'll
do<00:05:07.080> is<00:05:07.110> go<00:05:08.180> underarm<00:05:09.180> bind<00:05:09.630> off<00:05:09.840> for<00:05:10.140> one<00:05:10.350> and

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
do is go underarm bind off for one and

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.770 
do is go underarm bind off for one and
then<00:05:11.010> another<00:05:11.310> two<00:05:11.700> for<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.030> shaping<00:05:12.300> and<00:05:12.660> the

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
then another two for the shaping and the

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.960 
then another two for the shaping and the
total<00:05:13.500> and<00:05:13.650> see<00:05:13.830> there<00:05:14.070> that<00:05:14.340> got<00:05:14.670> a<00:05:14.700> little

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
total and see there that got a little

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.790 
total and see there that got a little
curvy<00:05:15.300> that's<00:05:15.510> actually<00:05:15.900> okay<00:05:16.260> for<00:05:16.470> an<00:05:16.530> arms

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
curvy that's actually okay for an arms

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.650 
curvy that's actually okay for an arms
eye<00:05:16.980> so<00:05:17.280> i<00:05:17.310> won't<00:05:17.610> i<00:05:17.820> won't<00:05:17.880> worry<00:05:18.270> about<00:05:18.360> it

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
eye so i won't i won't worry about it

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.600 
eye so i won't i won't worry about it
but<00:05:18.870> if<00:05:19.080> you<00:05:19.500> wanted<00:05:19.740> that<00:05:19.830> to<00:05:20.070> be<00:05:20.190> straight

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
but if you wanted that to be straight

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.670 
but if you wanted that to be straight
you<00:05:20.910> could<00:05:21.300> start<00:05:21.900> over<00:05:22.080> or<00:05:22.440> edit<00:05:22.860> it<00:05:22.950> later

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
you could start over or edit it later

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.500 
you could start over or edit it later
and<00:05:25.680> i'll<00:05:25.860> fix<00:05:26.070> that<00:05:26.280> little<00:05:26.400> wonky<00:05:26.880> bit<00:05:27.270> to

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
and i'll fix that little wonky bit to

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.670 
and i'll fix that little wonky bit to
the<00:05:28.350> total<00:05:28.800> arms<00:05:29.070> i<00:05:29.250> is<00:05:29.690> seven<00:05:30.690> inches<00:05:31.110> deep<00:05:31.380> so

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
the total arms i is seven inches deep so

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.640 
the total arms i is seven inches deep so
from<00:05:32.010> from<00:05:32.640> that<00:05:32.730> bind<00:05:33.150> off<00:05:33.419> i<00:05:33.720> want<00:05:34.290> to<00:05:34.380> go<00:05:34.500> up

from from that bind off i want to go up

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.100 
from from that bind off i want to go up
seven<00:05:35.250> that's<00:05:35.550> one<00:05:36.210> two<00:05:36.660> three<00:05:36.690> four<00:05:38.690> seven<00:05:39.690> i
