00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
pretty pretty big when I was playing my

pretty pretty big when I was playing my
DK<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:30.660> these<00:00:30.840> duels<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.380> didn't<00:00:31.590> really<00:00:31.770> notice

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
DK in these duels I didn't really notice

DK in these duels I didn't really notice
a<00:00:32.220> change<00:00:32.250> from<00:00:32.760> live<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.530> beta<00:00:34.710> not<00:00:34.950> in

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
a change from live to on the beta not in

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.850 
a change from live to on the beta not in
terms<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:36.750> way<00:00:36.900> that<00:00:36.930> that's<00:00:37.350> actually

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
terms of the way that that's actually

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.490 
terms of the way that that's actually
played<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.430> did<00:00:39.090> think<00:00:39.330> that<00:00:39.420> conversion<00:00:40.320> on

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
played I did think that conversion on

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.869 
played I did think that conversion on
the<00:00:40.620> beta<00:00:40.800> build<00:00:41.040> right<00:00:41.220> now<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> little<00:00:41.580> too

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
the beta build right now is a little too

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.030 
the beta build right now is a little too
overpowered<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.080> I<00:00:43.110> just<00:00:43.440> went<00:00:43.769> against

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
overpowered so I just went against

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.549 
overpowered so I just went against
taking<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.580> I<00:00:44.670> took<00:00:45.110> death<00:00:46.110> siphon

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
taking it and I took death siphon

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.829 
taking it and I took death siphon
instead<00:00:47.100> even<00:00:48.000> though<00:00:48.089> i<00:00:48.120> found<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.449> yelling

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
instead even though i found that yelling

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.350 
instead even though i found that yelling
a<00:00:48.900> little<00:00:49.080> bit<00:00:49.170> ridiculous<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.909> anyway<00:00:50.909> so<00:00:50.970> so

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
a little bit ridiculous to anyway so so

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.210 
a little bit ridiculous to anyway so so
