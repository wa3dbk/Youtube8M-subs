 hello friends welcome to another new 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.190
 video tutorial in which we can 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.760
 teach them how to install a custom room 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.349
 which is called christel or this cultural 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.960
 rom I'll leave it in the description of 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.330
 video and you can download it and copy it 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.710
 of your microsd memory and install it with 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.690
 an advanced recovery like the one that 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.550
 I show at this time they have to be 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.430
 the 3 wii for its proper functioning in 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.519

 folder where we copy the custom rom and 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.520
 only sections where it says cristelos and 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.520
 we are going to install

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.840

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.960
 this process takes time as they can 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.690
 see already finished we give you next and you 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.430
 we give start now we give it finish 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.800
 you have already installed the custom rum and 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.780
 we only hope that it charges what it is 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.940
 the configuration of the files the 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.530
 last one before before loading 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.530
 the terminal and 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.500
 and we only hope 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.629
 as I said, it has to be a 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.830
 Android backup too 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.300
 backup of your applications 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.460
 if you do not want to lose them 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:11.620
 I recommend app backup 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:14.049
 there are other tools to do that 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.209
 that backup of your applications but they 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.849
 I recommend that meat is very easy to 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.599
 use very simple does not have many that 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.599
 they are many configurations 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.730
 and then only restore them 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.840
 well as you can see it's finished 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.549
 load the applications now only 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.549
 is updating the operating system 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:24.090
 we wait a moment to update what 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.090
 what are the applications 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.360
 our terminal I recommend you 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.800
 charge zinc at least 50 percent 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.270
 hundred in our terminal so it does not 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.440
 we have no problem and we do not know 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.409
 go to download in the middle of the 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.000
 installation 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.790
 As you can see, it's over 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.870
 here we have what is good this is the 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.130
 code 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.130
 before my way 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:55.270
 5 good we're going to start we have no 

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:57.220

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.060

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:14.310
 well as you can see here we already have 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:17.310

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.360

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:31.860

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.930
 of the 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.880

 let's see what the camera is 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.810
 in the camera works correctly 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:18.220
