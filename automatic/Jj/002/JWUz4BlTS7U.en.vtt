importance of that combine on his farm

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.010 
importance of that combine on his farm
he<00:00:31.230> relies<00:00:31.980> heavily<00:00:32.009> upon<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:33.090> at<00:00:33.329> harvest

he relies heavily upon it at harvest

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.470 
he relies heavily upon it at harvest
time<00:00:34.100> I'm<00:00:35.100> probably<00:00:35.340> right<00:00:35.850> at<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.149> acreage

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
time I'm probably right at the acreage

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.440 
time I'm probably right at the acreage
amount<00:00:36.899> where<00:00:37.370> maybe<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.489> possibly<00:00:39.030> need<00:00:39.239> two

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
amount where maybe I possibly need two

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.569 
amount where maybe I possibly need two
machines<00:00:39.899> but<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.320> try<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.649> run<00:00:40.890> all<00:00:41.129> three

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
machines but we try to run all three

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.280 
machines but we try to run all three
thousand<00:00:41.969> acres<00:00:42.239> through<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:42.690> machine<00:00:43.050> and

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
thousand acres through one machine and

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.040 
thousand acres through one machine and
so<00:00:44.250> certainly<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.700> my<00:00:44.879> particular<00:00:45.329> operation

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
so certainly in my particular operation

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.799 
so certainly in my particular operation
it<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.440> crucial<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.280> machine<00:00:47.460> runs<00:00:47.969> 12

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
it is crucial that that machine runs 12

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.889 
it is crucial that that machine runs 12
to<00:00:48.930> 14<00:00:49.320> hours<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> day<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.629> you<00:00:51.629> know<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.870> needs

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
to 14 hours a day so you know it needs

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.770 
to 14 hours a day so you know it needs
it<00:00:52.440> needs<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.860> thorough<00:00:53.190> gone<00:00:53.910> over<00:00:54.270> every

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
it needs a thorough gone over every

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.799 
it needs a thorough gone over every
morning<00:00:55.140> before<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:55.590> start<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.570> and<00:00:57.570> we've

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
morning before we start and and we've

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.979 
morning before we start and and we've
been<00:00:57.840> successful<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.270> doing<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.690> and

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
been successful in in in doing that and

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.689 
been successful in in in doing that and
keeping<00:01:01.530> an<00:01:01.649> eye<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:01.800> things<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.399> keeping

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
keeping an eye on things and keeping

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.899 
keeping an eye on things and keeping
things<00:01:02.940> well<00:01:03.149> lubed<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:04.280> it's<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:05.670> turned

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
things well lubed and it's it's turned

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.630 
things well lubed and it's it's turned
out<00:01:06.030> very<00:01:06.210> well<00:01:06.270> for<00:01:06.600> me<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:07.290> my<00:01:07.560> operation<00:01:08.100> we

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
out very well for me in my operation we

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.820 
out very well for me in my operation we
we<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:09.210> not<00:01:09.240> trade<00:01:09.750> very<00:01:10.080> often<00:01:10.500> for<00:01:10.680> new

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
we do not trade very often for new

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.160 
we do not trade very often for new
equipment<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.670> probably<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.630> keep<00:01:12.810> up<00:01:12.990> with

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
equipment so probably to keep up with

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.560 
equipment so probably to keep up with
the<00:01:13.260> lubricants<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.670> very<00:01:14.970> important<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.450> my

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
the lubricants is very important to my

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.260 
the lubricants is very important to my
operation<00:01:15.900> probably<00:01:16.680> our<00:01:16.799> average<00:01:17.270> equipment

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
operation probably our average equipment

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.170 
operation probably our average equipment
is<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:19.020> know<00:01:19.140> ten<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.890> fifteen<00:01:20.310> years<00:01:20.520> old<00:01:20.700> so

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
is you know ten to fifteen years old so

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.820 
is you know ten to fifteen years old so
but<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.110> know<00:01:22.229> if<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.530> keep<00:01:22.650> it

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
but you know if you keep it

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.800 
but you know if you keep it
well-maintained<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.729> found<00:01:24.119> out<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
well-maintained I found out that the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.660 
well-maintained I found out that the
longevity<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.680> equipment<00:01:26.130> will<00:01:26.310> be<00:01:26.430> great

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
longevity of the equipment will be great

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.580 
longevity of the equipment will be great
and<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.000> kind<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.689> has<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> lot<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.140> do<00:01:28.380> with

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
and that kind of has a lot to do with

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.340 
and that kind of has a lot to do with
keeping<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:29.579> with<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> lubricants<00:01:30.350> Steve

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
keeping up with the lubricants Steve

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.920 
keeping up with the lubricants Steve
shared<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.890> me<00:01:32.040> how<00:01:32.280> he<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.790> serious<00:01:33.630> about

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
shared with me how he is serious about

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.770 
shared with me how he is serious about
his<00:01:34.380> equipment<00:01:34.860> therefore<00:01:35.850> he's<00:01:36.210> pretty

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
his equipment therefore he's pretty

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.960 
his equipment therefore he's pretty
religious<00:01:37.259> as<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.560> might<00:01:37.740> say<00:01:38.009> about<00:01:38.700> his

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
religious as you might say about his

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.289 
religious as you might say about his
equipment<00:01:39.479> lubrication<00:01:41.119> combined<00:01:42.119> is

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
equipment lubrication combined is

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.240 
equipment lubrication combined is
probably<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.659> most<00:01:42.810> crucial<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.950> gets

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
probably the most crucial and that gets

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.429 
probably the most crucial and that gets
the<00:01:44.970> corn<00:01:45.240> head<00:01:45.390> grist<00:01:45.600> greased<00:01:45.960> every<00:01:46.290> day

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
the corn head grist greased every day

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.560 
the corn head grist greased every day
and<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.130> machine<00:01:47.430> itself<00:01:47.759> every<00:01:48.210> other<00:01:48.329> day

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and the machine itself every other day

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.109 
and the machine itself every other day
certainly<00:01:49.409> depending<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.220> hours<00:01:50.549> but

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
certainly depending on the hours but

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.030 
certainly depending on the hours but
that's<00:01:51.570> probably<00:01:51.840> our<00:01:51.960> most<00:01:52.200> crucial<00:01:52.710> machine

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
that's probably our most crucial machine

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.149 
that's probably our most crucial machine
that<00:01:53.280> we<00:01:53.399> keep<00:01:53.909> an<00:01:54.060> eye<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:55.380> tractors<00:01:55.890> you

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
that we keep an eye on the tractors you

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.429 
that we keep an eye on the tractors you
know<00:01:56.280> once<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.640> week<00:01:56.820> they<00:01:57.149> get<00:01:57.270> gone<00:01:57.479> over<00:01:57.840> real

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
know once a week they get gone over real
