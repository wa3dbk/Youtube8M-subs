00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
we've reached two hurdles and apparently

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.390 
we've reached two hurdles and apparently
they're<00:02:36.260> facing<00:02:36.440> wrong<00:02:36.739> direction<00:02:36.920> but

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
they're facing wrong direction but

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.970 
they're facing wrong direction but
that's<00:02:37.550> okay<00:02:38.030> because<00:02:38.440> they<00:02:39.440> still<00:02:39.709> work<00:02:39.860> the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
that's okay because they still work the

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.449 
that's okay because they still work the
same<00:02:40.010> way<00:02:40.370> if<00:02:40.519> you<00:02:40.670> knock<00:02:41.030> them<00:02:41.060> over<00:02:42.070> it<00:02:43.070> just

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
same way if you knock them over it just

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:44.770 
same way if you knock them over it just
means<00:02:43.700> you're<00:02:44.090> awesome

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
July 27th I believe which is exactly a

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.650 
July 27th I believe which is exactly a
week<00:04:45.030> from<00:04:45.539> when<00:04:45.870> I'm<00:04:46.050> recording<00:04:46.530> this<00:04:47.660> so

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
week from when I'm recording this so

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.379 
week from when I'm recording this so
hopefully<00:04:48.840> that<00:04:49.470> dude<00:04:49.710> has<00:04:50.220> enough<00:04:50.550> time<00:04:50.910> to

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
hopefully that dude has enough time to

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.810 
hopefully that dude has enough time to
add<00:04:51.690> in<00:04:52.229> all<00:04:52.500> of<00:04:52.710> these<00:04:52.919> sports<00:04:53.220> because<00:04:53.580> he

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
add in all of these sports because he

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.550 
add in all of these sports because he
just<00:04:54.000> started<00:04:54.300> like<00:04:54.570> a<00:04:54.600> few<00:04:54.840> days<00:04:55.020> ago<00:04:55.229> and

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
just started like a few days ago and

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.710 
just started like a few days ago and
there's<00:04:55.800> been<00:04:55.950> quite<00:04:56.310> a<00:04:56.370> lot<00:04:56.520> of<00:04:56.580> stuff<00:04:57.360> added

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
there's been quite a lot of stuff added

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.230 
there's been quite a lot of stuff added
in<00:04:57.979> although<00:04:58.979> there's<00:04:59.159> only<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.520> hurdles<00:04:59.970> and

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
in although there's only the hurdles and

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.650 
in although there's only the hurdles and
the<00:05:00.330> track

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
the track

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.260 
the track
the<00:05:01.840> javelins<00:05:02.440> for<00:05:02.920> now<00:05:03.190> he<00:05:03.970> has<00:05:04.060> already

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
the javelins for now he has already

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.780 
the javelins for now he has already
finished<00:05:04.810> adding<00:05:05.140> the<00:05:05.530> tennis<00:05:06.070> and<00:05:06.340> the

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
finished adding the tennis and the

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.390 
finished adding the tennis and the
archery<00:05:07.300> stuff<00:05:07.720> and<00:05:07.990> I<00:05:08.680> think<00:05:09.010> there's<00:05:09.220> also

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
archery stuff and I think there's also

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.900 
archery stuff and I think there's also
guns<00:05:09.850> coming<00:05:10.380> swimming<00:05:11.380> and<00:05:11.830> stuff<00:05:12.520> like<00:05:12.670> that

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
guns coming swimming and stuff like that

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.180 
guns coming swimming and stuff like that
but<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.420> next<00:05:13.870> update<00:05:14.020> will<00:05:14.200> probably<00:05:14.830> be<00:05:15.010> out

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
but the next update will probably be out

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.830 
but the next update will probably be out
pretty<00:05:15.400> soon<00:05:15.670> it<00:05:15.850> might<00:05:15.970> even<00:05:16.180> be<00:05:16.450> outs

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840
