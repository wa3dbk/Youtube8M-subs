 the telecom so that the market it stands today also the way there from the 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.180
 Spielvereinigung Greuther Fürth his personal from Wednesday 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.799
 Hello I am the one who does not work 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.390
 by Greuther Fürth and old characters I mean drum 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:24.159
 in 4 stands at the first pisa test of percent today leads currently 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.640
 the number two but one percent unbelievable power gymnastics has done with that 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.100
 Club but stands together and be 11 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.260
 Outstanding Keeper in Brander Mensch and one of my 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.390
 Data good friend of mine and therefore 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.390
 but comes next to the gate 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.490
 now find more Priol and Lucio that are consider two defenders of a few percent 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.070
 «Have great respect as those of the week occur 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.660
 in the past, the last time is ten percent higher than on the left 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.120
 played there when I was with a central defense from Bayer 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.570
 the ranks two to the absolute world top and therefore am holding synonymous 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.540
 on the left is Roberto Carlos 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.400
 alone specialist positions yes in my youth was simply one of the players 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.330
 I 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.530
 most admired and that he and his colleagues believe France 98 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.530
 Wanted for the wall professionals had become simple 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.740
 bumped in my heart and eldest 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.740
 plays "but more on the left side 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.150
 so rehearsing the right side played Stefan Schreck 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.300
 Percent also players of Greuther Fürth incredibly fast, "said Brantner 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.079
 Player as rarely seen and l 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:59.080
 he has often enough shown what he has on it Quante 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.080
 That's why he has made a place for me 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.919
 so on the 6 say about me 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.329
 and over the coach Hank I do not have much to say one of the 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:19.429
 So one of the best players right now and I think Messi would still be ahead 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:22.889
 not as good as a racer like Intel now I am here behind him 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:24.269
 be from Bayer 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.610
 I myself have pretty much gymnastics percent of the world's best midfielder 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:31.369
 therefore, a wall must be asked for it 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.549
 then percent on the 10 my brother plays something of the holidays 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.809
 he plays both so and Laer 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:51.299
 that has always been my dream to play with him and percent on the 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.299
 Chalkboard allows me guided in any case 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:07.439
 on the left play dates percent meet Pektürk 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.709
 also leads from the size 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.029
 one percent very good technician had the attached l &amp; l 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:18.159
 three or four years ago, he also Koblenz in the second division of the descent 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:19.379
 rescued 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.379
 and l also count a very good touching friend 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:25.099
 and therefore he has percent 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.099
 also deserves the lineup 

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:38.389
 on the right side I offer good friend of mine 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.739
 the last place Erwig she changes 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.309
 in New York 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:47.419
 most recently 2 9 percent more hab percent per year and five ladies played off percent 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:51.369
 still close contact with him so dapd it will make me happy if someday 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:54.369
 again with modest finder 

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.389
 ahead 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.809
 actually in my opinion best player of all time 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:08.089
 Years in its top form 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:10.769
 or nobody comes to him he simply has 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.129
 had everything what his eleventh time but need 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.849
 the fastest was double game deaths it's ever been 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.449
 had superior technology and the 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.080
 is just a legend and that sounds 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.539
 Jump up to ten percent so the Brazilian 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.779
 yes and percent 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:37.719
 there is my wife Merkel's percent I want to be able to escape and of course 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:40.210
 when I first look at colorful 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.050
 yes that's one percent come from me if Ursula summer is going to happen 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.360
 really only a dream remains but Dr there I am of course not missing 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.900
 Yes 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.409
 getting ahead and around 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:04.409
 I hope she is right 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.900
 because honestly say 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.180
 Inka Bause are all saying that you have a colorful mix of a drum 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.310
 the back space player so recorded 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.730
 He would have loved to play two with a couple of Ott 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:32.580
 games 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.250
 Roberto Carlos, who now earns his living in the Cruze Land but that's it 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.860
 I do not think so bad as I read today for my birthday 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.729
 eighth thirtieth birthday 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.570
 not only would the president be beautiful 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.659
 the authors throw 1 made millions left 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:49.639
 but all right, make this pure and beautiful when I do all this too 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.429
 really times the accident bus Meiler again stopped in his dream world and not 

00:05:53.429 --> 00:05:57.879
 only Cristiano still the little fat and hello for the already 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:58.699
 quite well 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.889
 the strikingly many that he is now no player from the 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.499
 Ascended team has set up for it from then on but then has 

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:07.520
 three quarters led among other things Martin nevertheless the Stefan Stork 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.069
 who has recently become international in the Philippines 

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:12.990
 you have to do it first 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.020
 London - as I said, would be very colorful mix 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.850
 Brunner 2 still on 6 4 Volkswagen and now 9 Parma 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.759
 you can also be curious how it develops around 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:25.740
 for the eleven on the heels 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.069
 All this has given the team the citizen's festival its financial resources for the 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:31.379
 other assessment, of course, a big thank you 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:34.939
 on the design and of course a thank you to the Kasseler Kripo too 

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:36.699
 improve is goodbye
