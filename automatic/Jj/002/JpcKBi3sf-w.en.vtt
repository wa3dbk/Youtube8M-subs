00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.390
 hello youtuber today I bring you a video 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.730
 where are we going to get angry 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.380
 enrage and exalt in this video 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.110
 I will talk about the 10 most games 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.840
 difficult in the world so let's start in 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.830
 the number 10 is the game on 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.050
 cat and mouse 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.030
 in this game you are the little red ball and 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.430
 you will try to get her out of the circle without 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.230
 the blue ball touches you the difficulty of 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.030
 this game is that the blue ball is 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.430
 four times faster than the pellet 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.720
 red and that's why this game is won 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.000
 place number 10 number 9 in this 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.950
 put is the game escapes in this 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.660
 game you are the red box and you will try 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.000
 avoid that the paintings do not touch you 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.610
 blue the legend says that if you achieve 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.680
 hold 18 seconds you're a phenomenon and 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.200
 if you manage to hold two minutes you are 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.180
 chuck norris thing that is impossible anymore 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.390
 that the blue squares while it passes more 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.550
 time will move faster number 8 in 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.950
 this position is the cat game 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.410
 bros is a game where we will have to 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.300
 handle a cat you will go through different 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.400
 scenarios the difference is that in this 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.780
 game is one of the most deceptive games 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.060
 since they have many 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.770
 and that's why this game wins the 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.679
 position number 8 number 7 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.299
 hexagon is a game where with the help of 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.399
 your keyboard arrows you should avoid 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.860
 may the figures that come hit you 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.899
 I think this game is difficult because 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.659
 they come very fast that you can not even see them 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.670
 the gameplay is good you have good 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.420
 control of the point that you drive and this 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.380
 game you win the number 7 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.380
 number 6 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.130
 the hardest game in the world this is 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.530
 a game that is said to be the most 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.810
 difficult of the world but for me it is not 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.580
 in this game you are the red box and 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.409
 You must reach the area on the other side 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.299
 without the balls touching you the 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.610
 difficulty is that the more levels 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.500
 passes gets harder and that's why 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.350
 that this game earns number one 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.830
 6 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.530
 number 5 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.510
 impossible in this game where we will have 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.980
 have to control the ball and carry it 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.260
 different spaces very small 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.150
 run into objects that if we touch 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.460
 we will lose this game has three 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.350
 clear difficulties if you choose the easy 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.360
 you will think that it is not difficult but if 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.220
 you choose the last difficulty of shitting 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.770
 asia that increases the severity and that will be 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.690
 very difficult to control this game is 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.660
 wins place number 5 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.970
 number 4 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.980
 giant is a game where we are 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.080
 a blue platform and with the help of 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.600
 mouse we will help to avoid that 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.760
 drop the ball the goal is to put the 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.620
 ball in the hole of each level the 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.390
 difficulty is that light drives the 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.459
 ball up and if it collides with 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.440
 some wall or object we will lose and it is 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.980
 that's why this game wins the place 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.550
 number 4 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.040
 number 3 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.960
 multitask is a mini-game where 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.910
 principle we will have to be a bar 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.190
 that will keep the little ball above her 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.960
 but the more points we make 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.570
 They also appear more objects 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.820
 we will have to move this game you win 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.560
 the number 2 place for the tasks 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.950
 assigned when you play it you'll want 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.650
 have four hands number 2 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.750
 of a fire platform is a game 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.700
 amazing is similar to cat's 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.769
 gross but this game has many more 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.750
 traps the boxes with text make you 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.269
 confuse you but sometimes you do not 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.700
 makes for you to gain confidence and this 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.670
 game you win the number 2 number 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.340
 1 and winner of the top wanna be the wee 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.500
 friends this game is the hardest of the 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.480
 world in my opinion this game was created 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.430
 only for gods at a glance you see 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.410
 which is a normal game but it is not and 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.390
 that's why this game wins the 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.459
 ranked number 1 since it has many 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.190
 levels and when playing it you will want to destroy your 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.350
 computer 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.150
