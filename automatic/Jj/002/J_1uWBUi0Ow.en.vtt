00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
tell me about selecting these particular

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.519 
tell me about selecting these particular
characters<00:00:03.030> because<00:00:03.780> it<00:00:03.899> seems<00:00:04.080> like<00:00:04.140> you<00:00:04.380> may

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
characters because it seems like you may

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.099 
characters because it seems like you may
have<00:00:04.560> cast<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.609> wide<00:00:05.759> net<00:00:05.790> yeah<00:00:06.480> yeah<00:00:06.930> it<00:00:07.080> was

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
have cast a wide net yeah yeah it was

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.720 
have cast a wide net yeah yeah it was
one<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.440> these<00:00:07.560> situations<00:00:08.370> I<00:00:08.460> think<00:00:08.639> I

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
one of these situations I think I

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.129 
one of these situations I think I
probably<00:00:09.030> interviewed<00:00:09.740> 22<00:00:10.940> 23<00:00:12.139> different

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
probably interviewed 22 23 different

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.740 
probably interviewed 22 23 different
handlers<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.920> it<00:00:14.340> was<00:00:14.460> really<00:00:14.730> about<00:00:14.820> finding

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
handlers and it was really about finding

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.550 
handlers and it was really about finding
handlers<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:17.460> had<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.560> connection

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
handlers that that had that connection

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.960 
handlers that that had that connection
with<00:00:19.770> their<00:00:19.920> dog<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.189> Milan<00:00:20.430> they<00:00:20.760> obviously

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
with their dog of Milan they obviously

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.040 
with their dog of Milan they obviously
all<00:00:21.240> have<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.480> great<00:00:21.630> connection<00:00:21.960> with

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
all have that great connection with

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.179 
all have that great connection with
their<00:00:22.140> dog<00:00:22.260> but<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.439> guess<00:00:22.560> it's<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.769> ability

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
their dog but I guess it's that ability

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.880 
their dog but I guess it's that ability
to<00:00:23.519> communicate<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.570> bond<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:25.590> know<00:00:25.619> and

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
to communicate that bond you know and

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.500 
to communicate that bond you know and
then<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.310> because<00:00:26.910> they've<00:00:27.060> all<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.420> know

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
then and because they've all you know

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.660 
then and because they've all you know
they<00:00:27.630> all<00:00:27.750> work<00:00:28.529> all<00:00:28.769> combat<00:00:29.160> veterans<00:00:29.189> and

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
they all work all combat veterans and

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.820 
they all work all combat veterans and
all<00:00:29.760> had<00:00:29.970> amazing<00:00:30.480> experiences<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.619> know<00:00:31.710> and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
all had amazing experiences you know and

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.860 
all had amazing experiences you know and
some<00:00:32.009> had<00:00:32.160> been<00:00:32.399> more<00:00:32.759> amazing<00:00:33.239> maybe<00:00:33.450> combat

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
some had been more amazing maybe combat

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.540 
some had been more amazing maybe combat
records<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.380> others<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.800> was<00:00:34.920> just<00:00:35.100> there

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
was some of them that just you just felt

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.020 
was some of them that just you just felt
that<00:00:37.649> bond<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.129> they<00:00:38.340> had<00:00:38.489> with<00:00:38.700> their<00:00:38.850> dog

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
that bond that they had with their dog

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.330 
that bond that they had with their dog

look at a clip about the dogs and how

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.940 
look at a clip about the dogs and how
the<00:01:12.180> dogs<00:01:12.479> are<00:01:12.659> trained<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.110> were<00:01:13.770> there's

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the dogs are trained but were there's

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.280 
the dogs are trained but were there's
some<00:01:14.130> dogs<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:14.670> shipped<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.479> they

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
some dogs that are shipped in and they

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.149 
some dogs that are shipped in and they
don't<00:01:17.130> pass<00:01:17.930> muster<00:01:18.930> yeah<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.619> would<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.770> but

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
don't pass muster yeah that would be but

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.920 
don't pass muster yeah that would be but
they<00:01:20.250> would<00:01:20.369> find<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.700> out<00:01:20.880> early<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
they would find that out early on in the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.050 
they would find that out early on in the
training<00:01:22.140> they<00:01:22.590> would<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.549> fact<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
training they would and in fact in the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.020 
training they would and in fact in the
specialized<00:01:25.049> search<00:01:25.560> dog<00:01:25.590> program<00:01:26.520> which<00:01:26.880> is

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
specialized search dog program which is

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.170 
specialized search dog program which is
when<00:01:27.509> they<00:01:27.600> search<00:01:28.170> for<00:01:28.200> things<00:01:28.530> off<00:01:28.710> leash

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
when they search for things off leash

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.429 
when they search for things off leash
the<00:01:30.180> handlers<00:01:30.509> are<00:01:30.600> actually<00:01:30.869> given<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.140> dogs

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
the handlers are actually given to dogs

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.130 
the handlers are actually given to dogs
and<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.520> they<00:01:32.670> try<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.850> see<00:01:33.060> which<00:01:33.240> one<00:01:33.479> works

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
and and they try to see which one works

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.319 
and and they try to see which one works
best<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.100> one<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.340> them<00:01:35.520> may<00:01:35.700> just

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
best and and one of them may just

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.249 
best and and one of them may just
they're<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:36.509> because<00:01:36.810> there<00:01:36.930> has<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.140> be

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
they're just because there has to be

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.140 
they're just because there has to be
that<00:01:37.380> connection<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.490> they<00:01:38.970> basically

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
that connection and so they basically

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.600 
that connection and so they basically
