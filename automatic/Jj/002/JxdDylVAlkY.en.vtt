00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
explain to you guys the only things I

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.539 
explain to you guys the only things I
don't<00:01:05.489> really<00:01:06.950> important<00:01:07.950> thing<00:01:08.340> is

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
don't really important thing is

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.460 
don't really important thing is
skeletons<00:01:09.330> just<00:01:09.420> because<00:01:09.900> they<00:01:10.140> don't<00:01:10.320> really

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
skeletons just because they don't really

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.469 
skeletons just because they don't really
have<00:01:10.740> blood<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.100> mean<00:01:11.400> they're<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:11.880> made<00:01:12.299> out

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
have blood I mean they're just made out

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.090 
have blood I mean they're just made out
of<00:01:12.510> bones<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.140> think<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.500> makes<00:01:13.710> sense<00:01:13.979> so

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
of bones I think that makes sense so

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.530 
of bones I think that makes sense so
it's<00:01:14.220> kind<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:14.700> realistic<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.509> that

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
it's kind of like realistic and that

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.899 
it's kind of like realistic and that
sort<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.930> sense<00:01:16.140> as<00:01:16.740> well<00:01:17.009> as<00:01:17.100> skeleton<00:01:17.520> horses

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
sort of sense as well as skeleton horses

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.359 
sort of sense as well as skeleton horses
so<00:01:18.119> if<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.840> plan<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.080> slaying<00:01:19.680> your<00:01:19.770> horse<00:01:20.130> you

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
so if you plan on slaying your horse you

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.719 
so if you plan on slaying your horse you
will<00:01:20.610> not<00:01:20.939> get<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.390> pleasing<00:01:21.900> look<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:23.040> blood

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
will not get the pleasing look of blood

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.399 
will not get the pleasing look of blood
going<00:01:23.939> everywhere<00:01:24.150> where<00:01:24.630> as<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.869> hit<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.170> pig

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
going everywhere where as I hit this pig

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.870 
going everywhere where as I hit this pig
you<00:01:25.530> know<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.799> guy<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.009> he's<00:01:26.369> filled<00:01:26.610> up<00:01:26.790> with

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
you know this guy is he's filled up with

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.219 
you know this guy is he's filled up with
blood<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.150> can<00:01:27.299> see<00:01:27.390> little<00:01:27.570> blood<00:01:27.840> chunks

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
blood you can see little blood chunks

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.380 
blood you can see little blood chunks
will<00:01:28.890> come<00:01:29.100> out<00:01:29.250> every<00:01:29.610> time<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:29.850> hit<00:01:30.090> him<00:01:30.210> so

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
will come out every time I hit him so

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.899 
will come out every time I hit him so
each<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.290> could<00:01:31.439> see<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.860> just<00:01:31.890> shoots<00:01:32.759> out

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
each it you could see it just shoots out

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.580 
each it you could see it just shoots out
blood<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.180> again<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.900> doesn't<00:01:34.049> really<00:01:34.140> add<00:01:34.290> in

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
blood and again it doesn't really add in

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.749 
blood and again it doesn't really add in
much<00:01:34.770> but<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:35.340> something<00:01:35.640> that's

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
much but it's just like something that's

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.100 
much but it's just like something that's
a<00:01:35.790> little<00:01:35.880> bit<00:01:36.030> aesthetically<00:01:36.600> pleasing<00:01:36.630> like

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
a little bit aesthetically pleasing like

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.200 
a little bit aesthetically pleasing like
it<00:01:37.259> looks<00:01:37.470> nicer<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.979> hit<00:01:38.130> something<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.700> see

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it looks nicer to hit something and see

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.640 
it looks nicer to hit something and see
blood<00:01:39.420> kind<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.840> squirting<00:01:40.170> out<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.500> rather

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
blood kind of squirting out of it rather

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.280 
blood kind of squirting out of it rather
than<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:40.979> seeing<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.430> go<00:01:41.579> all<00:01:41.759> red<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.930> got

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
than just seeing it go all red so I got

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.719 
than just seeing it go all red so I got
a<00:01:43.320> bunch<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.619> moms<00:01:43.829> here<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.310> we<00:01:44.430> could<00:01:44.579> use

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
a bunch of moms here that we could use

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.370 
a bunch of moms here that we could use
this<00:01:44.850> add-on<00:01:45.090> like<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.600> do<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:45.930> chickens

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
this add-on like you do it on chickens

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.960 
this add-on like you do it on chickens
you<00:01:46.950> hit<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> chick<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.490> you'll<00:01:47.610> see<00:01:47.729> blood

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
you hit a chick and you'll see blood

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.960 
you hit a chick and you'll see blood
goes<00:01:48.210> everywhere<00:01:48.570> check<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.409> out<00:01:49.619> guys

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
goes everywhere check this out guys

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.580 
goes everywhere check this out guys
squids<00:01:50.970> even<00:01:51.299> bleed<00:01:51.509> it's<00:01:51.750> pretty<00:01:51.960> amazing

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
squids even bleed it's pretty amazing

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.069

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.699 
well it might be the same as regular
zombies<00:02:27.100> but<00:02:27.520> we'll<00:02:27.700> say<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:29.170> if<00:02:29.350> we<00:02:29.530> hit<00:02:29.680> a

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
zombies but we'll say so if we hit a

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.890

everything<00:04:49.330> else<00:04:49.479> looks<00:04:49.690> exactly<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.259> same

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
everything else looks exactly the same

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.950 
everything else looks exactly the same
and<00:04:50.860> I'm<00:04:51.550> pretty<00:04:51.850> sure<00:04:52.090> if<00:04:52.300> it's<00:04:52.479> used<00:04:52.690> against

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
and I'm pretty sure if it's used against

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.330 
and I'm pretty sure if it's used against
a<00:04:53.080> player<00:04:53.229> there's<00:04:53.530> like<00:04:53.680> a<00:04:53.710> lot<00:04:53.949> more<00:04:54.100> blood

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
a player there's like a lot more blood

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.060 
a player there's like a lot more blood
