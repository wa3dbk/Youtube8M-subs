00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.809
 Christmas 2013 will be an amazing Christmas 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:13.730
 a little different from the usual but also 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.209
 traditional as we like the day of 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.430
 Christmas 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.500
 we talk to our queen goes cha 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.940
 to lifesize good morning at home good morning 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.530
 maddalena today a table a little outside 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.200
 from the canons of tradition above all 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:32.540
 a table without series for a buffet 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:34.550
 Christmas in the sense that it is often thought 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.170
 that to give the Christmas lunch or the 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.239
 Eve dinner at home if you 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.460
 must have a large table with 26 and 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.870
 instead if you have a small house anyway 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.730
 desire to receive but now a fool 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.980
 ruin you can challenge yourself with a 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.410
 buffet 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.380
 we really cooked the eggs 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.570
 the English we cooked for real 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.640
 this rapid cream with leeks inside 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.370
 and let's see if they hear the potatoes 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.800
 perfume do not know if we hear the 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.210
 perfume I do n't know if they hear it and then 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.670
 served with this parmesan wafer 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.650
 to us over the pomegranate to give a 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.660
 touch of red at this table the buffet 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.660
 we did it total white 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.580
 we turn the page and go to see the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.580
 page with the formal table 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.909
 this time we are at the table 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.319
 traditional christmas vanity fair 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:31.810
 with traditional saba saba they are a bit 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.979
 puzzled too red but no look 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.840
 maddalena and the elements of the 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.549
 tradition there are points because we have 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.170
 the tablecloth then especially one 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.090
 class situation so I don't think so 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.340
 the one we saw standing before 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.840
 here every seated diner is there 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.209
 even the three glasses the 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.890
 plate with gold cutlery then 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:49.990
 the elements of tradition are there 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.240
 maybe we played a little mixing 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.189
 color giving an accent a little more vanity 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.810
 with the tartan tablecloth it should 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:01.329
 be the color of the year 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.220
 it's not difficult if you use the 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.350
 thought lines I thought of 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.840
 mix different objects to get 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.820
 a 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.460
 large red wire conductor with the 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.600
 color if it is not a served however 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.630
 with 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.270
 many things matched you have to try to 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.670
 then choose or select party 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.620
 in form a color or maybe a certain one 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.330
 type of decoration because to mix both 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.340
 forms that colors really requires 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.959
 so much skill 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.050
 I didn't do the centerpiece but there 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.660
 most are all the flowers are the candles in the 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.780
 body with class of landro but two 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.379
 light points placed with the pine cone and also the 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.480
 napkin and less classic while remaining 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.160
 a cloth napkin because they have a 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.319
 sign against which is projected above 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.980
 many little details that will make the 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.709
 difference 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.420
 and before wishing you merry Christmas and good 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.629
 fun even with your tables 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.280
 I would say three tips to make no mistake if 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.170
 you have a figure that resumes panic 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.230
 first look at these three things 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.000
 the fabric tablecloths and napkins also 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.120
 if of different colors they must have a 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.980
 identical or otherwise combined fabric 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.110
 how to create a bit of rigor in one 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.340
 table so that it does not look messy 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.440
 at first glance 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.390
 if the table is as formal as this 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.340
 choose to use a table mat 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.849
 will help you create a little bit of 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.470
 geometry and finally the glasses not used 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.269
 never more than three is because really 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.940
 difficult to match them and if you want 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.400
 mix the types you get at least 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.430
 equal transparent color for not 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.790
 make mistakes or in my case red 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.480
 best wishes 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:45.150
 see how they pass all the pass 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:50.630
 our words and I see you taste the 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.630
 my tears within the rain from the end
