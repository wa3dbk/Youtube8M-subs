00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.460
 you can see 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:05.420
 well now we will see our materials 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.350
 of seed 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.979

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.390

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.960
 would be a bear Cadiz equal thing well 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.400
 let's remember how the voice is made 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.400
 We expected to make sticks 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:31.990
 - here, here we have a sickle 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.990
 stone 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:41.470
 well and I slipped the fucking good Maria 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.840
 let's start let's put the earth as 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.140
 we want, I'll put it to my 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.140
 way 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.500
 forgive for the lag aso 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.190
 you do not leave the place we always have to 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:02.300
 leave room for the water to run 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.300
 the way 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.700
 here 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.700
 cat 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:37.430
 perfect good we already have our land 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.400
 placed 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.909
 and now we are going to put it here there is no 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.909
 affair 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.720
 and now what we read what we should 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.710
 to do is with the voice 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.710
 right click 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.560
 to the earth 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:17.220
 well excellent and now with the seeds 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.000
 that I do not think that reaches me we're going to 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.000
 place them 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:31.039
 As you can see I finished putting them 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:35.440
 Well now I will explain one thing 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:39.259
 which is very important when they kill the 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:43.699
 skeletons that have arrows when they 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:47.320
 they throw bones they put it here and they're going to 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:50.050
 get out this bone powder 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.530
 that this serves to make it grow more 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.530
 Quick 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.620
 but if you do not have it, it will grow slowly 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.910
 but it's going to grow 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.910
 rest assured that they grow 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.240
 in charleston greece then 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.700
 Well I hope you liked it and we 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.720
 we see in another next chapter of 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.720
