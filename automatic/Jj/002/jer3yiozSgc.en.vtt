00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.610
 how good this time 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.910
 I bring a tutorial to install web 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.800
 to Nestor the successor of Cuevana which is a 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.600
 service of an application that we 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.920
 It offers the possibility of connecting us to 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.670
 cuevana tv service 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.670
 through we can see 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.600
 we can see what all the p 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.559
 and series 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.079
 since they did not stay some of 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.180
 our movies 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.360
 but how it works as a cave works 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.120
 the following way connects to the 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.730
 torrent servers and streams 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.260
 of everything you are storing of this 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.760
 way we can see them not only 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.490
 we have to download it but we can 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.310
 see her directly 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.520
 well to start with these first 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.400
 we have to have for facilities 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.290
 we have to extend wine installed already 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.290
 what cave is not for linux 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.110
 in this case to install wine we enter 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.690
 to guayana the point of heretic 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.400
 we have download and in download to 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.090
 use let's download the package 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:31.490
 that we ingest in this case we are going to lower 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:34.750
 that is the theme for the mount a 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.360
 pancake of 14 04 of that 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.610
 discharge 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.170
 tells me what are the repositories to 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.080
 that the repository 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.130
 that the ppa is here after adding what 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.130
 we do the sudoku 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.810
 decide 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.649
 I'm not going to do it for the reason that 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:04.479
 I catch installed then a sub apt-get 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:14.470
 octane to update the repositories 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:17.870
 and at the end your app that install wine 1.7 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.580
 at the end the installation we will when 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.370
 finalize that we will have installed 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.890
 completely what is uruguay now 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.280
 let's go through the application we enter 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.280
 cuevana tv 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:39.790
 an experience that we are going to download 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:46.209
 have to download beta for windows 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.209
 it will resend us to what it is 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.310
 and we will have download in our 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.720
 computer 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.210

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.690
 after downloading I have 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.340
 previously downloaded 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.340
 what we do is 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:12.500
 in downloads in this cave these 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.010
 Christians and law open with a 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.080
 troubleshooter already when they load 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.930
 we do the full installation and 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.980
 finish we just have to create a 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.980

 bad 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:45.009
 first and then already when the 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:45.009
 episode 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.960

 when I come here that says 4 of 36 

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:07.559
 customers those are the two seeds to 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.240
 just like when we are loading a 

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:10.889
 bull are the clients which is being 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.619
 connecting the team right now is 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:16.940
 downloading the buffer to thus 

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:20.030
 do it what is a 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.860
 a reproduction without pause this 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.840
 reproduction of the no pause will depend 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.840
 a lot of our internet connection 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.810
 for windows users the 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:34.350
 installation is easy only they should 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:39.350
 enter cuevana.tv 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.350
 to download reopen what is the 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:52.060
 the file will download and they will 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:54.370
 proceed to install and in case 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.330
 have the active fire have to give 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.060
 authorization 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.069
 to go through the fire since it is not a 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.050
 application that is to look for topic 

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:04.479
 reproduce what you have locally 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:07.990
 but an application that reproduces what 

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:10.719
 that is in light on outside in the cloud and 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.550
 the streaming here we can see I have not 

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:15.819
 done absolutely nothing I have not put 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.860
 to upload it but you already recognize me that the 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:20.120
 computer is in Spanish 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.340
 and at once 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:27.320
 and he puts the subtitles 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:28.970
 slice is an excellent application and it is 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.070
 who has come to save us 

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:34.240
 lovers of the series series already 

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:37.960
 we won the elections so 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.960
 no mana to add
