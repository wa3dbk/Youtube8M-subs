trigger remote speedlights that's also
layered<00:00:25.769> light<00:00:26.099> but<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.699> also<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.660> need<00:00:27.900> to

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
layered light but you also you need to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.169 
layered light but you also you need to
be<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.130> course<00:00:29.160> fully<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.730> line<00:00:29.910> with

be this is of course fully in line with
the<00:00:30.269> premise<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.260> need<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.529> see<00:00:31.679> your

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
the premise of you need to see your

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.910 
the premise of you need to see your
photographs<00:00:32.460> as<00:00:32.790> what<00:00:33.570> they<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:34.079> be<00:00:34.410> versus

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
photographs as what they can be versus

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.040 
photographs as what they can be versus
what<00:00:35.130> your<00:00:35.309> eyeballs<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:36.270> see<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.780> mean<00:00:36.930> your

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
what your eyeballs can see I mean your

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.229 
what your eyeballs can see I mean your
camera<00:00:37.620> as<00:00:37.800> I've<00:00:38.010> said<00:00:38.160> repeatedly<00:00:38.309> as<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> time

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
camera as I've said repeatedly as a time

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.600 
camera as I've said repeatedly as a time
machine<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.440> need<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.890> start<00:00:41.129> thinking<00:00:41.190> in

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
machine so you need to start thinking in

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.049 
machine so you need to start thinking in
terms<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:42.090> time<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:43.070> layering<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.399> light<00:00:44.670> not

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
terms of time and layering of light not

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.630 
terms of time and layering of light not
just<00:00:45.300> exposure<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.440> composition<00:00:47.280> which<00:00:47.460> are

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
just exposure and composition which are

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.819 
just exposure and composition which are
obviously<00:00:47.760> incredibly<00:00:48.329> important<00:00:48.989> but<00:00:49.200> you

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
obviously incredibly important but you

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.010 
obviously incredibly important but you
know<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.100> layering<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.670> light<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.809> mean

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
know the layering of light I mean

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.630 
know the layering of light I mean
obviously<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.649> one<00:00:52.860> layer<00:00:53.039> here<00:00:53.460> that

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
obviously I have one layer here that

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.330 
obviously I have one layer here that
I've<00:00:53.760> actually<00:00:53.969> checked<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.770> simplex

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
I've actually checked for it's a simplex

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.529 
I've actually checked for it's a simplex
fiber<00:00:56.640> optics<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.449> glued<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.910> Nikon<00:00:59.910> body<00:01:00.239> back

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
fiber optics I glued a Nikon body back

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.630 
fiber optics I glued a Nikon body back
together<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.199> essentially<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.309> shell

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
together it's essentially just a shell

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.469 
together it's essentially just a shell
there's<00:01:03.059> nothing<00:01:03.420> inside<00:01:03.650> whatsoever<00:01:04.650> and

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
there's nothing inside whatsoever and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.670 
there's nothing inside whatsoever and
obviously<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.570> turned<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.409> light<00:01:07.650> off

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
obviously I turned this light off

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.990 
obviously I turned this light off
overhead<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.460> i<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:08.790> for

asking<00:01:14.010> well<00:01:14.159> why<00:01:14.400> iso<00:01:15.060> 200<00:01:15.689> vs<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:17.009> know

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
asking well why iso 200 vs you know

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.890 
asking well why iso 200 vs you know
you're<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.369> complete<00:01:17.670> pitch<00:01:18.030> dark<00:01:18.390> well<00:01:18.659> the

you're in complete pitch dark well the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.020 
you're in complete pitch dark well the

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
that i have to actually use my brushes

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
whatever it is fiber optics gives me

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.819 
whatever it is fiber optics gives me
more<00:01:28.770> latitude<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.820> paint<00:01:30.150> my<00:01:30.840> picture<00:01:31.290> so

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
more latitude to paint my picture so

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.700 
more latitude to paint my picture so
that's<00:01:31.979> why<00:01:32.159> i'm<00:01:32.280> using<00:01:32.610> iso<00:01:33.060> 200<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.079> what<00:01:34.680> i

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
that's why i'm using iso 200 and what i

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.560 
that's why i'm using iso 200 and what i
was<00:01:34.920> doing<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.490> do<00:01:35.670> you'll<00:01:35.850> see<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.150> download

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
was doing and do you'll see the download

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.749 
was doing and do you'll see the download
link<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.990> below<00:01:37.110> i<00:01:37.650> said<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.729> a

link to below i said this is a

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.670 
link to below i said this is a
five-minute<00:01:39.060> setup<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.930> mean<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.380> imagine

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
five-minute setup I mean just imagine

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.010 
five-minute setup I mean just imagine
what<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.400> could<00:01:41.579> do<00:01:41.759> if<00:01:42.000> you've<00:01:42.150> got<00:01:42.390> 20

what you could do if you've got 20

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.749 
what you could do if you've got 20
minutes<00:01:43.049> or<00:01:43.470> half<00:01:43.590> an<00:01:43.770> hour<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.130> set<00:01:44.340> up<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.549> shot

be thinking not only in terms of

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.190 
be thinking not only in terms of
composition<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.360> know<00:01:48.509> being<00:01:48.659> creative

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
composition and you know being creative

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.249 
composition and you know being creative
and<00:01:49.290> what<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.680> can<00:01:49.860> do<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.430> let<00:01:50.909> me<00:01:51.899> see<00:01:52.079> if<00:01:52.140> I

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
and what you can do and let me see if I

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.020 
and what you can do and let me see if I
can<00:01:52.439> bring<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.310> up<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.670> don't<00:01:53.820> know<00:01:53.909> if<00:01:53.970> you

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
can bring this up I don't know if you

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.289 
can bring this up I don't know if you
can<00:01:54.149> see<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:54.570> i'll<00:01:54.689> have<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.079> download

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
can see it but i'll have the download

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.100 
can see it but i'll have the download
link<00:01:57.299> below<00:01:57.540> but<00:01:59.000> you<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.180> see<00:02:00.390> what<00:02:00.719> we<00:02:00.899> have

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
link below but you can see what we have

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.990 
link below but you can see what we have
here<00:02:01.170> but<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:02.280> need<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.460> be<00:02:02.490> thinking<00:02:02.579> in

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
here but you need to be thinking in

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.240 
here but you need to be thinking in
terms<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.600> layering<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.560> effects<00:02:05.100> so

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
terms of the layering of the effects so

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.039 
terms of the layering of the effects so
your<00:02:05.430> composition<00:02:06.180> you're<00:02:06.450> like<00:02:06.600> oh<00:02:06.750> that's

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
your composition you're like oh that's

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.359 
your composition you're like oh that's
too<00:02:07.229> much<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.799> know<00:02:07.860> i<00:02:07.890> need<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.190> get<00:02:08.310> my

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
too much you know i need to get my

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.090 
too much you know i need to get my
exposure<00:02:08.849> right<00:02:09.209> well<00:02:09.899> when<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.229> comes<00:02:10.410> to

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
exposure right well when it comes to

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.040 
exposure right well when it comes to
you<00:02:11.520> know<00:02:11.610> time<00:02:11.850> exposures<00:02:12.480> like<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.870> you

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
you know time exposures like this you

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.050 
you know time exposures like this you
experiment<00:02:13.530> around<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:14.040> little<00:02:14.190> bit<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.610> after

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
experiment around a little bit and after

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.390 
experiment around a little bit and after
you<00:02:15.780> know<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.930> few<00:02:16.170> days<00:02:16.380> or<00:02:16.770> even<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.250> know<00:02:17.280> a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
you know a few days or even you know a

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.490 
you know a few days or even you know a
few<00:02:17.670> weeks<00:02:17.910> at<00:02:18.120> most<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.720> just<00:02:18.900> putzing<00:02:19.170> around

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
few weeks at most of just putzing around

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.040 
few weeks at most of just putzing around
and<00:02:20.430> you'll<00:02:20.610> actually<00:02:20.790> get<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.090> feel<00:02:21.360> for<00:02:21.810> like

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
and you'll actually get a feel for like

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.570 
and you'll actually get a feel for like
well<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.260> have<00:02:22.410> too<00:02:22.560> much<00:02:22.590> center<00:02:23.100> like<00:02:23.310> here's

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
well I have too much center like here's

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.610 
well I have too much center like here's
what<00:02:23.820> I<00:02:23.850> need<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.090> do<00:02:24.330> I've<00:02:24.960> got<00:02:25.110> too<00:02:25.260> much<00:02:25.380> to

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
what I need to do I've got too much to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.800 
what I need to do I've got too much to
burn<00:02:26.040> in-<00:02:26.730> enter<00:02:27.030> my<00:02:27.180> image<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:27.660> what<00:02:27.750> I'm

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
burn in- enter my image so what I'm

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.270 
burn in- enter my image so what I'm
going<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.960> do<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.260> I'm<00:02:28.410> going<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.620> raise<00:02:28.950> my

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
going to do is I'm going to raise my

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.510 
going to do is I'm going to raise my
aperture<00:02:29.640> up<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:30.930> know<00:02:31.080> 22<00:02:31.530> or<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.400> know

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
aperture up to you know 22 or you know

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.910 
aperture up to you know 22 or you know
higher<00:02:33.740> drop<00:02:34.740> my<00:02:34.890> iso<00:02:35.370> down<00:02:35.670> lower<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.920> I'm

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
higher drop my iso down lower and I'm

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.890 
higher drop my iso down lower and I'm
going<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.220> change<00:02:38.610> my<00:02:38.760> shutter<00:02:39.150> speed<00:02:39.240> up<00:02:39.720> or

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
going to change my shutter speed up or

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.810 
going to change my shutter speed up or
down<00:02:40.050> a<00:02:40.080> little<00:02:40.320> bit<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.130> gives<00:02:41.610> me

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
down a little bit so that gives me

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.310 
down a little bit so that gives me
enough<00:02:41.850> time<00:02:42.030> would<00:02:42.570> have<00:02:42.690> actually<00:02:42.810> done<00:02:43.080> the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
enough time would have actually done the

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.070 
enough time would have actually done the
shot<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.950> layered<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.760> light<00:02:44.940> by<00:02:45.540> obviously

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
shot is layered the light by obviously

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.200 
shot is layered the light by obviously
exposing<00:02:46.920> for<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.130> blue<00:02:47.250> fiber<00:02:47.520> optics<00:02:48.030> but

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
exposing for the blue fiber optics but

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.830 
exposing for the blue fiber optics but
actually<00:02:48.960> painting<00:02:49.410> with<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:49.830> flashlight<00:02:50.840> you

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
actually painting with a flashlight you

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.390 
actually painting with a flashlight you
can<00:02:51.990> actually<00:02:52.110> do<00:02:52.380> with<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.650> speed<00:02:52.950> light<00:02:53.220> on

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
can actually do with the speed light on

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.190 
can actually do with the speed light on
strobe<00:02:53.820> mode<00:02:54.120> but<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.450> mean<00:02:54.660> that's<00:02:54.780> too<00:02:55.020> much

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
strobe mode but I mean that's too much

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.390 
strobe mode but I mean that's too much
and<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.500> wanted<00:02:55.710> to<00:02:55.800> actually<00:02:55.920> leave<00:02:56.250> my

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
and I wanted to actually leave my

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.030 
and I wanted to actually leave my
background<00:02:57.410> unexposed<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.770> then<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.890> have<00:02:59.010> to

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
background unexposed and then I have to

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.460 
background unexposed and then I have to
edit<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.580> in<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.820> heavily<00:03:00.360> in<00:03:00.540> Photoshop<00:03:01.140> so

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
edit it in a heavily in Photoshop so

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.770 
edit it in a heavily in Photoshop so
always<00:03:02.160> be<00:03:02.310> thinking<00:03:02.640> in<00:03:02.940> terms<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.360> layering

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
always be thinking in terms of layering

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.980 
always be thinking in terms of layering
your<00:03:03.960> light<00:03:04.320> I<00:03:04.650> mean<00:03:05.030> you<00:03:06.030> know<00:03:06.150> fill<00:03:06.420> flash<00:03:06.600> is

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
your light I mean you know fill flash is

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.230 
your light I mean you know fill flash is
layering<00:03:07.230> multiple<00:03:08.160> strobes<00:03:08.490> or<00:03:08.880> multiple

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
layering multiple strobes or multiple

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.240 
layering multiple strobes or multiple
speed<00:03:09.510> lights<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.170> slave<00:03:10.410> mode<00:03:10.740> is<00:03:10.980> layering

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
speed lights and slave mode is layering

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.160 
speed lights and slave mode is layering
I<00:03:11.700> mean<00:03:11.850> this<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.060> layering<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.900> mean<00:03:13.050> I'm

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
I mean this is layering I mean I'm

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.110 
I mean this is layering I mean I'm
exposing<00:03:13.590> for<00:03:13.920> this<00:03:14.040> from<00:03:14.310> checking<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.000> then

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
exposing for this from checking and then

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.240 
exposing for this from checking and then
what<00:03:15.300> I'm<00:03:15.390> doing<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:15.810> I'm<00:03:16.020> actually<00:03:16.530> painting

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
what I'm doing is I'm actually painting

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.980 
what I'm doing is I'm actually painting
the<00:03:18.180> outline<00:03:18.570> of<00:03:18.600> my<00:03:18.840> camera<00:03:19.350> just<00:03:19.560> like<00:03:20.310> this

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
the outline of my camera just like this

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.720 
the outline of my camera just like this
checking<00:03:21.990> and<00:03:22.350> actually<00:03:22.980> what<00:03:23.280> I've<00:03:23.400> done<00:03:23.580> is

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
checking and actually what I've done is

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.460 
checking and actually what I've done is
I've<00:03:23.850> used<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.570> lights<00:03:24.840> have<00:03:25.080> used<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.350> one

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
I've used to lights have used the one

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.530 
I've used to lights have used the one
hand<00:03:25.710> held<00:03:25.920> here<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.490> I've<00:03:26.910> use<00:03:27.060> another<00:03:27.390> one

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
hand held here and I've use another one

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.180 
hand held here and I've use another one
way<00:03:27.870> over<00:03:28.050> here<00:03:28.320> on<00:03:28.410> this<00:03:28.530> side<00:03:28.590> so<00:03:28.800> I'm<00:03:29.040> able

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
way over here on this side so I'm able

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.970 
way over here on this side so I'm able
to<00:03:29.310> illuminate<00:03:29.580> this<00:03:30.000> part<00:03:30.330> of<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.480> body<00:03:30.690> and

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
to illuminate this part of the body and

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.590 
to illuminate this part of the body and
that's<00:03:31.980> just<00:03:32.190> what<00:03:32.460> I<00:03:32.490> wanted<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:32.970> do<00:03:33.210> I<00:03:33.240> mean

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
that's just what I wanted to do I mean

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
later i did this she's like 15 years ago

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.070 
later i did this she's like 15 years ago
i<00:04:01.920> did<00:04:02.160> that<00:04:02.310> with<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.460> another<00:04:03.270> nikon<00:04:03.690> DSLR

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
i did that with a another nikon DSLR

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.510 
i did that with a another nikon DSLR
took<00:04:04.260> a<00:04:04.320> picture<00:04:04.530> of<00:04:04.680> someone<00:04:04.920> looking

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
took a picture of someone looking

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.620 
took a picture of someone looking
through<00:04:05.580> the<00:04:05.790> back<00:04:05.940> of<00:04:05.970> it<00:04:06.330> and<00:04:06.360> you<00:04:06.480> could

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
through the back of it and you could

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.690 
through the back of it and you could
actually<00:04:06.660> see<00:04:06.960> their<00:04:07.260> smile<00:04:07.560> all<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.340> way

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
actually see their smile all the way

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.550 
actually see their smile all the way
through<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.240> the<00:04:09.480> front<00:04:09.750> hole<00:04:09.960> of<00:04:10.080> the<00:04:10.200> camera

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
through the the front hole of the camera

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.050 
through the the front hole of the camera
because<00:04:10.800> the<00:04:10.920> camera<00:04:11.250> was<00:04:11.340> completely<00:04:11.850> gutted

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
because the camera was completely gutted

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.290 
because the camera was completely gutted
so<00:04:12.480> anyway<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.830> point<00:04:14.040> is<00:04:14.310> is<00:04:14.670> that<00:04:14.700> one<00:04:15.270> of

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
so anyway the point is is that one of

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.849 
so anyway the point is is that one of
the<00:04:15.450> really<00:04:15.660> key<00:04:16.049> fundamental<00:04:16.680> is<00:04:16.770> a

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
the really key fundamental is a

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.280 
the really key fundamental is a
professional<00:04:17.310> photography<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.090> basically<00:04:18.960> a

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
professional photography and basically a

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.900 
professional photography and basically a
hundred<00:04:19.950> percent<00:04:20.070> of<00:04:20.430> all<00:04:20.520> studio

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
hundred percent of all studio

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.930 
hundred percent of all studio
photography<00:04:21.660> is<00:04:21.870> light<00:04:22.200> layer

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
photography is light layer

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.480 
photography is light layer
people<00:04:23.750> think<00:04:23.930> of<00:04:24.140> terms<00:04:24.530> of<00:04:24.890> illumination

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
people think of terms of illumination

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.160 
people think of terms of illumination
well<00:04:25.820> I<00:04:25.850> need<00:04:26.030> to<00:04:26.150> eliminate<00:04:26.210> this<00:04:26.690> or<00:04:26.990> that

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
well I need to eliminate this or that

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.500 
well I need to eliminate this or that
and<00:04:27.200> well<00:04:28.100> obviously<00:04:28.430> that's<00:04:28.730> the<00:04:28.940> case<00:04:29.150> but

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
and well obviously that's the case but

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.180 
and well obviously that's the case but
you<00:04:29.630> got<00:04:29.900> to<00:04:29.930> think<00:04:30.290> in<00:04:30.470> terms<00:04:30.500> of<00:04:30.890> layering

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
you got to think in terms of layering

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.300 
you got to think in terms of layering
you<00:04:32.030> know<00:04:32.120> like<00:04:32.300> one<00:04:32.600> gel<00:04:32.990> to<00:04:33.440> simulate

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
you know like one gel to simulate

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.600 
you know like one gel to simulate
sunrise<00:04:35.240> or<00:04:35.510> sunset<00:04:35.740> another<00:04:36.740> jail<00:04:37.070> fulfill

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
sunrise or sunset another jail fulfill
