every<00:00:28.539> single<00:00:28.810> wig<00:00:29.230> I<00:00:29.560> think<00:00:29.589> except<00:00:30.400> for<00:00:30.609> one

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
every single wig I think except for one

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.990 
every single wig I think except for one
I<00:00:31.089> didn't<00:00:31.929> really<00:00:32.199> want<00:00:32.410> to<00:00:32.500> pay<00:00:32.769> $51<00:00:33.730> but<00:00:33.910> it

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
I didn't really want to pay $51 but it

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.390 
I didn't really want to pay $51 but it
was<00:00:34.120> only<00:00:34.239> one<00:00:34.480> left<00:00:34.809> and<00:00:35.650> it<00:00:35.769> was<00:00:35.920> a<00:00:35.949> one<00:00:36.190> beat

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:45.510 
30 so and i believe it's about 20 inches
and<00:00:39.850> it<00:00:40.180> was<00:00:40.480> the<00:00:41.610> GLS<00:00:43.379> 14<00:00:44.379> of<00:00:44.530> things<00:00:44.770> so
