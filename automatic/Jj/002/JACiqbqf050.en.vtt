00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.049
 sugar 100 grams 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:10.279
 enough water 

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:13.279
 a few drops of lemon 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:18.609
 in a saucepan, pour a little water in quantity 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.779
 add the sugar and a few drops of lemon 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.570
 the acidity of the lemon favors the caramelization process 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.080
 as the mixture warms up you will see that the sugar melts 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.420
 in the water and gradually becomes denser 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.380
 much water has evaporated and the sugar is in greater quantities than 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.380
 water 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.870
 to check the next stage of cooking you can do the so-called test 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.070
 of the fork 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.280
 but be careful not to burn yourself because cooked sugar reaches high 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.910
 temperatures 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.790
 dip the tips of the fork and helping yourself with wet fingers in the water 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.110
 cold pull the mixture 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.990
 if thin transparent threads are formed you have obtained the first stage of cooking 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.990
 of the sugar called son 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.350
 if you continue the culture instead of the trusts you will be able to shape the compound 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.120
 in dots with muses 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.120
 this cooking is called a bubble 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.730
 if the sugar hardens rapidly on the tips of the fork and breaks 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.850
 when you try to manipulate it it's called boxes 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.850
 is a French term meaning broken 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.640
 a few more seconds and the very hot sugar begins to take on a 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.640
 amber color is becoming caramel 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:31.929
 sugar is composed of carbon hydrogen and oxygen 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:34.689
 during the caramelization process 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.879
 progressively sheds hydrogen thus giving itself the caramel in 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.769
 final and oxidized sugar
