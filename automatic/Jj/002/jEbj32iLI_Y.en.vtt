 first of all, it 's very simple 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.910
 example if we move up to the part of 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.560

 read everything it offers and all this 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.260
 what it is now if there are clear words 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.270
 that all this is legal 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.380
 all these sponsored by microsoft 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:42.020
 it's not an internet program or something 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.020
 I do not know how to call pirate 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.040
 and good that we have a great variety of 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.610
 questions for example we recommend a 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.950
 friend that is an accuse the word and this 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.930
 it's silver and it's updated to cold 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.410
 obviously they give you 100 microsoft 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.230
 points 1 that tells us how to get bonuses 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.989

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.940
 this program is sponsored by xbox and 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:11.209
 this is a page managed by ai 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.099
 price on behalf of xbox xbox the words is 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.930
 a loyalty program sponsored by 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.519
 microsoft corporation as I had already had them 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.040
 that is, it is legal do not worry 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.109

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.880
 words continue buying things continue 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.560
 winning yes I know 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.600
 sometimes it takes a little while to deliver the 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.370
 points or if they have 20 obviously 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.449
 we will deliver until they join 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.550
 100 microsoft points 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.250
 now we go directly to the 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.880
 license transfer how it works 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.880
 this for example 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.320
 this for example have downloaded some 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.620
 games for example the most recent one that 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.210
 I downloaded was the space port and city 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.760
 impostors much to recommend it 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:53.150
 they are really very very bastards and well 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.560
 a little mother sincerely and good for 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.200
 example they want to spend a friend 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.610
 how they do it first of all they have 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.889
 that has to be a person of 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.919
 trust so very very trustworthy or that 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.650
 live near your house where you can 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:09.080
 see and everything and good the first step what 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.790
 you have to give your account to your friend and he 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.280
 you have to download it in your account 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.740
 of xbox once done that you have to 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.020
 go to good configuration is going to the 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.630
 interface first and until the last as 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.640
 can see has tabs the interface and 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.160
 good until the last they have the interface 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.310
 of configuration where we see the 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.590
 profile account and other mothers more than we 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.870
 remember good you consider and then 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.900
 from there they give in transfer of 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.090
 licenses activate it once activated and 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.900
 until they were all gone 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.030
 automatically without being downloaded 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.919
 nothing now the only thing they have to go is 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.639
 to the download history with that 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:46.880
 profile 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:49.490
 and download everything you want 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.180
 they give you a period of 24 hours to choose 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:55.430
 and they already give you limited time to 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.130
 downloading all like that weighs a lot of time 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.390
 not important anymore once selected already 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.640
 you know you have all the time of 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.380
 world to download such content or 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.390
 it does not matter anything else you have 24 hours 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.090
 to select what you want and 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.980
 add it to the download queue 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.920
 they are very easy you can pass everything 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:16.700

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:19.850

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.430
 download history you can pass 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.890

 season pass for eg profile 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.480
 they are exclusive to each profile this 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.690
 I even think that some gears of war do not 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.490

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.380
