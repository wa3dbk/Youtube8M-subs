00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.049
 I welcome you today video will be about 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.750
 Germans we have a new kia since time 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.110
 from time to time ask again how are we 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.080
 follow wrinkles and other intricacies 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.970
 so touch these topics and if you 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.029
 interesting then stay with me until 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.029
 the end 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.980
 before we get down to the nuances wanted 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.850
 general sounds 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.390
 the purpose here are the basics of makeup and 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.820
 this purpose is to make the face more 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.309
 fresh salty and of course more 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.580
 young with makeup can be reset 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.710
 a few years, but here I don’t have 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.960
 in view of the fact that at the same time weave summer 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.540
 a woman needs to do an average beauty 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.410
 it certainly looks inappropriate 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:59.750
 and even funny and people are just at the heart of the cache 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:02.059
 it is elegance and everything is minimal and so 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.210
 let's go to the nuances and the first 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.509
 the nuances here are well of course 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.950
 certain wrinkle correction for this 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.780
 special problems have a separate 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.229
 videos that you can watch on 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.180
 my channel here will repeat that you can 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.050
 use as such a means which 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.520
 will concealer to highlight wrinkles 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.840
 then a special pencil on 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.020
 silicone based 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.940
 I don’t have one now but tom 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.700
 video where just spoke about wrinkles 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.040
 It is shown applied directly to 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.580
 the car can be lightly finger in battle 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.619
 feather shade along the edges and after 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.939
 how the tool dries enough network 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.780
 with lemon pencil 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:47.060
 it is very important to put a tone on top 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.400
 important podgadat correctly tonal 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.990
 grandiosa makeup again because skin 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.130
 not so elastic 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.219
 ton 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.039
 the show is afraid harder can like extra 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.030
 exactly those kind of moments are zones 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.880
 can miss 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.880
 so you need to remove the creams 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.000
 more slab loose texture 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.959
 thinner which is easier 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.930
 distributed now for example show 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:17.810
 I have 2 tonal creams and so 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:21.849
 colors and the delux series they literally bring 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:25.310
 while throwing to show the difference 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:28.040
 I hope that imperceptibly let's go like this 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.250
 a little bit we will spread that is already visible before 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.560
 that he is more fluid more carpenters then 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.380
 there is he at risk to skin more 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.599
 dense layer 2 pcs anal cream he 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.549
 very light that's what is called flea 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.890
 visible just a very thin layer 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:46.459
 it can be quickly distributed easily 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.860
 thus creating a thin layer then 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.010
 either and at the base but with enough 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.200
 with a good disguise and it will be 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.690
 perfect makeup base for 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.980
 good skin because more dense 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.819
 tons he can already stress 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.780
 emphasize various troubles and 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.329
 wrinkles on the skin 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.280
 As for the powder, it is also very 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.420
 we put everything with a thin layer literally 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.450
 so transparent 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.180
 brush only one stroke of the brush 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.579
 so that all the instruments and not create 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.030
 some kind of mask effect on 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.859
 face 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.139
 that gas of this shadow is only used 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:29.329
 matte and satin shadows with sparkles 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:32.359
 iridescent or shimmer and no we don't 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.040
 use because it adds years 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.069
 on the contrary, we want to achieve the effect 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.210
 completely different as for shades 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.790
 here already 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.970
 and more pastel tones will fit no 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.480
 again bright screaming take 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:50.570
 bright blue glamorous pink some there 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.520
 the heyday of peacock feathers and other things 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.040
 togetherness wear i need this too 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.560
 add age using pastel 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.430
 shades and as for lipstick 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.140
 don't take it here either 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:07.040
 dark tones because dark tones like 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.160
 known add age you need 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.150
 clean more natural shades but 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.320
 it is desirable that these too were days 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.489
 pale and because pale shades they 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.380
 they also give me astounding and 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.500
 makeup makeup 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:25.280
 it's all the nuances that came to me now 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.410
 in the head that is it will repeat it 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.700
 wrinkle correction special remedy 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:34.130
 exists for this second it is with us 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.530
 tonal fluid cream do not choose 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.320
 then a thin layer of powder in no way 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.080
 case not fat do not need to make masks 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.120
 do you do moscow face 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.860
 further shadows are satin or matte and that 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.590
 touches shades then shades everything 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.990
 bed and the last item is labial 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.530
 lipstick that needs more natural 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.150
 shades 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.680
 not not dark but not pale and so if 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.330
