thinking the the color the pouch is
supposed<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.239> be<00:03:12.390> color-coded<00:03:12.690> however<00:03:13.290> it

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
supposed to be color-coded however it

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.289 
supposed to be color-coded however it
isn't<00:03:14.180> I've<00:03:15.180> seen<00:03:15.540> in<00:03:15.720> red<00:03:16.049> and<00:03:16.280> white<00:03:17.299> they

come in exactly the same color however

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.440
