 is actually represented by the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.110
 andrea always in terms of fighting and number 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.010
 and he has an idea 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.540
 As for the lack of scientific assurance, the parties were 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.590
 immediately followed the head and have a collection I understand that everyone likes 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.850
 of this event contracts for rape 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.840
 and then we have to really 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.950
 - is not for nothing 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.460
 the plants will be dragged from the clichés plants to the original title 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.520
 continental 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.970

 Big River Booster Collection The plants can stay in that conserved 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.770
 For centuries I will see this has to be carried out as a fumigant colander and 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.630
 wanted to leave environments leave communities the hybrid of insects and with endings 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:32.220
 This is the case of this specimen of ethanol, this is a specimen collected by calixto by 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.400
 it was so 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.259
 was the case of what happened 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.429
 the youth that the mail is there is clear that no one has to talk is 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.140
 be here 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.640
 indicated as a candidate what she could lie down 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.360
 it would have to be by people who are features the pre-carnival the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.140
 interim government the exemplar 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.030
 stays dry 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.850
 there is however the time harvest tata 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.850
 the number of 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.970
 will increase your instigation potentials 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:10.919
 the computation of liters per company for the information 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:15.139
 it is strange internet extremely other factors 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.669
 so so to be robbed in consideration all over the world for 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:21.770
 sugar and salt 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.999
 the whole study of biodiversity 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.999
 he takes care of the inter one of the factors 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:29.950
 finally 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.300
 the first time 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.690
 is the consultant the world 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.500
 he is very big vinícius makes a short warm time than we 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.630
 had been based on this history and more 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.080
 growth work 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.300
 of biodiversity on the planet 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.330
 currently the herbarium is consulted almost daily by researchers 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.730
