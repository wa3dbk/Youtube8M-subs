00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.200
 hello such good afternoon again 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.139
 greet today's ego on this occasion 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.869
 we are going to carry out a kind of work 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.410
 technical physics with the category group 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:19.890
 juvenile the pedagogical university the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.900
 same job is at the order of the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.640
 marco antonio am licensed teacher 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.830
 specialist in physical preparation 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.380
 sports training so let's go to 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.599
 see some elements some exercises that 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.970
 at this moment they seek to develop 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.560
 physical and technical part by way of 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.930
 heating 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.420
 we started separating the by groups in 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.880
 each group three four players each 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.460
 group with a ball and separated into 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.640
 front with a cone about 12 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.640
 meters 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.469
 the first exercise was driving and of 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.559
 return second exercise as we add 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:00.239
 a pass the player reaches the cone 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.860
 turn around the receipt pass and you 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.750
 I return to the one who will continue our 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.000
 remember that these works are of 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.430
 initiation are preparation for the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.229
 organism for an effort that is going to 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.229
 make higher 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.840
 the idea is another exercise now the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.759
 player drives trims change of 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.430
 address another address change and returns 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.259
 to drive in speed up to the cone 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.869
 he arrives there and makes a pass in the next 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.210
 player to the same ones we repeat cut 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.570
 change of speed again change of 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.869
 speed and speed the return here the idea 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.970
 is to work the technical part with a 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.750
 element that is important football or 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.750
 day that is the speed 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:56.350
 a more player variant moves in 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.090
 speed is turned receives a serve 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.590
 of band works the technique 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:05.859
 Control oriented we see the back 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.560
 speed until the cone pass and the other 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:13.500
 player moves without a ball 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.500
 when there is a return it controls 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.380
 driving 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.090
 half a turn the walk we add the 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.250
 technical work but we add a 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.810
 high difficulty which is the control 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.810
 after a throw-in 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.610
 let's make one more variant 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.379
 in which the player moves in 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.530
 speed and in the throw-in 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:46.319
 controls the return to the cone gives a pass 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.060
 but now he's going to get another serve and the 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.010
 returns from head add the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.349
 difficulty throw control 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.530
 oriented half a turn towards the cone 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:58.670
 pass and then after a pass 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.670
 I go back 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.780
 an exercise similar to previous but 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.200
 changing the roles 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.930
 first back player goes to 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.240
 return from head it moves towards the 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.450
 cone receives another long ball controls it 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.569
 and give the pass 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.190
 again we see it moving to the 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.769
 Half the way of the head pass 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.870
 it pings towards the cone the turn and controls 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.760
 the ball that came said back and 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.580
 I make the pass to another partner 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.300
 This series of works seeks to improve 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.800
 physical abilities but also the 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.160
 technical qualities of the player in 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.010
 diverse situations that resemble 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.959
 the reals always leaving the intensity 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.760
 is a determining factor and the speed 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.760
 of execution much more 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.050
 the last exercise always giving 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.420
 emphasis on technique and speed of 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.900
 execution the player how are we going 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.460
 observe will receive and returns from 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.790
 inner edge with both legs is 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:12.610
 moves at speed turns around 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.020
 control of the ball up the cone and I give 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.180
 step 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.709
 this is a series of samples of 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.770
 exercises that you can perform 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.440
 adding variants as I said 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.940
 previously resemble actions 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.580
 real game that has to be 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.500
 Thought control speed and 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.560
 technical actions that are used in the 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.840
 game with this we are going to stay 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.280
 hoping that they will continue to serve him in 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.620
 his practices I want to thank 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.360
 again to all the people who are 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.960
 subscribing to my channel and that is 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.940
 commenting I give them the opportunity and more 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.520
 I really want you to continue commenting on me 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.230
 keep asking for some kind of work and 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.350
 as long as time permits 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.210
 Well, I'm going to be doing the 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.340
 that are of benefit to their work 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.470
 its small schools so to the people 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.180
 from colombia to the people of ecuador 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.550
 paraguay and bolivia that is always 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.170
 pending a greeting to the distance 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.630
 same in Mexico to my friends from 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.009
 Argentina and we will continue working in 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.159
 post 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.809
 to be a small example for people 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:16.629
 that is developing the practice of 

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:19.270
 football as a means to develop 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:22.059
 skills in children and young people so 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.610
 here we stay see you next and 

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:28.169
 remember, let's work every day 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.169
 strongly to do anything
