 your side of Milan this book sends me the 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.170
 favor or juvenile the truth I liked 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.640
 I quite read it in one sitting 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.920
 he did very very fast on behalf of his 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.930
 contemporaries that I liked a lot and 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.490
 it kept me intrigued all the time 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.619
 I was reading 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.720
 Andrew Smith these other contemporaries 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.040
 that I've seen a lot of gp in the community of 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.420
 youtube that in English 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.800
 the truth I do not know for sure very well 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.840
 what it is about, I only know that it speaks of a 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.509
 little guy who goes to an internet I think 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.369
 suffer from bullying then it's like 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.860
 of that the truth I'm not sure social 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.750
 but now I will tell you more on the map 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.400
 last I want to see if I read function of 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.370
 giuliana value from the second book of 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.220
 the trilogy of 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.989
 that sent me no great house drama and 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.360
 so I'm curious to know 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.129
 what's up and I hope I can read it if it's 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.780
 I am in the world because it is not a world 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.090
 that I like too close 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.909
 makes very very pure pure the truth was a 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.379
 very cross world I liked quite 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:33.629
 finish it and start it really 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.250
 then yes yes yes they are nine 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.940
 books that I plan to read in this month and what 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.650
 they described although they are three but 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.060
 I really do not think I'm making any progress in the three 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.250
 I'm just going to read I hope the first 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.319
 because I want to wait for the ones from 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.780
 damn to give you time that leaves the 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.459
 last book and it's not quite like that 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.260
 it has been given that I need the 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.109
 last book I need a book then 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.180

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.099
 such you will see in the bass that was also 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.349
 with the readings but for now as 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.900
 these three books I have enough for 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.760
 take it and afterwards say that I will read from 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.890
 according to my world or what I have 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.430
 then want to read because if that is 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.830
 all of progress are the comments of 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:24.790
