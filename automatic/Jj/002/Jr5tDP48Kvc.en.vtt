got that bomb just
where<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.440> first<00:04:18.889> line<00:04:19.160> of<00:04:19.190> TNT<00:04:19.729> is<00:04:19.880> next<00:04:20.209> the

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
where the first line of TNT is next the

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.920 
where the first line of TNT is next the
piston<00:04:20.660> go<00:04:21.079> along<00:04:21.350> it<00:04:21.970> with<00:04:22.970> gravel<00:04:23.720> or<00:04:23.900> sand

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
piston go along it with gravel or sand

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.129 
piston go along it with gravel or sand
or<00:04:24.470> what<00:04:24.650> as<00:04:25.280> long<00:04:25.490> as<00:04:25.520> it<00:04:25.789> any<00:04:26.240> block<00:04:26.600> not

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
or what as long as it any block not

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.460 
or what as long as it any block not
anybody<00:04:27.380> or<00:04:28.220> any<00:04:28.370> block<00:04:28.639> affected<00:04:29.180> by<00:04:29.330> gravity

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
anybody or any block affected by gravity

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.969 
anybody or any block affected by gravity
so<00:04:32.080> so<00:04:33.080> you<00:04:33.169> want<00:04:33.320> to<00:04:33.380> go<00:04:33.440> all<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:33.680> way<00:04:33.800> across

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
so so you want to go all the way across

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.999 
so so you want to go all the way across
it<00:04:34.449> that's<00:04:35.449> eight<00:04:35.660> blocks<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:36.620> you<00:04:36.860> want

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
it that's eight blocks and you want

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.939 
it that's eight blocks and you want
little<00:04:37.190> from<00:04:38.060> right<00:04:38.330> here<00:04:38.720> you<00:04:39.530> want<00:04:39.710> to<00:04:39.830> go

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
little from right here you want to go

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.469 
little from right here you want to go
seven<00:04:40.310> ops<00:04:40.430> of<00:04:40.610> three<00:04:40.820> four<00:04:41.330> five<00:04:41.780> six<00:04:42.169> seven

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
seven ops of three four five six seven

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:52.900 
seven ops of three four five six seven
so<00:04:44.479> just<00:04:44.690> keep<00:04:44.810> doing<00:04:45.110> that<00:04:50.169> so<00:04:51.520> you<00:04:52.520> need<00:04:52.699> all

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
you need it's seven whoops you need it

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.779 
you need it's seven whoops you need it
seven<00:04:56.509> hi<00:04:56.780> so<00:04:58.120> when<00:04:59.120> it<00:04:59.240> fires<00:04:59.479> the<00:04:59.660> TNT<00:05:00.789> the

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
seven hi so when it fires the TNT the

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:06.999 
seven hi so when it fires the TNT the
Pistons<00:05:02.210> push<00:05:02.539> the<00:05:03.050> TNT<00:05:04.240> these<00:05:05.240> fall<00:05:05.539> down<00:05:06.009> so

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 
Pistons push the TNT these fall down so

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.650 
Pistons push the TNT these fall down so
it<00:05:07.099> can<00:05:07.250> be<00:05:07.400> pushed<00:05:07.669> to<00:05:08.530> push<00:05:09.530> the<00:05:09.740> opportunity

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
it can be pushed to push the opportunity

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.409 
it can be pushed to push the opportunity
so<00:05:12.130> come<00:05:13.130> on<00:05:13.280> I'm<00:05:13.729> not<00:05:13.849> going<00:05:13.970> to<00:05:14.060> show<00:05:14.150> you<00:05:14.210> now

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
so come on I'm not going to show you now

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.240 
so come on I'm not going to show you now
so<00:05:15.410> now<00:05:16.389> you<00:05:17.389> got<00:05:17.539> a<00:05:17.599> redstone<00:05:18.440> all<00:05:18.830> the<00:05:19.039> way<00:05:19.130> up

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
so now you got a redstone all the way up

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:26.200 
so now you got a redstone all the way up
there<00:05:20.740> mr.<00:05:21.740> block<00:05:21.919> here<00:05:23.979> from<00:05:24.979> this<00:05:25.340> block<00:05:25.639> put

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
there mr. block here from this block put

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:33.399 
there mr. block here from this block put
a<00:05:26.479> ring<00:05:30.190> like<00:05:31.190> this<00:05:31.780> and<00:05:32.780> on<00:05:32.840> this<00:05:33.110> one<00:05:33.349> you're

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:33.409 
a ring like this and on this one you're

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:35.920 
a ring like this and on this one you're
going<00:05:33.650> to<00:05:33.710> want<00:05:33.830> to<00:05:33.919> put<00:05:34.659> repeaters<00:05:35.659> all

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
going to want to put repeaters all

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.930 
going to want to put repeaters all
unfolded<00:05:36.470> I<00:05:36.530> again<00:05:39.190> another<00:05:40.190> repeater<00:05:40.639> hair

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
unfolded I again another repeater hair

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.680 
unfolded I again another repeater hair
going<00:05:41.150> into<00:05:41.630> the<00:05:41.720> TNT<00:05:43.510> then<00:05:44.510> you're<00:05:44.659> just

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
going into the TNT then you're just

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.629 
going into the TNT then you're just
going<00:05:44.960> to<00:05:45.050> redstone<00:05:45.470> it<00:05:45.710> up<00:05:45.800> or<00:05:46.430> sign<00:05:46.669> up

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
going to redstone it up or sign up

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.619 
going to redstone it up or sign up
load<00:05:49.569> this<00:05:49.749> space<00:05:50.110> oh<00:05:50.379> no<00:05:51.180> I'll<00:05:52.180> sort<00:05:52.449> that<00:05:52.569> out

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:52.629 
load this space oh no I'll sort that out

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:58.739 
load this space oh no I'll sort that out
later<00:05:53.219> yeah<00:05:54.219> so<00:05:55.740> this<00:05:56.740> is<00:05:56.770> it<00:05:57.039> done<00:05:57.629> click<00:05:58.629> the

later yeah so this is it done click the
button<00:05:58.779> lights<00:05:59.740> it<00:06:00.039> lights<00:06:00.550> for<00:06:00.759> that<00:06:00.879> one

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
button lights it lights for that one

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.980 
button lights it lights for that one
fires<00:06:01.900> it<00:06:02.020> off<00:06:02.229> over<00:06:02.710> there<00:06:03.039> and<00:06:04.029> that<00:06:04.629> reloads

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
fires it off over there and that reloads

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:11.879 
fires it off over there and that reloads
it<00:06:05.430> let's<00:06:06.430> pick<00:06:06.669> TNT<00:06:07.180> ready<00:06:07.419> to<00:06:07.569> fire<00:06:10.740> push<00:06:11.740> is

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:11.889 
it let's pick TNT ready to fire push is

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:14.550 
it let's pick TNT ready to fire push is
there<00:06:12.099> pushes<00:06:12.550> that<00:06:12.699> now<00:06:13.150> you<00:06:13.180> load<00:06:13.479> it<00:06:13.509> so<00:06:14.289> for

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
there pushes that now you load it so for

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.110 
there pushes that now you load it so for
