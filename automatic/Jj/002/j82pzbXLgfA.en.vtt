00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
audible card or 101 if you had any of

audible card or 101 if you had any of
those<00:02:34.540> three<00:02:34.840> things<00:02:35.049> those<00:02:35.319> counted<00:02:35.709> as<00:02:35.829> hits

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
those three things those counted as hits

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.140 
those three things those counted as hits
so<00:02:36.610> i<00:02:36.640> put<00:02:36.940> gb<00:02:37.269> one<00:02:37.480> beside<00:02:37.840> your<00:02:37.989> team<00:02:38.200> name<00:02:39.150> or

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
so i put gb one beside your team name or

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.860 
so i put gb one beside your team name or
gb2<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:42.459> team<00:02:42.670> must<00:02:42.819> sell<00:02:43.060> twice<00:02:43.329> on<00:02:43.660> both

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870
