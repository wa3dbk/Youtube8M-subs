00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
an ovulation is the main reason why the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.019 
an ovulation is the main reason why the

slide looking onto the slide okay what

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.310 
slide looking onto the slide okay what
is<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:50.130> main<00:04:50.310> problem<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:51.479> main<00:04:51.660> problem<00:04:52.229> is

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
is the main problem the main problem is

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.040 
is the main problem the main problem is
there<00:04:52.560> is<00:04:52.650> hyper<00:04:52.889> think<00:04:53.400> horses<00:04:53.789> as<00:04:54.050> excessive

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
there is hyper think horses as excessive

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.960 
there is hyper think horses as excessive
testosterone<00:04:55.289> production<00:04:55.979> from<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.580> ovaries

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
testosterone production from the ovaries

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.529 
testosterone production from the ovaries
so<00:04:57.750> obviously<00:04:58.169> the<00:04:58.320> testosterone<00:04:58.949> is<00:04:58.979> more

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
so obviously the testosterone is more

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:01.820 
so obviously the testosterone is more

will come in the blood giving rise to

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
acne oily skin restore to them and there

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.189 
acne oily skin restore to them and there
is<00:05:04.710> defective<00:05:05.220> a<00:05:05.699> dramatization<00:05:06.479> within<00:05:07.020> the

is defective a dramatization within the

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.520 
is defective a dramatization within the
ovaries<00:05:08.030> now<00:05:09.030> what<00:05:09.240> is<00:05:09.449> a<00:05:09.840> dramatization<00:05:10.110> we

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
ovaries now what is a dramatization we

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.170 
ovaries now what is a dramatization we
just<00:05:10.710> now<00:05:10.800> discussed<00:05:10.830> male<00:05:11.729> hold<00:05:11.940> on<00:05:12.060> the

just now discussed male hold on the

just now discussed male hold on the
female<00:05:12.449> on<00:05:12.570> so<00:05:13.110> if<00:05:13.229> this<00:05:13.349> does<00:05:13.590> not<00:05:13.800> take<00:05:14.099> place

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
female on so if this does not take place

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.159 
female on so if this does not take place
there's<00:05:14.610> a<00:05:14.639> lot<00:05:14.669> of<00:05:15.000> hyper<00:05:15.300> androgenic

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
there's a lot of hyper androgenic

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.620 
there's a lot of hyper androgenic
environment<00:05:16.860> within<00:05:17.039> the<00:05:17.220> ovaries<00:05:17.639> and<00:05:17.849> this

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
environment within the ovaries and this

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.659 
environment within the ovaries and this
prevents<00:05:19.410> the<00:05:19.530> follicle<00:05:20.039> from<00:05:20.250> growing<00:05:20.550> the

prevents the follicle from growing the

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.040 
prevents the follicle from growing the
follicles<00:05:21.120> will<00:05:21.240> not<00:05:21.389> grow<00:05:21.539> the<00:05:21.660> follicles

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
follicles will not grow the follicles

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.749 
follicles will not grow the follicles

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
follicle is not growing but very

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.129

testosterone comes in the adipose tissue
the<00:05:30.930> aromatization

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
the aromatization

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.159 
the aromatization
is<00:05:31.949> normal<00:05:32.490> so<00:05:32.940> in<00:05:33.060> the<00:05:33.120> add<00:05:33.300> in<00:05:33.599> the<00:05:33.720> adipose

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
is normal so in the add in the adipose

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.670 
is normal so in the add in the adipose
tissue<00:05:34.789> the<00:05:35.789> aromatization<00:05:36.270> takes<00:05:36.990> place<00:05:37.260> so

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
tissue the aromatization takes place so

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.020

the testosterone gets converted to

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.390 
the testosterone gets converted to
estrogen<00:05:41.120> so<00:05:42.120> it<00:05:42.570> is<00:05:43.139> also<00:05:43.349> a<00:05:43.710> hyper<00:05:44.010> East
