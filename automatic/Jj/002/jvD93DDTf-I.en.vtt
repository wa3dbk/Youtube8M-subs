jumping animation that we did in the
earlier<00:00:52.260> assignment<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.730> looks<00:00:53.910> really<00:00:54.120> nice

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
earlier assignment it looks really nice

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.660 
earlier assignment it looks really nice
it<00:00:55.440> doesn't<00:00:55.710> really<00:00:55.800> go<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.039> yellow<00:00:56.340> stone

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
it doesn't really go with yellow stone

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.510 
it doesn't really go with yellow stone
because<00:00:57.500> he<00:00:58.500> was<00:00:58.649> at<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.800> playground<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
because he was at the playground in the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.760

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.459 
assignment what we're going to do is
we're<00:02:02.219> going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.369> use<00:02:02.520> components<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.780> end<00:02:03.990> so

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
we're going to use components the end so

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.730 
we're going to use components the end so
in<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.340> video<00:02:06.200> Richard<00:02:07.200> Shoop<00:02:07.409> does<00:02:07.619> it

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
in the video Richard Shoop does it

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.400 
in the video Richard Shoop does it
really<00:02:07.860> easy<00:02:08.069> adds<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.849> component<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:09.899> very

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
really easy adds a component to it very

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.670 
really easy adds a component to it very
easily<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:10.890> let's<00:02:11.220> do<00:02:11.849> it

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
easily so let's do it

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.599 
easily so let's do it
see<00:02:12.890> if<00:02:12.950> we<00:02:13.069> can<00:02:13.250> do<00:02:13.609> what<00:02:13.760> he<00:02:13.909> did<00:02:14.090> window

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:15.609 
see if we can do what he did window

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:20.699 
see if we can do what he did window
components<00:02:17.680> okay<00:02:18.680> there's<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.459> components<00:02:20.090> and

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
components okay there's a components and

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.220 
components okay there's a components and
we're<00:02:21.709> going<00:02:21.829> to<00:02:21.890> look<00:02:22.099> at<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.730> user<00:02:23.689> interface

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
we're going to look at a user interface

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.920 
we're going to look at a user interface
all<00:02:25.219> right<00:02:25.459> I<00:02:25.489> believe<00:02:25.969> and<00:02:26.439> I'm<00:02:27.439> looking<00:02:27.829> for

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
all right I believe and I'm looking for

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.229 
all right I believe and I'm looking for
let's<00:02:29.930> say<00:02:30.260> here<00:02:30.530> there's<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.950> text<00:02:31.760> area<00:02:31.909> that

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
let's say here there's a text area that

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.569 
let's say here there's a text area that
sounds<00:02:32.599> good<00:02:32.810> text<00:02:33.709> input<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.159> sounds<00:02:34.430> good

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
sounds good text input that sounds good

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.059 
sounds good text input that sounds good
but<00:02:34.730> here<00:02:34.879> it<00:02:34.969> is<00:02:35.030> user<00:02:35.299> interface<00:02:35.870> scroll<00:02:36.799> bar

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
but here it is user interface scroll bar

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.699 
but here it is user interface scroll bar
right<00:02:37.519> and<00:02:37.819> we<00:02:38.629> could<00:02:38.750> take<00:02:38.900> this<00:02:39.049> scroll<00:02:39.439> bar

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
right and we could take this scroll bar

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.089 
right and we could take this scroll bar
and<00:02:40.040> we<00:02:40.760> can<00:02:40.909> just<00:02:41.090> drag<00:02:41.389> it<00:02:41.420> out<00:02:41.719> and<00:02:41.959> drop<00:02:42.859> it

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
and we can just drag it out and drop it

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.069 
and we can just drag it out and drop it
right<00:02:43.129> onto<00:02:43.609> the<00:02:44.000> text<00:02:44.389> box<00:02:44.629> and<00:02:44.930> it

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
right onto the text box and it

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.589 
right onto the text box and it
automatically<00:02:45.769> attaches<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.639> the<00:02:47.120> text<00:02:47.419> box

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
automatically attaches to the text box

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.869 
automatically attaches to the text box
all<00:02:48.049> right<00:02:48.200> now<00:02:49.069> let<00:02:49.250> me<00:02:49.280> scroll<00:02:49.549> in<00:02:49.669> a<00:02:49.700> little

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
all right now let me scroll in a little

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.429 
all right now let me scroll in a little
bit<00:02:49.970> closer<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.389> let<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:50.599> see<00:02:50.750> this<00:02:50.930> text<00:02:51.139> box

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:51.439 
bit closer to let you see this text box

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:57.459 
bit closer to let you see this text box
here<00:02:54.760> all<00:02:55.760> right<00:02:55.879> there's<00:02:56.090> my<00:02:56.180> text<00:02:56.599> box<00:02:56.810> I've

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:57.469 
here all right there's my text box I've

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.069 
here all right there's my text box I've
put<00:02:57.799> in<00:02:57.950> lots<00:02:58.639> of<00:02:58.849> text<00:02:59.269> here<00:02:59.299> more<00:02:59.689> text<00:03:00.019> than

I<00:03:00.260> need<00:03:00.439> so<00:03:00.469> that<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.889> scroll<00:03:01.159> bar<00:03:01.400> will<00:03:02.060> work

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
I need so that the scroll bar will work

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.720 
I need so that the scroll bar will work
and<00:03:02.569> now<00:03:03.439> let's<00:03:03.889> see<00:03:04.099> here<00:03:04.280> it's<00:03:04.400> attached

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
and now let's see here it's attached

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.789 
and now let's see here it's attached
there's<00:03:05.060> my<00:03:05.239> text<00:03:05.569> box<00:03:05.780> i<00:03:06.019> select<00:03:06.349> it<00:03:06.469> remember

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
there's my text box i select it remember

there's my text box i select it remember
this<00:03:06.889> has<00:03:07.069> to<00:03:07.219> say<00:03:07.370> dynamic<00:03:07.879> text<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.359> it

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
this has to say dynamic text and it

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.009 
this has to say dynamic text and it
needs<00:03:08.989> a<00:03:09.079> name<00:03:09.909> and<00:03:10.909> now<00:03:11.269> when<00:03:11.450> I<00:03:11.480> select<00:03:11.780> this

needs a name and now when I select this
you<00:03:12.889> I<00:03:12.919> scroll<00:03:13.489> bar<00:03:13.730> I<00:03:14.079> can<00:03:15.079> go<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:16.120> parameters

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
you I scroll bar I can go to parameters

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.149 
you I scroll bar I can go to parameters
and<00:03:17.449> look<00:03:18.199> at<00:03:18.319> its<00:03:18.440> parameters<00:03:18.799> and

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 
and look at its parameters and

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.890 
and look at its parameters and
automatically<00:03:19.699> since<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.120> dropped<00:03:20.419> it<00:03:20.659> onto

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
automatically since I dropped it onto

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.009 
automatically since I dropped it onto
the<00:03:21.349> dynamic<00:03:21.949> text<00:03:22.129> box<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:23.180> target<00:03:23.659> instance

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
the dynamic text box the target instance

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.319 
the dynamic text box the target instance
name<00:03:24.290> of<00:03:24.560> home<00:03:24.829> text<00:03:25.489> automatically<00:03:26.060> got

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
name of home text automatically got

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.059 
name of home text automatically got
filled<00:03:26.629> in<00:03:26.810> right<00:03:26.840> there<00:03:27.290> right

character is jumping behind the
scrolling<00:04:14.389> text<00:04:14.599> box<00:04:14.959> so<00:04:15.919> i<00:04:16.370> might<00:04:16.880> want<00:04:17.030> to
