00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:13.620
 I will explain how to install and use 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.150
 whatsapp messenger for the iPod touch of 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.990
 fourth generation 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:24.480
 but only then is the market for 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:31.399
 First let's download whatsapp 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:39.210
 messenger by stylus and resent it 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:43.010
 on the ipod then we connect the ipod to the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.410
 computer was sync with itunes 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.059
 after that we have to download a 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.570
 program that iphone configuration 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.360
 utility for windows we have windows se 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.879
 we have a mac were at the other link 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.660
 then we click on download and there 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.219
 will download iphone configuration then only 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.960
 after we did the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.210
 synchronization write the program 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.210
 he was wrong 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.659
 only after doing this we open tvt 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.710
 Iphone configuration has pretty much me 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.670
 now I already have everything added whatsapp 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:31.490
 so we have to press on add 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:34.530
 then since everything is already saved here 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.439
 as if we don't remember where itunes is 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.030
 saved whatsapp file us there 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:45.240
 we write here about the whatsapp search 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.909
 here it is music inside this folder 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.289
 and here we are already connected 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.289
 so we go into this 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:02:07.590
 link this process here then 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:10.470
 computer there in music in itunes itunes 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.360
 mobile media applications and then we have to 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.140
 change from have seventh 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.130
 mobile to all files if not, don't 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.760
 will find then we take whatsapp 2.8 point 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.200
 3 double click and we will write this 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.859
 written to you too is already new 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:33.030
 so I will replace it anyway here 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:37.890
 here the writing once this is done e 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.959
 so having this helps us make it 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.940
 possible whatsapp on the ipod 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.760
 but now we have to move 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.099
 on the ipod because we have to 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.700
 to work subsidized once 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:54.480
 downloaded whatsapp for the ipod touch and if 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.000
 we will go to open will tell us will give us a 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:02.209
 error because our device does not 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.220
 is supported for use but no problem 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.900
 because we have to do some steps with 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:13.140
 cydia 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:19.549
 then first we open cydia is 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:24.420
 we are practically looking for the package 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:26.340
 named watts pad which is free in the 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.269
 bigboss repository 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:38.840
 then we go in search and we are in fact 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:38.840
 wordpad a very good Russians charge 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:17.550
 ok once tried we will appear 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.930
 that one above all this one of fashions 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:24.780
 never because this we have to download 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.550
 practically because that of bigboss 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:32.270
 been removed 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:37.350
 then let's take this and put it in 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:40.070
 this will confirm and will do everything 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.070
 alone 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:05:03.680
 once it's done practically 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:06.470
 we practically select to restart 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.120
 our device but we'll do it already 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.890
 by procedure because practically 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:15.490
 we should restart it a moment and yes 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.490
 charge 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.140
 here another loaded will tell us to say 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:45.580
 start the springboard once 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:51.660
 restarted the device we could see 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:55.330
 that we can open whatsapp and tell us 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:59.140
 this thing then first there 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:03.900
 will say that the lame wants to access the 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.900
 our contacts and we say ok 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.860
 and then he will ask us for our number 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.140
 real phone and we tell him 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.770
 the real one that we have a large number of 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.770
 mobile phone 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:29.070
 ok to me already gives me the name because i am 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.540
 already registered but you will be given a pin there 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:34.140
 i had to go have a massage of yours 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:36.030
 phone with a pin and then transcribe network 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:43.710
 and therefore it will also be yours 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:47.610
 ok screen let's go to the contacts 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:49.320
 here today all the contacts that were 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.300
 already not from bots 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:07:00.590
 to add contacts it will be enough 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:07:00.590
 go to the contact screen 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:10.140
 here is where to issue something more here 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:12.660
 on the plus side the name is the telephone 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:18.210
 then whatsapp when you add a 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:19.950
