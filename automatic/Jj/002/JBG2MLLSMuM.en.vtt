00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 the press of all dear friends at all 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.650
 Apple recently announced 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.420
 that it will be free to replace the buttons 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.870
 power and their cable to users 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.969
 iphone 5 who bought until May 2013 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.360
 I just bought one of them on 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.330
 second day of sales and then the general button 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.789
 I stopped working around maybe 5 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.869
 months ago, that is, it was pressed with 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.279
 huge effort and then completely stopped 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.330
 work and I had to use 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.309
 built-in suck mtouch function which 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.680
 allows in general to manage all of them 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.170
 organs buttons if they broke and 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.860
 so means and I took my device to 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.350
 apple store 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.680
 Today, May 2 is the first 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.850
 free replacement day 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.530
 then checked my device on 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.730
 other breakdowns are the main conditions 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.170
 free replacement 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.149
 it was just full 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.789
 device performance if 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.309
 there are already some problems 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.809
 interfere for example 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.280
 completely disassemble the device to 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.160
 for example replacing a display like themselves 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.309
 They say they will have to fix them before 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.830
 That is , you still have money shaking 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.720
 I generally do not have such problems 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.880
 In general, the device passed without any problems 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.920
 testing which in general 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.650
 held on macbook connects to 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.080
 special cable and lasts about 3 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.320
 minutes only how do you know that 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.420
 I changed this battery and also the home button, but 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.979
 and but I set back the standard 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.080
 the only problem I'm with 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.590
 faced but it is yesterday that is 1 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.619
 May I unscrew the bolts to 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.170
 put the second button and on one 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.299
 carving in general cut off 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.030
 and had to put on my black 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.590
 iPhone I have found in general that not 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.720
 I know if this will be a problem for them 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.270
 new propeller device taken not think 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.310
 that something should happen as a must 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.259
 many of you have seen in china i got 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.570
 device in general for a replacement for a while 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.250
 repair is iphone 5 to 16 gigabytes 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.130
 black for one more 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.260
 will he by the way not be new i mean i 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.950
 I understand , I went through a lot of hands 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.410
 it gives in cases of repair and in general 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.570
 for example, here is my fashionable woman of life I can 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.610
 easy to wear and use afterwards 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.350
 just bring and recover data and 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.230
 give them your hands and change for your 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.820
 device and if something happens to it 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.650
 you have to pay for it of course 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.740
 repair that is an example to break 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.930
 If you drop the display, then this is again 200 euros 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.090
 only if you pay 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.400
 repair this device you get your 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.130
 the old one you give away if you donâ€™t 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.500
 want to repair the device then 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.530
 Your device will not be given away like this 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.480
 everything is just like I said device 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.550
 not new so many cat on it 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.070
 on the display, for example, there are broken pixels 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.959
 I look at him like now 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:49.230
 but in general, everything works fine 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.260
 The battery does not hold for very long, but in 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.739
 in principle, while normally I think this week 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.180
 ok still look like that well i 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.760
 I can say of course cool to 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.640
 a replacement device recently may 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.070
 chili's arm being healed and he waited 8 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.739
 weeks in the end could not have repaired 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.049
 sent back and he was extremely 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.269
 displeased 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.459
 so even we did not give on the device on 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.739

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.580

 waited for mines to bring the waiting list 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.820
 then I waited for one worker who 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.590
