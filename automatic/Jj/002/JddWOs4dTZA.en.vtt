00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.440
 very good, well, now we're going to 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.330
 clean the fretboard 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.000
 in another video we saw more or less by 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.410
 over how to clean now we're going to 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.650
 do to the practical 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.820
 I eat clean a little water and 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.820
 asthma soap 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.820
 here we are we must do all the 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.130
 days 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.530
 this is something in this case for all the 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.520
 what have we going to do 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.520
 and get him out 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.450
 a little bit like that 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.700
 I use an official Chinese sprayer 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.900
 do not come to me with limitations and for 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.350
 please the doctor's known brush 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.350
 kart 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.090
 look for you to see because my friend told me 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.430
 I said that he did not use this guitar 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.080
 but look look look how rich for 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.520
 spice up this is to spice up 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.520
 nothing, we are going to turn a blind eye 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.180
 of cleaning this day step 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.000
 clean instrument instruments and 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.800
 adjust it you do not have to be afraid there 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.800
 throw a little imagination 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:25.050
 obviously you can not do something they serve 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.050
 nothing I do to do this for 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.820
 will not be consulted here below 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.040
 You can leave your comment and your 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.490
 questions and we will give you solve the 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.790
 which we have that your questions are 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.790
 coherent 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.060
 well we know cleaned what is the 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.280
 fingerboard and as we can see here there 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.750
 as a kind of white brands 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.700
 white 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.370
 that is the deterioration of the wood to not 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.869
 take care not to hydrate it is very important 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.920
 hydrate the wood so it does not 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.850
 deteriorate more 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.850
 and lasts longer 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.729
 let's do this 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.110
 we saw in another video in this case instead 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.620
 of a ship is going to be a guitar 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.930
 acoustic in which we will use 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.760
 cotton cloth does not have to be 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.760
 of something special 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.490
 and from this 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.920
 and what I 'm going to do is wet the cloth 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.930
 with oil enough because this day 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.230
 passion needs a lot because it's very 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.750
 dry 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.920
 and as you can see here, it can happen 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.920
 all good to wood 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.390
 intractable 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.670
 how much quantity of charles did he have 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.560
 because this when they never happen to the 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.560
 fretboard starts to absorb to return 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.950
 equally this work of passing oil 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.840
 you do not have to do it every day 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.950
 you have to be careful not to put him 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.260
 much quantity very quickly but without 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.120
 put it now that the 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.160
 wood you can put enough for 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.440
 this 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.370
 and during the wood 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.370
 and protect us better 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.810
 so for now 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.849
 we have it well hydrated 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.670
 there is also something else that I do that is 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.459
 well on the edge of 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.770
 after you passed the rags out there 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.530
 because sometimes there is a little bit of a 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.010
 dirt chair 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.680
 on the fret is sometimes very dirty there 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.150
 then we can moisturize and also the 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.010
 slot that has the wood as it can 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.240
 get a little oil to hydrate it 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.480
 as well 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.940
 that is to say you have to love her 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.640
 we have hydrated the fingerboard and good what 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.680
 what are we going to do 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.620
 the oil in microns 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.190
 the oil what we are going to do is polish 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.420
 the front of the guitar 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.420
 and give it a little more brightness
