I don't know what's going to be up with
that<00:01:32.040> dragon<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.460> think<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:32.700> going<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.850> be

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
that dragon I think it's going to be

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.580 
that dragon I think it's going to be
more<00:01:33.360> important<00:01:33.900> than<00:01:33.960> just<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.380> little

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
more important than just this little

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.020 
more important than just this little
dragon<00:01:35.100> that's<00:01:35.189> attacking<00:01:35.460> them<00:01:35.790> for<00:01:35.939> now

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.210 
dragon that's attacking them for now

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
they're probably going to tame it take

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.530 
they're probably going to tame it take
it<00:01:38.369> with<00:01:38.460> them<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.850> don't<00:01:39.000> know<00:01:39.060> how<00:01:39.210> long<00:01:39.360> I'll

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540

be<00:01:39.600> with<00:01:39.810> them<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.049> it's<00:01:40.170> going<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.380> be

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
be with them but it's going to be

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.289 
be with them but it's going to be
important<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.100> some<00:01:41.700> way<00:01:41.850> they're<00:01:42.119> not<00:01:42.150> just

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
them so he he seemed like he was good at

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.589 
them so he he seemed like he was good at
at<00:02:16.800> least<00:02:16.920> pretending<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.760> be<00:02:17.879> a<00:02:17.910> nice<00:02:18.120> guy<00:02:18.300> and

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
at least pretending to be a nice guy and

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.990 
at least pretending to be a nice guy and
apparently<00:02:19.590> he<00:02:19.620> has<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.860> six<00:02:20.250> sister<00:02:20.730> who<00:02:20.910> he

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
apparently he has a six sister who he

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.699 
apparently he has a six sister who he
used<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.300> go<00:02:21.420> visit<00:02:21.450> sometime<00:02:22.140> my<00:02:22.500> first

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
used to go visit sometime my first

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.110 
used to go visit sometime my first
thought<00:02:22.980> was<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.280> it's<00:02:23.489> sisters<00:02:23.819> kiya

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
thought was that it's sisters kiya

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.030 
thought was that it's sisters kiya
because<00:02:24.750> she's<00:02:24.930> like<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.200> only<00:02:25.319> sick<00:02:25.680> person

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
because she's like the only sick person

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.589 
because she's like the only sick person
that<00:02:26.190> we<00:02:26.280> know<00:02:26.430> but<00:02:26.700> I'm<00:02:26.970> pretty<00:02:27.120> sure<00:02:27.360> she

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
that we know but I'm pretty sure she

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.470 
that we know but I'm pretty sure she
that's<00:02:27.900> not<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:28.800> just<00:02:28.950> some<00:02:29.670> random<00:02:30.120> girl

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
that's not it's just some random girl

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.330 
that's not it's just some random girl
I'm<00:02:31.080> used<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.410> hearing<00:02:31.590> things<00:02:31.950> in<00:02:32.069> one<00:02:32.190> piece

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
I'm used to hearing things in one piece

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.009 
I'm used to hearing things in one piece
and<00:02:32.519> instantly<00:02:32.849> trying<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.299> connect<00:02:33.660> them<00:02:33.870> to

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
and instantly trying to connect them to

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.839 
and instantly trying to connect them to
other<00:02:34.049> things<00:02:34.470> because<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.310> many<00:02:35.430> things<00:02:35.700> are

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
other things because so many things are

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.690 
other things because so many things are
connected<00:02:36.090> but<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.629> don't<00:02:37.140> think<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.580> so<00:02:38.580> he

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
connected but I don't think so so he

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.009 
connected but I don't think so so he
just<00:02:38.819> takes<00:02:39.030> everyone<00:02:39.390> down<00:02:39.540> he<00:02:39.690> beats<00:02:39.870> up

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
just takes everyone down he beats up

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.320 
just takes everyone down he beats up
Tasha<00:02:40.260> he<00:02:40.530> then<00:02:40.980> completely<00:02:41.640> unexpectedly

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
Tasha he then completely unexpectedly

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.170 
Tasha he then completely unexpectedly
