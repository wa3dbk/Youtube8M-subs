right now so it kind of clocks around a
little<00:00:32.940> bit<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.420> stays<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:33.780> I'm<00:00:34.380> uh

inian<00:00:37.770> is

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.710 

and<00:01:54.370> I<00:01:54.460> know<00:01:54.610> that's<00:01:54.700> pretty<00:01:54.940> fast<00:01:55.210> right

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
and I know that's pretty fast right

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.500 
and I know that's pretty fast right
that's<00:01:56.440> a<00:01:56.680> Valene<00:01:57.010> Ian<00:01:57.160> and<00:01:57.340> VXL<00:01:57.820> it's<00:01:58.150> two<00:01:58.300> s

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
that's a Valene Ian and VXL it's two s

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.010 
that's a Valene Ian and VXL it's two s
and<00:01:58.810> I'm<00:01:59.140> running<00:01:59.970> 1290<00:02:00.970> gearing<00:02:01.390> with

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
and I'm running 1290 gearing with

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.910 
and I'm running 1290 gearing with
underdrive<00:02:02.440> diffs

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
underdrive diffs

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.920 
underdrive diffs
so<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.790> under<00:02:04.000> drive<00:02:04.180> dips<00:02:04.450> give<00:02:04.630> you<00:02:04.750> about

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
so the under drive dips give you about

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.010 
so the under drive dips give you about
another<00:02:05.320> tooth<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.040> a<00:02:06.100> half<00:02:06.280> on<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:06.670> opinion

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
another tooth and a half on the opinion

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.540 
another tooth and a half on the opinion
which<00:02:08.020> puts<00:02:08.290> me<00:02:08.410> about<00:02:08.650> ten<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:09.010> half<00:02:09.190> two

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
which puts me about ten and a half two

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.600 
which puts me about ten and a half two
and<00:02:09.730> ninety

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
and ninety

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:23.150 
and ninety
it's<00:02:12.610> about<00:02:12.850> as<00:02:13.030> fast<00:02:13.180> as<00:02:13.420> my<00:02:13.540> 27<00:02:14.080> turn<00:02:14.230> what

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.470 

the<00:02:24.160> difference<00:02:24.520> is<00:02:24.700> it's<00:02:24.850> impossible<00:02:25.390> to

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
the difference is it's impossible to

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.310 
the difference is it's impossible to
ball<00:02:25.660> get<00:02:25.840> down<00:02:27.570> all<00:02:28.570> right<00:02:28.660> guys<00:02:28.840> that's<00:02:29.110> it

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.920 
ball get down all right guys that's it
I'm<00:02:30.160> gonna<00:02:30.370> go<00:02:30.490> get<00:02:30.610> something<00:02:30.880> faster<00:02:31.480> time

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
I'm gonna go get something faster time

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.850 
I'm gonna go get something faster time
