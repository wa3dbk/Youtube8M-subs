the<00:00:09.150> common<00:00:09.510> core<00:00:09.690> standards<00:00:10.200> have<00:00:10.920> changed

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
the common core standards have changed

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.680 
the common core standards have changed
the<00:00:11.340> way<00:00:11.460> that<00:00:11.639> we<00:00:11.910> approach<00:00:12.240> teaching

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
the way that we approach teaching

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.560 
the way that we approach teaching
because<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.110> allows<00:00:13.530> us<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.980> go<00:00:14.130> into<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.610> text

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
because it allows us to go into a text

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.810 
because it allows us to go into a text
with<00:00:15.719> more<00:00:16.020> depths<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:17.100> allows<00:00:17.310> us<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.580> spend

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
with more depths it allows us to spend

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.060 
with more depths it allows us to spend
more<00:00:18.029> time<00:00:18.390> with<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.720> text<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.199> examine<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:19.949> on

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
more time with the text to examine it on

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.210 
more time with the text to examine it on
multiple<00:00:20.670> levels<00:00:21.260> when<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.350> comes<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.769> ela

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
multiple levels when it comes to ela

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.730 
multiple levels when it comes to ela
it's<00:00:23.609> all<00:00:23.850> about<00:00:24.090> texts<00:00:24.720> worth<00:00:24.960> reading<00:00:25.320> and

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
it's all about texts worth reading and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.269 
it's all about texts worth reading and
questions<00:00:26.580> worth<00:00:26.849> answering
