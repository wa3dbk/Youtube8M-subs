is<00:04:24.750> there's<00:04:24.840> a<00:04:24.960> linkage<00:04:25.260> in<00:04:25.440> there<00:04:25.590> they're

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
is there's a linkage in there they're

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.320 
is there's a linkage in there they're
plastic<00:04:26.160> and<00:04:26.400> they<00:04:26.520> can<00:04:26.669> break<00:04:26.850> so<00:04:27.060> it's<00:04:27.180> not<00:04:27.300> a

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
plastic and they can break so it's not a

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.600

you can get access into that and block
put<00:04:31.110> replace<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.770> linkage
