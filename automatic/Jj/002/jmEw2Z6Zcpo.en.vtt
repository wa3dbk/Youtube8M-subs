of experience and they build up from

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.500 
of experience and they build up from
there<00:00:48.410> number<00:00:49.410> two<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.820> don't<00:00:51.030> look<00:00:51.300> out

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
there number two is you don't look out

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.580 
there number two is you don't look out
for<00:00:52.110> your<00:00:52.590> nutrition<00:00:53.580> now<00:00:54.450> a<00:00:54.810> lot<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.260> guys

for your nutrition now a lot of guys
they<00:00:55.950> start<00:00:56.310> working<00:00:57.240> out<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.930> they<00:00:58.770> really

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
they start working out and they really

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.060 
they start working out and they really
power<00:00:59.790> away<00:01:00.360> in<00:01:00.600> their<00:01:00.780> workouts<00:01:01.290> but<00:01:01.890> they

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
power away in their workouts but they

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.069 
power away in their workouts but they
don't<00:01:02.280> get<00:01:02.490> that<00:01:02.730> much<00:01:02.970> muscle<00:01:03.360> growth<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:04.079 
don't get that much muscle growth and

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:06.109 
don't get that much muscle growth and
then<00:01:04.500> they<00:01:04.650> wonder<00:01:04.890> why<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.790> many<00:01:06.030> cases

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
then they wonder why and in many cases

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.830 
then they wonder why and in many cases
the<00:01:06.869> problem<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.799> they<00:01:08.520> simply<00:01:09.330> have

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the problem is that they simply have

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.670 
the problem is that they simply have
nutrition<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.950> sucks<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:13.080> worst

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
nutrition that sucks and the worst

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.430 
nutrition that sucks and the worst
culprit<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.520> here<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.480> that<00:01:15.930> they<00:01:16.170> don't

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
culprit in this here is that they don't

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.680 
culprit in this here is that they don't
get<00:01:16.620> enough<00:01:16.830> protein<00:01:17.280> if<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.180> want<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.480> build

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
get enough protein if you want to build

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.410 
get enough protein if you want to build
muscle<00:01:19.230> then<00:01:19.800> you<00:01:20.340> don't<00:01:20.520> only<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.210> work

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
muscle then you don't only have to work

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.380 
muscle then you don't only have to work
out<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:22.290> also<00:01:22.470> have<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.950> have<00:01:23.370> enough<00:01:23.820> protein

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
out you also have to have enough protein

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.230 
out you also have to have enough protein
in<00:01:24.630> your<00:01:25.229> diet<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:26.550> doesn't<00:01:26.880> have<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.060> be

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
in your diet that doesn't have to be

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.210 
in your diet that doesn't have to be
tons<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.780> protein<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.920> nuts<00:01:29.630> number<00:01:30.630> three

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
tons of protein but nuts number three

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.730 
tons of protein but nuts number three
you<00:01:32.220> do<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:33.030> wrong<00:01:34.280> exercises<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:36.060> is

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
input so that they can grow if you

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.000 
input so that they can grow if you
always<00:02:50.070> swap<00:02:50.880> around<00:02:51.270> your<00:02:51.540> exercises<00:02:52.470> no

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
muscle will really grow and number five

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.380 
muscle will really grow and number five
last<00:02:56.970> but<00:02:57.270> not<00:02:57.300> least<00:02:58.250> many<00:02:59.250> guys<00:02:59.520> they<00:03:00.000> start

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
last but not least many guys they start

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.420 
last but not least many guys they start
working<00:03:00.870> out<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.290> they<00:03:01.440> think<00:03:01.710> working<00:03:02.100> out

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
working out and they think working out

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.000 
working out and they think working out
simply<00:03:03.060> means<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.720> have<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.350> hit<00:03:04.590> them

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
simply means you have to hit them

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.360 
simply means you have to hit them
weights<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:06.330> is<00:03:06.450> wrong<00:03:06.720> because<00:03:07.320> in<00:03:08.310> a

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
weights and that is wrong because in a

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.630 
weights and that is wrong because in a
fit<00:03:08.760> body<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.720> also<00:03:09.930> need<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.710> take<00:03:11.190> care<00:03:11.580> of

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
fit body you also need to take care of

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.780 
fit body you also need to take care of
your<00:03:12.320> cardiovascular<00:03:13.320> health<00:03:13.530> which<00:03:14.520> means

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
your cardiovascular health which means

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.600 
your cardiovascular health which means
you<00:03:15.120> also<00:03:15.300> have<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.900> do<00:03:16.080> cardio<00:03:16.770> to<00:03:17.430> be

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
you also have to do cardio to be

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.200 
you also have to do cardio to be
successful<00:03:18.450> in<00:03:18.720> your<00:03:19.110> workouts<00:03:19.740> and<00:03:20.030> that<00:03:21.030> is

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
successful in your workouts and that is

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.920 
successful in your workouts and that is
because<00:03:21.690> when<00:03:22.050> you<00:03:22.170> do<00:03:22.350> cardio<00:03:23.010> your<00:03:23.550> whole

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
because when you do cardio your whole

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.960 
because when you do cardio your whole
cardiovascular<00:03:24.930> system<00:03:25.560> gets<00:03:25.920> stronger<00:03:26.640> and

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
cardiovascular system gets stronger and

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.840 
cardiovascular system gets stronger and
stronger<00:03:27.810> that<00:03:28.230> system<00:03:28.830> is<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.610> more

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
stronger that system is the more

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.540 
stronger that system is the more
nutrients<00:03:30.570> it<00:03:30.960> can<00:03:31.320> deliver<00:03:31.560> throughout<00:03:32.340> your

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
body and then of course means more

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.240 
body and then of course means more
nutrients<00:03:35.460> also<00:03:36.150> get<00:03:36.360> to<00:03:36.630> your<00:03:36.830> muscles<00:03:37.830> that

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
nutrients also get to your muscles that

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.460 
nutrients also get to your muscles that
can<00:03:38.460> last<00:03:38.700> longer<00:03:39.390> in<00:03:39.690> your<00:03:39.810> workouts<00:03:40.320> and

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
maybe even grow a bit faster than when

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:52.200 
maybe even grow a bit faster than when
you<00:03:44.070> only<00:03:44.400> do<00:03:45.020> resistance<00:03:46.020> training
