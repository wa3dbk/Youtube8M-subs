lot<00:01:32.950> you<00:01:33.160> can<00:01:33.310> use<00:01:33.490> a<00:01:33.520> little<00:01:33.610> remember<00:01:34.090> what<00:01:34.210> I

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
lot you can use a little remember what I

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.120 
lot you can use a little remember what I
said<00:01:34.270> if<00:01:34.600> you<00:01:34.630> have<00:01:34.720> play<00:01:35.020> notes<00:01:35.290> I<00:01:35.590> recommend

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
said if you have play notes I recommend

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.520 
said if you have play notes I recommend
using<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:36.430> lot<00:01:36.670> of<00:01:36.850> ground<00:01:37.030> cinnamon<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.470> it

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
using a lot of ground cinnamon so it

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.200 
using a lot of ground cinnamon so it
should<00:01:38.740> look<00:01:39.010> somewhat<00:01:39.490> like<00:01:39.520> this<00:01:39.820> if<00:01:40.030> you're

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
should look somewhat like this if you're

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.290 
should look somewhat like this if you're
done<00:01:40.330> mixing<00:01:40.510> it<00:01:40.840> up<00:01:40.930> it<00:01:41.410> looks<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.800> very

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
done mixing it up it looks a very

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.520 
done mixing it up it looks a very
liquidy<00:01:43.300> you<00:01:43.720> wouldn't<00:01:43.930> expect<00:01:43.990> it<00:01:44.320> to<00:01:44.440> be

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
liquidy you wouldn't expect it to be

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.850 
liquidy you wouldn't expect it to be
pancake<00:01:45.130> mix<00:01:45.370> but<00:01:45.580> a<00:01:45.850> damn<00:01:46.119> well<00:01:46.330> is<00:01:46.710> now<00:01:47.710> it's

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
your eggs stick into the thing because

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.980 
your eggs stick into the thing because
you're<00:02:03.940> gonna<00:02:04.030> lose<00:02:04.210> protein<00:02:04.660> that<00:02:04.780> weighs

you're gonna lose protein that weighs

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.140 
you're gonna lose protein that weighs
right<00:02:05.350> so<00:02:05.830> you<00:02:05.890> can<00:02:06.010> use<00:02:06.160> olive<00:02:06.340> oil<00:02:06.580> anything

you want i just went with this because

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.949 
you want i just went with this because
it<00:02:08.890> was<00:02:09.010> on<00:02:09.130> hand<00:02:09.340> now<00:02:09.610> it's<00:02:10.600> time<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.840> cook

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
it was on hand now it's time to cook

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.350 
it was on hand now it's time to cook
this<00:02:11.410> up<00:02:11.440> grab<00:02:12.130> your<00:02:12.280> bowl<00:02:12.490> pour<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.300> in

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
this up grab your bowl pour it in

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.840 
this up grab your bowl pour it in
the<00:02:13.420> middle<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:14.290> should<00:02:14.680> be<00:02:14.830> pretty<00:02:15.400> decently

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
the middle it should be pretty decently

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.360 
the middle it should be pretty decently
consistent<00:02:16.540> i<00:02:16.750> recommend<00:02:17.650> maybe<00:02:17.800> mixing<00:02:18.220> it

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
consistent i recommend maybe mixing it

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.920 
consistent i recommend maybe mixing it
up<00:02:18.459> a<00:02:18.640> little<00:02:18.880> bit<00:02:19.120> before<00:02:19.269> you<00:02:19.540> throw<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.840> in

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
up a little bit before you throw it in

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.259 
up a little bit before you throw it in
there<00:02:20.080> just<00:02:20.290> so<00:02:20.470> all<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.800> Oh<00:02:20.830> sir<00:02:21.190> not<00:02:22.090> at<00:02:22.180> the

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
there just so all the Oh sir not at the

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.170 
there just so all the Oh sir not at the
bottom<00:02:22.660> or<00:02:22.810> whatnot<00:02:23.019> so<00:02:23.440> shimmy<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.580> around<00:02:24.850> I

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
bottom or whatnot so shimmy it around I

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.540 
bottom or whatnot so shimmy it around I
guess<00:02:25.239> I'll<00:02:26.230> make<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.590> perfect<00:02:26.920> pancake

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
guess I'll make it a perfect pancake

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.800 
guess I'll make it a perfect pancake
because<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:27.850> should<00:02:28.060> fill<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.420> bottom<00:02:28.720> of

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
because it should fill the bottom of

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.350 
because it should fill the bottom of
your<00:02:28.840> pants

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
your pants

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.960 
your pants
and<00:02:29.870> there<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.710> looks<00:02:30.890> pretty<00:02:31.130> damn<00:02:31.340> good<00:02:31.610> so

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
and there it looks pretty damn good so

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.460 
and there it looks pretty damn good so
we're<00:02:32.270> going<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.450> throw<00:02:32.510> cover<00:02:32.900> on<00:02:33.110> it<00:02:33.140> here

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
we're going to throw cover on it here

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.740 
we're going to throw cover on it here
the<00:02:34.160> idea<00:02:34.430> is<00:02:34.490> to<00:02:34.850> cook<00:02:35.030> fully<00:02:35.360> through<00:02:35.660> the

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
the idea is to cook fully through the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.920 
the idea is to cook fully through the
pancake<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.470> not<00:02:36.650> just<00:02:37.580> side<00:02:37.820> by<00:02:37.970> side<00:02:38.210> so<00:02:38.840> the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
pancake and not just side by side so the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.510 
pancake and not just side by side so the
cover<00:02:39.140> will<00:02:39.470> keep<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.710> heat<00:02:39.950> in<00:02:40.100> and<00:02:40.400> now<00:02:40.490> I

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
cover will keep the heat in and now I

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.190 
cover will keep the heat in and now I
always<00:02:40.850> check<00:02:41.240> it<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.690> make<00:02:41.720> sure<00:02:41.870> if<00:02:42.080> it's

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
always check it to make sure if it's

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.600 
always check it to make sure if it's
ready<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.500> cook<00:02:42.620> or<00:02:42.770> not<00:02:42.890> I<00:02:42.920> pull<00:02:43.250> up<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.400> top

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
ready to cook or not I pull up the top

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.340 
ready to cook or not I pull up the top
and<00:02:43.820> I<00:02:43.910> just<00:02:44.120> move<00:02:44.300> around<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.660> pan<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.260> little

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
and I just move around the pan a little

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.500 
and I just move around the pan a little
bit<00:02:45.680> there's<00:02:46.160> liquid<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:46.850> needs<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.210> cook<00:02:47.360> a

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
bit there's liquid it needs to cook a

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.390 
bit there's liquid it needs to cook a
little<00:02:47.630> bit<00:02:47.720> more<00:02:47.960> before<00:02:48.140> flipping<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.800> so

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
little bit more before flipping it so

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.250 
little bit more before flipping it so
throw<00:02:49.610> that<00:02:49.790> top<00:02:49.940> back<00:02:50.150> on<00:02:50.330> there<00:02:50.600> come<00:02:51.080> back

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
throw that top back on there come back

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.350 
throw that top back on there come back
in<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.470> minute<00:02:51.650> or<00:02:51.830> two<00:02:51.980> now<00:02:52.970> we're<00:02:53.120> ready<00:02:53.150> to

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
in a minute or two now we're ready to

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.630 
in a minute or two now we're ready to
flip<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:53.750> so<00:02:54.530> it's<00:02:54.620> simple<00:02:54.920> enough<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.340> just<00:02:55.550> use

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
flip it so it's simple enough I just use

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.120 
flip it so it's simple enough I just use
a<00:02:55.670> pretty<00:02:56.000> damn<00:02:56.209> big<00:02:56.480> spatula<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.410> I<00:02:57.920> just

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
a pretty damn big spatula and I just

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.100 
a pretty damn big spatula and I just
scoop<00:02:58.280> right<00:02:58.610> under<00:02:58.940> kind<00:02:59.630> of<00:02:59.690> turn<00:02:59.810> the<00:02:59.870> pan<00:03:00.080> a
