00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.869
 it's our goal 

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:12.179
 whenever I like times I like 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.919
 over the television 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:15.089
 was with us 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.169
 April appointed 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:19.329
 by Simone Rau 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:23.109
 what the people here are or have been in the DTM 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.849
 although it also attracts me 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.009
 I do not think so 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.430
 was very romantic Obama on 4 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.430
 that a player feels at home one would also have to be that 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.980
 the hollywood couple 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.820
 why the second division out 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.170
 chronic stress 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.400
 No, I was something where the insurers closed 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.140
 - Boy 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.430
 for the time being 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.890
 I recommend his own words 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.060
 the storyline in the Northrend 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.060
 So let me have one way or the other 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.670
 BÃ¶hler as 10,000 spectators 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.670
 this did not hold properly 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.490
 Finances that work individually 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.490
 Dr 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.610
 Dr 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.070
 Hofheim 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.400
 Dr 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.500
 remains unchanged 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.800
 no 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.800
 image 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.610
 here you will see it 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.610
 8 can 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.060
 that is very good 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.019
 May 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.149
 from Haller is that she him 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:13.449
 but probably too long 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:17.529
 the only sure thing is that it is in the national interest without my having fun 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:26.729
 but still high 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.529
 on 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:36.529
 from Seda first time 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:43.129
 ca 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.129
 fully cool skier not in sight 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.849
 on 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:03.809
 it is probably better my players 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.589
 r 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:09.589
 b 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.719
 30 000 people murdered 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:37.529
 b 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:46.029
 Red 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.959
 keel 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:56.430
 nothing is always nice
