00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:41.870
 pazzini km from new york near lake clement hotel jiva lille to hotel 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.850
 of contemporary luxury realized in black and if you are in the heart of the mountains 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.830
 swore 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.850
 for clarey started small 17 hours on the main building of 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:53.530
 the hotel 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.710
 to a third tonight in the canal at the pool the country for this the salons 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.420
 with his disposition he is one of the famous Argentine players jean-philippe 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.160
 nuel who assigned the interior design today is the day 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.850
 presentation to the press 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.570
 and this gallery is the center of the project 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.020
 the idea when the weather is nice is that it opens up that it is permeable on the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.240
 pool that is right behind 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.830
 of his series which are metal mesh side we do not want to 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.090
 to enter a middle of a lobby of violent in lyon tomorrow so it was necessary 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.799
 both enjoy this space but also know Tunisia 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.410
 jean-philippe nuel he is a master in the arrangement of interiors 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.650
 contemporary 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.200
 for fifteen years he has signed the decoration of a hundred rebels 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.200
 and will remain so 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.190
 the ibis hotel's restaurant writes on the same story as 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.250
 the entirety of the hotel itself 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.010
 in fact the idea I want I thought to myself is that people who could come 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.380
 of Geneva in the evening for men so for dinner in this place of life and he 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.900
 had to find an atmosphere quite felted fluid but also the 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.160
 poetry that's what we tried to do through the play on the light 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.750
 through a chimney so do 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.779
 to have a place to 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:12.589
 the stage the privileges 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:15.589
 it's pretty rare 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:19.639
 the visit continues in the rooms with other finds 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.480
 so why me what struck me was this city 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.869
 hence the desire to put the book face the week 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:30.809
 so already in laon and outside the teulier code completely completely trick 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:31.590
 classical 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.940
 to have fun drawing specifically for the project and its 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.560
 plans for small frames still the view when one is from the bed this is the 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.580
 house all that we could pursue the lfc the object that what 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.419
 worth the case to set the score 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:44.120
 on the table 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.079
 but it would be very easy to decline it by being mayor 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.539
 by being 100% on this level that I'm from the runner 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:53.009
 he proposed in edition 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:55.069
 I design the interior designer that the species 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.069
 Valdes illustration of expectations 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.999
 kinds of ways of conscious waiting for that it's unconscious 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:05.599
 and all of a sudden feel good about trying to meet his expectations these 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.819
 expectations intentions then I was talking about the game 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.459
 of the game with the outside in the room but it is also the game with 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.039
 outside in the bathroom 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:16.139
 the tub in the center and then at the shower time the species of 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.699
 put aside a little glamorous like that 16 32 or I understand the emotion 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.689
 dimensioned to two places 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.680
 always in a project is a touch of glamor 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.879
 sensuality and reasoning we only imagined his wife 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.409
 why not in the shower but two and again it's the stuff we found 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:37.619
 not at home and m but that too is the dream 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:40.989
 because we have to try to give change in his 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.989
 I hope this makes us dream the shower of all 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.969
 a few weeks ago 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.389
 it's a bit harsh that the lawyer's are not the same 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.359
 Sunday I do not want more 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.159
 surprise him change habits 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.249
 the important thing is to get rid of the usual codes of the city hall 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.759
 whereas at that time we simply know how to be in phase with our 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:07.340
 time 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.619
 a cloud 

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:10.180
 in a hotel room 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.200
 in the old palace for example we have very large rooms and all of a 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.470
 blow we have a bathroom equipped with a small bathroom in 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.630
 his corner and today of the hall scene and emotion a thousand of 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.970
 relaxing rest and therefore a living room in its own right 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.680
 rest
