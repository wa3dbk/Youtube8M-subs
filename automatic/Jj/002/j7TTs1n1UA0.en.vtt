 with victory 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:38.030
 it would be difficult to imagine a painting of the river Paraíba 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.189
 without the presence of the herons 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:42.689

 but it is not only the crew of the boats that contemplate this landscape 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.240
 one of the daily directions of the children of the 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.669

 nature is to run another ordinary circle 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:59.839
 but for viewers 

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:02.830
 poor production experience
