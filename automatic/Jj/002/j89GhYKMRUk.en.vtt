00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:15.280
 this fourth video will deal with the whose 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:18.820
 literal translation is hard material yes 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.810
 in practice it deals with the hardware that is 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.710
 of all the pieces of metal 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.509
 classical silicon et cetera composing 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.420
 materially the computer 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.900
 wanting to make a comparison we can say 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.730
 that the hardware matches 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.879
 the car while the software and 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.000
 corresponds to the driver 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:46.559
 in the second video of this video course 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.379
 we compared the human brain 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.850
 to the cpi we need to point out 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:57.909
 some details for example we have to 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.720
 to distinguish between organ and apparatus for 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:04.869
 understand the pavilion is an organ 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.260
 while the whole auditory system is a 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.829
 then the auditory apparatus e 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.520
 composed of external ear ear 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:18.340
 middle and inner ear which then comes 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.060
 connected to the brain thanks to the nerve 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.450
 auditive 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.429
 all this apparatus allows us to 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.979
 hear or listen to the external environment 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:33.100
 in the same way the microphone does not 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.979
 connects directly with the ACI more but 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.609
 is connected with a jack to the card 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:42.700
 audio the sound card connects with the 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:46.090
 motherboard that contains the cpi e 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.329
 so it interconnects everything obviously 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.719
 the sound card will allow over that 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:55.869
 the input then the microphone also output 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:59.380
 that is the use of a headset or 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:02.560
 a speaker just connect it to the 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.929
 green jack 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.990
 ultimately all the peripherals 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.250
 external two cables must be connected 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.470
 to the card but 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.400
 say that it is contained in the unit of 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.380
 system or central unit indicated with the 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.270
 number 3 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.500
 obviously if a peripheral is of the type 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:26.110
 wireless for example mouse or keyboard not 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.050
 will need the connection cable in 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.800
 what will happen all by waves 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.500
 electromagnetic 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.010
 here for example a motherboard to which 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.100
 then the c will be mounted plus the eventual ones 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.310
 video cards memory banks 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.070
 etc 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.020
 this instead is the inside of a computer 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.420
 is already complete 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.930
 we see that in the motherboard is already 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.680
 mounted the processor the video card 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.450
 memory banks and the due e 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.030
 connections and here is the inside of mine 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.100
 computer after removing the panel 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.070
 to kate 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.550
 let's see the different components together 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:09.100
 let's start from the cayce someone confuses 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.800
 the keys with the central unit 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.650
 in fact the keys is only the 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.060
 box the plastic container e 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.580
 metal that contains the central unit 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:25.150
 ie power supply motherboard e 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.580
 disks and so on normally in the 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.209
 car part of the cache we find 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.790
 the power supply that draws current 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.079
 electricity from the network and then the 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.430
 distributes properly treated is 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:42.340
 transformed to the various components 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.950
 of the central unit circled in red 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.829
 we see the motherboard with all the 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.070
 already assembled components this is the 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:53.530
 processor with heat sink e 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.799
 the cooling fan 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.360
 the video card a card for 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.510
 the acquisition of 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.870
 I by cameras two blocks of 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.390
 ram memory two hard disks or disks 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.300
 rigid a dvd player and a 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.710
 burner a card reader of 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.780
 memory and here are a couple of views 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:19.799
 outer back is the inner side 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.269
 of a central and generic unit 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.600
 this instead is a scheme 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.640
 central unit assembly as 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.090
 see the motherboard after having 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.590
 received the copper, the more the cards 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.640
 video and so on 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:38.940
 it must be inserted in the keys , which it belongs to 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.500
 time will also contain the hard disks i 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.250
 solid disks and readers o 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.030
 dvd burners 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.919
 but back to my computer for 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.419
 show you how to do them 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.090
 connections 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.020
 this is the rear view of the unit 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.600
 central 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.800
 this is the connection to the network 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.870
 electric and is located near 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.900
 to the power supply of the central unit 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.960
 these are mouse connections and 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.590
 keyboard involves ps2 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.140
 today I am very much in use mouse and keyboard 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.500
 with usb port 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:22.350
 this one in yellowish is instead the 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.600
 Ethernet connection that allows the 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.290
 internet connection 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:31.580
 slightly to the left in white la 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:34.770
 USB connection of my printer 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.140
 also those indicated by the arrow are 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.419
 other usb ports 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.430
 I inform you that you can get other doors 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:44.190
 also find in the front 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:48.180
 of the central unit I will observe you 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:51.200
 than in the part circled in red 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:55.169
 find the input output ports 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:58.229
 related to the motherboard while in the 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:01.220
 part circled in blue found the doors 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:04.930
 related to any cards 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:07.400
 additional this is the vga connection 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.980
 related to the monitor 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.700
 I note that it is connected with one 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:15.680
 graphic card I added 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.830
 in fact, looking more in detail 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.370
 you can see that one was planned 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.860
 also carries vga in the motherboard 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.410
 this as motherboards today 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:31.910
 they normally have a video card 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:34.850
 integrated an integrated sound card a 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:37.550
 integrated network card and so on 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.980
 but I wanted some more 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:43.520
 characteristics with regard to the 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:46.280
 graphic and then I bought a card 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:49.730
 video instead of using the card 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.080
 integrated video that has the indicated port 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.850
 by the arrow 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.020
 this is also a card that has 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:59.270
 added for video capture 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.850
 with leads to do it 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:05.060
 returning to the motherboard we find the 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.960
 parallel port for the connection of 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.380
 printers 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:12.290
 today, however, almost all printers have 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:15.410
 a connection with usb port 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:18.650
 always in the motherboard we find the 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:21.919
 sound card integrated with collectors 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:24.169
 aspi lotto audio connections yes 

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:26.270
 can also be found in the part 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:29.660
 front of the central unit 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:32.720
 if we wanted audio performance from 

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:35.810
 higher level we will have to provide to 

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:39.250
 buy and insert a good card 

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:42.440
 audio aside I think now not 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:45.350
 they should scare you all the more 

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.750
 wires and those connections you find 

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:50.020
 behind the central unit of yours 

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.020
 computer
