hello we're going to do a little

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.920 
hello we're going to do a little
demonstration<00:00:20.200> on<00:00:21.039> how<00:00:21.130> effective<00:00:22.000> the<00:00:22.119> PCCs

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
demonstration on how effective the PCCs

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.599 
demonstration on how effective the PCCs
unit<00:00:23.289> is<00:00:23.410> first<00:00:23.769> we're<00:00:24.039> going<00:00:24.130> to<00:00:24.189> compare<00:00:24.400> it

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:24.609 
unit is first we're going to compare it

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:26.519 
unit is first we're going to compare it
to<00:00:24.699> traditional<00:00:25.330> tap<00:00:25.510> butter<00:00:25.810> then<00:00:26.380> we're

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
to traditional tap butter then we're

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:27.870 
to traditional tap butter then we're
going<00:00:26.650> to<00:00:26.710> compare<00:00:27.070> it<00:00:27.189> to<00:00:27.279> reverse<00:00:27.640> osmosis

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
going to compare it to reverse osmosis

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.720 
going to compare it to reverse osmosis
water<00:00:28.509> and<00:00:28.810> then<00:00:29.230> of<00:00:29.349> course<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:29.769> PCCs<00:00:30.460> unit

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
water and then of course the PCCs unit

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.640 
water and then of course the PCCs unit
now<00:00:31.060> i<00:00:31.090> do<00:00:31.179> want<00:00:31.420> to<00:00:31.449> point<00:00:31.509> out<00:00:31.839> i<00:00:32.019> have<00:00:32.500> it

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
now i do want to point out i have it

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.770 
now i do want to point out i have it
well<00:00:32.890> that's<00:00:33.519> why<00:00:33.760> i<00:00:33.790> have<00:00:34.000> a<00:00:34.030> reverse<00:00:34.570> osmosis

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
well that's why i have a reverse osmosis

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.009 
well that's why i have a reverse osmosis
system<00:00:35.650> in<00:00:35.830> my<00:00:36.460> home<00:00:36.730> take<00:00:37.449> a<00:00:37.480> look<00:00:37.690> at<00:00:37.839> this

look at that nice blue color I'm telling
you<00:02:04.139> balance<00:02:05.139> pH<00:02:05.560> is<00:02:05.859> what<00:02:06.310> comes<00:02:06.490> out<00:02:06.670> here

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
you balance pH is what comes out here

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:08.279 
you balance pH is what comes out here
faucet<00:02:07.270> if<00:02:07.359> you<00:02:07.450> have<00:02:07.600> municipal<00:02:07.780> water

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
faucet if you have municipal water

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.290 
faucet if you have municipal water
that's<00:02:08.890> probably<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.490> pH<00:02:09.970> that<00:02:10.149> you're

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
that's probably the pH that you're

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.449 
that's probably the pH that you're
getting<00:02:10.420> out<00:02:10.630> of<00:02:10.720> here<00:02:10.780> that<00:02:11.410> if<00:02:11.770> you<00:02:12.250> drink

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
getting out of here that if you drink

bottled water or reverse osmosis this is

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.070 
bottled water or reverse osmosis this is
what<00:02:15.040> you're<00:02:15.190> getting<00:02:15.430> acidic<00:02:16.090> water<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:16.570> if

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
what you're getting acidic water and if

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.110 
what you're getting acidic water and if

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
you run that same water through the PCCs

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.420 
you run that same water through the PCCs
you

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
you

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.209 
you
instantly<00:02:20.269> changes<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.650> kind<00:02:21.859> of<00:02:21.980> pH

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:22.219 
instantly changes it to the kind of pH

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:24.399 
instantly changes it to the kind of pH
water<00:02:22.519> that<00:02:23.120> you<00:02:23.269> need<00:02:23.450> now<00:02:23.900> I'm<00:02:24.079> going<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.290> do
