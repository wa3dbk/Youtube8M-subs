another<00:02:49.650> one<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:49.920> made<00:02:50.159> this<00:02:50.489> is<00:02:50.760> just<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.480> bit

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
another one I made this is just a bit

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.979 
another one I made this is just a bit
more<00:02:51.780> elaborate<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.439> made<00:02:53.069> it<00:02:53.099> to<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.549> will<00:02:53.989> just

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
more elaborate I made it to it will just

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.470 
more elaborate I made it to it will just
go<00:02:55.260> along<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.890> row<00:02:56.099> just<00:02:56.609> I<00:02:56.909> just<00:02:57.090> think<00:02:57.389> that

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
go along the row just I just think that

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.429 
go along the row just I just think that
looks<00:02:57.689> kind<00:02:57.959> of<00:02:57.989> cool<00:02:58.170> and<00:03:00.049> yeah<00:03:01.049> I<00:03:01.079> just<00:03:01.200> did

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
looks kind of cool and yeah I just did

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.410 
looks kind of cool and yeah I just did
that<00:03:01.650> by<00:03:02.870> putting<00:03:03.870> these<00:03:04.230> rows<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.859> these

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
that by putting these rows of these

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.420 
that by putting these rows of these
redstone<00:03:06.420> repeaters<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.310> having<00:03:08.310> them

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
redstone repeaters and having them

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.429 
redstone repeaters and having them
spread<00:03:08.819> out<00:03:08.849> as<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.299> go<00:03:09.329> down<00:03:09.629> you<00:03:09.689> can<00:03:10.019> you

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
spread out as you go down you can you

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.849 
spread out as you go down you can you
can<00:03:10.590> see<00:03:10.799> that<00:03:10.829> there<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:12.319> each<00:03:13.319> way<00:03:13.650> down

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.580 
can see that there and each way down
just<00:03:14.129> delays<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.430> bit<00:03:14.730> longer<00:03:15.079> and<00:03:16.079> that<00:03:16.319> just

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
just delays a bit longer and that just

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.270 
just delays a bit longer and that just
makes<00:03:16.769> it<00:03:17.069> just<00:03:17.810> gives<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:19.040> effect<00:03:20.040> of

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
makes it just gives it that effect of

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.610 
makes it just gives it that effect of
starting<00:03:21.150> here<00:03:21.389> and<00:03:21.480> then<00:03:21.569> working<00:03:22.260> its<00:03:22.500> way

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
starting here and then working its way

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.390 
starting here and then working its way
