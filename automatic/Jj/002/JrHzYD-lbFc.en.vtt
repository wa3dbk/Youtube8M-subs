00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
we're really proud of the Far Cry 2 map

we're really proud of the Far Cry 2 map
editor<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.740> we<00:00:08.610> worked<00:00:08.929> with<00:00:09.929> all<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.469> tools

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
editor and we worked with all the tools

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.150 
editor and we worked with all the tools
that<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.900> production<00:00:12.900> team<00:00:13.080> has<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.679> we

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
that the production team has and we

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.939 
that the production team has and we
really<00:00:14.610> tried<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.910> simplify<00:00:15.750> them<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.440> make

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
really tried to simplify them and make

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.400 
really tried to simplify them and make
them<00:00:17.160> really<00:00:17.480> powerful<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.600> accessible<00:00:19.140> for

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
them really powerful and accessible for

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.640 
them really powerful and accessible for
the<00:00:19.560> user<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.859> create<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:20.760> map<00:00:21.320> you<00:00:22.320> can<00:00:22.500> have

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
the user to create this map you can have

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.490 
the user to create this map you can have
taryn<00:00:23.220> tools<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.910> are<00:00:24.050> really<00:00:25.050> effective

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
taryn tools that are really effective

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.029 
taryn tools that are really effective
you<00:00:26.369> can<00:00:26.609> create<00:00:27.210> mountains<00:00:27.510> rivers<00:00:28.260> really

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
you can create mountains rivers really

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.429 
you can create mountains rivers really
easily<00:00:29.369> yet<00:00:29.730> we<00:00:29.970> have<00:00:30.090> an<00:00:30.269> erosion<00:00:31.050> tool<00:00:31.260> that

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
easily yet we have an erosion tool that

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.310 
easily yet we have an erosion tool that
we<00:00:31.710> are<00:00:32.009> really<00:00:32.399> proud<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:33.020> even<00:00:34.020> when<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
we are really proud of even when the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.060 
we are really proud of even when the
programmer<00:00:35.390> designed<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:37.770> rest<00:00:37.890> of

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
programmer designed that to the rest of

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.950 
programmer designed that to the rest of
the<00:00:38.190> production<00:00:38.430> wanted<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.210> tool<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.719> their

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the production wanted that tool in their

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.799 
the production wanted that tool in their
tools<00:00:40.320> because<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.160> was<00:00:41.370> not<00:00:41.579> there<00:00:42.329> at<00:00:42.570> first

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
tools because it was not there at first

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.920 
tools because it was not there at first
it<00:00:43.170> was<00:00:43.710> just<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.430> map<00:00:44.550> editor<00:00:44.780> we<00:00:45.780> also

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
it was just on the map editor we also

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.650 
it was just on the map editor we also
have<00:00:46.230> like<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.489> noise<00:00:47.489> tool<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.059> make<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
have like a noise tool that make the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.540 
have like a noise tool that make the
Turin<00:00:49.410> really<00:00:50.210> natural<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:52.250> if<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.399> combine

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
Turin really natural and if you combine

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.700 
Turin really natural and if you combine
that<00:00:53.789> with<00:00:54.149> all<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.449> collection<00:00:55.110> system<00:00:55.530> we

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
that with all the collection system we

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.240 
that with all the collection system we
have<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.879> collection<00:00:57.210> system<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.190> how<00:00:59.190> you

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
have is the collection system is how you

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.349 
have is the collection system is how you
create<00:00:59.760> really<00:01:00.629> natural<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:02.359> really

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
create really natural and really

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.810 
create really natural and really
realistic<00:01:03.780> biome<00:01:04.500> such<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.280> jungle

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
realistic biome such as the jungle

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.130 
realistic biome such as the jungle
savannah<00:01:06.500> hour<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.890> month<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.930> kind<00:01:09.930> of

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
savannah hour a month in and kind of

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.140 
savannah hour a month in and kind of
look<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.659> we<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.780> algorithms<00:01:13.250> for<00:01:14.250> planting

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
look so we have algorithms for planting

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.200 
look so we have algorithms for planting
trees<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.840> then<00:01:16.380> bushes<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.189> grass<00:01:17.220> that

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
trees and then bushes and grass that

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.679 
trees and then bushes and grass that
really<00:01:18.750> fits<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.920> Africa<00:01:20.280> biomes<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
really fits in the Africa biomes so the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.890 
really fits in the Africa biomes so the
map<00:01:21.840> editor<00:01:21.990> for<00:01:22.470> far<00:01:22.650> cry<00:01:22.680> 2<00:01:22.939> really<00:01:23.939> gives

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
map editor for far cry 2 really gives

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.520 
map editor for far cry 2 really gives
the<00:01:25.890> user<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:27.000> possibility<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.840> move<00:01:28.140> make

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the user the possibility to move make

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.020 
the user the possibility to move make
all<00:01:28.799> four<00:01:29.310> game<00:01:30.030> modes<00:01:30.270> from<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.259> multiplier

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
all four game modes from the multiplier

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.929 
all four game modes from the multiplier
so<00:01:33.030> player<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:34.049> user<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.619> do<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> deathmatch<00:01:35.369> a

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
so player a user can do a deathmatch a

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.109 
so player a user can do a deathmatch a
map<00:01:36.479> can<00:01:37.140> do<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> team<00:01:37.710> deathmatch<00:01:38.070> capture<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
map can do a team deathmatch capture the

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.569 
map can do a team deathmatch capture the
diamond<00:01:39.540> when<00:01:39.869> uprising<00:01:40.470> map<00:01:40.619> or<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.400> do<00:01:41.549> a

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
diamond when uprising map or we can do a

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.819 
diamond when uprising map or we can do a
map<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:41.850> combines<00:01:42.570> those<00:01:42.840> two<00:01:43.170> or<00:01:43.409> three<00:01:43.649> or

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
map that combines those two or three or

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.830 
map that combines those two or three or
four<00:01:44.070> modes<00:01:44.280> at<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> same<00:01:44.850> time<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
four modes at the same time like the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.190 
four modes at the same time like the
same<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.290> we<00:01:46.560> do<00:01:46.770> with<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.070> retail<00:01:47.430> maps<00:01:48.200> yes

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
same that we do with the retail maps yes

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.880 
same that we do with the retail maps yes
he<00:01:49.950> has<00:01:50.070> all<00:01:50.700> almost<00:01:51.479> all<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.200> assets<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.710> we

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
he has all almost all the assets that we

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.889 
he has all almost all the assets that we
use<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> multiplayer<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
use on the multiplayer and the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.429 
use on the multiplayer and the
single-player<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.890> can<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:56.340> objects

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
single-player so you can have objects

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.370 
single-player so you can have objects
such<00:01:58.439> as<00:01:58.469> like<00:01:59.360> architectural<00:02:00.380> objects

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
such as like architectural objects

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.910 
such as like architectural objects
houses<00:02:02.219> church<00:02:03.320> vehicles<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.680> have

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
houses church vehicles you can have

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.639 
houses church vehicles you can have
dynamic<00:02:05.189> objects<00:02:05.969> like<00:02:06.259> explosive<00:02:07.259> barrel

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
dynamic objects like explosive barrel

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.499 
dynamic objects like explosive barrel
the<00:02:08.340> propane<00:02:08.729> tank

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
the propane tank

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.899 
the propane tank
really<00:02:09.810> sets<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.500> grass<00:02:10.709> on<00:02:10.950> fire<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.730> all

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
really sets the grass on fire to all

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.789 
really sets the grass on fire to all
those<00:02:12.150> cool<00:02:12.480> elements<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.170> we<00:02:13.319> have<00:02:13.470> in<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
those cool elements that we have in the

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.619 
those cool elements that we have in the
game<00:02:14.040> even<00:02:14.670> either<00:02:14.939> in<00:02:15.180> single-player

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
game even either in single-player

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
map after that when he creates his math

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.839 
map after that when he creates his math
he<00:02:22.290> can<00:02:22.560> either<00:02:22.860> share<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.610> with<00:02:23.760> the

can download the tons of maps that you

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.900 
can download the tons of maps that you
cannot<00:03:35.220> play<00:03:35.400> with<00:03:35.669> so<00:03:36.209> we<00:03:36.480> really<00:03:36.900> work<00:03:37.079> on

cannot play with so we really work on
building<00:03:38.910> good<00:03:39.449> validation<00:03:40.109> tools<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:41.160> for

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
building good validation tools so for

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.530 
building good validation tools so for
example<00:03:41.340> if<00:03:41.819> you<00:03:41.940> want<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.239> create<00:03:42.449> a

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
example if you want to create a

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.400 
example if you want to create a
deathmatch<00:03:43.280> map<00:03:44.280> or<00:03:44.900> capture<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.019> diamond

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
deathmatch map or capture the diamond

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.319 
deathmatch map or capture the diamond
maps<00:03:46.620> which<00:03:46.949> is<00:03:47.129> like<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.489> kind<00:03:47.699> of<00:03:47.790> capture

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
maps which is like to kind of capture

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.680 
maps which is like to kind of capture
the<00:03:48.480> flag<00:03:48.599> with<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:48.989> few<00:03:49.290> flavor<00:03:50.480> there<00:03:51.480> are

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
the flag with a few flavor there are

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.879 
the flag with a few flavor there are
validation<00:03:52.940> sets<00:03:53.940> that<00:03:54.629> could<00:03:55.199> work<00:03:55.349> for<00:03:55.409> each

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
validation sets that could work for each

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.189 
validation sets that could work for each
game<00:03:56.400> mode<00:03:56.609> so<00:03:56.879> if<00:03:57.030> you<00:03:57.239> were<00:03:57.480> building<00:03:57.930> a

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:58.199 
game mode so if you were building a

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:00.949 
game mode so if you were building a
deathmatch<00:03:58.560> map<00:03:58.949> then<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.940> engine<00:04:00.239> will<00:04:00.389> make

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
deathmatch map then the engine will make

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.020 
deathmatch map then the engine will make
sure<00:04:01.139> that<00:04:01.349> you<00:04:01.470> have<00:04:01.590> at<00:04:01.739> least<00:04:01.919> had<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.819> good

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
sure that you have at least had a good

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.770 
sure that you have at least had a good
number<00:04:03.209> of<00:04:03.569> spawn<00:04:04.349> point<00:04:04.620> for<00:04:04.949> 16<00:04:05.489> player

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
number of spawn point for 16 player

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.110 
number of spawn point for 16 player
match<00:04:06.780> if<00:04:07.470> you<00:04:07.709> have<00:04:08.040> a<00:04:08.069> captured<00:04:08.609> the<00:04:08.729> diamond

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
match if you have a captured the diamond

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.630 
match if you have a captured the diamond
mat

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640

then<00:04:10.270> the<00:04:10.630> tool<00:04:11.470> will<00:04:11.500> make<00:04:11.860> sure<00:04:12.069> that<00:04:12.280> you

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
then the tool will make sure that you

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.380 
then the tool will make sure that you
have<00:04:13.180> at<00:04:13.480> least<00:04:13.660> a<00:04:13.959> two<00:04:14.260> flag<00:04:14.560> station<00:04:14.800> and<00:04:15.390> 16

because<00:04:28.660> you<00:04:28.990> work<00:04:29.200> on<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:30.130> tool<00:04:30.370> tearing

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
because you work on the tool tearing

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.630 
because you work on the tool tearing
that<00:04:31.500> you<00:04:32.500> worked<00:04:32.710> on<00:04:32.830> the<00:04:32.919> terrain<00:04:33.130> after<00:04:33.490> you

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
that you worked on the terrain after you

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.820 
that you worked on the terrain after you
spawn<00:04:33.940> your<00:04:34.210> points<00:04:34.570> then<00:04:35.169> it<00:04:35.320> will<00:04:35.440> give<00:04:35.680> you

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
spawn your points then it will give you

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.010 
spawn your points then it will give you
an<00:04:36.010> error<00:04:36.190> and<00:04:36.550> will<00:04:36.760> really<00:04:37.419> bring<00:04:37.750> you

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
an error and will really bring you

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.620 
an error and will really bring you
straight<00:04:38.740> to<00:04:39.160> that<00:04:39.190> specific<00:04:39.910> spawn<00:04:40.360> point

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
straight to that specific spawn point

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.390 
straight to that specific spawn point
that<00:04:40.810> is<00:04:40.960> like<00:04:41.200> a<00:04:41.230> cross<00:04:41.470> the<00:04:41.650> ground<00:04:41.890> so<00:04:42.370> you

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
that is like a cross the ground so you

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.280 
that is like a cross the ground so you
don't<00:04:43.030> have<00:04:43.150> the<00:04:43.330> surprise<00:04:43.720> when<00:04:43.960> you<00:04:44.080> play

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
don't have the surprise when you play

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.140 
don't have the surprise when you play
them<00:04:44.440> had<00:04:44.590> that<00:04:44.770> you<00:04:45.010> spawn<00:04:45.370> and<00:04:45.610> you<00:04:45.730> like

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
them had that you spawn and you like

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.740 
them had that you spawn and you like
fall<00:04:46.630> in<00:04:47.640> nowhere<00:04:48.640> so<00:04:49.210> this<00:04:49.419> is<00:04:49.570> really

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
fall in nowhere so this is really

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.300 
fall in nowhere so this is really
something<00:04:50.080> that<00:04:50.320> the<00:04:50.560> tool<00:04:50.770> gives<00:04:51.070> you

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
something that the tool gives you

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.970 
something that the tool gives you
exactly<00:04:51.820> the<00:04:52.270> right<00:04:52.540> messages<00:04:53.080> to<00:04:53.590> know<00:04:53.710> okay

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
exactly the right messages to know okay

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.830 
exactly the right messages to know okay
I'm<00:04:54.160> missing<00:04:54.580> this<00:04:54.760> and<00:04:55.060> then<00:04:55.450> after<00:04:55.720> that

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
when I fix that problem then my map will

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.270 
when I fix that problem then my map will
be<00:04:58.330> good<00:04:58.480> for<00:04:58.540> playing<00:04:59.020> with<00:04:59.200> that<00:04:59.380> mode<00:04:59.650> what

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280

you look at what the players can do with
it<00:05:19.150> all<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:19.660> assets<00:05:19.960> because<00:05:20.110> we<00:05:20.260> have

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
it all the assets because we have

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
thousands of the object and that map

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.409 
thousands of the object and that map
editor<00:05:22.560> player<00:05:23.560> can<00:05:24.070> do<00:05:24.280> anything<00:05:24.700> I've<00:05:25.120> seen

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419

like<00:05:25.690> subway<00:05:26.169> station<00:05:26.650> we've<00:05:26.919> seen<00:05:27.280> port

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
like subway station we've seen port

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.159 
like subway station we've seen port
we've<00:05:28.030> seen<00:05:28.950> construction<00:05:29.950> site<00:05:30.190> based<00:05:30.790> on

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
we've seen construction site based on

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.659 
we've seen construction site based on
the<00:05:32.169> assets<00:05:32.590> that<00:05:32.740> we<00:05:32.890> have<00:05:33.010> in<00:05:33.130> a<00:05:33.220> game<00:05:33.460> that

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
the assets that we have in a game that

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.330 
the assets that we have in a game that
are<00:05:33.850> really<00:05:34.300> not<00:05:34.479> related<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.229> those<00:05:35.830> subject

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
are really not related to those subject

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.850 
are really not related to those subject
so<00:05:36.700> it's<00:05:36.850> really<00:05:37.030> good<00:05:37.270> and<00:05:37.419> I'm<00:05:37.690> eager<00:05:38.410> to<00:05:38.680> see

so it's really good and I'm eager to see
everything<00:05:39.430> will<00:05:39.760> find<00:05:40.060> in<00:05:40.210> that<00:05:40.240> that<00:05:40.960> map

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
everything will find in that that map

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.220 
everything will find in that that map
editor<00:05:41.320> it's<00:05:41.710> really<00:05:42.040> cool
