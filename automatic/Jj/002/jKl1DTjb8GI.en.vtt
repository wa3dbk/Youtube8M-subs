00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.220 
you 60 unstable I so eight so we're
going<00:02:13.820> to<00:02:13.940> go<00:02:14.000> ahead<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.360> advance<00:02:14.480> forward<00:02:14.990> in

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
going to go ahead and advance forward in

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.610 
going to go ahead and advance forward in
time<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.800> eight<00:02:16.340> hours<00:02:16.700> later<00:02:16.960> we<00:02:17.960> finish<00:02:18.410> the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
time and eight hours later we finish the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.340 
time and eight hours later we finish the
research<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:20.180> we<00:02:20.300> get<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.540> stealth<00:02:21.050> filled

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
research so we get that stealth filled

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.040 
research so we get that stealth filled
and<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:21.770> can<00:02:21.920> be<00:02:22.040> found<00:02:22.250> in<00:02:22.460> the<00:02:22.580> store<00:02:22.840> then<00:02:23.840> on

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
and it can be found in the store then on

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.590 
and it can be found in the store then on

you must compete in five PvP battles

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.370 
you must compete in five PvP battles
actually<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:50.270> only<00:02:50.360> have<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.690> complete<00:02:51.110> them

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
actually you only have to complete them

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.560 
actually you only have to complete them
you<00:02:52.040> don't<00:02:52.250> even<00:02:52.400> have<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:52.640> win<00:02:52.940> them<00:02:53.150> just<00:02:53.420> go

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
you don't even have to win them just go

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.170

can spend ten gold to finish now the

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.390 
can spend ten gold to finish now the
very<00:02:59.480> next<00:02:59.690> task<00:03:00.020> you<00:03:00.260> must<00:03:00.290> get<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.890> stores<00:03:01.190> of

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
very next task you must get to stores of

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.540 
very next task you must get to stores of
mastery<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.060> mission<00:03:02.660> 1<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.220> that's<00:03:04.220> pretty

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
mastery and mission 1 and that's pretty

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.250 
mastery and mission 1 and that's pretty
easy<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:05.150> do<00:03:05.330> so<00:03:05.570> you<00:03:05.630> shouldn't<00:03:05.930> have<00:03:06.080> too

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
easy to do so you shouldn't have too

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.170 
easy to do so you shouldn't have too
many<00:03:06.380> problems<00:03:06.650> completing<00:03:07.280> this<00:03:07.610> as<00:03:07.850> soon<00:03:08.030> as

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
many problems completing this as soon as

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.590 
many problems completing this as soon as
it<00:03:08.300> pops<00:03:08.480> up<00:03:09.220> now<00:03:10.220> test<00:03:10.580> number<00:03:10.730> 10<00:03:11.180> you<00:03:11.390> must

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
it pops up now test number 10 you must

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.410 
it pops up now test number 10 you must
use<00:03:11.870> Aires<00:03:12.320> in<00:03:12.530> combat<00:03:13.220> when<00:03:13.910> I<00:03:13.940> completed

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
use Aires in combat when I completed

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.210 
use Aires in combat when I completed
this<00:03:14.660> task<00:03:14.900> Ares<00:03:15.440> just<00:03:15.470> showed<00:03:15.830> up<00:03:16.010> in<00:03:16.130> the

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
this task Ares just showed up in the

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.790 
this task Ares just showed up in the
very<00:03:16.459> first<00:03:16.760> battle<00:03:17.120> I<00:03:17.209> clicked<00:03:17.480> on<00:03:17.630> it<00:03:17.930> was

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
very first battle I clicked on it was

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.800 
very first battle I clicked on it was
just<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.100> medium<00:03:19.489> threat<00:03:19.820> battle<00:03:20.270> and<00:03:20.420> he<00:03:20.630> was<00:03:20.780> a

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
just a medium threat battle and he was a

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.020 
just a medium threat battle and he was a
team<00:03:21.080> up<00:03:21.290> so<00:03:21.860> it<00:03:22.010> seems<00:03:22.310> like<00:03:22.520> they<00:03:22.670> make<00:03:22.880> this

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
team up so it seems like they make this

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.930 
team up so it seems like they make this
one<00:03:23.239> pretty<00:03:23.570> easy<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:24.110> complete<00:03:24.440> as<00:03:24.590> well<00:03:24.940> then

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
one pretty easy to complete as well then

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.550 
one pretty easy to complete as well then
you're<00:03:26.239> given<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.540> blueprint<00:03:27.110> for<00:03:27.320> Power

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
you're given the blueprint for Power

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
you're given the blueprint for Power
Cell<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.750> 1000<00:03:29.750> silver<00:03:30.110> the<00:03:30.890> Power<00:03:31.160> Cell<00:03:31.430> is

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
Cell and 1000 silver the Power Cell is

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.190 
Cell and 1000 silver the Power Cell is
actually<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.060> first<00:03:32.090> set<00:03:32.630> item<00:03:32.930> from<00:03:33.140> the

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
actually the first set item from the

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.050 
actually the first set item from the
vindication<00:03:33.769> set<00:03:34.280> so<00:03:35.269> you<00:03:35.330> already<00:03:35.570> have<00:03:35.780> 105

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
vindication set so you already have 105

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.479 
vindication set so you already have 105
but<00:03:38.060> it<00:03:38.180> is<00:03:38.330> upgradable<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.350> that<00:03:40.040> leads<00:03:40.310> us

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
but it is upgradable and that leads us

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.750 
but it is upgradable and that leads us
to<00:03:40.700> our<00:03:40.730> very<00:03:41.209> next<00:03:41.510> research<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.760> that's

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
to our very next research and that's

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.790 
to our very next research and that's
going<00:03:43.970> to<00:03:44.030> take<00:03:44.209> quite<00:03:44.660> a<00:03:44.720> while<00:03:44.870> like<00:03:45.350> normal

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
going to take quite a while like normal

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.890 
going to take quite a while like normal
it's<00:03:45.920> going<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.130> take<00:03:46.250> one<00:03:46.280> day<00:03:46.790> an<00:03:47.030> 80

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
it's going to take one day an 80

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.710 
it's going to take one day an 80
unstable<00:03:48.560> I<00:03:48.650> so<00:03:48.890> so<00:03:49.820> that's<00:03:50.060> going<00:03:50.239> to<00:03:50.300> be<00:03:50.360> test

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
unstable I so so that's going to be test

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.170 
unstable I so so that's going to be test
number<00:03:51.170> 11<00:03:51.200> and<00:03:51.800> the<00:03:52.070> last<00:03:52.310> task<00:03:52.640> for<00:03:53.030> this

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
number 11 and the last task for this

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.420 
number 11 and the last task for this
video<00:03:53.510> now<00:03:54.500> we're<00:03:54.620> going<00:03:54.739> to<00:03:54.800> briefly<00:03:55.160> show

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
video now we're going to briefly show

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.650 
video now we're going to briefly show
the<00:03:55.580> tasks<00:03:55.940> where<00:03:56.060> you<00:03:56.120> have<00:03:56.209> to<00:03:56.360> score<00:03:56.600> a

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
certain amount of points against the end

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.320 
certain amount of points against the end
bosses<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.750> first<00:04:00.050> one<00:04:00.350> you<00:04:00.470> have<00:04:00.620> to<00:04:00.739> score
