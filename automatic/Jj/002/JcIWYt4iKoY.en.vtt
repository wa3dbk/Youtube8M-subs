00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.810
 The tip is gymnastics and the first day 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.850
 you go with a lot of enthusiasm to the day 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.920
 next you got up from the camera is 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.840
 how to raise the everest touches you in the 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.490
 arm and seeing how big all of your 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.119
 life pass before your eyes as a 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.380
 movie are the famous shoelaces 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:20.140
 scientifically called as pain 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.029
 late onset muscle is a pain 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.939
 which is characterized by loss of strength 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.949
 say it is functional impotence 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.960
 inflammation and pain to the soul action the 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.119
 method that the shoelaces are crystals of 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.640
 lactic acid that puncture the muscle is 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.079
 wrong since it has been seen as in 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.660
 careless person 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.850
 mark you incapable of producing acid 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.250
 lactic also suffered from muscle pain 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.740
 originally 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.450
 In addition, lactic acid crystallizes 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.030
 from minus 5 degrees Celsius 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.590
 when our average temperature is 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.750
 37 degrees 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.180
 the theory most accepted by the community 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.790
 scientific although it is not yet totally 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.110
 proven is that the laces are micro 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.900
 injuries at the fiber level 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.489
 muscle in the sant eat for 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.830
 understand it we have to know the the 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.200
 shape of these fibers the muscle is 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.240
 It consists of muscle aces and these to your 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.250
 instead of muscle fibers 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.799
 the fibers we can see that actually 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.079
 they are composed of a row of muscles 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.909
 tiny little ones one behind the other 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.680
 in the drawing we can see a row of 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.049
 red deities that part 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.740
 contractive bounded by two bands 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.909
 white 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.310
 what are tendons 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.859
 each of these units is a saint 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.719
 Well mere shoelaces are small 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:36.750
 breaks at the junction of two mere arch 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.910
 consecutive in the fingernails 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.620
 the areas most affected by this pain 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.530
 They are muscle and joints 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.850
 tendons near the joints 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.040
 this is because the muscle zone 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.130
 tendinous is where there are more fibers 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.350
 weak muscle and more tension hits 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.260
 a second assumption that the receivers 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.690
 of pain or nociceptors are found in 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.760
 more in these regions the 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.770
 pain muscle weakness should be 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.750
 mainly to the processes 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.360
 inflammatory rather than micro damage 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.700
 muscle produced and usually have a 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.070
 period that ranges between five and 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.110
 seven days with a peak of pain that 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.500
 shows in the first three days after 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.500
 the exercise 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.570
 and your body reconstitutes them by making them 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.790
 stronger and bigger this is how 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.500
 now it goes muscle but when you 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.720
 raisins stripe muscle cells 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.810
 Myoglobin is broken down and poured 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.340
 containing the bloodstream 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.650
 this molecule release your blood is 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.990
 toxic to the kidneys and generates a 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.580
 condition called abduction bioanalysis that 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.650
 in the most serious cases it can take you 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.710
 to the hospital so drink water with 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.780
 sugar or bicarbonate is useless 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.850
 what could be done is a 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.760
 symptomatic treatment recommended by 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.260
 the doctor of anti-inflammatories 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.480
 to the injury itself is treated with 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.370
 Chemotherapy or massage exercise 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.900
 know with periods of rest would be 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.420
 also indicated when resubmitting 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.280
 and activates blood circulation and 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.019
 even causes a cleaning effect 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.019
 the waste products removed
