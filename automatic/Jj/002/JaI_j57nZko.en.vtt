00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
 hi guys keep on fanning 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.840
 another heading fanatok and today we 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:13.290
 we will have fun with eight pikes of level 3 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.289
 plus the little things are 5 onion 6 to 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.630
 scatter them for example on the edges 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.689
 in general, as you know me 205 place and 5 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.180
 places needed to take something so 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.699
 jars i took two rajahs hill and one 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.439
 jar john on the ears sang that is today 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.390
 we will have in spite of the fact that drink 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.960
 pretty quickly punch the fence I think 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.640
 somewhere we put our feet for the first time 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.250
 use jams sang and want to be look 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.460
 what will come of this in general fans 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.790
 the object is not a fan with jim general two in 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.950
 one 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.379
 In principle, I hope you are not anything 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.390
 interesting and we buy something too 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.730
 we get the cookies for the month too 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.780
 very important in principle offer a lot 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.059
 don't talk and go attack 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.489
 Here is such a base 9 Tambul I found 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.320
 I hope that I put masters 2 stars 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.870
 I'll try to do something now 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.140
 roughly figured out where to throw the same time 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.170
 in order to attract mpeg in general 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.890
 his movie between well, in general, see where 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.439
 Worth the tower wizard tower archers and how 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.540
 called that elixir vault collector 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.689
 In general, time is ticking and you need to start 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.400
 attack I drop the archer here one 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.009
 bake so she defended probably here 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.189
 utayu well, and now we start actually 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.640
 our attack so she went kinda pretty 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.350
 well, the main thing is to drink then go 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.630
 on the fence because they can go on 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.939
 somebody don't know gold collector 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.220
 Generally I think if they go there will be 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.320
 pretty sad hope this is for everything 2 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.119
 stars 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.710
 no no little go there 2 drink 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.020
 will have to use a tuba in order 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.229
 to break the circle and this is not good 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.979
 okay basically two stars to be 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.490
 should start here hope so like 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.770
 a circle and also they cleaned out and we are releasing everything 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.110
 all of our baked kwan costume bows magic 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.540
 that is, there don't drink at my place to 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.550
 sorry john we become you like this 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.170
 here it covers three at once 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.030
 hitch and sing at us runs to the center 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.550
 I throw the first jar raiji now they 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.090
 will reach her radius of Beijing 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.620
 jump the fence all we have here is good 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.180
 now not jumped a little wrong 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.989
 okay, I think with her to come back and be 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.060
 sometimes we need 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.970
 throw a little bottle of sickly because we 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.739
 quite a lot of defo 2 did nâ€™t go away 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.209
 not there okay let them down there with us 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:38.110
 wear percentiles I think it does not hurt 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:41.840
 25 percent we already have it good 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.870
 I will keep the clan caste up my sleeve 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.350
 to fill sim interest so there food 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.019
 dive me all already died unfortunately i 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.880
 I watch at this rate I forgot about the king 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.150
 and didn't use abilities in god 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.540
 so let's know where to servants 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.790
 we throw let's throw no no anyway 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.049
 there went lan 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.060
 clear something unfortunate so we left 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.250
 forgot about the mileage actually 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.860
 the third level seems to be dying 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.080
 pretty fast really fast 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.540
 dismantled they went and died where 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.820
 there okay the main thing from low to where 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.590
 We got to the hall 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.200
 but of course it is such that I expected more 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.200
 I think you too 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.299
 file file of course came out okay important 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.609
 used before had looked at least 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.620
 what it is and what it is eaten with never before 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:34.670
 I did not use it immediately I will order 3 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.560
 lightning to issue oil in general here 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.820
 such an attack from attack 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.620
 attacks but this is how we got 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:44.209
 I really expected her to much 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:46.670
 more but what is it like everything 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.200
 did according to the mind probably held the jar on 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.840
 I really don't even know where to throw 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.329
 all the banks seemed to be spread out correctly 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.120
 but most likely pumping virgins there was 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:59.980
 how let's see again and repeat 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.980
 let's see what was wrong with us 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.750
 Fuy principle find x 8 rest and pique 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.629
 probably only six failed 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.629
 peck went in there and base the rest 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:16.870
 pique 2 return we went around this 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:20.169
 sadly i forgot about the king zafeil in 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.960
 General, let's see again what we have 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:29.259
 happened wrong there should bake everything 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:34.120
 in general, normal hop they have everything 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:36.160
 them while it goes well there slept in paradise too 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.599
 there was a cry thrown not crooked though 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.599
 two peaks went to the left we saw but 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:45.690
 most went to the center 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:48.460
 town hall was demolished rather quickly 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:54.070
 furnaces under the hemlope drink by dredge all as 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:57.310
 need so one bake quickly killed those 2 5 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.530
 2 peak shelling these 2 peak is understandable 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.800
 disassembled queen 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:05.139
 means about the king and generally forgot 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.210
 it is clear that with this pecca in general Tesla 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.699
 quickly managed because how we 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.830
 know to drink is very afraid of strength 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:15.430
 it was here that they served shalom and casla clan 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:19.500
 actually was also for the owl in general 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:23.770
 guys file attack immediately you can see okay 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:26.320
 The main thing is what jams sang in 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.820
 principle if you learn it correctly 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.860
 you can use it to create 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.810
 really very very interesting 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.479
 things are in principle guys 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.820
 our not last attack purely peaks 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:40.000
 yet we will see quite a few and 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.860
 Therefore, we are looking at another successful 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.659
 results but now why zafeil in 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.250
 all right 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:48.849
 found probably not quite a good base 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:51.699
 sixth tesla is a slaughter in principle 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:55.740
 guys this is probably all wait for the next one 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:55.740
 fans and see you soon
