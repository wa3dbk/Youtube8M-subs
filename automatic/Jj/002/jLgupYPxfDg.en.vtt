upper<00:01:28.840> portion<00:01:29.380> this<00:01:29.649> is<00:01:29.709> the<00:01:29.920> part<00:01:30.100> that

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
upper portion this is the part that

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.889 
upper portion this is the part that
bolted<00:01:30.520> to<00:01:30.609> the<00:01:30.729> bucket<00:01:31.029> seats<00:01:31.270> I<00:01:31.359> didn't<00:01:31.689> want

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
bolted to the bucket seats I didn't want

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.139 
bolted to the bucket seats I didn't want
to<00:01:32.849> do<00:01:33.849> as<00:01:34.029> much<00:01:34.270> drilling<00:01:34.929> and<00:01:35.200> grinding<00:01:35.740> on

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
to do as much drilling and grinding on

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.899 
to do as much drilling and grinding on
this<00:01:37.149> piece<00:01:37.450> as<00:01:37.630> I<00:01:37.689> did<00:01:38.109> on<00:01:38.409> the<00:01:39.069> same<00:01:39.369> part<00:01:39.700> on

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
this piece as I did on the same part on

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.609 
this piece as I did on the same part on
the<00:01:40.060> bucket<00:01:40.479> if<00:01:40.719> that<00:01:41.020> makes<00:01:41.229> sense

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
the bucket if that makes sense

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.699 
the bucket if that makes sense
so<00:01:42.069> let<00:01:42.729> me<00:01:42.789> just<00:01:42.939> show<00:01:43.090> you<00:01:43.259> there's<00:01:44.259> a<00:01:44.349> rivet

00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:44.709 
so let me just show you there's a rivet

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:46.739 
so let me just show you there's a rivet
here<00:01:45.069> that<00:01:45.579> needs<00:01:45.759> to<00:01:45.909> be<00:01:46.029> removed

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:46.749 
here that needs to be removed

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:49.440 
here that needs to be removed
it<00:01:47.590> sits<00:01:47.919> just<00:01:48.069> like<00:01:48.369> this<00:01:48.520> one<00:01:48.759> basically<00:01:49.329> I

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
it sits just like this one basically I

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.999 
it sits just like this one basically I
ground<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:49.959> head<00:01:50.109> off<00:01:51.270> drilled<00:01:52.270> it<00:01:52.389> out

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
ground the head off drilled it out

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.399 
ground the head off drilled it out
almost<00:01:54.009> drilled<00:01:54.219> it<00:01:54.310> out<00:01:54.399> completely<00:01:55.409> but

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
almost drilled it out completely but

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.629 
almost drilled it out completely but
once<00:01:56.590> I<00:01:56.679> got<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:56.829> lot<00:01:57.009> of<00:01:57.039> material<00:01:57.520> out<00:01:57.579> of

00:01:57.629 --> 00:01:57.639 
once I got a lot of material out of

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:58.800 
once I got a lot of material out of
there<00:01:57.789> I<00:01:57.849> was<00:01:58.029> able<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.240> just<00:01:58.479> use<00:01:58.599> a<00:01:58.630> little

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
there I was able to just use a little

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.319 
there I was able to just use a little
brass<00:01:59.109> punch<00:01:59.469> and<00:01:59.739> I'll<00:02:00.489> just<00:02:00.639> pop<00:02:00.909> it<00:02:01.060> through

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
brass punch and I'll just pop it through

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.289 
brass punch and I'll just pop it through
so<00:02:01.929> I<00:02:01.959> had<00:02:02.169> to<00:02:02.259> drill<00:02:02.489> a<00:02:03.489> rivet<00:02:04.179> out<00:02:04.270> there<00:02:06.299> same

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
so I had to drill a rivet out there same

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.690 
so I had to drill a rivet out there same
here<00:02:07.659> on<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.530> front<00:02:08.830> it's<00:02:09.340> kind<00:02:09.520> of<00:02:09.550> in<00:02:09.640> the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
here on the front it's kind of in the

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.330 
here on the front it's kind of in the
shadow<00:02:09.970> let<00:02:10.179> me<00:02:10.270> move<00:02:10.630> it<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:11.440> again<00:02:12.160> this

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.170 
slider piece
off<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.890> bench<00:02:17.130> seat<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.120> now<00:02:19.160> inside

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
off of the bench seat that is now inside

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.740 
off of the bench seat that is now inside
of<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.420> upper<00:02:21.800> track<00:02:22.800> piece<00:02:23.270> that<00:02:24.270> is<00:02:24.390> part<00:02:24.660> of

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
of the upper track piece that is part of

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.530 
of the upper track piece that is part of
the<00:02:25.350> bucket<00:02:25.650> seats<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.730> on<00:02:27.000> this<00:02:27.120> one<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.360> also

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
the bucket seats so on this one I also

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.990 
the bucket seats so on this one I also
had<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.960> drill<00:02:28.140> out<00:02:28.320> one<00:02:29.160> rivet<00:02:29.370> on<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:29.820> side

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
had to drill out one rivet on this side

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.190 
had to drill out one rivet on this side
I<00:02:30.030> had<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.240> completely<00:02:30.570> drill<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:31.050> out

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
I had to completely drill this out

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.960 
I had to completely drill this out
because<00:02:31.380> there's<00:02:32.280> just<00:02:32.340> not<00:02:32.520> enough<00:02:32.580> room

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
because there's just not enough room

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.110 
because there's just not enough room
here<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.870> get<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.290> grinder<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:34.770> there<00:02:35.030> but<00:02:36.030> these

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
here to get a grinder in there but these

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.870 
here to get a grinder in there but these
rivets<00:02:36.480> are<00:02:36.570> important<00:02:37.160> okay<00:02:38.160> they<00:02:38.430> prevent

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
rivets are important okay they prevent

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.660 
rivets are important okay they prevent
the<00:02:39.140> little<00:02:40.140> slider<00:02:40.680> balls<00:02:41.010> in<00:02:41.250> there<00:02:41.430> there's

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
the little slider balls in there there's

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.640 
the little slider balls in there there's
little<00:02:42.660> slider<00:02:42.870> balls<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.290> you'll<00:02:43.440> see<00:02:43.620> a

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
little slider balls that you'll see a

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.030 
little slider balls that you'll see a
here<00:02:43.920> in<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.040> minute

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
here in a minute

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.310 
here in a minute
inside<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.190> mechanism<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.060> they're<00:02:49.020> in

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
inside this mechanism and they're in

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.390 
inside this mechanism and they're in
between<00:02:49.890> these<00:02:50.580> areas<00:02:50.850> so<00:02:51.630> these<00:02:52.260> rivets<00:02:52.560> act

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
between these areas so these rivets act

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.790 
between these areas so these rivets act
as<00:02:53.640> stops<00:02:54.030> so<00:02:55.020> that<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.350> slider<00:02:55.620> mechanism

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
as stops so that the slider mechanism

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.490 
as stops so that the slider mechanism
doesn't<00:02:56.310> overextend<00:02:57.120> it<00:02:57.870> same<00:02:58.170> here<00:02:58.200> on<00:02:58.410> the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
doesn't overextend it same here on the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.050 
doesn't overextend it same here on the
bottom<00:02:59.270> you'll<00:03:00.270> see<00:03:00.360> in<00:03:00.570> in<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.260> upcoming

little<00:03:03.060> videos<00:03:03.380> these<00:03:04.380> little<00:03:04.680> indentions

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
little videos these little indentions

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.880 
little videos these little indentions
are<00:03:05.340> also<00:03:05.490> stops<00:03:06.000> they're<00:03:06.360> on<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:07.140> on<00:03:07.350> the

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
are also stops they're on the on the

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.460 
are also stops they're on the on the
inside<00:03:08.250> it's<00:03:08.459> it's<00:03:08.850> a<00:03:09.030> raised<00:03:09.360> area<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:09.959> a

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
inside it's it's a raised area and a

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.710 
inside it's it's a raised area and a
little<00:03:10.680> slider<00:03:10.950> ball<00:03:11.160> mechanism<00:03:11.760> which<00:03:12.630> I

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
little slider ball mechanism which I

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.699 
little slider ball mechanism which I
don't<00:03:12.780> know<00:03:12.930> if<00:03:12.990> you<00:03:13.080> could<00:03:13.230> see<00:03:13.410> real<00:03:13.590> well

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
don't know if you could see real well

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.590 
don't know if you could see real well
it's<00:03:14.430> right<00:03:14.670> about<00:03:14.910> there<00:03:15.440> it<00:03:16.440> cannot<00:03:16.950> go<00:03:17.130> past

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
it's right about there it cannot go past

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.320 
it's right about there it cannot go past
these<00:03:18.600> points<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:20.720> we<00:03:21.720> have<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.050> replace<00:03:23.330> these

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
these points so we have to replace these

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.270 
these points so we have to replace these
rivets<00:03:24.600> that<00:03:24.870> we<00:03:24.959> drilled<00:03:25.170> out<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:25.590> when<00:03:26.250> I

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
rivets that we drilled out and when I

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.860 
rivets that we drilled out and when I
was<00:03:26.459> looking<00:03:27.180> at<00:03:27.269> these<00:03:27.390> things<00:03:27.510> trying<00:03:27.810> to

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
was looking at these things trying to

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:28.820 
was looking at these things trying to
figure<00:03:28.080> them<00:03:28.170> out<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.320> was<00:03:28.500> trying<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.709> figure

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
figure them out I was trying to figure

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.720 
figure them out I was trying to figure
out<00:03:28.980> what<00:03:29.580> this<00:03:29.790> hole<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.239> for<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.750> really

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
out what this hole is for and really

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
out what this hole is for and really
it's<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.850> window<00:03:33.890> if<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:35.100> move<00:03:35.340> it<00:03:35.519> there<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:36.600> can

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
it's a window if I move it there you can

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.060 
it's a window if I move it there you can
see<00:03:36.930> there's<00:03:37.170> that<00:03:37.350> rivet<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:37.769> we<00:03:37.860> had<00:03:38.010> to

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
see there's that rivet that we had to

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.560 
see there's that rivet that we had to
drill<00:03:38.250> out<00:03:38.430> so<00:03:39.180> my<00:03:39.989> solution<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:41.420> went<00:03:42.420> to<00:03:42.480> the

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
drill out so my solution I went to the

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.940 
drill out so my solution I went to the
hardware<00:03:42.720> store<00:03:43.140> and<00:03:43.970> got<00:03:44.970> some<00:03:45.799> these<00:03:46.799> are

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
hardware store and got some these are

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.750 
hardware store and got some these are
quarter<00:03:47.190> inch<00:03:47.340> diameter<00:03:48.920> socket<00:03:49.920> cap<00:03:50.100> screws

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
quarter inch diameter socket cap screws

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.530 
quarter inch diameter socket cap screws
these<00:03:51.360> are<00:03:51.540> three<00:03:51.720> quarters<00:03:51.989> of<00:03:52.110> an<00:03:52.200> inch<00:03:52.260> long

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
these are three quarters of an inch long

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.400 
these are three quarters of an inch long
what<00:03:54.540> I'll<00:03:54.660> do<00:03:55.160> is<00:03:56.160> I'll<00:03:56.340> just<00:03:56.370> stick<00:03:56.760> them

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
what I'll do is I'll just stick them

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.440 
what I'll do is I'll just stick them
down<00:03:58.410> in<00:03:58.590> there<00:04:00.830> hold<00:04:01.830> that<00:04:01.950> in<00:04:02.070> place<00:04:02.450> there

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
down in there hold that in place there

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:10.400 
down in there hold that in place there
you<00:04:03.480> can<00:04:03.720> see<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:05.790> screw<00:04:07.370> coming<00:04:08.370> here<00:04:09.410> I'm

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
you can see the screw coming here I'm

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.890 
you can see the screw coming here I'm
using<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:11.100> like<00:04:11.610> to<00:04:11.700> use<00:04:11.820> nylock<00:04:12.269> nuts<00:04:12.540> like

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
using I like to use nylock nuts like

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.300 
using I like to use nylock nuts like
this<00:04:13.140> but<00:04:13.350> you<00:04:13.470> use<00:04:13.739> a<00:04:13.769> nut

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
this but you use a nut

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.570 
this but you use a nut
I<00:04:14.340> definitely<00:04:14.820> recommend<00:04:15.420> using<00:04:15.540> them<00:04:16.580> some

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
I definitely recommend using them some

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.000 
I definitely recommend using them some
type<00:04:17.910> of<00:04:18.030> thread<00:04:18.239> Locker<00:04:18.419> on<00:04:18.660> there<00:04:18.870> we<00:04:19.799> just

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
type of thread Locker on there we just

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.730 
type of thread Locker on there we just
come<00:04:20.190> in<00:04:20.310> here<00:04:20.459> we<00:04:20.580> got<00:04:20.700> that<00:04:20.850> window<00:04:21.239> on<00:04:21.740> this

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
come in here we got that window on this

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.100 
come in here we got that window on this
side<00:04:22.950> that<00:04:23.070> we<00:04:23.190> could<00:04:23.310> stick<00:04:23.580> our<00:04:24.150> allen<00:04:24.750> key

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
side that we could stick our allen key

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.770 
side that we could stick our allen key
tool<00:04:25.800> in<00:04:25.890> there<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:26.430> just<00:04:27.330> type<00:04:27.479> them<00:04:27.630> down

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
tool in there and just type them down

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.540 
tool in there and just type them down
and<00:04:27.990> so<00:04:28.110> we've<00:04:28.260> basically<00:04:28.380> replaced

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
and so we've basically replaced

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.050 
and so we've basically replaced
those<00:04:31.550> rivets<00:04:31.790> and<00:04:32.660> now<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:34.820> little

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060
