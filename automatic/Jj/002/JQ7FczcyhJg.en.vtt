00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
carries on with the design the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.010 
carries on with the design the
information<00:02:23.730> there<00:02:23.910> cook<00:02:24.150> right<00:02:24.360> then<00:02:24.900> it

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
information there cook right then it

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.270 
information there cook right then it
goes<00:02:25.110> on<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.349> tabs<00:02:25.620> like<00:02:25.830> they<00:02:25.950> can<00:02:26.069> see<00:02:26.190> they

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
goes on the tabs like they can see they

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.830 
goes on the tabs like they can see they
are<00:02:26.310> faded<00:02:26.819> but<00:02:26.940> then<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.120> stops<00:02:27.420> inside<00:02:27.720> the

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
are faded but then it stops inside the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.780 
are faded but then it stops inside the
box<00:02:28.050> he<00:02:28.170> goes<00:02:28.319> back<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.920> wine<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:29.730> think

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
box he goes back to the wine so I think

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.890 
box he goes back to the wine so I think
they<00:02:29.940> could<00:02:30.060> have<00:02:30.150> done<00:02:30.269> bit<00:02:30.510> more<00:02:30.720> there

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
they could have done bit more there

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.860 
they could have done bit more there
maybe<00:02:31.080> carried<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.790> inside<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:33.569> if<00:02:33.720> this

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
maybe carried it on inside so if this

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.210 
maybe carried it on inside so if this
deck<00:02:34.140> will<00:02:34.349> see<00:02:34.500> what<00:02:34.620> you're<00:02:34.739> seeing<00:02:34.920> as<00:02:35.130> you

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
actually it's really really good then we

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.430 
actually it's really really good then we
have<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.299> bat<00:03:18.480> designers<00:03:18.900> get<00:03:19.079> into<00:03:19.320> its

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
have the bat designers get into its

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.380 
have the bat designers get into its
exact<00:03:19.739> same<00:03:19.980> as<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.160> bat<00:03:20.340> we<00:03:20.519> see<00:03:20.760> it's<00:03:20.880> the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
exact same as the bat we see it's the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.849 
exact same as the bat we see it's the
paper<00:03:21.630> looks<00:03:21.959> like<00:03:22.049> it's<00:03:22.200> coming<00:03:22.500> off<00:03:22.650> there

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
paper looks like it's coming off there

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.490 
paper looks like it's coming off there
so<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:23.130> is<00:03:23.370> it<00:03:24.060> looks<00:03:24.329> it's<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.750> one<00:03:24.989> way<00:03:25.019> back

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
so it is it looks it's a one way back

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.970 
so it is it looks it's a one way back
because<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.820> can<00:03:26.970> see<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.870> there<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.530> it's

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
know if it's this side yet it has that

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.690 
know if it's this side yet it has that
and<00:03:34.200> it<00:03:34.260> has<00:03:34.410> this<00:03:34.560> little<00:03:34.739> mark<00:03:35.040> there<00:03:35.340> as

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
get that fit up there the mirrored like

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.650 
get that fit up there the mirrored like
carried<00:05:24.990> on<00:05:25.110> look<00:05:25.350> as<00:05:25.680> you<00:05:25.950> can<00:05:26.070> see<00:05:26.220> that<00:05:26.660> the

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
carried on look as you can see that the

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.510 
carried on look as you can see that the
nice<00:05:27.810> little<00:05:28.140> design<00:05:28.260> there<00:05:28.680> if<00:05:29.130> you<00:05:29.280> flip<00:05:29.490> it

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
nice little design there if you flip it

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.090 
nice little design there if you flip it
around<00:05:29.610> you<00:05:30.330> can<00:05:30.510> have<00:05:30.690> it<00:05:30.840> there<00:05:31.440> as<00:05:31.590> well<00:05:31.800> so

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
around you can have it there as well so

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.400 
around you can have it there as well so
it<00:05:32.520> depends<00:05:32.970> what<00:05:33.270> you<00:05:33.300> really<00:05:33.660> want<00:05:33.960> to<00:05:34.080> do<00:05:34.230> of

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
it depends what you really want to do of

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.310 
it depends what you really want to do of
it<00:05:34.910> so<00:05:35.910> is<00:05:36.120> it<00:05:36.270> one<00:05:36.390> way<00:05:36.600> back<00:05:36.810> maybe<00:05:37.050> that<00:05:37.110> may

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
it so is it one way back maybe that may

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.200 
it so is it one way back maybe that may
be<00:05:37.380> a<00:05:37.500> disappointing<00:05:38.040> view<00:05:38.280> so<00:05:38.820> basically<00:05:39.060> if

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
be a disappointing view so basically if

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.120 
be a disappointing view so basically if
you<00:05:39.300> like<00:05:39.450> decks<00:05:39.780> are<00:05:40.050> you<00:05:40.470> could<00:05:40.650> even<00:05:40.860> turn

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
you like decks are you could even turn

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.070 
you like decks are you could even turn
it<00:05:41.310> round<00:05:41.460> shuffle<00:05:41.910> anyway<00:05:42.300> and<00:05:42.570> it'll<00:05:43.020> be

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
it round shuffle anyway and it'll be

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.330 
it round shuffle anyway and it'll be
exactly<00:05:43.440> the<00:05:43.590> same<00:05:43.620> on<00:05:43.860> the<00:05:43.920> back<00:05:44.100> and

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
exactly the same on the back and

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.920 
exactly the same on the back and
there'll<00:05:44.460> be<00:05:44.490> no<00:05:44.700> differences<00:05:45.240> then<00:05:45.660> don't

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
there'll be no differences then don't

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.230
