the kids from school because they had to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.620 
the kids from school because they had to
go<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.810> school<00:01:40.320> for<00:01:40.500> half<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.799> day<00:01:40.920> today<00:01:41.130> and

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
go to school for half a day today and

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.200 
go to school for half a day today and
before<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.810> left<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.799> we're<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.369> our<00:01:44.520> way<00:01:44.549> and
