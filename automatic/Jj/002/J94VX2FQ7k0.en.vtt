00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
this one is sharp enough that's leaving

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.500 
this one is sharp enough that's leaving
a<00:01:15.110> little<00:01:15.770> bit<00:01:15.890> of<00:01:16.010> scraping<00:01:16.340> so<00:01:16.790> play<00:01:17.000> with<00:01:17.390> my

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
a little bit of scraping so play with my

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.760 
a little bit of scraping so play with my
thumbnail<00:01:18.040> if<00:01:19.040> it<00:01:19.280> wasn't<00:01:19.700> sharp<00:01:19.909> enough<00:01:20.770> then

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
thumbnail if it wasn't sharp enough then

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.130 
thumbnail if it wasn't sharp enough then
we'll<00:01:22.340> have<00:01:22.520> to<00:01:22.670> go<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:22.880> a<00:01:23.300> side<00:01:23.659> edging

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
we'll have to go to a side edging

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.610 
we'll have to go to a side edging
procedure<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:26.290> then<00:01:27.290> we<00:01:27.500> would<00:01:27.680> end<00:01:27.950> up

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
procedure and so then we would end up

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.740 
procedure and so then we would end up
having<00:01:30.620> to<00:01:30.950> I<00:01:31.310> started<00:01:31.909> out<00:01:32.120> with<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:32.330> ski<00:01:32.600> in

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
having to I started out with a ski in

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.180 
having to I started out with a ski in

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
up out of the way in a ski vice this is

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.700 
up out of the way in a ski vice this is
a<00:01:50.479> vice<00:01:51.380> that<00:01:51.820> we<00:01:52.840> designed<00:01:53.840> a<00:01:54.020> beast<00:01:54.260> tuning

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
a vice that we designed a beast tuning

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.980 
a vice that we designed a beast tuning
and<00:01:55.460> it's<00:01:55.700> called<00:01:55.909> jaws<00:01:56.210> of<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.540> Beast<00:01:56.750> it

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
and it's called jaws of the Beast it

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.390 
and it's called jaws of the Beast it
grips<00:01:57.229> a<00:01:57.409> nice<00:01:57.590> key<00:01:57.830> very<00:01:58.159> securely<00:01:58.690> and<00:01:59.690> so<00:02:00.400> if

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
grips a nice key very securely and so if

as possible so you polish it up with the

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.780 
as possible so you polish it up with the
diamond<00:03:16.410> then<00:03:16.860> you'll<00:03:17.040> follow<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.459> up<00:03:17.580> with<00:03:17.610> a

thing<00:04:02.130> that's<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.459> most<00:04:02.640> important<00:04:03.239> is<00:04:03.780> that

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
thing that's the most important is that

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.509 
thing that's the most important is that
you've<00:04:04.110> gotten<00:04:04.380> repetitive<00:04:04.920> action<00:04:05.310> so<00:04:05.400> you

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
you've gotten repetitive action so you

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.699 
you've gotten repetitive action so you
have<00:04:05.940> pretty<00:04:06.390> good<00:04:06.480> mechanical<00:04:07.200> skills<00:04:07.500> that

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
have pretty good mechanical skills that

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.370 
have pretty good mechanical skills that
you<00:04:07.769> develop<00:04:07.940> but<00:04:08.940> it's<00:04:09.540> really<00:04:10.079> quite<00:04:10.350> easy

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
you develop but it's really quite easy

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.150 
you develop but it's really quite easy
very<00:04:10.980> few<00:04:11.450> mechanical<00:04:12.450> skills<00:04:12.780> if<00:04:13.769> you<00:04:14.040> know

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
very few mechanical skills if you know

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.830 
very few mechanical skills if you know
which<00:04:14.370> end<00:04:14.549> of<00:04:14.670> a<00:04:14.730> screwdriver<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.420> hold<00:04:15.600> or

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
which end of a screwdriver to hold or

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.690 
which end of a screwdriver to hold or
which<00:04:15.989> end<00:04:16.200> of<00:04:16.289> a<00:04:16.380> pliers<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.859> hold<00:04:16.890> you're

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
which end of a pliers to hold you're

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.849 
which end of a pliers to hold you're
probably<00:04:18.049> mechanical<00:04:19.049> enough<00:04:19.320> so<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:19.709> can

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
probably mechanical enough so you can

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.230 
probably mechanical enough so you can
tune<00:04:20.160> your<00:04:20.190> own<00:04:20.519> skis<00:04:20.940> so<00:04:22.430> now<00:04:23.430> what<00:04:23.880> we<00:04:24.000> do

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240

used here and that's a $85 so you can be

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.990 
used here and that's a $85 so you can be

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
year you probably probably go back once

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.700 
year you probably probably go back once
during<00:05:02.790> the<00:05:03.060> year<00:05:03.270> or<00:05:03.810> twice<00:05:04.140> during<00:05:04.350> the<00:05:04.500> year

during the year or twice during the year

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.680 
during the year or twice during the year
but<00:05:04.890> maintain<00:05:05.460> them<00:05:05.610> yourself<00:05:06.060> and<00:05:06.390> you're

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
but maintain them yourself and you're

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.060 
but maintain them yourself and you're
going<00:05:06.810> to<00:05:06.840> have<00:05:06.990> a<00:05:07.020> lot<00:05:07.260> more<00:05:07.470> enjoyment<00:05:07.800> on
