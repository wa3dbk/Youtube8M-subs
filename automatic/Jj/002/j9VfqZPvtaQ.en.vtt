I will not stand for it you'll probably
see<00:05:26.780> me<00:05:26.960> not<00:05:27.500> at<00:05:27.890> the<00:05:28.310> pro-am<00:05:28.580> if<00:05:29.000> that's<00:05:29.270> the

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
see me not at the pro-am if that's the

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.570 
see me not at the pro-am if that's the
case<00:05:29.720> i'll<00:05:30.200> be<00:05:30.410> there<00:05:30.800> a<00:05:30.860> few<00:05:30.950> times<00:05:31.160> to<00:05:31.520> check

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
case i'll be there a few times to check

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.340 
case i'll be there a few times to check
it<00:05:31.880> out<00:05:31.970> but<00:05:32.240> that'll<00:05:32.480> be<00:05:32.570> about<00:05:32.690> it<00:05:33.050> for<00:05:33.230> me

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
it out but that'll be about it for me

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.830 
it out but that'll be about it for me
because<00:05:33.680> the<00:05:34.220> waiting<00:05:34.669> on<00:05:34.820> the<00:05:35.270> pro-am<00:05:35.630> is

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
because the waiting on the pro-am is

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.890 
because the waiting on the pro-am is
just<00:05:36.140> really<00:05:36.680> hard<00:05:36.830> to<00:05:36.919> deal<00:05:37.160> with<00:05:37.190> so<00:05:38.120> as<00:05:38.390> you

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
just really hard to deal with so as you

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.420 
just really hard to deal with so as you
can<00:05:39.020> see<00:05:39.260> we<00:05:39.560> were<00:05:39.650> destroying<00:05:40.040> these<00:05:40.190> guys

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
can see we were destroying these guys

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.430 
can see we were destroying these guys
early<00:05:40.850> on<00:05:40.880> we<00:05:41.300> got<00:05:41.570> a<00:05:41.600> pretty<00:05:41.780> big<00:05:42.050> lead<00:05:42.260> but

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
early on we got a pretty big lead but

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.720 
early on we got a pretty big lead but
they<00:05:42.560> started<00:05:42.890> to<00:05:42.950> come<00:05:43.250> back<00:05:43.460> when<00:05:43.640> we

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
they started to come back when we

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.180 
they started to come back when we
started<00:05:44.030> to<00:05:44.120> screw<00:05:44.390> around<00:05:44.419> so<00:05:45.380> fusion<00:05:45.980> pro

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
started to screw around so fusion pro

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.010 
started to screw around so fusion pro
