we're going to try to do this in less
than<00:00:29.650> three<00:00:30.650> minutes<00:00:30.830> because<00:00:31.160> that's<00:00:31.520> all

the time I have won the camera cart so

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.590 
the time I have won the camera cart so
the<00:00:36.920> boiler<00:00:37.220> did<00:00:37.460> have<00:00:37.989> a<00:00:38.989> few<00:00:39.980> coals<00:00:40.600> around

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
the boiler did have a few coals around

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.890 
the boiler did have a few coals around
the<00:00:41.750> nozzle<00:00:42.200> on<00:00:42.380> the<00:00:42.890> inside<00:00:43.600> but<00:00:44.600> for<00:00:44.809> the

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
the nozzle on the inside but for the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.950 
the nozzle on the inside but for the
most<00:00:45.110> part<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:45.559> coals<00:00:45.770> inside<00:00:45.980> were<00:00:46.370> dead<00:00:46.960> and

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
most part the coals inside were dead and

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.720 
most part the coals inside were dead and
as<00:00:48.230> you<00:00:48.379> can<00:00:48.500> see<00:00:48.559> there<00:00:48.830> was<00:00:48.950> no<00:00:49.190> there<00:00:49.550> was<00:00:49.580> no

as you can see there was no there was no
fire<00:00:50.150> inside<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:50.809> boiler<00:00:51.430> so<00:00:52.430> what<00:00:52.610> we've

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
fire inside the boiler so what we've

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.880 
fire inside the boiler so what we've
done<00:00:52.910> we've<00:00:53.120> shut<00:00:53.330> the<00:00:53.480> upper<00:00:53.750> door<00:00:53.900> just<00:00:54.739> lit

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
done we've shut the upper door just lit

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.220 
done we've shut the upper door just lit
the<00:00:55.010> paper<00:00:55.220> in<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.640> center<00:00:56.420> loading<00:00:57.140> door<00:00:57.320> and

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
the paper in the center loading door and

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.300 
the paper in the center loading door and
we're<00:01:00.230> just<00:01:00.380> going<00:01:00.500> to<00:01:00.530> let<00:01:00.680> that<00:01:00.800> burn<00:01:01.040> for<00:01:01.250> a

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
we're just going to let that burn for a

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.740 
we're just going to let that burn for a
little<00:01:01.489> bit<00:01:01.640> you<00:01:01.880> can<00:01:01.970> look<00:01:02.180> up<00:01:02.329> here<00:01:02.510> on<00:01:02.660> the

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
little bit you can look up here on the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.210 
little bit you can look up here on the
control<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:04.130> flue<00:01:04.339> gases<00:01:05.860> you're<00:01:06.860> beginning

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
control the flue gases you're beginning

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.930 
control the flue gases you're beginning
to<00:01:07.310> climb<00:01:09.670> quite<00:01:10.670> nicely

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.850 

unlike<00:01:14.480> I<00:01:14.600> said<00:01:14.780> we<00:01:14.900> did<00:01:15.050> have<00:01:15.230> some<00:01:15.380> coals<00:01:15.620> in

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
unlike I said we did have some coals in

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.520 
unlike I said we did have some coals in
the<00:01:16.040> in<00:01:16.700> around<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.090> nozzle<00:01:17.270> a<00:01:17.720> few<00:01:18.320> of<00:01:18.410> them

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
the in around the nozzle a few of them

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.360 
the in around the nozzle a few of them
still<00:01:18.830> we're<00:01:19.400> glowing<00:01:19.610> but<00:01:20.570> not<00:01:20.750> enough<00:01:21.020> to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
still we're glowing but not enough to

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.120 
still we're glowing but not enough to
not<00:01:22.370> enough<00:01:22.580> to<00:01:22.700> get<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:22.940> fire<00:01:23.120> going<00:01:23.420> or<00:01:23.810> get

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.610 

get<00:01:28.130> it<00:01:28.220> to<00:01:28.340> start<00:01:28.580> gasifying<00:01:32.350> so<00:01:33.350> we'll<00:01:33.470> just

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
get it to start gasifying so we'll just

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.060 
get it to start gasifying so we'll just
kind<00:01:33.800> of<00:01:33.890> keep<00:01:33.979> watching

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
kind of keep watching

00:01:36.070 --> 00:02:03.090 
kind of keep watching
the<00:01:36.340> flu<00:01:36.550> temps<00:01:36.940> rise

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.510 

so<00:02:03.640> we're<00:02:03.790> up<00:02:03.850> about<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.120> hundred<00:02:04.330> degrees<00:02:04.540> now

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
so we're up about a hundred degrees now

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.170 
so we're up about a hundred degrees now
on<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.700> flue<00:02:06.910> gas<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.890> if<00:02:09.550> we<00:02:09.700> come<00:02:09.940> down<00:02:10.119> here

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
on the flue gas and if we come down here

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.900 
on the flue gas and if we come down here
and<00:02:10.830> take<00:02:11.830> a<00:02:11.890> peek<00:02:12.160> in<00:02:12.370> there<00:02:12.550> that's<00:02:12.730> what

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
and take a peek in there that's what

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.110 
and take a peek in there that's what
happens<00:02:13.380> now<00:02:14.380> what<00:02:14.650> what<00:02:15.220> we<00:02:15.340> did<00:02:15.550> when<00:02:15.820> we<00:02:15.910> put

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
happens now what what we did when we put

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.540 
happens now what what we did when we put
the<00:02:16.210> paper<00:02:16.450> in<00:02:16.720> there<00:02:16.930> because<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:18.130> frou<00:02:18.340> Ling

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
the paper in there because the frou Ling

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.809 
the paper in there because the frou Ling
shuts<00:02:18.850> down<00:02:20.430> completely

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
shuts down completely

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.839 
shuts down completely
after<00:02:23.599> it<00:02:23.810> knows<00:02:24.290> that<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.620> wood<00:02:24.799> load<00:02:25.700> has

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
after it knows that the wood load has

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.479 
after it knows that the wood load has
been<00:02:26.030> consumed<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:27.319> saves<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:27.860> coal<00:02:28.099> bed<00:02:28.310> in

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
been consumed it saves that coal bed in

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.600 
been consumed it saves that coal bed in
there<00:02:28.670> so<00:02:29.000> with<00:02:29.180> just<00:02:29.209> two<00:02:29.480> pieces<00:02:29.870> of<00:02:29.900> paper

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
there so with just two pieces of paper

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.460 
there so with just two pieces of paper
you<00:02:31.610> can<00:02:31.640> reignite<00:02:32.120> those<00:02:32.629> dead<00:02:32.840> coals<00:02:33.140> laying

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
you can reignite those dead coals laying

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.920 
you can reignite those dead coals laying
across<00:02:34.129> the<00:02:34.310> front<00:02:34.549> of<00:02:34.579> the<00:02:34.700> boiler<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.659> you

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
across the front of the boiler and you

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.140 
across the front of the boiler and you
can<00:02:36.110> be<00:02:36.230> up<00:02:36.349> and<00:02:36.470> gasifying<00:02:37.099> in<00:02:37.400> just<00:02:37.849> a<00:02:37.939> couple

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
can be up and gasifying in just a couple

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.930 
can be up and gasifying in just a couple
of<00:02:38.239> minutes<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:39.739> that's<00:02:40.099> that<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:40.700> guess

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
of minutes and that's that I guess

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.309 
of minutes and that's that I guess
that's<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.269> whole<00:02:41.299> point<00:02:41.629> of<00:02:41.659> the<00:02:41.750> video<00:02:41.870> here

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
that's the whole point of the video here

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.130 
that's the whole point of the video here
is<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:43.180> show<00:02:44.180> how<00:02:44.299> quickly<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.780> can<00:02:44.930> get<00:02:45.019> the

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
is to show how quickly you can get the

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.479 
is to show how quickly you can get the
boiler<00:02:45.440> up<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.769> running<00:02:46.010> now<00:02:46.099> if<00:02:46.159> we<00:02:46.280> could<00:02:46.400> go

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
boiler up and running now if we could go

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.330 
boiler up and running now if we could go
take<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.730> picture<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.209> stack<00:02:47.450> right<00:02:47.690> now

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
take a picture of the stack right now

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.390 
take a picture of the stack right now
you<00:02:49.340> would<00:02:49.489> see<00:02:49.670> that<00:02:49.819> there<00:02:50.000> isn't<00:02:50.120> any<00:02:50.450> smoke

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
you would see that there isn't any smoke

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.809 
you would see that there isn't any smoke
if<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:52.549> peek<00:02:52.760> inside

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.900 

the<00:02:57.090> combustion<00:02:57.450> chamber

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
the combustion chamber

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.740 
the combustion chamber
you<00:02:59.210> can<00:02:59.360> see<00:02:59.570> we've<00:02:59.720> got<00:02:59.900> some<00:02:59.960> gasification

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
you can see we've got some gasification

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.790 
you can see we've got some gasification
refractories<00:03:02.750> not<00:03:02.900> hot<00:03:03.110> yet<00:03:03.290> but<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.620> coal

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
refractories not hot yet but the coal

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.970 
refractories not hot yet but the coal
bed<00:03:03.950> is<00:03:04.130> enough<00:03:04.400> to<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:05.780> get<00:03:05.930> us<00:03:06.050> gasifier

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
bed is enough to to get us gasifier

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.030 
bed is enough to to get us gasifier
so<00:03:07.580> there<00:03:07.760> you<00:03:07.850> have<00:03:07.880> it<00:03:08.560> about<00:03:09.560> three<00:03:09.860> minutes

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
so there you have it about three minutes

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.950 
so there you have it about three minutes
to<00:03:10.310> get<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.520> rolling<00:03:10.730> up<00:03:11.000> and<00:03:11.180> gasifying<00:03:11.690> we're

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
to get it rolling up and gasifying we're

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.120 
to get it rolling up and gasifying we're
going<00:03:12.110> to<00:03:12.550> close<00:03:13.550> it<00:03:13.700> up<00:03:13.790> now<00:03:14.890> we're<00:03:15.890> going<00:03:16.070> to

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
going to close it up now we're going to

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.280 
going to close it up now we're going to
shut<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.430> outer<00:03:16.580> door<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:20.110> we're<00:03:21.110> going<00:03:21.260> to

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
shut the outer door and we're going to

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.440 
shut the outer door and we're going to
call<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:21.590> night

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450
