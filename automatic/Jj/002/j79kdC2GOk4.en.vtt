00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
here is a charging port that our

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.570 
here is a charging port that our
customer<00:00:35.970> tried<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.330> to<00:00:37.170> replace<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.310> they

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:38.580 
customer tried it to replace and they

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.580 
customer tried it to replace and they
broke<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.000> pins<00:00:39.240> and<00:00:39.750> that's<00:00:40.140> how<00:00:40.260> they<00:00:40.380> sent

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
broke the pins and that's how they sent

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.850 
broke the pins and that's how they sent
to<00:00:40.710> us<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.400> I<00:00:42.120> can<00:00:42.300> still<00:00:42.570> see<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.350> some<00:00:43.710> of

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
to us and I can still see that some of

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.220 
to us and I can still see that some of
the<00:00:43.980> pins<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.400> the<00:00:44.490> first<00:00:44.730> two<00:00:44.970> are<00:00:45.840> still

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the pins on the first two are still

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.740 
the pins on the first two are still
there<00:00:46.470> just<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.579> little<00:00:47.760> bit<00:00:47.880> of<00:00:47.970> it<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.660> I'm

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
there just a little bit of it so I'm

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.740 
there just a little bit of it so I'm
gonna<00:00:48.870> clean<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.829> first<00:00:50.310> and<00:00:50.550> see<00:00:51.510> how<00:00:51.540> much

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
gonna clean that first and see how much

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.900 
gonna clean that first and see how much
I<00:00:51.900> got<00:00:51.930> there<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.530> see<00:00:52.650> how<00:00:52.740> much<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.400> have<00:00:53.670> to

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
I got there and see how much I have to

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.760 
I got there and see how much I have to
work<00:00:54.030> with<00:00:54.060> and<00:00:54.450> try<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.079> build<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.530> bridge

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
work with and try to build the bridge

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.520 
work with and try to build the bridge
and<00:00:56.040> bypass<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.940> broken<00:00:57.450> part<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.900> still

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
and bypass this broken part and still

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.270 
and bypass this broken part and still
make<00:00:58.650> a<00:00:58.680> connection<00:00:59.630> through<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.890> I'll<00:01:01.980> start

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
make a connection through so I'll start

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.310 
make a connection through so I'll start
by<00:01:02.460> cleaning<00:01:02.700> the<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:04.860> board

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.530 

I'll<00:01:08.830> just<00:01:09.100> clean<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.460> pins<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.970> holes<00:01:10.210> where

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
I'll just clean the pins the holes where

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.230 
I'll just clean the pins the holes where
the<00:01:10.660> neutronic<00:01:11.080> pour<00:01:11.260> is<00:01:11.350> gonna<00:01:11.500> sit<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:12.240> by

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
the neutronic pour is gonna sit and by

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.900 
the neutronic pour is gonna sit and by
applying<00:01:13.420> some<00:01:13.900> heat<00:01:14.140> when<00:01:15.040> we<00:01:15.190> apply<00:01:15.430> heat<00:01:15.700> to

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
applying some heat when we apply heat to

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.540 
applying some heat when we apply heat to
start<00:01:16.150> moving<00:01:16.450> around<00:01:16.540> so<00:01:17.280> that's<00:01:18.280> gonna<00:01:18.430> be

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
start moving around so that's gonna be

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.670 
start moving around so that's gonna be
more<00:01:18.730> work<00:01:18.970> on<00:01:19.180> you<00:01:19.300> what<00:01:20.170> I'm<00:01:20.230> doing<00:01:20.470> is<00:01:20.560> I'm

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
more work on you what I'm doing is I'm

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.470 
more work on you what I'm doing is I'm
hearing<00:01:20.980> the<00:01:21.160> the<00:01:21.730> area<00:01:22.000> where<00:01:22.180> I'm<00:01:22.270> going<00:01:22.420> to

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
hearing the the area where I'm going to

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.480 
hearing the the area where I'm going to
suck<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.750> solder<00:01:22.990> from<00:01:23.410> those<00:01:23.590> holes<00:01:23.860> so<00:01:24.340> the

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
suck the solder from those holes so the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.730 
suck the solder from those holes so the
new<00:01:24.610> charging<00:01:24.940> port<00:01:25.210> pens<00:01:25.990> they<00:01:26.380> say<00:01:26.560> don't

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
new charging port pens they say don't

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.870 
new charging port pens they say don't
sit<00:01:27.250> on<00:01:27.340> those<00:01:27.460> holes<00:01:27.730> I<00:01:32.340> try<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:33.400> push<00:01:33.640> the

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
sit on those holes I try to push the

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.640 
sit on those holes I try to push the
charging<00:01:34.420> port<00:01:34.570> as<00:01:34.810> close<00:01:35.050> as<00:01:35.170> possible<00:01:35.320> to

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
charging port as close as possible to

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.360 
charging port as close as possible to
the<00:01:35.860> Pens<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.780> I'll<00:01:37.900> make<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.170> smaller<00:01:38.830> I<00:01:39.100> mean

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
the Pens so I'll make a smaller I mean

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.730 
the Pens so I'll make a smaller I mean
I'm<00:01:39.640> not<00:01:39.850> as<00:01:40.030> much<00:01:40.270> long<00:01:40.960> connection<00:01:41.410> a

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
I'm not as much long connection a

00:01:41.740 --> 00:02:06.120 
I'm not as much long connection a
shorter<00:01:42.160> connection

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.900 

some<00:02:07.130> flux

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.860 

what<00:02:10.910> I'm<00:02:11.000> trying<00:02:11.240> to<00:02:11.330> do<00:02:11.450> is<00:02:11.630> get<00:02:11.810> a

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
what I'm trying to do is get a

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.780 
what I'm trying to do is get a
connection<00:02:12.140> from<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.680> tip<00:02:12.890> of<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.250> end<00:02:13.580> of

connection from the tip of the end of

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.630 
connection from the tip of the end of
the<00:02:13.880> charging<00:02:14.270> port<00:02:14.450> spins<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.920> where<00:02:16.430> the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
the charging port spins to where the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.860 
the charging port spins to where the
connection<00:02:17.000> on<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.180> motherboard<00:02:17.420> is<00:02:17.630> still

bit of solder on the tip of my soldering

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.430 
bit of solder on the tip of my soldering
station<00:02:26.600> gun<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:29.590> try<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.770> feed<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.160> through

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
station gun and try and feed it through

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.790 
station gun and try and feed it through
the<00:02:33.440> motherboard<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.100> watch<00:02:34.550> it<00:02:34.760> just<00:02:35.800> just

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
the motherboard and watch it just just

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:48.510 
the motherboard and watch it just just
walk<00:02:37.160> back<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.880> charging<00:02:38.540> port<00:02:38.690> pins<00:02:39.160> I

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.520 

think<00:02:49.520> it's<00:02:49.670> good<00:02:49.910> I<00:02:50.180> see<00:02:50.840> all<00:02:50.990> the<00:02:51.170> pins<00:02:53.530> white

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
think it's good I see all the pins white

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.780 
think it's good I see all the pins white
and<00:02:56.380> touch<00:02:57.380> him<00:02:57.530> from<00:02:57.710> point<00:02:58.010> A<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.280> point<00:02:58.490> B

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
and touch him from point A to point B

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.440 
and touch him from point A to point B
and<00:02:59.630> that's<00:03:00.320> exactly<00:03:00.650> what<00:03:00.980> I<00:03:01.010> needed

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
and that's exactly what I needed

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.760 
and that's exactly what I needed
there's<00:03:02.450> enough<00:03:02.720> solder<00:03:02.960> and<00:03:03.230> there<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.590> hold

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
there's enough solder and there to hold

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.070 
there's enough solder and there to hold
it<00:03:03.950> for<00:03:04.070> a<00:03:04.160> long<00:03:04.340> time<00:03:04.660> so<00:03:05.660> it's<00:03:05.810> not<00:03:05.900> gonna

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
it for a long time so it's not gonna

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.580 
it for a long time so it's not gonna
break

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
break

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.680 
break
I<00:03:06.620> made<00:03:07.310> sure<00:03:07.340> those<00:03:07.700> four<00:03:08.030> pins<00:03:08.390> where<00:03:08.600> the

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
I made sure those four pins where the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.930 
I made sure those four pins where the
charging<00:03:08.990> port<00:03:09.140> sit<00:03:09.440> are<00:03:10.130> all<00:03:10.400> fed<00:03:10.700> with

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
charging port sit are all fed with

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.050 
charging port sit are all fed with
solder<00:03:11.210> and<00:03:12.370> that's<00:03:13.370> gonna<00:03:13.489> make<00:03:13.640> it<00:03:13.700> just<00:03:13.970> a

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
solder and that's gonna make it just a

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.140 
solder and that's gonna make it just a
solid<00:03:14.330> connection<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.840> all<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.230> the
