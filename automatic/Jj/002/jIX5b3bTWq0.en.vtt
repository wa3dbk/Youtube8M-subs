00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.139 

so<00:00:05.210> we<00:00:05.450> have<00:00:05.540> seen<00:00:05.750> a<00:00:05.779> major<00:00:06.020> scale<00:00:06.410> and

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:07.149 
so we have seen a major scale and

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:09.910 
so we have seen a major scale and
another<00:00:08.149> way<00:00:08.360> of<00:00:08.389> exploring<00:00:09.110> the<00:00:09.440> major<00:00:09.590> scale

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
another way of exploring the major scale

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.459 
another way of exploring the major scale
is<00:00:10.129> just<00:00:10.309> by<00:00:10.700> playing<00:00:11.030> it<00:00:11.270> in<00:00:11.450> intervals<00:00:12.170> hold

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:12.469 
is just by playing it in intervals hold

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.650 
is just by playing it in intervals hold
it<00:00:12.710> what's<00:00:12.950> called<00:00:13.009> diatonic<00:00:13.880> intervals<00:00:14.540> I

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
it what's called diatonic intervals I

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.929 
it what's called diatonic intervals I
recorded<00:00:15.049> a<00:00:15.170> dike<00:00:15.440> intervals<00:00:15.950> within<00:00:16.610> the

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
recorded a dike intervals within the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.409 
recorded a dike intervals within the
scale<00:00:17.240> which<00:00:18.050> means<00:00:18.380> all<00:00:18.710> the<00:00:19.160> third<00:00:19.579> major<00:00:20.270> a

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:20.419 
scale which means all the third major a

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:23.499 
scale which means all the third major a
minor<00:00:20.630> here<00:00:21.079> is<00:00:21.169> a<00:00:21.200> letter<00:00:21.439> or<00:00:22.340> on<00:00:22.820> the<00:00:23.090> fourth

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:23.509 
minor here is a letter or on the fourth

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.049 
minor here is a letter or on the fourth
all<00:00:23.989> the<00:00:24.200> intervals<00:00:24.590> or<00:00:24.800> fourth<00:00:25.160> or<00:00:25.430> the<00:00:25.820> notes

00:00:26.049 --> 00:00:26.059 
all the intervals or fourth or the notes

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:28.780 
all the intervals or fourth or the notes
that<00:00:26.119> far<00:00:26.660> apart<00:00:26.960> by<00:00:27.500> an<00:00:27.559> interval<00:00:27.860> fourth<00:00:28.220> or

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.790 
that far apart by an interval fourth or

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.749 
that far apart by an interval fourth or
fifth<00:00:29.509> contained<00:00:30.500> within<00:00:30.649> that<00:00:30.919> scale<00:00:31.250> I'll

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
fifth contained within that scale I'll

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.510 
fifth contained within that scale I'll
just<00:00:31.910> make<00:00:32.090> an<00:00:32.180> example<00:00:32.680> this<00:00:33.680> is<00:00:33.800> C<00:00:34.040> major<00:00:36.520> and

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
just make an example this is C major and

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.110 
just make an example this is C major and
now<00:00:37.850> I<00:00:37.880> want<00:00:38.150> to<00:00:38.210> play<00:00:38.360> that<00:00:38.540> scale<00:00:39.310> with<00:00:40.310> in

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
now I want to play that scale with in

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.410 
now I want to play that scale with in
thirds<00:00:41.600> which<00:00:42.050> means<00:00:42.610> playing<00:00:43.610> start<00:00:44.150> for<00:00:44.360> the

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
thirds which means playing start for the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.170 
thirds which means playing start for the
first<00:00:44.450> note<00:00:44.840> and<00:00:45.350> then<00:00:45.740> plane<00:00:46.130> the<00:00:46.700> second

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
first note and then plane the second

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.810 
first note and then plane the second
note<00:00:47.360> which<00:00:47.960> is<00:00:48.230> a<00:00:48.800> third<00:00:49.310> ball<00:00:51.460> and<00:00:52.460> starting

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
note which is a third ball and starting

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.520 
note which is a third ball and starting
from<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.000> second<00:00:53.510> note<00:00:53.690> of<00:00:53.720> the<00:00:53.900> scale<00:00:54.079> and

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
from the second note of the scale and

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.650 
from the second note of the scale and
playing<00:00:54.950> the<00:00:55.310> one<00:00:55.460> that<00:00:55.610> sits<00:00:55.790> on<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.510> ball

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
playing the one that sits on the ball

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.420 
playing the one that sits on the ball
this<00:00:57.140> is<00:00:57.200> d<00:00:59.079> so<00:01:00.079> know<00:01:00.230> that<00:01:00.470> so<00:01:00.890> no<00:01:01.130> lo<00:01:01.310> the

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
this is d so know that so no lo the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.319 
this is d so know that so no lo the
scale<00:01:01.730> he<00:01:02.329> and<00:01:03.079> then<00:01:04.040> play<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:04.430> 106<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:05.059> third

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
scale he and then play the 106 the third

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:13.870 
scale he and then play the 106 the third
above<00:01:05.720> which<00:01:06.619> is<00:01:06.860> G<00:01:07.720> and<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:08.930> on<00:01:12.640> for<00:01:13.640> playing

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
above which is G and so on for playing

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.510 
above which is G and so on for playing
the<00:01:14.000> same<00:01:14.210> position

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.090 

Oh

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100 

okay<00:01:20.730> so<00:01:20.790> these<00:01:21.210> are<00:01:21.420> whole<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> thirds

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
okay so these are whole the thirds

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.899 
okay so these are whole the thirds
contained<00:01:22.800> in<00:01:22.920> C<00:01:23.190> major

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
contained in C major

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.320 
contained in C major
it<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.720> same<00:01:25.190> playing<00:01:26.190> on<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> fourth<00:01:26.850> so

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
it was the same playing on the fourth so

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.330 
it was the same playing on the fourth so
now<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.540> second<00:01:28.020> note<00:01:28.200> will<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.800> fourth

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
now the second note will be the fourth

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:49.160 
now the second note will be the fourth
fourth<00:01:29.729> part<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:31.820> OBC<00:01:44.869> v<00:01:45.869> our<00:01:47.330> example<00:01:48.330> of<00:01:48.630> C

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
fourth part so OBC v our example of C

00:01:49.170 --> 00:02:03.420 
fourth part so OBC v our example of C
major<00:01:49.380> C<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.400> G<00:01:58.550> and<00:01:59.550> C

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.740 

this<00:02:03.850> one<00:02:04.120> can<00:02:04.960> have<00:02:05.050> six<00:02:05.410> I<00:02:06.300> can<00:02:07.300> do<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.540> same

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
this one can have six I can do the same

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.080 
this one can have six I can do the same
for<00:02:08.020> all<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.770> other<00:02:08.890> intervals<00:02:09.369> although<00:02:09.910> you

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
for all the other intervals although you

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.180 
for all the other intervals although you
know<00:02:10.180> the<00:02:10.240> sixth<00:02:10.720> seventh<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:11.770> on<00:02:11.920> up<00:02:12.160> to

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
know the sixth seventh and so on up to

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.510 
know the sixth seventh and so on up to
the<00:02:12.940> upper<00:02:13.120> extensions<00:02:13.980> how<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.040> use<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.400> and

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
the upper extensions how to use it and

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.850 
the upper extensions how to use it and
sell<00:02:15.790> those<00:02:16.000> I<00:02:16.210> think<00:02:16.630> a<00:02:16.870> good<00:02:17.200> way<00:02:17.520> is<00:02:18.520> to<00:02:19.860> play

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
sell those I think a good way is to play

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.050 
sell those I think a good way is to play
a<00:02:20.890> solo<00:02:21.250> where<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:22.060> play<00:02:22.330> mostly<00:02:23.580> only<00:02:24.580> thirds

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
a solo where you play mostly only thirds

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.250 
a solo where you play mostly only thirds
or<00:02:25.810> only<00:02:26.910> forward<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:28.270> on<00:02:28.510> actually

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
or only forward to so on actually

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260 
or only forward to so on actually
certain<00:02:29.620> intervals<00:02:30.160> are<00:02:30.460> specifically

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
certain intervals are specifically

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.720 
certain intervals are specifically
Sprint's<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.380> certain<00:02:32.860> kind<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.490> jack

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
just by playing mostly intervals of the

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.850 
just by playing mostly intervals of the
third<00:03:01.180> you'll<00:03:01.780> recognize<00:03:02.290> black<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:02.740> white
