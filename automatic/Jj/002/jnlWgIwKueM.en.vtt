how do higher-order intelligences in the

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.120 
how do higher-order intelligences in the
galaxy<00:00:04.500> know<00:00:05.220> where<00:00:05.460> we<00:00:05.609> are<00:00:06.799> it's<00:00:07.799> because

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
galaxy know where we are it's because

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.020 
galaxy know where we are it's because
the<00:00:08.280> earth<00:00:08.429> has<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:09.030> zip<00:00:09.360> code<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:10.759> that<00:00:11.759> zip

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
the earth has a zip code and that zip

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.140 
the earth has a zip code and that zip
code<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.570> based<00:00:12.960> on<00:00:13.200> your<00:00:13.440> good<00:00:13.679> old

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
code is based on your good old

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.960 
code is based on your good old
Kabbalistic<00:00:15.150> Tree<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.509> Life<00:00:16.340> if<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.730> take<00:00:17.940> a

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
Kabbalistic Tree of Life if you take a

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.330 
Kabbalistic Tree of Life if you take a
tree<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.420> life<00:00:19.730> we<00:00:20.730> lost<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.119> okay<00:00:22.340> that's

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
tree of life we lost it okay that's

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.480 
tree of life we lost it okay that's
interesting<00:00:23.779> yes<00:00:24.779> there<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.050> go<00:00:25.140> if<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.250> take

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
interesting yes there you go if you take

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.750 
interesting yes there you go if you take
the<00:00:26.640> Tree<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.880> Life<00:00:27.080> and<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.980> project<00:00:29.310> it

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
the Tree of Life and you project it

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.749 
the Tree of Life and you project it
outward<00:00:30.330> onto<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.260> sphere<00:00:31.650> roughly<00:00:32.250> one<00:00:32.489> light

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
outward onto a sphere roughly one light

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.200 
outward onto a sphere roughly one light
year<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.270> any<00:00:33.450> direction<00:00:33.660> from<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.230> Sun<00:00:34.469> you

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
year in any direction from the Sun you

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.160 
year in any direction from the Sun you
get<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.450> one<00:00:36.809> direction<00:00:37.219> something<00:00:38.219> like<00:00:38.370> this

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
get in one direction something like this

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.690 
get in one direction something like this
now<00:00:40.170> imagine<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.890> we're<00:00:41.010> filling<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.640> in

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
now imagine that we're filling this in

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.479 
now imagine that we're filling this in
in<00:00:42.239> all<00:00:42.420> four<00:00:42.809> directions<00:00:43.129> so<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
in all four directions so that the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.510 
in all four directions so that the
central<00:00:45.030> pillar<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.719> tree<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.230> unique<00:00:47.160> and

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
central pillar of the tree is unique and

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.770 
central pillar of the tree is unique and
the<00:00:48.390> side<00:00:48.660> pillars<00:00:48.960> overlap<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.989> have<00:00:52.610> 26

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
the side pillars overlap and we have 26

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.319 
the side pillars overlap and we have 26
circles<00:00:55.280> okay<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.520> if<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.879> can<00:00:57.030> go<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
circles okay and if you can go to the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.240 
circles okay and if you can go to the
other<00:00:57.480> one

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.000 

no<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.609> further<00:01:02.879> up<00:01:03.149> yes<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.780> one<00:01:04.010> yeah

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
no it's further up yes that one yeah

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.679 
no it's further up yes that one yeah
it's<00:01:05.309> hard<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.180> see<00:01:06.330> without<00:01:06.450> my<00:01:06.600> glasses

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
it's hard to see without my glasses

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.929 
it's hard to see without my glasses
there<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.320> go

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
there you go

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.630 
there you go
now<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.750> northern<00:01:10.710> hemisphere<00:01:11.040> this

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
now this is the northern hemisphere this

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.600 
now this is the northern hemisphere this
is<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> southern<00:01:11.939> hemisphere<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.430> if<00:01:14.430> we

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
is the southern hemisphere and if we

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.800 
is the southern hemisphere and if we
just<00:01:14.880> simply<00:01:15.810> from<00:01:16.020> earth<00:01:17.570> diagram<00:01:18.570> this

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
just simply from earth diagram this

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.460 
just simply from earth diagram this
pattern<00:01:19.490> there<00:01:20.490> are<00:01:20.700> stars<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.450> each<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.320> these

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
pattern there are stars in each of these

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.789 
pattern there are stars in each of these
circles<00:01:23.720> now<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.930> circle<00:01:25.290> right<00:01:25.439> here<00:01:25.500> is

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
circles now this circle right here is

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.380 
circles now this circle right here is
that<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.100> ecliptic<00:01:26.490> North<00:01:26.909> Pole<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
telescope based ideas that there is no

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.890 
telescope based ideas that there is no

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
star there however in the last 20 years

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.859 
star there however in the last 20 years
we've<00:01:37.320> discovered<00:01:37.530> deep<00:01:38.280> space<00:01:38.549> astronomy

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
we've discovered deep space astronomy

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.600 
we've discovered deep space astronomy
that<00:01:39.869> there<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> star<00:01:40.530> right<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.340> center

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
that there is a star right in the center

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.569 
that there is a star right in the center
and<00:01:41.880> that's<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.170> coils<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.829> Draco<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
and that's in the coils of Draco and the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.160 
and that's in the coils of Draco and the
very<00:01:44.790> still<00:01:45.090> point<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> center<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.930> Draco

very still point in the center of Draco

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.139 
very still point in the center of Draco
and<00:01:46.579> it's<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.820> very<00:01:48.210> long<00:01:48.570> way<00:01:49.470> away<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:50.149> the

okay<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:33.500> if<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.610> simply<00:02:35.610> want<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.300> find

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
okay and if you simply want to find

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.370 
okay and if you simply want to find
earth<00:02:37.640> then<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.670> find<00:02:39.360> where<00:02:39.750> all<00:02:39.990> those

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
earth then you find where all those

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.610 
earth then you find where all those
stars<00:02:41.600> come<00:02:42.600> together<00:02:44.209> so<00:02:45.209> Earth's<00:02:45.660> zip<00:02:46.350> code
