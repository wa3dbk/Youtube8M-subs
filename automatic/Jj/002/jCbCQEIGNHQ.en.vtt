driveshafts and now my thumb is black be
careful<00:00:22.769> when<00:00:22.859> you're<00:00:22.920> pounding<00:00:23.160> something

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
careful when you're pounding something

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.599 
careful when you're pounding something
with<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.820> hammer<00:00:24.029> that's<00:00:24.300> all<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.480> got<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.750> say

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
with a hammer that's all I got to say

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.480 
with a hammer that's all I got to say
anyway<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:27.330> trainee<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.720> put<00:00:28.019> in<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:29.039> out<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.250> a

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
anyway the trainee I put in is out of a

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.820 
anyway the trainee I put in is out of a
2003<00:00:30.240> Crown<00:00:30.510> Vic<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.109> some<00:00:31.289> reason<00:00:31.679> they

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
2003 Crown Vic and for some reason they

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.729 
2003 Crown Vic and for some reason they
grew<00:00:32.189> another<00:00:32.489> two<00:00:32.790> inches<00:00:33.440> so<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.469> got<00:00:34.710> a

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
grew another two inches so I got a

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.630 
grew another two inches so I got a
solution<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.899> the<00:00:36.899> drive<00:00:37.170> shaft<00:00:37.489> the<00:00:38.489> one

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
solution to that the drive shaft the one

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.209 
solution to that the drive shaft the one
on<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.820> right<00:00:39.000> side<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.360> car<00:00:39.570> originally

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
on the right side of the car originally

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.130 
on the right side of the car originally
and<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.460> too<00:00:41.640> long<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.570> went<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
and it's too long so I went to the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.610 
and it's too long so I went to the
junkyard<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.770> picked<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.250> one<00:00:44.430> over<00:00:44.730> 2003

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
junkyard and picked up one over 2003

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.229 
junkyard and picked up one over 2003
this<00:00:46.620> may<00:00:46.829> involve<00:00:46.980> aluminum<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.030> later

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
this may involve aluminum so it's later

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.420 
this may involve aluminum so it's later
but<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.230> main<00:00:49.379> reason<00:00:49.410> why<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.800> got<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.190> because

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
but the main reason why I got is because

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.069 
but the main reason why I got is because
it<00:00:50.820> seems<00:00:51.420> now<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.840> one<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:52.320> shorter<00:00:53.000> so

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
it seems now this one it's shorter so

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.470 
it seems now this one it's shorter so
this<00:00:55.079> one<00:00:55.289> should<00:00:55.320> work<00:00:56.090> so<00:00:57.090> I'll<00:00:57.180> get<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.360> all

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
this one should work so I'll get it all

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.330 
this one should work so I'll get it all
bolted<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.199> we'll<00:00:58.320> see<00:00:58.469> what<00:00:58.590> happens

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340
