other<00:02:08.970> thing<00:02:09.179> about<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.479> guitar<00:02:09.720> that's

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
other thing about the guitar that's

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.479 
other thing about the guitar that's
interesting<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.560> course<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.069> neck<00:02:11.250> carve

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
interesting of course is the neck carve

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.520 
interesting of course is the neck carve
is<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.970> nice<00:02:12.209> profile<00:02:12.690> neck<00:02:12.959> on<00:02:13.140> this

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
is a nice profile neck on this

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.120 
is a nice profile neck on this
but<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.220> also<00:02:14.580> has<00:02:15.050> vintage-style<00:02:16.050> fret<00:02:16.950> wire

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
but it also has vintage-style fret wire

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.820 
but it also has vintage-style fret wire
so<00:02:17.520> it's<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.880> smaller<00:02:18.240> fret<00:02:18.780> but<00:02:19.350> it's<00:02:19.500> also<00:02:19.680> a

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
so it's a smaller fret but it's also a

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.210 
so it's a smaller fret but it's also a
comfortable<00:02:20.430> fret<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:22.709> other<00:02:22.830> thing<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.100> we
