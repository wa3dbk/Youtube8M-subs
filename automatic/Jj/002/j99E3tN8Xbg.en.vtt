00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.030
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:12.330
 100,000 subscribers special 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.640
 no, of course, not 100,000 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.720
 upload calls which of course I too 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.320
 At that time it was still a little joke 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.250
 but now it's a hundred reality 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.180
 thousand subscribers that are really extremely 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.090
 many people 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.149
 and yes, I did not have it then 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.879
 I have come up with a comparison 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.089
 on the video day so in the round 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:41.129
 looked at indexes arena and while there were 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:43.739
 10,000 people approximately 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.229
 and that was really much 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.659
 I really wondered how 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:51.600
 many people really got together 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:53.999
 are there and have considered okay take that 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.530
 now eight at this time and 

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:57.359
 so many people have subscribed to me and 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.979
 that was just really right blatantly 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.109
 I could not really do that 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.320
 So imagine you had such a few 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.090
 do not turn cool 80,000 anthony 2000 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.220
 but if you look at it all the time 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.470
 really imagine that in front of everyone 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.410
 argument a person is sitting there 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.000
 is looks at and thinks like me 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.190
 I would like to see more of that and miss it 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.920
 subscribed as that's really correct 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.710
 blatantly and that's why I want you 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.400
 just time to say thank you thank you for 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.610
 which already two and a half years ago 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.270
 i do youtube here and thats her 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.830
 not always going on but that she 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.920
 just be general and yes as 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.680
 thank you very much is planned 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.850
 In any case, that will be all 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.970
 so with the time coming I want now 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.280
 not really telling a lot about what 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.960
 but now the most up to date is two 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.940
 I already have live streams 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.240
 Halfway announced so the first one is

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:04.020
 second morning on saturday just does that 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.970
 We say yes to make two personnel of 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.830
 the relatively normal length have a good link 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.200
 this is the description of me 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.450
 any case, if you all computer 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.459
 all it gets unstable and many 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.099
 then again really big thank you 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.860

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.400
