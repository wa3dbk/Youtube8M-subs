00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
so food grade quality

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.229 
so food grade quality
just<00:03:27.879> like<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.269> Inox<00:03:28.919> landox<00:03:29.919> 304<00:03:30.819> that<00:03:31.120> we

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
just like the Inox landox 304 that we

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.899 
just like the Inox landox 304 that we
just<00:03:31.450> had<00:03:31.689> I<00:03:32.219> use<00:03:33.219> it<00:03:33.400> in<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.790> beginning

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
just had I use it in the beginning

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.059 
just had I use it in the beginning
because<00:03:34.480> it<00:03:34.599> is<00:03:34.689> a<00:03:34.780> strong<00:03:35.079> cleaner<00:03:35.439> it<00:03:35.769> cleans

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
because it is a strong cleaner it cleans

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.800 
because it is a strong cleaner it cleans
all<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.310> oxidation<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.329> the<00:03:37.419> corrosion

all the oxidation and the corrosion

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.929 
all the oxidation and the corrosion
right<00:03:38.560> out<00:03:38.799> just<00:03:39.129> let<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.370> sit<00:03:39.579> for<00:03:39.609> a<00:03:39.819> while

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:39.939 
right out just let it sit for a while

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:42.750 
right out just let it sit for a while
and<00:03:40.150> then<00:03:40.569> wipe<00:03:40.810> it<00:03:40.959> up<00:03:41.109> this<00:03:41.980> is<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.280> panel<00:03:42.730> that

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
apply the Inox mx3 keep in mind that I'm

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.000 
apply the Inox mx3 keep in mind that I'm
not<00:03:59.769> giving<00:04:00.669> it<00:04:00.790> a<00:04:00.909> full<00:04:01.419> time<00:04:02.169> to<00:04:02.439> penetrate
