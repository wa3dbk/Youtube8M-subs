00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.870
 well friends here and the last issue 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.939
 build a cube of a rubik 3 by 3 and in this 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.250
 I will show you how to leave the most 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:23.070
 last corners here on this and in this 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.290
 goblet after you arrange them and 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.680
 cube you will finally come to this 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:34.620
 the long awaited state he will meet then 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:38.090
 what you waited so long means the cube we 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.129
 we will keep here the bottom of us 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.870
 yellow color then the bottom layer is white it 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.760
 top about those who have other markup but 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.530
 they may have other color know on 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.960
 some dice is yellow 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.469
 for example the spa pool they are down here we will 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.570
 take the bottom side down here left 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.100
 I apologize here so here is yellow life 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.530
 trying yellow here we will run not 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.949
 and down the overnight type is on this 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.230
 we will use that form on the side 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.150
 which we used back then 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.090
 the very beginning you remember we shot 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.460
 Here are the tricks it will be here such here 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.120
 fours 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:21.180
 well, let's get on as soon as possible 2 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.550
 everybody can't wait to make a cube like that 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.860
 what does it mean we find cubes 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.430
 rather on this fence on the yellow 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.730
 we find here the rib cube I apologize 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.280
 nodal which is not his own 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.590
 place here here in my case 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.350
 opposite sat in their place means 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.450
 take the cube with the yellow side on the left 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.730
 we find the attack cube in its place 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.830
 For example, I will have a yellow-blue red 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.490
 and countries so that he was in the top left 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.110
 the corner here is how we know that the four 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.320
 changes the cube 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.850
 this court is doing this here and there 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.300
 one 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:04.080
 here is a four cube come down here 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.090
 we substitute it for this place 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.330
 supply the place where it should be 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.950
 that is, we look at the cube with us 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.830
 yellow-red blue means here 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.930
 there must be cubes red and blue here 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.190
 we twist until here is red and 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.290
 blue here or 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.890
 the cube that is it must be between them 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.590
 here here and we do 4 as long as 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.960
 this cube is not themselves yellow clap well you 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.610
 From the first from the first from the first 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:35.760
 foursome here it may take well 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:38.610
 several there 42 34 for 640 dice 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.590
 going to the former position means 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.020
 thatâ€™s what the cube has figured out 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.360
 much here we see and need nothing 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.800
 scary after we do everything 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.900
 what all fours need 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.370
 she collects a life position on this we 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.600
 We do not pay attention to the fact that he is so 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.960
 terribly exploded it anyway 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.440
 get together and worry means look 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.780
 farther 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.360
 village we put this cube here on 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.090
 your place in this lower right corner 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.060
 we have another kulik here is orange 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.150
 green yellow he will get hold between 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.680
 orange and green rib cubes here 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.690
 By this, we spin a cube until 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.730
 while here and there a green 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.840
 Orange 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.310
 here is cool but orange is green 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.820
 this cube should be right here in 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.540
 this corner 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:31.790
 grandfather foursome again until 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:35.459
 he will not turn yellow to the left 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.980
 everyone is looking so big o 1 cube here 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.070
 1 appears and if this cube did it 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.450
 which he stands in his place 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.209
 white and green red and what do we do in 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:49.019
 in this case when arises 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:51.390
 such a situation then we just turn 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.170
 this is where we put the dice 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.390
 to their seats 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.130
 let the dice here who 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.739
 flow in its place here we twist 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:03.959
 I look at the edges here 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:05.820
 worth much orange yellow here we are 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.209
 just doing one foursome in order 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.550
 so that he rebelled from here to this place 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.130
 so we derive here we brought out the water he 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.489
 here began to examine us orange 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.919
 blue yellow should it stand between 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.350
 orange and blue centers here we are looking 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.890
 where do we have mega here is blue here is orange 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.539
 they must be sent so that the place is 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.990
 720 in between so here is this place one 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.289
 it should be 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.529
 It was in the upper left corner 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:36.050
 diagonally this is a cube in the right personally and 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:40.759
 do further fours until he becomes 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:43.939
 yellow left here he came 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:48.199
 look further what a shame here Kulik here 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:50.930
 red green yellow so i mean get up 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:54.309
 between the red and green costal 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:57.800
 dice and look where we have it so we 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:05:00.800
 blue-red green red rib 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.930
 cubes to ask for the number four until 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.659
 until this cube turns yellow 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:11.289
 left we're doing here 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:14.659
 well take a cube from us is not going to 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:17.689
 means if such a situation arises and 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:20.439
 108 gathered something that means you well 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:23.089
 lucky and if you are not going to cube 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:24.919
 night we do 4 until 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:31.879
 get 2 dice in their places but 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:36.459
 translated 5 times two three four here and we 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:39.889
 see what to delete and here is the green 

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:42.229
 red-yellow cube and green red 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:46.849
 white cube they stand in their places and 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:49.430
 they are turned over here that is we must 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:50.779
 put here after you here 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.819
 see something like that we should be 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:55.729
 put on one left but not so 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:57.769
 I have now personally like this more convenient 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.050
 riding that is clear that everything is everywhere 

00:05:57.769 --> 00:06:01.490
 collected except for these two cubes 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.800
 Olesya such places but they need 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.959
 flip as they turn over 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.999
 set so that they become 1 store 

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:11.839
 on the left just to be sure left 

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:14.419
 the brink and do now fours the same 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:16.909
 that's what we turn this one over 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:19.669
 cube here that is it reached break 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:26.539
 up I am at the four until he 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:29.599
 will become white memory spots 4 4 1 2 3 4 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:31.069
 here he became white up well four stages 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:34.490
 it is necessary with my case 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:37.759
 need two can 4 can 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:40.039
 then he became a defense if he got up 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:41.270
 his place we will become here 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:44.830
 another cube that we need 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:46.880
 flip over here is green red and yellow and 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:51.009
 keep fours on max 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:53.270
 make 2 ap we made two fours and 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:55.550
 the cube was going why we left them 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:59.240
 do two because we know what 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.940
 cube going for 64 that's all 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.630
 turn the face and and the cube with us 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.819
 got together 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:07.520

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:18.610
 add cubes like these two 

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:24.889
 two here 2 for 2 minutes aminka 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:26.300
