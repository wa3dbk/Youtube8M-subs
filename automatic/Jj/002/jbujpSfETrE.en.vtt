00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:09.460
 the spacecraft and land version and 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.460
 distribution sinase 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:16.580
 Welcome to our spacecraft. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.760
 for this year's trip around the 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.760
 Sun 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.270
 the planet closest to the sun is diving 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.480
 diving is greater only than our 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.480
 fight 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.010
 in its orbit near the mercury sun takes 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.250
 less than three months to take a walk 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.250
 complete 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.510
 a few weeks mercury was 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.790
 slightly offset from the sun 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.550
 looking from the ground and due to its axis 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.830
 inclined, this is what we see when 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.470
 mercury dawns on the horizon or the sun 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.720
 appears at almost the same time it illuminates 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.830
 the atmosphere and immediately mercury 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.960
 disappears in the blue sky when mercury 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.090
 is in its most shifted position of the 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.250
 sun has an advance of an hour and a half 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.220
 before sunrise 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.560
 the experiment if its horizon to the east 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.509
 and band a past if there is no drama 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.080
 you can see mercury before 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.080
 sound hit 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.110
 but mercury attention turns very fast 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.910
 in your hour 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.430
 a week later it will be swallowed 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.530
 again by the brightness of the sun and 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.509
 I have to wait four months for 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.390
 find a dive in a position where 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.770
 we can see well 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.319
 mercury takes three months to complete 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.740
 around around the sun which will bring 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.740
 Here 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.170
 during these three months the land will have 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.360
 traveled the room of his hour after 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.149
 mercury still take a marshy month 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.380
 surpassed and be here where we 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.380
 we'll see in the early morning 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:07.380
 mercury under the influence of the nearby sun 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.380
 I did not have it nor Venus 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.770
 the third planet earth after the sun 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.770
 has a satanic our moon 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:25.230
 Mars has two satellites 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:31.709
 we got and went fire suffered enough 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:35.969
 due to a collision but away from the sun 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:38.129
 Jupiter is hated with 16 satellites 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:40.170
 you can see the four largest 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:47.219
 share notes 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:49.590
 dani middle calixto and e e europa still 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:52.349
 farther saturn possesses a true 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.930
 courtship of small and large satellites 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.930
 that border their spectacular rings 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:04.250
 the earth has only the moon as satellites 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:09.959
 on a moon that has a single face 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:12.569
 always the same but always the same 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.510
 face we see why all these 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.299
 different ascents day after day 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.970
 this same face wants to show us the time 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.889
 whole is illuminated by the sun the day after 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.959
 day differently 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:27.180
 at the moment of the small crescent logo 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.699
 after the new moon the face of the moon was 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.310
 light is almost against light after 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:34.790
 in the full street to fascinate was lit 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.790
 beside 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.340
 there the moon goes through the second quarter of 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.720
 its orbit and position itself more and more 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:50.100
 in front of the sound the sun illuminates a part 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:53.130
 its easy to say this is 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.260
 almost the full moon on the eve of the moon 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:00.180
 full at the time the sun goes down the 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.880
 moon is well below the horizon after 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.100
 continuing his journey around the earth 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.320
 she arrives in the sun land alignment 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.810
 putting yourself in front of the sun 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.020
 there it appears at the same time as the sun 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.020
 put 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.539
 she receives the light of the sun in all her 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.539
 face 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.300
 The night of the full moon is the night when 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:30.300
 it sends the maximum light of the earth 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:44.480
 is as increasing as it reaches the 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:46.600
 moon always shows us the same face with the 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.820
 earth is not the same thing 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:53.060
 the earth spinning around its axis in 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:56.510
 24 hours in succession 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:00.610
 their faces a sound seen from the sun at 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.610
 earth does not hide 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:09.050
 The moon is connected to earth whose mass is 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.390
 between the bar and moon is the 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.180
 force of attraction of the earth that 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.760
 moon to rotate freely and encouraged in 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:25.130
 her quotation she always shows us the 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:27.440
 same face between the great sun and a 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.510
 small mercury is the same thing 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.919
 the sun prevents diving from spinning 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:37.990
 free space between neighboring beyond 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.990
 the strongest is the law of the greatest 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.430
 if you look at the full moon at 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.669
 winter you will see that it rises very high 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.479
 while the sun as always in winter 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.479
 remains very low 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:58.699
 because this difference 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.770
 The moon does not interfere with anything. 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:03.800
 is our earth movement movement 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.720
 that makes everything oscillate seen by a 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.090
 alien moon is right in front 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.400
 in the sun more or less inside it 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.919
 plane in which a land evolves and the 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.660
 planets but for us on earth to 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:20.210
 reference in the sky is the zodiac 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:26.569
 in this background we place the stars 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:28.580
 the planets also the sun and the moon as 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:31.580
 the earth is inclined in relation to the 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:36.830
 devil by day the sun appears very low in the 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:39.440
 horizon at night we look at the sky 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:46.729
 in this direction and we see that the moon appears 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:49.270
 sky high in the daytime at night 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:49.270
 like this 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:54.149
 the earth rotates obliquely 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.919
 looking from the ground the zodiac the top and 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:06.840
 seems to make waves 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:09.690
 the sun at noon passes in front of the 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.930
 Horizon the moon midnight goes high in the 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:16.729
 sky but the waves that the zodiac does 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.729
 only the effect of earth movement 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:29.280
 until the next good trip program 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.280
 all in order
