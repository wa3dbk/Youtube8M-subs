150 meters 150 meters been slightly a
slightly<00:00:25.419> old<00:00:25.630> distance<00:00:25.930> for<00:00:26.259> these<00:00:26.380> guys<00:00:26.619> to

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:26.829 
slightly old distance for these guys to

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.490 
slightly old distance for these guys to
swim<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:28.480> because<00:00:28.720> I<00:00:28.750> haven't<00:00:29.050> run<00:00:29.380> this

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
swim so because I haven't run this

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.560 
swim so because I haven't run this
distance<00:00:29.860> too<00:00:30.610> frequently<00:00:31.059> before<00:00:31.239> they've

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
distance too frequently before they've

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.119 
distance too frequently before they've
got<00:00:31.719> lack<00:00:31.899> of<00:00:32.050> experience<00:00:32.529> in<00:00:32.649> natural<00:00:32.920> pace

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
got lack of experience in natural pace

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.190 
got lack of experience in natural pace
in<00:00:33.309> this<00:00:33.460> set<00:00:33.700> so<00:00:33.730> the<00:00:34.390> instruction<00:00:34.840> was<00:00:35.020> to

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
in this set so the instruction was to

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.260 
in this set so the instruction was to
actually<00:00:35.410> set<00:00:35.649> off<00:00:35.680> and<00:00:36.129> to<00:00:36.730> hold<00:00:37.000> their

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
actually set off and to hold their

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.310 
actually set off and to hold their
fastest<00:00:38.190> maintainable<00:00:39.190> pace<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:41.140> let's

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
fastest maintainable pace so let's

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.930 
fastest maintainable pace so let's
follow<00:00:41.500> them<00:00:41.770> just<00:00:42.039> on<00:00:42.129> this<00:00:42.219> first<00:00:42.550> interval

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
follow them just on this first interval

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.610 
follow them just on this first interval
and<00:00:43.090> see<00:00:43.239> how<00:00:43.420> well<00:00:43.629> they<00:00:43.750> actually<00:00:43.780> succeed

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
and see how well they actually succeed

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.060 
and see how well they actually succeed
with<00:00:44.829> that<00:00:45.929> this<00:00:46.929> pool<00:00:47.170> is<00:00:47.350> a<00:00:47.379> 50<00:00:47.800> meter<00:00:47.980> pool

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
with that this pool is a 50 meter pool

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.939 
with that this pool is a 50 meter pool
in<00:00:48.550> Claremont<00:00:49.320> which<00:00:50.320> is<00:00:50.440> where<00:00:50.620> we<00:00:50.710> do<00:00:50.829> the

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
in Claremont which is where we do the

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.500 
in Claremont which is where we do the
majority<00:00:50.980> of<00:00:51.489> our<00:00:51.550> squad<00:00:51.850> training<00:00:52.030> sessions

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
majority of our squad training sessions

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.930 
majority of our squad training sessions
so<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.659> coaches<00:00:56.019> were<00:00:56.140> actually<00:00:56.350> taking<00:00:56.940> 25

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
so the coaches were actually taking 25

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.419 
so the coaches were actually taking 25
and<00:00:58.300> 50<00:00:58.569> meter<00:00:58.749> splits<00:00:59.140> to<00:00:59.739> see<00:00:59.949> how<00:01:00.190> well

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:00.429 
and 50 meter splits to see how well

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:02.009 
and 50 meter splits to see how well
these<00:01:00.579> guys<00:01:00.819> are<00:01:01.120> actually<00:01:01.179> holding<00:01:01.749> that

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
these guys are actually holding that

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.649 
these guys are actually holding that
come<00:01:02.289> and<00:01:02.499> the<00:01:03.100> pace<00:01:03.339> over<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.729> course<00:01:03.909> of<00:01:03.999> 150

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
come and the pace over the course of 150

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.800 
come and the pace over the course of 150
meters<00:01:05.670> here<00:01:06.670> we<00:01:06.790> have<00:01:06.909> Joe<00:01:07.150> just<00:01:07.420> turning<00:01:07.690> for

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
meters here we have Joe just turning for

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.340 
meters here we have Joe just turning for
his<00:01:07.930> first<00:01:08.170> 50<00:01:08.530> meters<00:01:08.800> in<00:01:09.870> 36.5<00:01:10.870> that's<00:01:11.200> the

there we also have Robin turning in 53
seconds<00:01:31.030> so<00:01:31.960> let's<00:01:32.320> see<00:01:32.500> how<00:01:32.680> well<00:01:32.890> these<00:01:33.010> guys

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
seconds so let's see how well these guys

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.300 
seconds so let's see how well these guys
actually<00:01:33.790> maintain<00:01:34.600> this<00:01:34.840> pace<00:01:35.080> on<00:01:35.920> to<00:01:36.190> their

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
actually maintain this pace on to their

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.760 
actually maintain this pace on to their
next<00:01:36.520> 50<00:01:37.120> meters<00:01:37.480> so<00:01:37.900> going<00:01:38.110> between<00:01:38.380> 50<00:01:38.740> and

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
next 50 meters so going between 50 and

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.610 
next 50 meters so going between 50 and
100<00:01:39.160> meters<00:01:39.460> here<00:01:39.990> many<00:01:40.990> swimmers<00:01:41.290> when<00:01:41.530> they

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
100 meters here many swimmers when they

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.200 
100 meters here many swimmers when they
set<00:01:41.830> off<00:01:42.010> thinking<00:01:42.520> that<00:01:42.580> they're<00:01:42.820> trying<00:01:43.000> to

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
set off thinking that they're trying to

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.090 
set off thinking that they're trying to
hold<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.600> consistent<00:01:44.170> pace<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:44.650> one<00:01:44.800> which<00:01:44.950> is

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
hold a consistent pace and one which is

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.390 
hold a consistent pace and one which is
nice<00:01:45.340> and<00:01:45.630> maintainable<00:01:46.800> believe<00:01:47.800> they<00:01:47.950> do<00:01:48.130> so

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
nice and maintainable believe they do so

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.820 
nice and maintainable believe they do so
but<00:01:48.610> in<00:01:48.760> the<00:01:48.820> first<00:01:49.000> 25<00:01:49.660> to<00:01:49.870> 50<00:01:50.170> meters<00:01:50.470> as<00:01:50.680> we

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
pace on the first 50 Nicole 53 58 58 so

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.190 
pace on the first 50 Nicole 53 58 58 so
a<00:03:18.190> little<00:03:18.940> bit<00:03:19.060> better<00:03:19.239> maintained<00:03:19.840> over<00:03:20.110> the

a little bit better maintained over the
last<00:03:20.349> 50<00:03:20.709> meters<00:03:21.010> but<00:03:21.220> again<00:03:21.459> still<00:03:21.879> too<00:03:22.150> quick

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
last 50 meters but again still too quick

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.830 
last 50 meters but again still too quick
on<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:22.660> first<00:03:22.900> 50<00:03:23.319> Sally<00:03:24.250> 50<00:03:24.910> 60<00:03:25.510> s<00:03:25.540> 56<00:03:27.840> when

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
on that first 50 Sally 50 60 s 56 when

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.180 
on that first 50 Sally 50 60 s 56 when
these<00:03:28.989> guys<00:03:29.200> saw<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.530> results<00:03:30.010> they<00:03:30.129> were

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
these guys saw the results they were

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.190 
these guys saw the results they were
actually<00:03:30.519> shocked<00:03:30.819> by<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.480> about<00:03:32.019> how

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
actually shocked by and about how

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.470 
actually shocked by and about how
inconsistent<00:03:32.829> their<00:03:33.160> pacing<00:03:33.549> was<00:03:33.730> now<00:03:34.269> whilst

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
inconsistent their pacing was now whilst

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.030 
inconsistent their pacing was now whilst
it<00:03:34.660> seems<00:03:34.900> like<00:03:35.049> these<00:03:35.170> guys<00:03:35.410> aren't<00:03:35.680> pacing

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
it seems like these guys aren't pacing

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.099 
it seems like these guys aren't pacing
themselves<00:03:36.430> out<00:03:36.549> very<00:03:36.790> well<00:03:36.880> I<00:03:37.269> challenge<00:03:38.019> you

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
themselves out very well I challenge you

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.599 
themselves out very well I challenge you
to<00:03:38.260> have<00:03:38.410> a<00:03:38.440> go<00:03:38.620> at<00:03:38.709> to<00:03:38.799> set<00:03:39.040> similar<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.489> this

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
to have a go at to set similar to this

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.650 
to have a go at to set similar to this
six<00:03:40.239> times<00:03:40.380> 150<00:03:41.380> meters<00:03:42.090> maybe<00:03:43.090> with<00:03:43.299> twenty

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
six times 150 meters maybe with twenty

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.180 
six times 150 meters maybe with twenty
to<00:03:43.780> thirty<00:03:43.989> seconds<00:03:44.349> rest<00:03:44.530> between<00:03:44.829> each<00:03:44.889> one

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
to thirty seconds rest between each one

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.460 
to thirty seconds rest between each one
and<00:03:45.730> see<00:03:45.940> how<00:03:46.209> well<00:03:46.480> you<00:03:46.630> can<00:03:46.750> consistently

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
and see how well you can consistently

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.670 
and see how well you can consistently
hold<00:03:47.709> that<00:03:47.859> pace<00:03:48.069> as<00:03:48.340> you<00:03:48.430> go<00:03:48.549> along<00:03:48.670> you<00:03:49.680> might

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
hold that pace as you go along you might

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.610 
hold that pace as you go along you might
be<00:03:50.859> surprised<00:03:51.250> by<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.489> results<00:03:52.319> and<00:03:53.319> this<00:03:53.500> is

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
be surprised by the results and this is

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.229 
be surprised by the results and this is
on<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:53.829> first<00:03:54.069> interval<00:03:54.549> you<00:03:54.880> can<00:03:55.030> sort<00:03:55.209> of

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
on the first interval you can sort of

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.699 
on the first interval you can sort of
appreciate<00:03:55.750> just<00:03:55.900> how<00:03:56.019> much<00:03:56.200> that<00:03:56.410> would<00:03:56.470> hurt

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
appreciate just how much that would hurt

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.159 
appreciate just how much that would hurt
your<00:03:56.980> ear<00:03:57.639> energy<00:03:58.030> reserves<00:03:58.419> for<00:03:58.750> the<00:03:58.840> rest<00:03:59.019> of

effectively<00:04:02.889> is<00:04:03.190> absolutely<00:04:04.000> critical
