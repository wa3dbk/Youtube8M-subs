review<00:00:05.299> where<00:00:05.420> we<00:00:05.509> cover<00:00:05.750> the<00:00:05.870> diver<00:00:06.410> rage<00:00:06.740> and

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
review where we cover the diver rage and

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.570 
review where we cover the diver rage and
I<00:00:07.099> think<00:00:07.389> viruses<00:00:08.389> true<00:00:08.630> strong<00:00:08.960> point<00:00:09.320> is<00:00:09.920> its

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
I think viruses true strong point is its

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.700 
I think viruses true strong point is its
range<00:00:10.910> of<00:00:11.180> divers<00:00:11.690> the<00:00:11.870> depth<00:00:12.170> of<00:00:12.380> the<00:00:12.500> range

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 
range of divers the depth of the range

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.250 
range of divers the depth of the range
and<00:00:12.980> the<00:00:13.760> differences<00:00:14.389> in<00:00:14.720> the<00:00:14.870> level<00:00:15.019> of

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
and the differences in the level of

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.509 
and the differences in the level of
difference<00:00:15.559> between<00:00:15.980> them

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:16.519 
difference between them

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.460 
difference between them
there's<00:00:16.849> something<00:00:17.119> really<00:00:17.269> in<00:00:18.080> the<00:00:18.230> August

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
there's something really in the August

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.620 
there's something really in the August
I've<00:00:18.619> arranged<00:00:18.949> to<00:00:19.249> a<00:00:19.550> technical<00:00:20.119> man<00:00:20.300> Warren

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
I've arranged to a technical man Warren

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.960 
I've arranged to a technical man Warren
give<00:00:21.140> us<00:00:21.259> a<00:00:21.349> rundown<00:00:21.560> mode<00:00:21.949> okay<00:00:22.519> so<00:00:22.579> that<00:00:22.880> the

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
give us a rundown mode okay so that the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.679 
give us a rundown mode okay so that the
master<00:00:23.300> Tasha<00:00:24.669> the<00:00:25.669> newest<00:00:26.149> one<00:00:26.329> forty<00:00:26.659> nine

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
master Tasha the newest one forty nine

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.809 
master Tasha the newest one forty nine
millimeters<00:00:27.380> now<00:00:27.409> it<00:00:27.829> comes<00:00:28.159> across<00:00:28.369> as<00:00:28.579> being

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:28.819 
millimeters now it comes across as being

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:30.999 
millimeters now it comes across as being
a<00:00:28.939> very<00:00:29.210> large<00:00:29.479> watch<00:00:29.839> but<00:00:30.140> because<00:00:30.769> of<00:00:30.800> the

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
a very large watch but because of the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.920 
a very large watch but because of the
shape<00:00:31.699> of<00:00:31.729> the<00:00:31.970> case<00:00:32.180> and<00:00:32.450> now<00:00:32.540> I<00:00:32.570> think<00:00:32.840> it's

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
shape of the case and now I think it's

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.930 
shape of the case and now I think it's
for<00:00:33.079> quite<00:00:33.290> wearable<00:00:33.590> it's<00:00:34.370> taking<00:00:34.730> a<00:00:34.820> little

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
for quite wearable it's taking a little

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.650 
for quite wearable it's taking a little
while<00:00:35.060> to<00:00:35.450> warm<00:00:35.660> to<00:00:36.080> the<00:00:36.470> new<00:00:36.830> design<00:00:37.010> but<00:00:37.660> the

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
while to warm to the new design but the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.210 
while to warm to the new design but the
design<00:00:38.930> of<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.140> hands<00:00:39.350> and<00:00:39.590> that<00:00:39.680> which<00:00:39.860> I

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
design of the hands and that which I

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.250 
design of the hands and that which I
found<00:00:40.940> it<00:00:41.090> first<00:00:41.240> probably<00:00:41.660> not<00:00:41.780> quite<00:00:41.960> so

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
found it first probably not quite so

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.980 
found it first probably not quite so
common<00:00:42.650> as<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.370> older<00:00:43.670> model<00:00:43.940> you<00:00:44.450> know<00:00:44.540> it's

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
common as the older model you know it's

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.200 
common as the older model you know it's
extremely<00:00:45.440> readable<00:00:45.920> quite<00:00:46.700> variable<00:00:46.940> and

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
extremely readable quite variable and

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.760 
extremely readable quite variable and
I'm<00:00:47.270> not<00:00:47.420> very<00:00:47.570> heavy<00:00:47.870> you<00:00:48.080> know<00:00:48.350> being

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
I'm not very heavy you know being

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.040 
I'm not very heavy you know being
titanium<00:00:49.340> orange<00:00:50.060> is<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:50.210> new<00:00:50.420> black<00:00:50.660> isn't

titanium orange is the new black isn't

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.310 
titanium orange is the new black isn't
it<00:00:51.170> pretty<00:00:51.350> much<00:00:51.560> it<00:00:51.800> is<00:00:52.720> not<00:00:53.720> certain<00:00:53.900> is<00:00:54.200> you

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
it pretty much it is not certain is you

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.620 
it pretty much it is not certain is you
see<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.370> orange<00:00:55.700> are<00:00:55.910> like<00:00:56.180> highlights

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
see the orange are like highlights

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.370 
see the orange are like highlights
really<00:00:57.500> do<00:00:57.740> stand<00:00:58.010> out<00:00:59.079> accentuate<00:01:00.079> a<00:01:00.110> very

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
really do stand out accentuate a very

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.190 
really do stand out accentuate a very
much<00:01:00.560> by<00:01:00.800> that<00:01:01.040> while<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:01.340> white<00:01:01.550> dog<00:01:02.200> it

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
much by that while the white dog it

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.770 
much by that while the white dog it
looks<00:01:03.410> smart<00:01:03.770> it<00:01:04.189> looks<00:01:04.519> good<00:01:04.879> what<00:01:05.659> do<00:01:05.720> you

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
looks smart it looks good what do you

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.260 
looks smart it looks good what do you
think<00:01:05.960> of<00:01:06.020> its<00:01:06.110> luminosity<00:01:06.439> luminosity<00:01:07.270> I

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
think of its luminosity luminosity I

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.999 
think of its luminosity luminosity I
think<00:01:08.600> is<00:01:08.689> excellent<00:01:09.049> every<00:01:09.469> part<00:01:09.859> of<00:01:09.950> that

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
think is excellent every part of that

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.999 
think is excellent every part of that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.670 

rumor<00:01:43.030> is<00:01:43.060> of<00:01:43.780> some<00:01:43.990> bigger<00:01:44.170> work<00:01:44.380> just<00:01:44.560> to

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
rumor is of some bigger work just to

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.480 
rumor is of some bigger work just to
come<00:01:44.890> in<00:01:45.690> 2009<00:01:46.690> how<00:01:47.680> much<00:01:47.830> better<00:01:48.010> can<00:01:48.220> you<00:01:48.340> go

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
come in 2009 how much better can you go

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.480 
come in 2009 how much better can you go
I<00:01:48.820> think<00:01:49.330> they<00:01:49.690> can<00:01:49.840> test<00:01:50.170> it<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:50.650> I'm<00:01:51.370> looking

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
I think they can test it and I'm looking

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.460 
I think they can test it and I'm looking
