00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
and you kind of got an idea of what each

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.910 
and you kind of got an idea of what each
steer<00:02:37.510> would<00:02:37.690> do<00:02:37.870> what<00:02:38.410> do<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:38.560> do<00:02:38.740> you<00:02:38.890> take

notes write down some things so that

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.720 
notes write down some things so that
because<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:41.530> don't<00:02:41.680> know<00:02:41.830> what<00:02:42.070> your<00:02:42.250> draw<00:02:42.460> is

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730

real deal
they<00:03:02.230> all<00:03:02.410> change<00:03:02.860> you<00:03:03.010> know<00:03:03.130> really<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.940> only

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
they all change you know really the only

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.180 
they all change you know really the only
time<00:03:04.240> we<00:03:04.450> can<00:03:04.480> tell<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.170> once<00:03:05.620> they<00:03:05.800> come<00:03:06.010> back

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
time we can tell is once they come back

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.280 
time we can tell is once they come back
for<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:06.730> second<00:03:07.060> time<00:03:07.180> at<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.600> rodeo<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:08.050> know

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
for a second time at the rodeo you know

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.570 
for a second time at the rodeo you know
and<00:03:08.560> watch<00:03:08.710> what<00:03:08.920> they<00:03:09.010> did<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.250> first<00:03:09.280> time

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580

in<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.820> actual<00:03:10.060> rodeo<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:10.990> seems<00:03:11.170> like<00:03:11.320> they

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
in the actual rodeo it seems like they

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.040 
in the actual rodeo it seems like they
always<00:03:11.620> change<00:03:11.830> from<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.280> practice<00:03:12.640> day<00:03:12.760> but

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050
