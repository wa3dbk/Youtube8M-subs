00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.740
 or not 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.350
 we continue with the program and now we 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.610
 we are going to bring a new tire that already 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.010
 is in the market here better than 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.429
 nicolÃ¡s traverso let's talk about this one 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.980
 radian ate 2 ante is a brand is a 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.750
 well-known description yes that 's how 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.380
 well a lot of the public knows that the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.390
 art is an off-road tire and that's how it is 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.480
 in this case it puts you in the nomenclature 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.550
 2 because it is a superior version 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.710
 which was that of the next in this tire 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.220
 is being used quite a lot in what they are 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.049
 vehicles for mini mining are 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.400
 adopting by this tire so 

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:39.930
 we talked and that in the sessions 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.610
 gone through the cost issue the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.129
 tire apart the cost is a 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.629
 tire that is the guarantee is the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.640
 same representative here in Peru 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.110
 provides the guarantees in the case of 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.720
 some breakdown immediately the change 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.150
 complete the tire is not something that 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.920
 next in the truth here in all 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.589
 and also in the radio sense 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.379
 t2 we also have the emt knees that 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:05.190
 they are for there much more aggressive floor 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:09.090
 mtm chosen either badly or mud 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.070
 rocky s pair oxapampa to climb like this 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.960
 this is how they are using 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.490
 we have sold a lot also in the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.350
 new mine that is doing for gold already 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.160
 I hope the road does not value it 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.480
 nothing more but is already selling everything 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.490
 quite that kind of tire is not 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.370
 basically a tire for a truck 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.290
 4x4 4 x 2 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.570
 as I said before 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.310
 defined and has a few that are the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.320
 hard coconuts 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.750
 you can see now this one has a band 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.730
 central and has two and has two that is 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.950
 which is a balanced issue 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.750
 to tires this is also directional not 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.910
 it is not not if it is not directing the only 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.190
 that is the way are part of the 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.560
 the tire that come out white or if 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.650
 you prefer to change it so you have the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.690
 profile of black color that you can have it 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.729
 well if you do not want to do or if you want 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.729
 you can put with pretty 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.799
 this also has the theme that we had 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.270
 commented on the high perfomance lines 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.550
 certain lines that prevents them from 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.130
 sound a lot reading now not all 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.630
 we know that many beats on the road to 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.730
 certain speed is starts at the 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.430
 buzzing then this one has a 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.620
 technology that avoids noise but still 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.480
 having the same clear performance by 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.280
 one moment all the tires were those 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.480
 older than were those of the chips s 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.519
 radios that everyone used to 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.280
 outside before all these came 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.440
 I was held hostage by mms and everyone and that's how 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.560
 they make a clear noise so it's practically 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.819
 the screen was what we call the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.410
 black screen that was was second 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.330
 super aggressive tire and so far the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.470
 use for those who want to acquire them 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.110
 forget we are on the avenue 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.660
 spring 11 85 at the height of the bridge 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.340
 spring ready then the report in 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.790
 ex in bring if we continue with the 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.790
 Program
