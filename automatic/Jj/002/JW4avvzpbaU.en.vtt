you're gonna want to loop it around this

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.920 
you're gonna want to loop it around this
starting<00:00:44.399> from<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.730> bottom<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.420> you're

gonna work your way around the top so
that<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.980> starts<00:00:50.430> at<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> bottom<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:50.969> this

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
that it starts at the bottom on this

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.459 
that it starts at the bottom on this
side<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.570> ends<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.020> bottom<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.320> this

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
side and it ends in the bottom on this

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.290 
side and it ends in the bottom on this
side<00:00:52.710> another<00:00:53.370> thing<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.760> want<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.969> take<00:00:54.120> note

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
side another thing you want to take note

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.450 
side another thing you want to take note
of<00:00:54.329> before<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
of before you do that is to have the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.200 
of before you do that is to have the
line<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.570> spool<00:00:58.670> parallel<00:00:59.670> to<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
line here on the spool parallel to the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.000 
line here on the spool parallel to the
line<00:01:00.420> that's<00:01:00.750> will<00:01:01.079> be<00:01:01.199> going<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.770> loop

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
line that's will be going on this loop

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.369 
line that's will be going on this loop
here<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:03.059> once<00:01:03.239> we<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.629> those<00:01:03.840> two<00:01:04.110> things

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
here so once we have those two things

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.469 
here so once we have those two things
done<00:01:04.650> we're<00:01:05.400> gonna<00:01:05.519> keep<00:01:05.760> some<00:01:06.000> tension<00:01:06.420> on

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
done we're gonna keep some tension on

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.000 
done we're gonna keep some tension on
the<00:01:06.570> line<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.020> can<00:01:07.049> pick<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.530> up<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.920> you

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
the line so I can pick this up and you

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.039 
the line so I can pick this up and you
guys<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.490> kind<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.729> see<00:01:08.909> how<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.180> get<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> level

how evenly it is kind of distributed in

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.730 
how evenly it is kind of distributed in
sections<00:01:56.539> and<00:01:59.170> then<00:02:00.170> whenever<00:02:00.380> you're<00:02:00.590> ready

all again and catch some more fish and
that's<00:02:11.180> how<00:02:11.299> you<00:02:11.360> use<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.690> level<00:02:11.959> one<00:02:12.110> system

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
that's how you use the level one system
