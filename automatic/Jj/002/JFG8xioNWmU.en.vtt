00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:03.370
 hello how about friends good 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.750
 I am 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.560
 back on my youtube channel 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.000
 he is boissier the reason why i am back gmt you encouraged me 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.179
 quite now the videos 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:15.320
 the truth 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.789
 I do not have much imagination to do 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.730
 these videos the finish in a bit the cea you know is the classic of the iphone 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.450
 cozumel 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.650
 previous etcetera operated 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.140
 installs them with a little ideas 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.319
 so 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:33.309
 I want to thank you very much for writing me they wrote me enough 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.829
 people thank you very much they have subscribed more than I thought 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.660
 I have a virus 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.780
 so that a normal person like me who has just started on this are very good 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.550
 they are quite high 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.990
 and I thank you very much 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.080
 the dc answered a little I assure you 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.750
 ee uu el manitos questions are timely night or suggestions 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.130
 and I have tried to take them 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.890
 so the s answered and dies the hotel hopefully help them to govern 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.630
 this video alone to tell you that 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.040
 to thank you very much about 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.510
 about your support about your suggestions 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.530
 and to ask them a little help to give me ideas 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.990
 what do they want green from this type of apparatus 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.600
 percent 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.049
 not be the only thing I can think of another company has served them 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.540
 interesting applications 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.829
 that can be downloaded at this time for these devices 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.140
 per cent initiated news that comes on poor contribution 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.869
 and well, they took advantage of it, conceived to tell you my theory 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.150
 about the future of these devices 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.580
 at events 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.580
 but you do not know what now one with 3g s 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.960
 as you know is the continuation of the 3g and one before the four 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.550
 percent this is a country by all of the first generation 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.210
 very old stars 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.950
 this one stayed in the air or stress he took her is four no longer his 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.870
 processor 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.399
 he could not stand it anymore 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.809
 or because she 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:13.010
 the halloween 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.039
 4 as bidders you already know 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:19.039
 has this merger that is already multitasking 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:22.709
 is to have several applications open at the same time 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.379
 iu no to the processor of the poor there is for all Egypt bill no longer works 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:31.679
 p 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:35.169
 a little summary about these places as fast 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:39.959
 is that ap olp I think my theory is that they are running out a little 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:40.599
 ideas 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.069
 why do I say this 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.960
 it's because from the led it's 1 to 4 they were walking sabugo 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.899
 with interesting things 

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:53.429
 have had no chance and it is the odd nonsense to present as 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:56.449
 covite izq that is something that god have had from the beginning 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.760
 but 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.249
 the truth 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:03.249
 they have lied to things and I think I think 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.849
 in the opinion 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.849
 what aba for the celestial is something happens with the ideas on what to put for 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:12.629
 these 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:13.689
 appliances 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.170
 so they approached the pÃ©rez thanks to the occ 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.480
 of hunger if really the multitasking and the prosecution demanded it and so on 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.269
 since the favela euros 5 is more than confirmed is the case of diego ap in the 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.440
 rumor that is there with the 3gs 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.989
 it is no longer what I was going to endure on the side 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.959
 the one elected in the one in which she has the nickname of the line d 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.729
 of time 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:41.069
 g always follow very strictly assumed that the counter is that if you had 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.710
 to stay in this concession 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.909
 it did not 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.370
 it did not 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.869
 why 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:52.619
 for another time my theory to do because you are running out of ideas 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:55.150
 and he took her to five his work the update 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.239
 but it is not the greatest and the most ingenious that they have had 

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:02.419
 so 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:06.209
 it's funny that shows a little bit what he is saying 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.390
 this sound river to greet them 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.480
 and to ask them for the great help of what 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.960
 please 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.100
 tell me what the story to see of these devices 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:23.370
 because I need your something almost full 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.650
 know what they want to see 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.659
 know what they want to know about these devices to see what they want 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.040
 see how I try ocles 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.319
 He turned them off in the test that is 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:35.669
 percent 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.490
 I have the odd idea to make videos of some applications 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.699
 interesting good i estimate in daily life to those things that everything 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.039
 the world want a device like this 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.740
 they only four I promise you a lot of thanks for subscribing 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.259
 thank you very much for writing me 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:59.259
 It gives me great pleasure to receive 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.020
 in a box of you and answer yes that they put me that they like my videos 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.040
 we like how he talked about exeter art is perfect 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.349
 for his works and I will continue doing it as far as I can 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.499
 then do it because how are they for what 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:15.349
 imagine 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.610
 and see the difference between this processor 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.610
 that there is reunion of 2010 les lie happens with everything how much ranti millet 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:24.460
 cepeda 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.330
 this reduces by 56 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.210
 2 156 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.210
 venegas but I do not know how many virgin 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:37.199
 the truth is that I do not have a pilot humillen idea either 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.729
 country and now if you like 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:40.849
 but 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:44.319
 if we take accounts this should be 

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:48.219
 If the 3g was faster than inn, it should be 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:51.219
 Perez or four times faster than you are and how good 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:56.599
 let's give them a little test just so the video has a little 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:05:58.400
 interest 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.490
 I pique first at 3g s 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.060
 and well it's over and the everyone keeps thinking that I asked 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:10.289
 the rude hung simple also of these devices 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:14.849
 I really do not know why 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:17.939
 but these apparatuses to give themselves account that they are 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:19.130
 real person 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.639
 you imagine that he is a real person 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:25.410
 that because this device has been four years since I took it out of the box 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:29.400
 no longer do things that should be normally see 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.249
 for example 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:34.520
 in 2000 cantonal 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.110
 I get 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.969
 what could not open the page that had 

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:42.089
 that did not know how to connect to a server 

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:45.089
 it's a very rare thing to go to pont 

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:48.469
 iii just happens do not tell them 

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:52.419
 because because the process is very slow and that's not not from the beginning 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:53.119
 I could 

00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:57.019
 open pages normally with standing but in truth between more time 

00:06:57.019 --> 00:07:01.519
 they are destined the device so more can give them is like an old man no longer wants 

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:02.719
 walk and 

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:05.739
 and it hurts everything and if you know it true 

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:09.619
 that's what we are I want to see on page 3 very strange 

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:13.710
 they are really wearing out they're going 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.360
 sales is costing work is common car that the debate getting mileage 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.360
 she does not want to move forward and so on 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.630
 good people share there to thank you for all your support of 

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.330
 all your decorations 

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.300
 please if what you want 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.430
 this card that you would like 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.520
 see and know about these devices I commented 

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:40.509
 and another more than going out 

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:44.710
 and they are really going to make you the videos that you find interesting and 

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.749
 that all the community bears Perez want to see so many thanks 

00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:50.109
 no, not until then
