00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.420
 hello today we have one more 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:27.140
 pen pen is simple but recently we have on 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.800
 the site 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.870
 Julia Julia craftswomen will definitely give 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.730
 a reference to her photo workshop 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.320
 offered a very interesting pen 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.580
 which is me inside by chance 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.580
 interested and matured in my head 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.369
 master class in a simplified pen 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:50.269
 which version of the stove I and more 

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:52.699
 complex version with a constriction which 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.940
 Julia offered a big thank you for the ideas 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:00.699
 and matured such a master class is popular 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:06.049
 popularize ideas highly recommend 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:07.939
 such a pen we had on a similar twisted 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.880
 pen but here 's a little bit there 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:14.689
 difference in the point add up to such here 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.380
 rows and it is slightly different first 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:20.329
 I have already made an option now, well, rather 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.289
 I already made one pen yesterday 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:29.090
 Today I will show you on the example of the second 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:32.090
 we will need 4 handles 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.579
 I connected them and in length 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.579
 4 tubules they are wet 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.230
 so clothespins outlined the places where we 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:49.150
 will handle retreat three rows and 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:51.660
 we pass ours or so simply if they 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.660
 pass if not then using the spokes 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.660
 we pass 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.619
 tubules 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.100
 through the weave between the third fourth 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.590
 near the top 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:18.000
 the bend point we did so therefore 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:21.770
 the handles are pretty strong won't destroy us 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.770
 come wrong 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.010
 so roughly evenly tubules 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:39.470
 humidity again and again 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:43.680
 and additional them still soften now 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.209
 make sure that the ranks are not violated 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.099
 ie plump here and so each one 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:52.400
 pressed down 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:52.400
 tubules and so we do there 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:01.489
 crossing the tubes make sure that they 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.489
 did not run into each other so times 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.130
 pretty cute but I get 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.130
 Like it so much 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.360
 there was a thought about what can be done 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.560
 two-colored or or play with 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.470
 flowers in these rows 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.030
 well honestly the simple version is not 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.890
 I wanted to play but already on 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.890
 complicated I'll show you 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:30.620
 played means 6 turns saw time two three 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.109
 4 5 6 so I remembered 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.549
 on the first version of course 2 us 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:41.840
 need to do exactly this in this 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.319
 place I have is that I prischepochka 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.810
 pen 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:49.519
 fasten that is so here one turn 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:53.329
 go inside 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:04:03.489
 that is, those schedule so two times three 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:04:03.489
 here, too, must find me again 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.450
 stalk it 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:20.470
 will enter the tubes from the outside under the arcs 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:26.850
 I also look for the outer layer of them one by one 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.850
 here less often seen 2 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.870
 3 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.479
 4 here we try to make them exactly 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.599
 also in a row 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:42.400
 I'm running over each other to 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:50.949
 neat this coil 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:50.949
 run from this side 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:01.930
 rack 1 miss and behind the rack then 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:01.930
 us too consistently 

00:05:09.429 --> 00:05:13.339
 method of fixing the same first and 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:17.349
 the second option is therefore the second time I 

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:17.349
 can show and will 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.510
 have secured now we have left 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.090
 fill up 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:34.190
 and glue as also consistently 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:37.160
 can be laid using a special 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.610
 here and so it turns out we stack in 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.610
 point 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:54.720
 we will stay here to miss it empty 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.290
 here and here and embed later and exactly 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.290
 we also perform 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.410
 pour 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:19.540
 and visibility here is this tube it needs 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:19.540
 tighten it and in the same way here 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.720
 also cope without 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.790
 such an express 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:39.660
 the pen is pretty simple fast and pretty 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.660
 nice 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:51.790
 there is everything left on fuel oil 5 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:54.640
 cut and get this option 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:58.500
 varnish must be primed first with water 

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:03.520
 then squabble all solid solid handle 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:06.040
 so so this is our first simple option 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.250
 or points now proceed to the 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.250
 interesting 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.240
 and 

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:21.569
 and
