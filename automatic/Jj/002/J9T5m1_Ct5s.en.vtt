00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
bit more spacious around the nose you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.170 
bit more spacious around the nose you
could<00:01:31.320> combine<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.860> two<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:32.490> an<00:01:32.820> eager<00:01:33.060> to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
could combine the two so be an eager to

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.969 
could combine the two so be an eager to
try<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.570> out<00:01:33.600> yeah<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.229> we're<00:01:34.500> talking<00:01:34.710> about

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
try that out yeah so we're talking about

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.320 
try that out yeah so we're talking about
the<00:01:35.190> lenses<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.550> little<00:01:35.759> bit<00:01:35.850> more<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.149> you<00:01:36.210> can

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
the lenses a little bit more and you can

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.660 
the lenses a little bit more and you can
actually<00:01:36.479> swap<00:01:37.080> out<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.830> colors<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.430> sounds

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
actually swap out the colors it sounds

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
like yes never be doing for variety of

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.650 
like yes never be doing for variety of
lenses<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.700> during<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.030> daytime<00:01:42.420> I

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
lenses so like during the daytime I

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.820 
lenses so like during the daytime I
usually<00:01:43.110> use<00:01:44.420> at<00:01:45.420> anytime<00:01:45.660> at<00:01:46.080> nighttime<00:01:46.619> are

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
usually use at anytime at nighttime are

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.980 
usually use at anytime at nighttime are
just<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.450> public<00:01:48.450> lighter<00:01:48.660> up

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
just the public lighter up

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.760 
just the public lighter up
and<00:01:50.990> place<00:01:51.950> it<00:01:51.979> with<00:01:52.369> one<00:01:53.119> of<00:01:53.150> the<00:01:53.770> Emperor

and place it with one of the Emperor
King<00:01:54.950> Thomas<00:01:55.610> design<00:01:56.000> through<00:01:56.180> like

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
King Thomas design through like

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.480 
King Thomas design through like
situations<00:01:57.170> gives<00:01:57.500> a<00:01:57.619> better<00:01:57.770> saturation<00:01:58.430> of

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
situations gives a better saturation of

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.050 
situations gives a better saturation of
color

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
color
