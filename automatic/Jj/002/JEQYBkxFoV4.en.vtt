00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
planning on coming up this way but kind

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.629 
planning on coming up this way but kind
of<00:02:24.060> stumbled<00:02:24.420> into<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:25.069> bit<00:02:26.069> of<00:02:26.099> a<00:02:26.219> free<00:02:26.400> tour

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:31.639 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.780 

slope<00:02:32.639> Eslake<00:02:32.849> down<00:02:33.269> there<00:02:34.579> through<00:02:35.579> the<00:02:35.609> eyes

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
slope Eslake down there through the eyes

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:43.190 
slope Eslake down there through the eyes
of<00:02:36.000> this<00:02:36.150> telescope<00:02:41.209> it's<00:02:42.209> pretty<00:02:42.420> cool<00:02:42.510> check

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
of this telescope it's pretty cool check

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.509 
of this telescope it's pretty cool check
out<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.349> visitor<00:02:43.769> center<00:02:43.980> we<00:02:44.099> just<00:02:44.250> sent<00:02:44.400> in

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
out this visitor center we just sent in

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:55.309 
out this visitor center we just sent in
this<00:02:44.639> book<00:02:52.549> put<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.669> tracking<00:02:54.180> antenna<00:02:54.989> for

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
this book put the tracking antenna for

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.020 
this book put the tracking antenna for
the<00:02:56.120> texts<00:02:58.430> so<00:02:59.430> these<00:02:59.519> are<00:02:59.579> actually<00:02:59.939> the

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
the texts so these are actually the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.179 
the texts so these are actually the
tracking<00:03:00.419> tags<00:03:00.689> that<00:03:01.349> go<00:03:01.530> on<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.769> Condors

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
tracking tags that go on the Condors

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:03.890 
tracking tags that go on the Condors
rings<00:03:02.400> that's<00:03:02.579> a<00:03:02.669> tail<00:03:03.000> tag<00:03:03.299> there<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.780> that

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
rings that's a tail tag there and that

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.869 
rings that's a tail tag there and that
one's<00:03:04.049> a<00:03:04.230> goes<00:03:04.919> on<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.099> wing<00:03:05.219> lets<00:03:05.579> punch<00:03:05.760> it

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
one's a goes on the wing lets punch it

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:06.920 
one's a goes on the wing lets punch it
through<00:03:05.939> the<00:03:06.060> wing<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.269> it<00:03:06.389> heals<00:03:06.540> up<00:03:06.719> pretty

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
through the wing and it heals up pretty

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.869 
through the wing and it heals up pretty
good<00:03:07.019> but<00:03:07.620> I<00:03:07.650> guess<00:03:07.709> move<00:03:07.980> down<00:03:08.129> to<00:03:08.189> like<00:03:08.310> 28

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
good but I guess move down to like 28

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.300 
good but I guess move down to like 28
California<00:03:09.689> condors<00:03:10.049> left<00:03:10.319> ever<00:03:10.620> anywhere

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
California condors left ever anywhere

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.940 
California condors left ever anywhere
but<00:03:11.909> now<00:03:12.060> we<00:03:12.120> are<00:03:12.269> back<00:03:12.719> up<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.500> could<00:03:13.859> put

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
but now we are back up to I could put

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.849 
but now we are back up to I could put
370<00:03:14.579> between<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.900> captive<00:03:16.229> population<00:03:16.739> in

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
370 between the captive population in

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.199 
370 between the captive population in
zoos<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.220> stuff<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.609> stuff<00:03:17.669> it's<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.150> the

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
zoos and stuff and stuff it's in the

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.849 
zoos and stuff and stuff it's in the
wild<00:03:18.449> and<00:03:19.019> actually<00:03:19.109> this<00:03:19.379> year<00:03:19.620> is<00:03:19.680> gonna<00:03:19.769> be

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
wild and actually this year is gonna be

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.589 
wild and actually this year is gonna be
the<00:03:19.979> first<00:03:20.159> year<00:03:20.519> that<00:03:20.699> the<00:03:21.239> number<00:03:21.569> of

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
the first year that the number of

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.899 
the first year that the number of
condors<00:03:22.290> in<00:03:22.409> the<00:03:22.470> wild<00:03:22.919> exceeds<00:03:23.699> the<00:03:23.879> number

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
condors in the wild exceeds the number

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.460 
condors in the wild exceeds the number
in<00:03:24.180> captivity<00:03:24.479> so<00:03:24.930> that's<00:03:25.109> kind<00:03:25.349> of<00:03:25.379> a

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
in captivity so that's kind of a

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.349 
in captivity so that's kind of a
milestone<00:03:25.650> for<00:03:25.829> them<00:03:26.040> too<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:27.090> it's<00:03:27.209> really

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
milestone for them too so it's really

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:36.570 
milestone for them too so it's really
cool

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.640 

so<00:03:37.580> we've<00:03:37.670> taken<00:03:37.700> a<00:03:37.940> couple<00:03:38.060> of<00:03:38.240> trails<00:03:38.650> since

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
so we've taken a couple of trails since

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.430 
so we've taken a couple of trails since
we<00:03:39.890> hit<00:03:40.070> that<00:03:40.340> high<00:03:40.880> mountain<00:03:41.210> lookout<00:03:41.480> now

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
we hit that high mountain lookout now

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.800 
we hit that high mountain lookout now
we're<00:03:42.620> at<00:03:42.740> the<00:03:42.770> dead<00:03:43.040> end<00:03:43.070> of<00:03:43.670> Lopez<00:03:44.480> canyon

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
we're at the dead end of Lopez canyon

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.290 
we're at the dead end of Lopez canyon
road<00:03:44.990> and<00:03:45.610> it's<00:03:46.610> been<00:03:46.670> raining<00:03:46.910> a<00:03:47.060> little<00:03:47.150> bit
