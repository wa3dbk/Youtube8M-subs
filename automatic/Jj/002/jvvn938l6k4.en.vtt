00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.450
 who started this movement in Brazil 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:11.220
 roller derby is a sport that exists 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.810
 since the 1930s but he was more 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.150
 restricted to the United States for 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.720
 very good thing in Brazil that 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.970
 started with 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.870
 had the movie the fantastic kid in 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.549

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.080
 I'm going to Brazil, and then the crowd. 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.549
 began to watch like this because the 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.890
 This is the sport that started looking for 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.720
 began to search several people if 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.489
 charmed with sport and started 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.989
 search for groups there was no group 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.849
 and people started to join in the 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.069
 internet to actually form a league 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.450
 so here on the river in São Paulo and in 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.450
 cities of Brazil 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.840
 ae 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.370
 she 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.370
 who claims to be there 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.930
 sincere friend 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.300
 we had a chance 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.550
 thing that I had a lot of interest in 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.620
 do this matter is because we already 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.360
 we fold we preach a lot that you 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.440
 can do what you want to do that 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.690
 You do not have to be inside a 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.569
 neither physical nor in São Paulo nor 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.890
 musical because you can be different 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.349
 have fun do all you have 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.810
 and I felt very much that in the year 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.340
 You must be aware I need to do this. 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.470
 you really have to 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.830
 philosophy one thing you think 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.480
 like this 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.040
 different from other sports you have 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.080
 a specific biotype for example the 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.400
 keeper has to be skinny and high or 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.769
 in the race you have to be stronger 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.510
 in the woman must he find a 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.340
 function for each different physical type 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.370
 then you can have a function if you 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.319
 for you are skinny and soft and agile if you 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.220
 for big high is suddenly more stable 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.650
 stronger 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.540
 all of their biotypes 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.160
 personalities they can find a 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.549
 place within government is that it serves 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.680
 For something, everyone, for you. 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.989
 do not play alone who looks who 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.700
 and what do you do there? 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.190
 I do not think it matters your physical type 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.989
 with a patrician he spoke so much but even 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.019
