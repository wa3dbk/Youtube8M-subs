00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:25.660
 Hello dear friends I present you 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.360
 this time the 42 02 lego city 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.690
 dump truck from the year 2012 that is 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.550
 the carton from the back and that is how it works 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:39.470
 here around the miners 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.420
 the set contains 269 ​​tyler and a mini 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.010
 Another figure is five 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.320
 sticker included and the 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.550
 age recommendation of lego is five 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.230
 to twelve years 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.840
 Here we see the complete 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.360
 built up is as you see contains 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.640
 it's the big beautiful dump truck the 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.000
 small mini figure with a small 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:03.200
 charge tnt a traffic sign with a 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.180
 sticker and two beautiful stone with one 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.190
 small gold lumps in it 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.810
 Let's take a closer look 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.660
 the miner or the 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.190
 Miner with a green helmet here 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.590
 once without a helmet as you can see 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.210
 the sweat is on his forehead 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.580
 Let's see it all again 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.410
 you can see from the back once 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.290
 a thick wide belt and the 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.560
 braces and quickly return the helmet 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.840
 so that nothing happens 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.720
 Next, the small charge with tnt 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.470
 a traffic signal with a time lunar 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.710
 the symbol of blessing and 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.360
 of course the two big stones in 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.380
 which the gold forming lego 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.380
 crystals are located 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.470
 The dump truck is 19 cm wide 13 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.750
 centimeters long and twelve centimeters 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.320
 comes up with big thick balling 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.510
 wheels and a hit born loading area 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.850
 even if it is a city ​​vehicle 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.670
 it is almost twice as big as 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.320
 the normal city ​​cars is but 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.410
 understandable in the size of a 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.800
 original dump trucks so we fold 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.790
 now the loading area up and 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.160
 look at the bracket 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.760
 and, of course, the cab 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.920
 or driver's cab to open and the 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.450
 miners in placing that 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.250
 do we now time once the 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:34.940
 remove the lid and now the 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:39.560
 Miner putting lid in again 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.510
 and let's go between the 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.510
 cab and the engine is located 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.640
 a small stop when you are now 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.890
 the tnt charge takes the lead 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.170
 one forest in hand, you can have 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.400
 it here now place them 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.400
 to transport properly 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.840
 Let's have a look 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.750
 The loading area of ​​the dump truck is more accurate 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.879
 You can work on that again 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.640
 I do not think I notice a bigger one 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:12.860
 purpose but is actually rather 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.569
 thought it into a neat 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.700
 Angle stands you can do it naturally 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.430
 loaded with the two stones 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.379
 are and wonderful again offload 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.220
 how to see the dump truck right away 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:27.980
 Incidentally, 2005 already saw the 73 44 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.500
 But then it was an ingredient egos them 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.849
 the construction site at last only one 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.129
 look into the instructions of the 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.760
 Dump Trucks The set comes in three 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.739
 Date title 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.150
 First you build the minifigures 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.950
 accessories then the chassis of the 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.379
 Dump trucks did the cab then 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.379
 the loading area of ​​the dump trucks here from 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:49.730
 Naturally, 2012 fits seamlessly into the 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:52.220
 mines such as 42 04 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.079
 was the great work was why he was wonderful 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.810
 would fit but in my opinion 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:59.690
 also good to the other normal ones 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.819
 Construction vehicles fit with it so is 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.410
 the construction manual almost through here 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.900
 you can see him already assembled 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.489
 here are a few others you the 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.370
 models here is the mine by the way 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.569
 to see again and come last 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.160
 the parts list 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.019
 I say thank you for that 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.340
 attention and hopefully until the 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.340
 next time at briggs foto
