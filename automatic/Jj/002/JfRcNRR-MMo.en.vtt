00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.420
 hello very good to all new video in 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.670
 the channel and today we recover carlos 10 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.980
 banzet warfare just like we did with 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.099
 drive a few days ago we take advantage 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.750
 an update to see how it has 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.510
 changed the game and in this case 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.779
 introduce yourself to the protagonist that you have 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.029
 on the screen is the assault rifle 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:28.150
 directed energy as they call it in 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.970
 the game the a4 that they will be able to download 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.470
 those who have the season pass 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.360
 well actually those who have the 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.250
 pass season and also have a 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.379
 good luck because there's 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.270
 users who have found that after 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.360
 buy the atlas edition is coming 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.309
 with a thousand things including the pass of 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.410
 season have the season pass 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.789
 downloaded but when they are going to use the 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.350
 weapon they find that has the 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:51.710
 locked padlock and can not 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.930
 use 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.480
 If it's your case, know that Microsoft 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.910
 is on the subject and they are trying 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.040
 look for a solution that we hope to get 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.540
 to sooner than later 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.489
 The fact is that we are going to take advantage of this 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.460
 video with gameplay to tell you about this 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.440
 weapon and especially to comment some 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.390
 of the things that do not finish us 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:16.409
 convince of this new call of duty 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.659
 we started with the weapon 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.819
 an assault rifle in which the great 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:27.300
 grace is in the cadence and second in 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:29.700
 do not have to look for ammunition 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:34.320
 it was a moment of dementia and now 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.120
 we know nobody has seen anyone idiot 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.180
 if they have seen you do the idiot and also 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.120
 they have killed you cocoon 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.190
 we followed with the weapon what I said 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.840
 assault rifle in which grace is 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.880
 in the cadence and the theme of not picking 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.860
 bullets on the floor because he does not have 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.070
 ammunition the only thing that we have to be 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.780
 attentive is to the energy that is heated 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.940
 too many fast what makes it very 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.010
 complicated to end up with several groups 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.730
 of enemies and damage 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:06.200
 that needs about three or four bullets 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:09.720
 pam pam pam to kill the enemies 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.360
 those who are concerned about the issue of 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.990
 a safe dlc weapon that is flattened 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.200
 this is pay to win and blah blah blah not os 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.500
 worry because at least under my point 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.740
 of sight the weapon is an important milestone 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.990
 I do not like anything is very slow 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.750
 very much in killing takes a lot in 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:36.550
 recharge and also has a problem 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:39.270
 on the subject of the relationship between cadence 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.990
 damage and precision 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.660
 if you have to kill someone would closely 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.540
 with an assault rifle or a submachine gun 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.300
 you're going to end up dead because your weapon 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.460
 kill more than yours if you try 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.500
 to do from far you are going to finish dead 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.370
 same because the dispersion of the bullets 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.130
 is tremendous in this case I have the look 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.560
 of opposite red dot because the sight of 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.140
 iron is very bad has a cross a 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.390
 little weird with which it costs to point 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.750
 but even if you point with the point sight 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.080
 red there you go to see the bullets are going 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.680
 cancun every two times what what 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:24.560
 it's very complicated 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.560
 Kills people at what distance 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.620
 we put the gun aside and 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.440
 concerns aside to comment other 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.500
 which also does not convince me 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.720
 let's see the game takes a month already 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.230
 in the market and still have errors 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.430
 like this you are going to see here that is 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.349
 you have seen is the camera change 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.260
 fast there are times when you jump 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:51.450
 with him with the suit you try 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.160
 hook to a cornice it seems that the 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.560
 character comes to us but really if 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.930
 arrives and the animation makes a weird change 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.849
 in which the camera many times 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.250
 it leaves you completely sold because he 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.410
 you do not see what is happening 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.750
 another thing that I do not like either 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:11.800
 nothing is this that you have here 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:15.670
 xs a new day probably one of the 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:19.900
 most important streaks of the game 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.370
 how can it be worse than going to 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.300
 paw 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.190
 that is, we are in a game that is 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.990
 fast that the idea is that we go 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.050
 hitting jumps and flying towards all 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.389
 sides 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.030
 and one of the best streaks in the game 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.909
 consists of a tank that is slow to 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.610
 noses with a gun that to kill 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:42.530
 you have to go to very short bursts 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.330
 because you can not stay there with the 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.909
 trigger safe and take advantage of the subject of 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.680
 that you have infinite ammunition you have to 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:51.689
 go to short bursts because if you do not 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.809
 bullets scatter a barbarity 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:57.269
 the case you have a weapon in theory would have 

00:04:54.809 --> 00:05:00.179
 to be the best of the game 

00:04:57.269 --> 00:05:03.959
 it's not a potato like a lord castle 

00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:05.819
 it's a potato and with this happens as with 

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:07.559
 the vast majority of game streaks that 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.779
 I do not like anything 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:11.279
 it's worth 20 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:12.719
 helicopters in the aggregator by the 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:16.289
 personnel from modern warfare to 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:19.229
 Sometimes it could be a bit heavy but 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.939
 in hobart it is also true that you have 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.860
 the feeling that you have earned it 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:25.379
 because you have killed so many enemies 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.149
 symbolics and you have your prize that results 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:31.499
 be by a helicopter that devastates with 

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:34.379
 everything here not here instead of a c-130 

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:37.079
 that shot thousands of meters from 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:39.779
 distance and charge you go to half equipment 

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:43.439
 enemy in a matter of seconds here 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:46.349
 you have streaks that are a potato in the 

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:49.610
 It's harder to kill than if you stop 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:51.969
 the streak in autonomous control 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.819
 And you put an to shoot the map 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:57.680
 bad bad bad really was one-armed like this 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:00.460
 heavy that there is here that does not let me 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.460
 OK 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.689
 It is another of the things that I do not 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.269
 like the game 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:10.939
 finally the subject of maps by 

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:12.529
 please please I do not understand why there was 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:14.719
 people who did not like maps 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:16.519
 of call of duty black ops' and the idea is 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:18.919
 In addition, it goes because, in reality, the 

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:22.249
 three roads of the stage went great 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:23.839
 so that you would stretch back at one point and 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:27.229
 you were all the time killing something that 

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:29.299
 here it does not happen you get luck as it has 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:32.169
 happened in this game or you throw a 

00:06:29.299 --> 00:06:34.930
 good time hanging around the stage 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:37.509
 in order that we hope that for the next 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:41.439
 the best thing is that you do not worry 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:44.289
 the rifle four because we will 

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:47.259
 kill more than with any other and you 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:50.169
 I leave here with the score that does not 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:52.539
 they were 25 could be better but hey 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:55.020
 and see you next time 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:55.020
 see you later
