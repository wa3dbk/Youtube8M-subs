parts<00:03:33.439> in<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.799> clip<00:03:34.099> are<00:03:34.340> sped<00:03:34.849> up<00:03:35.000> just<00:03:35.329> to

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:35.419 
parts in the clip are sped up just to

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:37.209 
parts in the clip are sped up just to
show<00:03:35.659> that<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:35.989> light<00:03:36.169> goes<00:03:36.319> to<00:03:36.500> cycle<00:03:37.040> and

show that the light goes to cycle and

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.599 
show that the light goes to cycle and
that<00:03:37.310> they<00:03:37.430> are<00:03:37.459> randomly<00:03:38.419> generated<00:03:39.609> so

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
that they are randomly generated so

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.670 
that they are randomly generated so
