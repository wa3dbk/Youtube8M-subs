00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
the reason we came well we spent two

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.600 
the reason we came well we spent two
years<00:03:58.840> in<00:03:59.050> UK<00:03:59.530> and<00:03:59.739> it's<00:04:00.190> pretty<00:04:00.400> different

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
years in UK and it's pretty different

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.390 
years in UK and it's pretty different
from<00:04:00.940> Malaysia<00:04:01.209> and<00:04:01.330> we<00:04:01.480> liked<00:04:01.690> it<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:02.530> be<00:04:02.560> open

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
maybe we didn't like the way the

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.199 
maybe we didn't like the way the
Malaysian<00:04:05.170> system<00:04:05.560> was<00:04:05.739> with<00:04:05.980> with<00:04:06.549> work<00:04:06.910> and

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
Malaysian system was with with work and

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.720 
Malaysian system was with with work and
with<00:04:07.360> the<00:04:07.480> kids<00:04:07.720> education<00:04:08.379> so<00:04:09.040> we<00:04:09.580> had<00:04:09.700> a

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
with the kids education so we had a

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.220 
with the kids education so we had a
choice<00:04:09.910> of<00:04:10.060> either<00:04:10.180> going<00:04:10.390> back<00:04:10.510> to<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.870> UK

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
choice of either going back to the UK

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.170 
choice of either going back to the UK
Australia<00:04:11.410> and<00:04:11.980> we<00:04:12.069> thought<00:04:12.220> keep<00:04:12.879> Australia

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
Australia and we thought keep Australia
