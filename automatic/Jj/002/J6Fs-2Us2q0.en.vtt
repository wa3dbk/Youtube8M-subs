 so you have to know that one to about 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.120

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.710
 there's stuff that's been around long enough 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.219
 I will buy 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.600
 so here I am we will start where I 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.699
 speak victory is so first of all 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.760
 I took a black leggings like that 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.010
 really quite simple in size m I them 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.860
 was paying 2 euros 95 it's really all 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.930
 sweet and that's the leggings it serves 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.750
 I always took a red one 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.860
 like that whose color is pretty flash 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.159
 it's easy you 'll see the good 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.110
 color 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.720
 but in fact I do not really know what 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.759
 put it with black but here it is 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.759
 in any case it always comes out like jama 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.530
 or to stay at home 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.320
 so now I'm going to show you a 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.729
 pair of shoes that I bought llama 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.320
 is good enough in I think there is 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.689
 two months is actually they are 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.299
 gorgeous end see these kinds of doc 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.240
 marteens a little rogers like that a little 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.470
 for rhodia that's with the flag of 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.540
 England on the side as his 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.650
 just training 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.350
 music and I think I paid enough 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.520
 5 euros or something like that and 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.820
 frankly for 5 euros 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.390
 finally I found beautiful so the 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.280
 pair in the end is plastic well 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.360
 sure but I find really pretty 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.690
 I do not know what you think 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.030
 it's a little original but it smells 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.580
 ok plastic but I really love his 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.500
 shoes here but for the price it's 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.580
 pretty original to go out with a 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.640
 held to stay in the shoes 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.340
 I also found ballerinas 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.840
 like that with the english flag 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.959
 I had put on instagram if I 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.670
 follow I do not remember the noise and 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.520
 I think it's 6 euros for 7 euros 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.980
 95 in short almost nothing and frankly 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.600
 they are really super comfortable and 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.980
 I'm not that he does not like 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.640
 really the ballerinas this one me good 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.680
 that's fine, so I took 36 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.940
 because I was little foot and that's it 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.930
 it's really a very, very good 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.160
 case to stay in the shoes 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.090
 I went to babu but I forgot to 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.350
 you show them in paste wanted 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.580
 absolutely wanted to show that none 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.620
 relationship with nuptials but I wanted you 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.110

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.750
 asylum has therefore yielded creepers late 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.910

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.130

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.360
 instinct g 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.890
 in fact I love it I wanted 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.650
 absolutely you are talking about it so if you 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.910
 look for creepers go to babu there 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.920
 it really has all the colors 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.800
 there are some like that blacks 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.420
 chestnuts and peaches of voices 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.750
 so here they are really very very 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.300
 very training in bed so that's it 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.070
 now we are going to eat because 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.780
 that I did a lot of food to 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.300
 dare you take me for a 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.420
 big food all that but in fact 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.680
 I really love the food of 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.060
 at home because it's actually 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.070
 products for not finding here 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.610
 products found in other countries 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.960
 in fact 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.600
 and I love discovering everything 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.920
 new at the food level and suddenly 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.300
 here I showed you that it seems 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.980
 weird enough but we will ask 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.990
 some halls do not dare but I do 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:46.250
 so first of all destroys the brioche 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:47.870
 like that except it's it's at 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.090
 serial in fact so that is it is 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.440
 not bad and I had never doubted 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.910
 avoriaz arial source so it is 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.310
 it can be good for the morning 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.730
 I can not remember the fruits of 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:02.690
 their account 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:07.370
 I do not have them with me and then that 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.020
 it is six of Asian province in 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.160
 chilli pepper 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.380
 so I thought it could be nice 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.250
 tested I paid this at 40 cents 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:20.600
 So here it could be quite 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:24.740
 here it is written by a packet of pasta 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:28.790
 German like that I found at 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.710
 semarang what I have 90 years he sees 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.630
 there are like that 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.370
 is she really very happily 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.280
 SCPI 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:43.080
 this is fussball knodel so it's 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.550
 a german thing so here after I 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.920
 taken with that I ate everything at 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:54.180
 the time is really good 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:57.360
 like that it's salty cakes at 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.720
 curry and it's a German thing I think 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.690
 as well 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.060
 it's really super good finally it's 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:07.710
 quite spicy but savuth curie actually 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.660
 it's really not bad ah yes 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.150
 then I bought a shower gel as 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.510
 that patchouli there is not really any 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.750
 Mark 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.100
 it cost me a euro 15 and they are 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.430
 very good were also 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.930
 coconut but only in cream 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.820
 in late May I wanted a shower gel but 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.200
 frozen will find a shower gel even this is 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.700
 the serious I will take back one day and 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.290
 in fact he really feels that the 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.720
 treatment is for a euro 15 lies 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:34.290
 that it's ok 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.940
 then I bought books so the 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.650
 hungry at home did not really dare anything and 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.200
 so I bought a cookbook 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.670
 like that super brunch so it happens 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.320
 with recipes for brunches 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:49.720
 you have a little of everything it cost me 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.140
 0.90 and she spent the summer in 25 years 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.600
 breton 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.340
 it's really a very good deal and 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.580
 there I would like to make a little dedication 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.900
 to helena the x bodily string so if you 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.740
 do not know it I 'll put the link to 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.460
 arm of a fake because she is 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.330
 really great and so that's the 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.580
 are you going to hilary duff 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.660

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.640
 did not know at all the decrees a 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.680
 novel of the coup I bought because he 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.880

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.400
 here and I also paid 3 euros 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.900
 so now the best for the end 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.040
 the fish I told you about 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:25.390
 in my favorites of march 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.580

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.260

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:54.220
 I do not really know how to use 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:56.290
