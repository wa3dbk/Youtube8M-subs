 you don't have to leave the gene socks and on 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:42.769
 heels are not like a full stop for this we 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:47.110
 have a little bit of a pull out socks 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:53.449
 from under the bar so you can see your masks 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.839
 Russian granddaughters socks turned wide 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.339
 the shoulders 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:59.600
 you can bet a little on one bet 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:02.809
 put accept such 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.410
 so you do not pull the stamp on his feet 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.470
 so you break many feet pants 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:13.119
 must go along well very carefully 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.119
 calm along him 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.610
 dragging on only when you 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.070
 make a position for according to you 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.740
 should pull up to themselves and not here 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.010
 should stand up straight and pull out 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.190
 back back should be some 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.490
 newcomers tact well you can not both 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:41.200
 undermine the barbell undermine and firing and 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:43.360
 here you are friends 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.210
 I constantly why all the time I say everything 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.780
 time I speak speak speak full 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.360
 foot 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.509
 the foot is standing on a complete foot back 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:59.740
 stretched like a string you should back and 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:02:02.289
 kicking that risk so you can't drastically 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.380
 undermine if you don't help your back 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:08.200
 the back is necessarily involved and the back and 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.920
 legs and so do things right not 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.280
 hurry 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.680
 not taken off stark risk very 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.000
 quickly do it wrong you do 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.709
 you break completely 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.329
 your barbell direction you should barbell 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.510
 if you compare you have to remove the barbell 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:31.360
 so so you drive into the needle's ear 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.030
 thread about the fact that there is no sharply 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.310
 that is, if you started the roar tighten 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.010
 the bar you do not cover not enough power 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.320
 undermine and and some there will be an hour 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.060
 arguing in a small place 20 kilograms 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.310
 thirty kilo forty fifty is 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.110
 you can do it very quickly that is 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.540
 These words are cross-functional 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.549
 training can do it all quickly but i 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.130
 talking about extreme weights when you go 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.620
 on the limiting weights at all most 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.680
 start learning and correct yourself you must 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.170
 very gently very gently get under way 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.269
 that is, you can compare it here 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.980
 a car about skidding hit the asphalt and 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.320
 slowly starts to pick up speed 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.010
 so you must clearly calm 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.280
 to move 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.640
 and then when undermining the risk of dative and 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.079
 then she flies until the number is undermined 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:23.140
 while at the top of the tit you will be sharply down 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.739
 learn guys start is very important very 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.440
 important 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.860
 watch your starts so 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.620
 always professional athletes 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.310
 prepare well before the start they are very 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.319
 carefully tuned to start very 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.660
 I get it right 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.330
 takes a position 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.090
 small-small back and forth 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.370
 wrong you to go direction 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.099
 out of the bar will not go wrong 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.010
 then for example you catch any part 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.840
 body you knees that pick up or when 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.640
 start up 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.769
 immediately you express immediately speed 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.930
 stop instantly therefore 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.540
 to correct in the bitch kind of seam rod 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.420
 well you just have to pull it to the 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:12.120
 pelvis abruptly give an undermining and put it 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.120
 neatly racial shelf and she home 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:23.460
 does not cling skip pull up and 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:28.550
 here gave a piece of iron 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.550
 david legs from the movie here it is here 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.759
 too fast they should 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:45.060
 because you get too close 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:54.479
 you get a corner just your legs and you 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:59.669
 can't you beat become a little 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:05.400
 touched your shins and solder tighten 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:10.880
 when exactly to pull away 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.880
 knees and the bar itself does not let go 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:21.240
 More gently pull pull pull summing 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:23.400
 don't get so far 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.099
 let's undermine the action or can not 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.490
 as friends of the bar away from you hold 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:33.650
 start take the correct full stop 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:36.300
 your back is tight and you should 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.330
 back and legs at the same time and you 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.580
 Commerce as a spring I repeat 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.340
 take it slowly 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.009
 very slowly calmly without any 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:52.009
 sudden movements that do not raise 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:55.430
 that so it is impossible 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:58.039
 no way behind these sharp movements 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.389
 do it count as a match you lit 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:01.430
 it burned everything 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:04.039
 that's when you start at the start 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:09.259
 legal movement you do not have enough strength 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:10.999
 to and undermine understand if you me 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:13.069
 don't believe go to limit weight and 

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:15.139
 try not to do it 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:16.909
 do not in any case first you 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:18.800
 can hurt her back she could 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:20.659
 He is able to play in the second you 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.599
 Rod goes wrong path 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:24.969
 wrong again I repeat 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:28.490
 clearly calmly remove and begin 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:29.389
 accelerate the fastest speed it 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.139
 after blasting 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:35.149
 so long ago you fly as it turned out 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:38.149
 earth it doesn't bother anyone you just 

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:39.800
 should clearly this of course care neither you 

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:43.069
 should this account how to properly remove 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:46.219
 exactly smooth and beautiful and send it 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:49.459
 when undermining how to get your hands off 

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:53.330
 letting go all the elbows 

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:56.209
