00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.760 
reason why I do that is to combine those
flavors<00:03:46.260> in<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.980> juicer<00:03:47.459> in<00:03:47.790> one<00:03:48.180> go<00:03:48.540> now<00:03:49.320> if

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
flavors in the juicer in one go now if

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.710 
flavors in the juicer in one go now if
you'd<00:03:50.040> like<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.459> reduce<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.970> amount<00:03:51.150> of<00:03:51.240> pulp

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
you'd like to reduce the amount of pulp

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.260 
you'd like to reduce the amount of pulp
that<00:03:52.080> comes<00:03:52.350> into<00:03:52.590> your<00:03:52.770> juice<00:03:53.250> then<00:03:53.790> putting

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
that comes into your juice then putting

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.230 
that comes into your juice then putting
the<00:03:54.480> fibrous<00:03:55.110> or<00:03:55.320> leafy<00:03:55.740> vegetables<00:03:56.340> last<00:03:56.850> is

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
the fibrous or leafy vegetables last is

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.510 
the fibrous or leafy vegetables last is
a<00:03:57.300> technique<00:03:57.870> if<00:03:58.380> you<00:03:58.500> don't<00:03:58.680> mind<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:58.950> tiny<00:03:59.310> bit

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
a technique if you don't mind a tiny bit

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.880 
a technique if you don't mind a tiny bit
of<00:03:59.640> pulp<00:03:59.880> appearing<00:04:00.690> in<00:04:00.870> your<00:04:01.050> juice<00:04:01.320> and<00:04:01.740> I

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
of pulp appearing in your juice and I

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.490 
of pulp appearing in your juice and I
recommend<00:04:02.310> actually<00:04:02.840> alternating<00:04:03.840> belief

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
recommend actually alternating belief

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.310 
recommend actually alternating belief
your<00:04:04.709> vegetables<00:04:05.340> your<00:04:06.030> stringy<00:04:06.480> vegetables

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
your vegetables your stringy vegetables

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.680 
your vegetables your stringy vegetables
with<00:04:07.920> some<00:04:07.950> of<00:04:08.220> your<00:04:08.400> harder<00:04:08.790> vegetables<00:04:08.940> or

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
with some of your harder vegetables or

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.990 
with some of your harder vegetables or
fruits<00:04:10.110> and<00:04:10.739> that<00:04:10.890> alternation<00:04:11.700> will<00:04:11.820> mean

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
fruits and that alternation will mean

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.610 
fruits and that alternation will mean
that<00:04:12.180> everything<00:04:12.600> gets<00:04:12.750> pushed<00:04:13.110> out<00:04:13.350> the

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
that everything gets pushed out the

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.830 
that everything gets pushed out the
waste<00:04:13.800> chute<00:04:14.580> it<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:14.850> will<00:04:14.940> find<00:04:15.209> this<00:04:15.630> is

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
waste chute it and will find this is

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.630 
waste chute it and will find this is
actually<00:04:15.989> quite<00:04:16.410> dry<00:04:16.950> when<00:04:17.250> it<00:04:17.340> comes<00:04:17.520> down

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
actually quite dry when it comes down

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.890 
actually quite dry when it comes down
I'm<00:04:17.760> squeezing<00:04:18.150> it<00:04:18.299> there<00:04:18.480> and<00:04:18.570> there's<00:04:18.720> no

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
I'm squeezing it there and there's no

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.099 
I'm squeezing it there and there's no
more<00:04:19.109> liquid<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.830> come<00:04:20.280> out<00:04:20.840> and<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:21.930> get<00:04:22.080> a

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
more liquid to come out and you get a

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.030 
more liquid to come out and you get a
great<00:04:22.320> mixed<00:04:22.919> juice<00:04:23.610> in<00:04:24.000> that<00:04:24.210> way

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
great mixed juice in that way

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.330 
great mixed juice in that way
so<00:04:25.160> pop<00:04:25.430> them<00:04:25.640> all<00:04:25.790> through<00:04:26.150> gently<00:04:27.190> ginger<00:04:28.190> of

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
so pop them all through gently ginger of

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.270 
so pop them all through gently ginger of
course<00:04:28.640> gets<00:04:29.360> squeezed<00:04:29.810> so<00:04:30.140> it<00:04:30.260> in<00:04:30.680> comparison

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
course gets squeezed so it in comparison

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.400 
course gets squeezed so it in comparison

this particular juice now remember it is

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.010 
this particular juice now remember it is
a<00:04:39.620> slow<00:04:40.040> juicer<00:04:40.310> so<00:04:41.000> slow<00:04:41.270> masticating

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
a slow juicer so slow masticating

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.350 
a slow juicer so slow masticating

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
the bowl you can open the spout there we

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.280 
the bowl you can open the spout there we

all the way out and having that closed

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.480 
all the way out and having that closed
prevents<00:04:53.840> too<00:04:53.990> much<00:04:54.140> foam<00:04:54.500> from<00:04:54.890> those<00:04:55.040> leafy
