00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
is I just wanted the colors to pop a

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.740 
is I just wanted the colors to pop a
little<00:03:04.410> bit<00:03:04.590> more<00:03:04.739> in<00:03:05.030> retrospect<00:03:06.030> I'm<00:03:06.600> going

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
little bit more in retrospect I'm going

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.720 
little bit more in retrospect I'm going
to<00:03:06.810> be<00:03:06.870> working<00:03:07.050> with<00:03:07.230> that<00:03:07.470> pale<00:03:07.769> mint<00:03:08.280> color

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
to be working with that pale mint color

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.130 
to be working with that pale mint color
in<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.120> palette<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.600> see<00:03:09.750> right<00:03:09.780> there

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
in the palette that you see right there

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.449 
in the palette that you see right there
I<00:03:10.320> probably<00:03:10.860> would<00:03:11.100> have<00:03:11.160> went<00:03:11.280> with

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
I probably would have went with

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.949 
I probably would have went with
something<00:03:11.820> that<00:03:11.850> had<00:03:12.209> more<00:03:12.420> teal<00:03:12.660> in<00:03:12.840> it

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
something that had more teal in it

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.800 
something that had more teal in it
because<00:03:13.080> it's<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.340> little<00:03:14.850> sheer<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.390> ended<00:03:15.690> up

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
because it's a little sheer and ended up

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.690 
because it's a little sheer and ended up
just<00:03:16.200> looking<00:03:16.320> like<00:03:16.500> white<00:03:16.890> on<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.489> lids

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
just looking like white on the lids

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.280 
just looking like white on the lids
which<00:03:18.269> kind<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.540> took<00:03:18.630> this<00:03:18.780> into<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:19.049> weird

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
which kind of took this into a weird

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.490 
which kind of took this into a weird
attack<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.459> 80s<00:03:20.820> kind<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.269> place<00:03:22.019> which

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
attack of the 80s kind of place which

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.060 
attack of the 80s kind of place which
also<00:03:22.709> isn't<00:03:22.950> bad<00:03:23.690> mid-tone<00:03:24.690> purple<00:03:25.110> in<00:03:25.260> the

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
also isn't bad mid-tone purple in the

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.069 
also isn't bad mid-tone purple in the
crease<00:03:26.280> sort<00:03:26.549> of<00:03:26.640> above<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.090> crease<00:03:27.329> around

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
crease sort of above the crease around
