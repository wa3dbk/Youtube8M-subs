we've<00:04:04.060> done<00:04:04.270> is<00:04:04.450> improved<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:04.960> design<00:04:05.290> of<00:04:05.470> it

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
we've done is improved the design of it

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.460 
we've done is improved the design of it
by<00:04:05.770> actually<00:04:05.950> making<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.550> bosses<00:04:07.030> thicker<00:04:07.470> so

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
by actually making the bosses thicker so

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.160 
by actually making the bosses thicker so
when<00:04:08.620> you<00:04:08.709> use<00:04:08.860> the<00:04:09.040> pipe<00:04:09.250> thread<00:04:09.550> it<00:04:09.670> doesn't

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
when you use the pipe thread it doesn't

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.460 
when you use the pipe thread it doesn't
break<00:04:11.170> the<00:04:11.200> boss<00:04:12.060> we<00:04:13.060> use<00:04:13.270> a<00:04:13.660> little<00:04:14.080> larger

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
break the boss we use a little larger

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.320 
break the boss we use a little larger
inside<00:04:14.980> so<00:04:15.280> it<00:04:15.370> actually<00:04:15.610> has<00:04:15.730> a<00:04:15.760> better<00:04:16.030> flow

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330
