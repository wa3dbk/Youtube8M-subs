00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.670 
it is a nice burn I'd give it about a
two<00:02:54.170> out<00:02:54.739> of<00:02:54.799> five<00:02:55.040> for<00:02:55.430> heat<00:02:55.750> um<00:02:56.750> as<00:02:56.989> far<00:02:57.560> as

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
two out of five for heat um as far as

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.500 
two out of five for heat um as far as
flavor<00:02:57.920> go<00:02:58.190> it's<00:02:58.580> you<00:02:59.000> know<00:02:59.120> it's<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.330> loaded

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
flavor go it's you know it's a loaded

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.660 
flavor go it's you know it's a loaded
grillers<00:02:59.780> so<00:03:00.080> it's<00:03:00.260> pretty<00:03:00.860> good<00:03:01.130> it<00:03:01.489> does

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
grillers so it's pretty good it does

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.789 
grillers so it's pretty good it does
have<00:03:01.850> a<00:03:01.910> little<00:03:02.120> bit<00:03:02.239> of<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.480> bitter<00:03:03.320> taste<00:03:03.410> to

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
have a little bit of a bitter taste to

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.100 
have a little bit of a bitter taste to
it<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.489> I<00:03:04.580> think<00:03:04.670> that's<00:03:05.090> attributed<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.720> the

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
it and I think that's attributed to the

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.970 
it and I think that's attributed to the
ghost<00:03:06.709> chilies<00:03:07.100> that<00:03:07.130> they<00:03:07.340> use<00:03:07.600> but<00:03:08.890> you<00:03:09.890> know

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
ghost chilies that they use but you know

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.590 
ghost chilies that they use but you know
it's<00:03:10.220> it's<00:03:10.459> pretty<00:03:10.730> decent<00:03:10.970> it's<00:03:11.390> not

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
it's it's pretty decent it's not

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.710 
it's it's pretty decent it's not
