onto<00:01:52.599> the<00:01:52.899> leaf<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.989> Thermax

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
onto the leaf and Thermax

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.800 
onto the leaf and Thermax
or<00:01:56.619> yucca<00:01:57.039> is<00:01:57.280> also<00:01:57.759> just<00:01:57.969> good<00:01:58.299> for<00:01:58.509> the<00:01:58.539> fan

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
or yucca is also just good for the fan

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.109 
or yucca is also just good for the fan
so<00:01:59.020> Green<00:01:59.409> them<00:01:59.560> up<00:01:59.709> just<00:02:00.099> that<00:02:00.280> on<00:02:00.700> its<00:02:00.939> own

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
so Green them up just that on its own

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.389 
so Green them up just that on its own
and<00:02:01.719> I'm<00:02:02.319> sure<00:02:02.560> that<00:02:02.709> he's<00:02:02.829> mentioned<00:02:03.069> to<00:02:03.310> you

and I'm sure that he's mentioned to you
before<00:02:03.549> that<00:02:03.879> it<00:02:04.030> is<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.209> stress<00:02:04.659> reducer<00:02:04.989> so

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
before that it is a stress reducer so

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.319 
before that it is a stress reducer so
because<00:02:06.219> I'm<00:02:06.399> doing<00:02:06.549> a<00:02:06.759> couple<00:02:07.060> of<00:02:07.119> things

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
because I'm doing a couple of things

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.830 
because I'm doing a couple of things
unfolding<00:02:08.170> these<00:02:08.349> plants<00:02:09.009> grow<00:02:09.720> maybe<00:02:10.720> a

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
unfolding these plants grow maybe a

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.800 
unfolding these plants grow maybe a
little<00:02:11.140> bit<00:02:11.440> longer<00:02:11.980> before<00:02:12.849> we<00:02:13.120> can<00:02:13.450> get

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
little bit longer before we can get

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.819 
little bit longer before we can get
space<00:02:14.200> ready<00:02:14.530> for<00:02:14.799> them<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:16.500> then<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:17.769> know

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
space ready for them and then I know

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.949 
space ready for them and then I know

your humidity together those numbers are

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.990 
your humidity together those numbers are
more<00:03:15.300> than<00:03:15.420> 150<00:03:16.050> you<00:03:17.010> will<00:03:17.220> kill<00:03:17.580> anything

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
that you spray it's very very very bad

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.500 
that you spray it's very very very bad
for<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.959> plants<00:03:22.290> so<00:03:22.410> if<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:22.680> were<00:03:22.830> warm<00:03:23.550> in<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
for the plants so if it were warm in the

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.590 
for the plants so if it were warm in the
afternoon<00:03:25.110> it'd<00:03:25.620> be<00:03:26.160> really<00:03:26.640> tough<00:03:27.239> on<00:03:27.390> these

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.800 
afternoon it'd be really tough on these
plants<00:03:28.110> so<00:03:28.260> we<00:03:28.410> just<00:03:28.590> try<00:03:28.800> not<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:29.010> do<00:03:29.370> any<00:03:29.810> for

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
plants so we just try not to do any for

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.990 
plants so we just try not to do any for
example<00:03:31.260> when<00:03:31.440> Danny<00:03:31.739> is<00:03:31.950> gonna<00:03:32.130> feed<00:03:32.459> out<00:03:32.700> in

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
the field guilt so maybe start he likes

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.170
