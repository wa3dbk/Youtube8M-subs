00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.960
 Now imagine your beautiful garden 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.560
 Imagine the most beautiful garden 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.680
 But even the sun could not illuminate the cizent 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.040
 Then the girl grew up and left the fairy tales behind 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.380
 Even if you were not happy forever. 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.020
 BESIDE THE FANTASTIC HISTORY 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.860
 You left it at the counter yesterday. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.400
 long for crazy 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.020
 No, no, bipolar is not crazy 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.820
 My new playlist 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.040
 What's it? 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.934
 Do you girls come tonight? 

00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:49.434
 Thank you 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.820
 See you there 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.160
 We will 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.520
 I think the story of Adam and Eve is the truest one I've ever heard 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.680
 because things are perfect and we end up spoiling them 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.310
 Hard night? 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.940
 Hard life 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.920
 The secrets make you sick. 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.760
 I know a place. Are you coming? 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.754
 Yes 

00:01:14.794 --> 00:01:16.794
 Do you have drugs on your system? 

00:01:16.794 --> 00:01:18.510
 All the people who come here have it, do not they? 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.240
 Are you ready for this? 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.020
 I think so 

00:01:28.694 --> 00:01:30.694
 Florida Music Festival? Let's go all together 

00:01:31.054 --> 00:01:33.054
 If there is music I will not think of drugs 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.860
 No ... there are no drugs at a music festival, it's a great idea. 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.780
 THE PERSSOAL HISTORY THAT INSPIRED A MOVEMENT 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.420
 Your story is not unique, but it is 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.140
 Thank you 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.080
 You're welcome 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.720
 I think this is all about me finally asking my friends for help 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.580
 One day at a time ... at least that's what my mother told me.
