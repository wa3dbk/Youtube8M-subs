00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.460
 yes 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.600
 Hi, I'm pizza, welcome to Friday 

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:10.430
 of vehicles on today's topic we will see 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.679
 the bomber that has been requested 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.360
 since it came out in rising we will see in 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.250
 where is where to be able 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.630
 find to use what weapons 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.820
 has at your disposal and among others 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.800
 more things do not forget to put your suggestion 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.840
 for the next Friday of vehicles and 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.519
 let's start with the bomber first 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.109
 where the bomber appears 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.640
 all the chain rising maps and the 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.890
 less in the modes of conquest and 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.080
 big conquest now already within those 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.400
 maps have to go in the case of the 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.559
 big conquest have to go to the 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.930
 base of or delta and in the case of 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.839
 small conquest or conquest of less 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.210
 flags to the point charlie is already in the 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:46.220
 base as long as that is captured 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.229
 flag will be able to enter the bunker 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.150
 to call the bomber is easily 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:52.489
 identifiable where you call the bomber 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.470
 for three reasons practically one the 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.930
 color that is different from all the 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.400
 the metal structures 2 has a 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.229
 giant antenna that even moves 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.239
 when available and number 3 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.010
 there is a bomber icon on that 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.049
 bunker when it's available to be 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.939
 used or when it is in use 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.740
 Same icon colors apply themselves 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.890
 is being used not used or 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.810
 others like any other vehicle 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.909
 the time it takes to be used 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.140
 new more than anything varies from the server 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.490
 but they are using the 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.500
 default configuration is 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.119
 around 90 seconds very well 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.490
 entered maps and game modes 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.590
 adequate find the cabin is 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.479
 unoccupied they climb on it they are already 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.070
 inside a bomber now with that 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.869
 tell what they can do with it 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.060
 let's start with what will defend them 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.070
 30 flares that are released as 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.470
 countermeasures and if you do not know how many 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.090
 30 flares just calculation in a lot 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.590
 more time in which the enemy does not 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.970
 can fix on you and that 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.830
 virtually any missile is going to 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.750
 crash against those huge flares 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.490
 seriously if you see the flares are going to 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.430
 realize that they are exclusively from 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.560
 about 130 or a bomber now they 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.530
 touch to attack you who can do 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.970
 with the bomber can move it a 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.950
 slightly sideways not much 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.440
 because it's not maneuverable but if they can 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.390
 aim from the sight that look has for 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.970
 default or by default what they would be 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.979
 four pumps jm which once of 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.170
 sign on the map where they want it to fall 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.000
 will spend a few seconds traveling to your 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.980
 target and they will crash more alone to 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.440
 give you an idea of ​​how much damage 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.020
 makes a bomb to jd a m are around 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.270
 41 to 51 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.850
 2 being 41 points of damage for 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.350
 lbs tanks while they would be 51 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.170
 points for armored vehicles type 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.490
 jeep or the mobile artillery after 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.620
 that have marked the four objectives 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.000
 remember more than anything that the objectives 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.430
 they move and the pumps are slow to arrive 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.620
 they will have a new series of four pumps 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.630
 after three seconds the best 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.030
 strategy is to start with the objectives 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.410
 that are closer to you and then 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.600
 worry about those who will find 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.640
 later on the road because because 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.290
 the look is limited to what would be the 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.240
 that is, they can not turn around very 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.190
 back and if you suddenly shoot 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.230
 your missiles some distant objective and of 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.090
 suddenly they see a succulent delicacy as a 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.710
 tank in a base that is closer 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.540
 of your team's operations center 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.160
 It will not be so easy to return the sight and 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.660
 point to that tank that is closest 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.350
 because they have already passed it is to say 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.270
 best 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.860
 worry about finding goals of 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.480
 close distance and then 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.580
 worry about the objectives that are 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.410
 further go especially against 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.390
 vehicles that are not moving that 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.220
 are waiting to change a position or 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.840
 something similar or that antiaircraft that does not 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.000
 move from its base because that way 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.380
 will guarantee that they will not move as much and 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.150
 most of the pumps are going to fall 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.350
 about them so far almost everything 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.630
 mentioned if the game 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.830
 4 for a good time especially in rising 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.990
 they will realize that it is something 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.670
 relatively obvious but after that 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.680
 which follows if you are completing the 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.440
 mother mission of all pumps as a 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.900
 this will assign them a secondary cannon 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.460
 with a cruise missile like the good 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.950
 similar to what would be the commander's 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.020
 although with less power to get 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.060
 that cruise missile need to destroy a 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.950
 bomber that is they already realized 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.320
 that with so much flare is difficult medium 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.400
 with anti-aircraft missiles so you better 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.160
 I suggest you use the vehicle 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.170
 anti-aircraft or even a hunt 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.790
 reaction to destroy the vehicle that is 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.490
 the first task of the mission the second 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.500
 consists of killing 15 enemies with the 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.360
 bombing does not matter as if they're 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.340
 inside a vehicle or something similar to 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.350
 stand while you kill 15 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.000
 enemies doing this be it one thing 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.130
 first that the other both in the same 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.900
 gone for some reason it does not matter the 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.850
 order will have the missile unlocked 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.110
 cruise for the next time they get on 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.299
 a bomber after having it 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.920
 unlocked everything will look the same but if 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.020
 you press the change button 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.910
 secondary school weapon either in 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.920
 the vehicles in the weapon to change 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.600
 a gun that same button that they use 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.249
 they will change the option to use a 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.929
 single cruise missile 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:36.209
 since they shoot him do not commit the 

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:38.189
 same rookie error that I had not 

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:40.319
 point to where you want this to fall 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:43.049
 it works like a missile or whatever 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:45.659
 a network you guide the rocket to 

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:47.249
 through the sight does not hurt so much and does not 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:49.889
 It is so recommended in comparison to 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:51.449
 jm bombs but good is an option that 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.549
 they have available that does not hurt 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.289
 use in one pass the strategy that 

00:04:53.549 --> 00:04:57.719
 I usually use is to mark the 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.729
 four bombs jd amy after that 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:01.769
 I use the cruise missile once in the 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.509
 that recharge the pumps and use the 

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:05.069
 pumps remaining the rest of the way 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:06.749
 and there it is in less than five minutes 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.549
 all the information we could get 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:10.019
 of the bomber to use it at 

00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:11.639
 maximum unlock in all 

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:13.349
 tools use it to destroy 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.939
 some antiaircraft artillery 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.799
 enemy that are near the base and that 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:18.479
 no tank can reach oled in 

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:19.679
 any use that you like, I hope 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.389
 that you liked the video and about 

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:22.979
 everything that has been informative if it was like that 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.689
 please give a grade to it

 subscribe or can not check others 

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:31.079
 videos that I have to the channel so that 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.819
 convince you give an idea of ​​what I do 

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:35.930
 for notices social networks is in
