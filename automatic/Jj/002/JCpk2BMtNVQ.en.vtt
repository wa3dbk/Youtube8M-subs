I'm<00:02:01.380> going<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.560> do<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.830> Center<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.370> J<00:02:02.610> I've

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
I'm going to do is Center the J I've

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.120 
I'm going to do is Center the J I've
designed<00:02:03.810> these<00:02:03.990> stops<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.770> left<00:02:04.950> and

designed these stops on the left and

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.190 
designed these stops on the left and
right<00:02:05.159> side<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:06.299> when<00:02:06.510> they're<00:02:06.630> flush<00:02:06.930> with

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
the outside of the minor track that's

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.180 
the outside of the minor track that's
zeros<00:02:11.700> tenon<00:02:12.269> jig<00:02:12.500> essentially<00:02:13.500> centering<00:02:14.069> it

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
zeros tenon jig essentially centering it

on<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:15.660> router<00:02:16.020> bed<00:02:16.490> so<00:02:17.490> now<00:02:17.640> when<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:17.850> move

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
on the router bed so now when I move

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.400 
on the router bed so now when I move
these<00:02:18.360> out

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
these out

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.920 
these out
with<00:02:19.620> distance<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:21.150> will<00:02:21.300> determine<00:02:21.690> the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
with distance that will determine the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.810 
with distance that will determine the
travel<00:02:22.520> left-to-right<00:02:23.520> of<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.840> tenon<00:02:25.200> jig<00:02:25.820> so

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
travel left-to-right of the tenon jig so

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.570 
travel left-to-right of the tenon jig so
I'm<00:02:26.910> going<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.120> dial<00:02:27.330> those<00:02:27.510> in<00:02:28.070> setup<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.340> make

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
I'm going to dial those in setup to make

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.320 
I'm going to dial those in setup to make
a<00:02:30.020> mortise<00:02:31.020> that's<00:02:31.550> just<00:02:32.550> under<00:02:32.760> two<00:02:33.030> inches

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
a mortise that's just under two inches

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.930 
a mortise that's just under two inches
wide<00:02:37.430> now<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:38.700> have<00:02:38.880> those<00:02:39.000> locked<00:02:39.300> in

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
wide now that I have those locked in

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.330 
wide now that I have those locked in
you'll<00:02:41.940> notice<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.510> distance<00:02:43.160> that<00:02:44.160> the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
you'll notice the distance that the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.670 
you'll notice the distance that the
tenon<00:02:44.670> jig<00:02:44.850> can<00:02:45.060> travel<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.930> restricted<00:02:46.380> by

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
tenon jig can travel is restricted by

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.160 
tenon jig can travel is restricted by
those<00:02:46.890> stops<00:02:47.280> there's<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.420> two<00:02:48.570> pieces<00:02:49.020> and

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
those stops there's the two pieces and

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.940 
those stops there's the two pieces and
I'm<00:02:49.260> going<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.530> join<00:02:50.540> typical<00:02:51.680> loose<00:02:52.680> tenon

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
I'm going to join typical loose tenon

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.830 
I'm going to join typical loose tenon
joinery<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:54.690> rail<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.230> style<00:02:55.530> fashion

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
joinery in a rail and style fashion

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.670 
joinery in a rail and style fashion
we're<00:02:57.840> going<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.170> create<00:02:58.350> a<00:02:58.410> mortise<00:02:58.800> here<00:02:59.670> and

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
we're going to create a mortise here and

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.100 
we're going to create a mortise here and
a<00:03:01.680> mortise<00:03:02.010> on<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.250> end<00:03:02.370> of<00:03:02.490> this<00:03:02.610> board<00:03:03.110> and

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
a mortise on the end of this board and

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.620 
a mortise on the end of this board and
then<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.320> loose<00:03:04.500> tenon<00:03:04.830> will<00:03:05.040> join<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.460> two<00:03:05.640> so

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
then it loose tenon will join the two so

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.590 
then it loose tenon will join the two so
the<00:03:06.750> next<00:03:06.960> step<00:03:08.060> it's<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.150> center<00:03:09.480> of<00:03:09.510> the

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
the next step it's the center of the

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.870 
the next step it's the center of the
tenon<00:03:09.930> jig<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:11.040> mortise<00:03:11.550> will<00:03:11.760> be

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
tenon jig so that the mortise will be

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.830 
tenon jig so that the mortise will be
created<00:03:12.360> in<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:13.830> middle<00:03:14.160> of<00:03:14.820> this<00:03:15.300> board<00:03:15.630> and

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
created in the middle of this board and

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.260 
created in the middle of this board and
as<00:03:16.410> long<00:03:16.680> as<00:03:16.710> I<00:03:17.310> don't<00:03:17.640> make<00:03:18.030> an<00:03:18.150> adjustment

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
as long as I don't make an adjustment

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.310 
as long as I don't make an adjustment
between<00:03:19.140> cutting<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.770> mortise<00:03:20.750> in<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:22.110> rail

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
between cutting the mortise in the rail

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.970 
between cutting the mortise in the rail
or<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:23.100> style<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:25.290> mortise<00:03:25.620> will<00:03:25.830> be

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
or the style the mortise will be

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.430 
or the style the mortise will be
equidistance<00:03:26.790> from<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.060> face<00:03:27.300> of<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:28.170> next

mortise down the first board is complete

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.670 
mortise down the first board is complete
we're<00:04:47.669> gonna<00:04:47.759> move<00:04:47.969> on<00:04:48.180> to<00:04:48.210> mortising<00:04:48.809> the<00:04:48.990> the

we're gonna move on to mortising the the
other<00:04:49.830> board<00:04:51.289> again<00:04:52.289> we've<00:04:52.469> got<00:04:52.649> a<00:04:52.680> centerline

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:53.129 
other board again we've got a centerline

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:58.059 
other board again we've got a centerline
on<00:04:53.580> this<00:04:54.089> board<00:04:54.559> and<00:04:55.559> there's<00:04:55.949> the<00:04:56.099> centerline

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:58.069

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:28.050 

we're<00:05:09.040> ready<00:05:09.220> to<00:05:09.370> do<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:09.670> second<00:05:10.030> piece

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.700 

so<00:05:29.060> we<00:05:29.210> have<00:05:29.360> the<00:05:29.480> exact<00:05:29.870> same<00:05:29.990> mortise<00:05:30.650> with
