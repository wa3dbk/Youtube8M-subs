00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.420
 Hi all 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.549
 in this little tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.740
 explain how to keep your 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.170
 text messages once you decide 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.180
 change our android terminal to 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.939
 that you just have to use a 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.840
 application that you can find for free 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:24.820
 in the google plate here in the video there 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.960
 you can appreciate the name well but 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.449
 good is sms backup andrÃ©s store 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.160
 buy as I mentioned earlier your 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:37.079
 free application 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.730
 then the low is to install and once 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.019
 already installed you can open it 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.699
 you will see that they appear different 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.790
 options the first is the copy of 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.970
 security and the second is to restore 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.040
 then the third view then it is to see 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.159
 all the backups that you have 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.809
 is stored and look good then 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.339
 simply to put for example a 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.170
 date if you do not find it to a 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.880
 reference to find your 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.530
 previous backups 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.220
 the operation is very simple 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.550
 you just give backup 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.020
 you choose the name you want to put on 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.550
 file your backup I 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.650
 for example I will put 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.650
 from December 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.979
 13 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.979
 and I give it to ok 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.170
 and you see that it starts 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.570
 to make a backup you will see that 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.130
 it's very fast so good for not 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.490
 make us wait I'm going to cut here the 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.509
 video and once finished it continued 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.080
 well, the backup copy already 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.450
 finished 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:46.100
 I like here copy security completed 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:48.820
 successfully 7 thousand 350 messages zero failure 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.320
 altogether good since 7 thousand 350 messages 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.870
 then right now we have a 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.680
 backup in internal memory 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.230
 we also have the option for example 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.290
 to store them in google drive or 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.630
 in other other platforms 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.300
 storage in the cloud simply in 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.690
 the upper corner here appears the 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.270
 option of menu we unfold it and we give it 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.820
 to the option to send file 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.480
 we choose the file that we want in this 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.780
 case I created December 13 what 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.060
 selected I give ok and here because I already 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.590
 appear the different options that 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.130
 I have for example send by email 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:35.890
 add to the dropbox add to my unit 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:39.300
 drive and it would be so easy then how to give it 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.300
 and just upload the 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.820
 then how do we restore 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.690
 very easy we just go to the second 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:50.650
 restore menu option 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.810
 we choose the file that we want 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.820
 restore in this case is the file 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.000
 December 13 that he just created him 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.910
 I give ok and you get an option for 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.580
 example restore all messages or 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.720
 then restore only the messages 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.930
 sent received since the date then 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.630
 that you decide so the truth is very 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.450
 very easy is very simple and apart from the 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.910
 application is free following these 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.730
 simple steps because you will be able to 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.150
 keep your text messages a 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.500
 Once you decide to change the terminal and nothing 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.180
 that 's all if you have any questions 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.220
