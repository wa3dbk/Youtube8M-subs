00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
we're going to talk about they cast on

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.210 
we're going to talk about they cast on
how<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.339> show<00:00:06.150> you<00:00:06.210> how<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.600> cast<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.589> baitcaster

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
how to show you how to cast a baitcaster

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.089 
how to show you how to cast a baitcaster
or<00:00:08.309> outfit<00:00:08.700> okay<00:00:09.599> so<00:00:10.139> we<00:00:10.320> know<00:00:10.440> that<00:00:10.469> we've<00:00:10.889> got

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
or outfit okay so we know that we've got

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.580 
or outfit okay so we know that we've got
the<00:00:11.340> center<00:00:11.910> school<00:00:12.599> control<00:00:13.230> knob<00:00:13.469> he

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
the center school control knob he

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.880 
the center school control knob he
adjusted<00:00:14.130> so<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.460> line<00:00:14.639> just<00:00:14.969> falls<00:00:15.890> and

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
adjusted so the line just falls and

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.010 
adjusted so the line just falls and
stops<00:00:17.190> towards<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.760> ground<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.330> we<00:00:18.900> know

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
stops towards the ground so that we know

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.670 
stops towards the ground so that we know
that<00:00:19.050> that's<00:00:19.380> set<00:00:19.680> correctly<00:00:21.470> also<00:00:22.470> we're

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
that that's set correctly also we're

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.960 
that that's set correctly also we're
going<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.859> determine<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.310> wind<00:00:23.490> factor<00:00:23.670> if

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
going to determine the wind factor if

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.550 
going to determine the wind factor if
I'll<00:00:24.119> be<00:00:24.150> casting<00:00:24.600> into<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.869> window<00:00:25.199> we<00:00:25.320> cast

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
I'll be casting into the window we cast
