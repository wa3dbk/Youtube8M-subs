00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
for me I mean that three is the point I

for me I mean that three is the point I
wouldn't<00:02:00.810> say<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.610> some

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860

who eats me is not a compassionate
person<00:02:05.970> but<00:02:06.970> I<00:02:07.150> think<00:02:07.390> there's<00:02:07.540> definitely

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
person but I think there's definitely

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.779 
person but I think there's definitely
something<00:02:08.259> to<00:02:08.410> work<00:02:08.560> on<00:02:08.740> there<00:02:08.950> on<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.670> other

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
something to work on there on the other

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.360 
something to work on there on the other
hand<00:02:10.030> just<00:02:10.450> because<00:02:10.810> somebody<00:02:11.680> doesn't<00:02:12.070> eat

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
hand just because somebody doesn't eat

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.470 
hand just because somebody doesn't eat
me<00:02:12.550> it<00:02:12.760> doesn't<00:02:13.030> mean<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.210> they're

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
me it doesn't mean that they're

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.900 
me it doesn't mean that they're
necessarily<00:02:13.960> very<00:02:14.260> compassionate<00:02:15.190> overall

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
necessarily very compassionate overall

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.420 
necessarily very compassionate overall
at<00:02:16.180> all<00:02:16.420> so<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:17.410> could<00:02:17.440> have<00:02:17.680> one<00:02:17.830> person<00:02:18.220> who

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
at all so you could have one person who

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.430 
at all so you could have one person who
eats<00:02:18.580> me<00:02:18.820> who's<00:02:19.150> very<00:02:19.450> very<00:02:19.750> compassionate<00:02:20.080> in

know whether that judging is actually
happening<00:03:01.030> or<00:03:01.180> whether<00:03:02.080> this<00:03:02.380> is<00:03:02.440> just<00:03:02.770> a

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
happening or whether this is just a

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.670 
happening or whether this is just a
perception<00:03:03.310> because<00:03:03.550> sometimes<00:03:03.850> people<00:03:03.910> feel

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
perception because sometimes people feel

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.740 
perception because sometimes people feel
guilty<00:03:05.680> or<00:03:05.920> uneasy<00:03:06.489> when<00:03:06.700> they're<00:03:06.880> doing

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
people don't do but it's quite possible

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.960 
people don't do but it's quite possible
that<00:03:12.510> this<00:03:13.510> person<00:03:13.930> is<00:03:14.110> being<00:03:14.640> judged<00:03:15.640> and

that this person is being judged and

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.600 
that this person is being judged and
that<00:03:16.540> would<00:03:16.690> be<00:03:16.720> that<00:03:17.530> would<00:03:17.920> be<00:03:18.100> a<00:03:18.130> shame<00:03:18.370> I

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
that would be that would be a shame I

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.930 
that would be that would be a shame I
think<00:03:19.180> those<00:03:20.080> of<00:03:20.200> us<00:03:20.380> who<00:03:20.739> are<00:03:21.010> vegetarian

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
think those of us who are vegetarian

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.539 
think those of us who are vegetarian
should<00:03:22.299> remember<00:03:22.720> that<00:03:23.200> when<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.100> but<00:03:24.250> in<00:03:24.459> the

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
should remember that when the but in the

should remember that when the but in the
case<00:03:24.700> of<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.970> vast<00:03:25.150> majority<00:03:25.239> of<00:03:25.690> us<00:03:26.080> there

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
case of the vast majority of us there

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.050 
case of the vast majority of us there
was<00:03:26.799> a<00:03:26.830> time<00:03:27.010> when<00:03:27.250> we<00:03:27.370> were<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.519> vegetarian

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
was a time when we were a vegetarian

was a time when we were a vegetarian
there<00:03:28.420> was<00:03:28.510> a<00:03:28.540> time<00:03:28.780> when<00:03:28.950> we<00:03:29.950> probably<00:03:31.799> didn't

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
there was a time when we probably didn't

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.509 
there was a time when we probably didn't
care<00:03:33.090> didn't<00:03:34.090> want<00:03:34.209> to<00:03:34.299> know<00:03:34.860> maybe<00:03:35.860> you<00:03:36.400> know

in<00:03:36.580> my<00:03:36.610> case<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:37.120> used<00:03:37.299> to<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:37.750> know<00:03:37.780> argue<00:03:38.230> with

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
in my case I used to you know argue with

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.960 
in my case I used to you know argue with
my<00:03:38.560> system<00:03:39.190> I<00:03:39.340> used<00:03:39.549> to<00:03:39.580> be<00:03:39.760> quite<00:03:39.790> the

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
my system I used to be quite the

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.820 
my system I used to be quite the
sarcastic<00:03:40.390> but<00:03:40.989> are<00:03:41.230> being<00:03:41.530> vegetarian<00:03:43.830> that

sarcastic but are being vegetarian that

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.910 
sarcastic but are being vegetarian that
kind<00:03:45.040> of<00:03:45.070> regret<00:03:45.730> no<00:03:46.480> obviously<00:03:49.530> there<00:03:50.530> was

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
kind of regret no obviously there was

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.740 
kind of regret no obviously there was
probably<00:03:51.190> a<00:03:51.250> time<00:03:51.459> when<00:03:51.670> we<00:03:51.880> you<00:03:52.420> know<00:03:52.540> thought

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
probably a time when we you know thought

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.330 
probably a time when we you know thought
the<00:03:52.840> vegetarianism<00:03:53.350> was<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.650> good<00:03:53.860> thing<00:03:54.100> but

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
the vegetarianism was a good thing but

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.610 
the vegetarianism was a good thing but
it<00:03:54.580> was<00:03:54.760> difficult<00:03:55.660> for<00:03:55.900> us<00:03:56.080> to<00:03:56.110> do<00:03:56.290> there<00:03:56.500> was

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
it was difficult for us to do there was

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.580 
it was difficult for us to do there was
a<00:03:56.650> strong<00:03:57.090> habit<00:03:58.090> therapist<00:03:58.780> for<00:03:59.170> some<00:03:59.320> people

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
a strong habit therapist for some people

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.680 
a strong habit therapist for some people
they've<00:04:00.250> tried<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.489> be<00:04:00.670> vegetarian<00:04:00.820> defend

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
they've tried to be vegetarian defend

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.069 
they've tried to be vegetarian defend
that<00:04:01.810> if<00:04:01.989> occasionally<00:04:02.670> slipped<00:04:03.670> from<00:04:04.090> so<00:04:05.049> I

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
that if occasionally slipped from so I

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.520 
that if occasionally slipped from so I
think<00:04:05.350> it<00:04:05.500> behooves<00:04:06.160> all<00:04:06.610> of<00:04:07.180> us<00:04:07.380> who<00:04:08.380> are

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
think it behooves all of us who are

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.559 
think it behooves all of us who are
vegetarian<00:04:09.130> too

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
vegetarian too

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.809 
vegetarian too
remember<00:04:09.959> that<00:04:10.260> it's<00:04:10.859> not<00:04:10.980> necessarily<00:04:11.609> an

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
remember that it's not necessarily an

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.869 
remember that it's not necessarily an
easy<00:04:11.939> thing<00:04:12.269> and<00:04:12.680> you<00:04:13.680> know<00:04:13.709> we've<00:04:14.010> been<00:04:14.370> there

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
easy thing and you know we've been there

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.140 
easy thing and you know we've been there
ourselves<00:04:15.299> it's<00:04:15.959> very<00:04:16.109> easy<00:04:16.350> I<00:04:16.739> think<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.549> say

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
ourselves it's very easy I think to say

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.520 
ourselves it's very easy I think to say
while<00:04:18.419> I'm<00:04:18.449> a<00:04:18.570> vegetarian<00:04:18.720> so<00:04:19.199> now<00:04:19.350> I'm

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
while I'm a vegetarian so now I'm

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.420 
while I'm a vegetarian so now I'm
perfect<00:04:20.329> anyone<00:04:21.329> who<00:04:21.860> eats<00:04:22.860> meat<00:04:23.250> is

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
perfect anyone who eats meat is

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.129 
perfect anyone who eats meat is
obviously<00:04:23.789> not<00:04:24.000> how<00:04:24.509> are<00:04:24.630> you<00:04:24.690> doing<00:04:24.870> it

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
obviously not how are you doing it

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.620 
obviously not how are you doing it
they're<00:04:25.289> not<00:04:25.410> really<00:04:25.590> a<00:04:25.710> Buddhist<00:04:26.039> I<00:04:26.630> think

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
they're not really a Buddhist I think

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.219 
they're not really a Buddhist I think
that's<00:04:27.780> that<00:04:28.380> would<00:04:28.530> be<00:04:28.650> most<00:04:28.860> unhelpful<00:04:29.520> so

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
that's that would be most unhelpful so
