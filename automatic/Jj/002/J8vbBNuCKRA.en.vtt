00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
Paula meets just like that big feature

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.440 
Paula meets just like that big feature
right<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.040> crosses<00:00:35.400> over<00:00:35.520> into<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:35.940> many<00:00:36.060> areas

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
right it crosses over into so many areas

I'm a living testimony to holla meat

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.450 
I'm a living testimony to holla meat
being<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.420> really<00:00:39.690> fun<00:00:40.110> mode<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.680> skateboarding

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
being a really fun mode of skateboarding

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.650 
being a really fun mode of skateboarding
we're<00:00:41.640> really<00:00:41.790> excited<00:00:42.030> about<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.450> actually

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
we're really excited about it's actually

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.580 
we're really excited about it's actually
one<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.840> more<00:00:42.900> fun<00:00:43.140> things<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.500> we're

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
one of the more fun things that we're

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.470 
one of the more fun things that we're
doing<00:00:43.650> another<00:00:44.340> way<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.610> play

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.090 

our<00:00:49.480> guy<00:00:49.630> isn't<00:00:49.930> dead<00:00:50.260> when<00:00:50.560> he<00:00:50.680> wipes<00:00:50.890> out

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
our guy isn't dead when he wipes out

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.830 
our guy isn't dead when he wipes out
it's<00:00:51.490> not<00:00:51.610> like<00:00:51.760> a<00:00:51.820> loss<00:00:52.090> of<00:00:52.300> control<00:00:52.450> it's

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
it's not like a loss of control it's

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.830 
it's not like a loss of control it's
still<00:00:53.050> a<00:00:53.080> continuous<00:00:53.830> game<00:00:54.330> you<00:00:55.330> have<00:00:55.450> control

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
still a continuous game you have control

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.810 
still a continuous game you have control
while<00:00:56.170> he's<00:00:56.380> falling<00:00:56.830> to<00:00:57.070> like<00:00:57.370> spin<00:00:57.790> a

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
while he's falling to like spin a

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.840 
while he's falling to like spin a
flippin<00:00:58.720> angle<00:00:59.500> him<00:00:59.590> back<00:00:59.830> you<00:01:00.520> can<00:01:00.670> use<00:01:00.760> the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
flippin angle him back you can use the

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:01.980 
flippin angle him back you can use the
left<00:01:01.030> stick<00:01:01.150> to<00:01:01.270> actually<00:01:01.510> tweak<00:01:01.690> your<00:01:01.810> body

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:01.990 
left stick to actually tweak your body

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.570 
left stick to actually tweak your body
it's<00:01:02.230> been<00:01:02.380> faster<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:02.830> faster<00:01:02.950> spin<00:01:03.400> any

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
it's been faster and faster spin any

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.880 
it's been faster and faster spin any
direction<00:01:03.850> back<00:01:04.270> left<00:01:04.809> right<00:01:05.080> whatever<00:01:05.230> pull

in<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:06.100> same<00:01:06.130> direction<00:01:06.310> go<00:01:07.150> into<00:01:07.360> a

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
in the same direction go into a

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.140 
in the same direction go into a
cannonball<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:09.070> can<00:01:09.250> counteract<00:01:09.610> that<00:01:09.790> spin

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
cannonball you can counteract that spin

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.420 
cannonball you can counteract that spin
by<00:01:10.330> pushing<00:01:10.570> one<00:01:10.840> way<00:01:11.020> open<00:01:11.740> up<00:01:11.830> your<00:01:11.979> body<00:01:12.190> to

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
by pushing one way open up your body to

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.719 
by pushing one way open up your body to
slow<00:01:12.640> down<00:01:12.760> your<00:01:13.030> spin<00:01:17.370> we've<00:01:18.370> always<00:01:18.520> had

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
slow down your spin we've always had

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.310 
slow down your spin we've always had
great<00:01:18.940> physics<00:01:19.390> in<00:01:19.510> the<00:01:19.570> white<00:01:19.690> boats<00:01:19.900> but<00:01:20.140> now

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
great physics in the white boats but now

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.240 
great physics in the white boats but now
they've<00:01:20.560> really<00:01:20.860> like<00:01:21.040> come<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.670> life<00:01:23.250> just

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
they've really like come to life just

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.859 
they've really like come to life just
having<00:01:24.850> control<00:01:25.180> while<00:01:25.390> you're<00:01:25.540> playing<00:01:25.630> a

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
having control while you're playing a

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.630 
having control while you're playing a
game<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:28.630> awesome<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.369> then<00:01:30.369> once<00:01:30.520> you're

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
game that's awesome and then once you're

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.680 
game that's awesome and then once you're
actually<00:01:30.700> falling<00:01:31.150> through<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.300> cracking

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
actually falling through the cracking

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.770 
actually falling through the cracking
open<00:01:32.490> when<00:01:33.490> you've<00:01:33.640> left<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:34.000> ground<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.600> you

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
open when you've left the ground to you

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.940 
open when you've left the ground to you
hit<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.080> ground<00:01:35.229> how<00:01:35.440> far<00:01:35.710> did<00:01:35.830> you<00:01:35.890> actually

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
hit the ground how far did you actually

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.550 
hit the ground how far did you actually
fall<00:01:36.369> like<00:01:36.670> down<00:01:36.820> to<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.150> one<00:01:37.780> centimeter<00:01:38.320> for

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
fall like down to the one centimeter for

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.920 
fall like down to the one centimeter for
all<00:01:38.619> you<00:01:38.770> Canadians

all you Canadians
the<00:01:41.440> speed<00:01:41.800> at<00:01:42.070> which<00:01:42.130> you<00:01:42.760> bail

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.289 

dragged<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.320> ground<00:01:46.560> when<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.860> feel<00:01:47.299> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
dragged on the ground when you feel the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.580 
dragged on the ground when you feel the
intensity<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.810> your<00:01:48.840> impact<00:01:49.140> within<00:01:49.469> the

intensity of your impact within the
multiple<00:01:49.890> impacts<00:01:50.189> well<00:01:50.399> then<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.820> go<00:01:51.000> elbow

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
multiple impacts well then you go elbow

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.569 
multiple impacts well then you go elbow
to<00:01:51.600> wrist<00:01:51.930> finger<00:01:52.500> or<00:01:52.770> did<00:01:52.979> your<00:01:53.100> wrist<00:01:53.399> hit

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
to wrist finger or did your wrist hit

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.830 
to wrist finger or did your wrist hit
first<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.060> then<00:01:54.179> you<00:01:54.240> kind<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.420> rolled<00:01:54.630> over

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
first and then you kind of rolled over

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.300 
first and then you kind of rolled over
onto<00:01:54.990> your<00:01:55.079> elbow<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.890> actually<00:01:55.979> know<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
onto your elbow we actually know the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.830 
onto your elbow we actually know the
order<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.610> which<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.729> hit<00:01:56.939> things<00:01:57.179> did<00:01:57.719> you

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840
