00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.710
 This exercise program demonstrates detection and pulmonary plague 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.610
 enemy Titans 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.780
 The Titan is protected by a strong defense shield 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.420
 the only effective remedy against the offender a shield is the Titan from the 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.740
 Missile System Block 3 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.070
 Several of these missile silos were on the battlefield 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.630
 positioned 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.290
 if this article control you Sidos 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.650
 incoming enemy titans will automatically launch Titan like missiles 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.200
 attacked 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.180
 Horseradish a rocket silos to make a kinked 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.020
 once you have control of the active silo, the system works 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.640
 from car market 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.640
 So the rocket launches regular intervals 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.410
 the shield of Titans takes damage 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.090
 the leg automatically stops 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.090
 so you always have the status of the sign in view 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.230
 the more you control Lucent the faster you can shield at the beginning 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.520
 turn off 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.050
 the step is overcome 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.060
 The rockets continue to damage digital for too long 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.340
 until he finally destroys 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.780
 but there is also a faster way to destroy a guitar 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.010
 Once the Shiit has been neutralized, you can answer enemy Taz 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.850
 de 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.100
 The easiest way to get on board is to use an air transport 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.080
 vehicle 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.850
 Andy Reiss, on the other hand 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.050
 Launch ports rested 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.240
 you to the Titan 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.270
 as you can see, the on-board system of the em-title has been torn down 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.419
 to go on parole 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.049
 as soon as you are in reach strong the BAG with the right mouse button 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:15.979
 it will be booked out automatically in the next few days 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.579
 I think that does not come after the standard 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.489
 knew the strongly secured reactor cores 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.249
 Access to the reactor cores too 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:34.739
 had destroyed first four terminals inside the Titans 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.399
 destroy the Cologne 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:38.899
 on the lower level 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:40.779
 Terminals on the top 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:42.609
 to reach theirs 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.439
 you can tell the terminals 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:48.439
 Ignite explosives 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:52.289
 you have access now 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.769
 after the destruction of the reactor core remains only too 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:03.169
 Leave Titan 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:05.239
 before the 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.489
 that's the field
