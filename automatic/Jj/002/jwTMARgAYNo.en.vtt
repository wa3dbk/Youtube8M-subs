00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:19.430
 summer 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.430
 every note we come here 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.520
 and here it is the long-awaited republican 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.410
 event of all-Russian scale 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.200
 only queens so-called Russian 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.239
 provinces have opened the first in the last 25 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.610
 Years New Opera and Ballet Theater 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.350
 so many regions do not even dream 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.150
 This event which this year already 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.580
 called the main thing in cultural life 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.770
 the entire region is dedicated to the declared 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.170
 in Russia and in maria el in particular year 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.680
 culture than we arrange deposits today 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.780
 money 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.340
 it is impossible to grow in culture 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.500
 individuals without comprehensive development to 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.540
 only sport needs to swim well 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.180
 need to be able to skate need 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.010
 fight and protect myself from me but 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.870
 spiritual food must be present in 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.880
 nurturing so our young 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.860
 generation must join the culture 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.960
 in order to join our culture 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.330
 our cultural institutions will be such 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.210
 which was not ashamed to receive guests and 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.700
 to make artists proud of their theaters 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.860
 their philharmonic did not give great 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.200
 staging a new building is not a whim but 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.450
 rather the need for a chorus is spoken and 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.610
 artists and the audience the fact is that the troupe 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.920
 Opera and Ballet Theater did not have 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.470
 own scene 46 years old namely 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.119
 so much theater they shared it with 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.280
 national drama theater 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.680
 if almost half a century ago in the same building 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.899
 there was plenty of room for two theaters 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.640
 in recent years, theaters literally 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.729
 huddled everyone saw that he was not a son 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.410
 enough why not enough 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.570
 not only for the ballet performance and 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.790
 there was not enough for someone already and for experience and 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.250
 because today we are big choirs 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.540
 sex with very large performances and of course 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.180
 we needed to give a big space 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.610
 we sit and hurt it just life but 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.950
 On was necessary build theater began 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.200
 back in 2006, the foundation was poured 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.150
 laid a memorial stone and construction 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.400
 boil how much labor here 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.769
 experts and read now probably 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.900
 tricky best builders designers 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.250
 both watched from nearby 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.010
 Regions are now safe. 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.230
 say the new theater of opera and ballet 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.420
 the largest and most technically challenging in 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.549
 all over the background so it is here in 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.190
 new theater building surrounded by power 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.730
 Republic and artists turned and Dmitri 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.430
 Medvedev 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.299
 we are not very often 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.420
 new theaters are opening and it is always 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:47.569
 events in the life of the country and large 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.920
 event and if we talk about theaters 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:57.340
 which open in the regions 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:02.709
 then probably this is a rather rare story 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:06.319
 the more pleasant it is 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:09.230

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.260
