00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 two 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.790
 Hi, I'm Benavidez level and this is a 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.520
 advice over practical natural cooking 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.820
 this time we are going to make a juice of 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.130
 tomato with orange this recipe the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.110
 let's take out because we have a little left 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.849
 of the pulp of a tomato recipe 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.650
 stuffed with rice and like here not 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.930
 we wasted nothing we are going to do this 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.680
 delicious refreshing juice for in the 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.510
 tomorrow we're going to need 3 oranges and the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.670
 leftovers of our tomatoes that in 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.680
 this case are 2 I already have here some 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.740
 peeled oranges let's take the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.230
 peel we're not going to squeeze the juice going to 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.530
 be a very healthy game we will have all 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.530
 the fiber 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.560
 since we have it peeled we split it in 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.860
 3 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.380
 this is to see where we have seeds 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.400
 since the seeds and we grind it in the 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.400
 blender can sour 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.440
 well we put in the blender the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.440
 tomatoes 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.040
 If your oranges are not very sweet 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.210
 you can add a little sugar and 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.600
 we add the oranges I also have here 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.270
 prepared a little bit like half a glass 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.740
 of water in case it costs me work in 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.740
 liquefy whatever is very thick 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.980
 in this way we are going to take advantage of all 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.980
 the fibers of the orange 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.420
 I did not need the water, I think it's 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.840
 and so you like more liquid you can 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.840
 You can add 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.000
 I am benavÃ­dez level and remember that we are 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.000
 what we eat
