00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:05.539 

now<00:00:04.259> let's<00:00:04.470> got<00:00:04.650> a<00:00:04.680> little<00:00:04.859> bit<00:00:04.950> deeper<00:00:05.310> into

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
now let's got a little bit deeper into

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.390 
now let's got a little bit deeper into
modeling<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.420> take<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.080> look<00:00:07.379> at<00:00:07.589> modifiers

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
modeling and take a look at modifiers

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.000 
modeling and take a look at modifiers
now<00:00:09.090> up<00:00:09.330> until<00:00:09.660> this<00:00:09.780> point<00:00:09.900> we've<00:00:10.740> been

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
now up until this point we've been

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.820 
now up until this point we've been
working<00:00:11.519> mostly<00:00:12.090> with<00:00:12.210> editing<00:00:13.080> tools<00:00:13.380> on<00:00:13.679> the

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
working mostly with editing tools on the

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.980 
working mostly with editing tools on the
object<00:00:14.309> tools<00:00:14.610> palette<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.299> those<00:00:15.839> are

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
object tools palette and those are

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.010 
object tools palette and those are
pretty<00:00:16.199> much<00:00:16.379> one-time<00:00:17.220> operation<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.359> if<00:00:18.600> you

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
pretty much one-time operation so if you

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.349 
pretty much one-time operation so if you
were<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.260> extrude<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:20.039> face<00:00:20.340> for<00:00:20.609> example<00:00:20.730> once

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
were to extrude a face for example once

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.420 
were to extrude a face for example once
you've<00:00:21.510> extruded<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.170> it's<00:00:22.619> done<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.250> you

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
you've extruded it it's done and you

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.269 
you've extruded it it's done and you
move<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.000> next<00:00:24.269> operation<00:00:25.279> modifiers

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
move on to the next operation modifiers

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.580 
move on to the next operation modifiers
are<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.670> lot<00:00:27.029> more<00:00:27.269> interactive<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.439> you

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
are a lot more interactive in that you

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.380 
are a lot more interactive in that you
can<00:00:28.800> come<00:00:29.039> back<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.550> them<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.910> change

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
can come back to them and change

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.139 
can come back to them and change
parameters<00:00:31.080> later<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:32.340> these<00:00:32.489> can<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:32.759> really

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
parameters later so these can be really

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.370 
parameters later so these can be really
handy<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:34.140> more<00:00:34.950> complex<00:00:35.489> objects<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:37.170> let's

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
handy for more complex objects so let's

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.049 
handy for more complex objects so let's
take<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> look<00:00:37.800> at<00:00:37.890> these<00:00:38.040> I'm<00:00:38.550> gonna<00:00:38.820> go<00:00:38.969> ahead

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
take a look at these I'm gonna go ahead

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.639 
take a look at these I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:00:39.420> right-click<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:40.140> my<00:00:40.829> box<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:42.260> expand<00:00:43.260> my

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and right-click on my box and expand my

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.920 
and right-click on my box and expand my
properties<00:00:44.280> panel<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.180> way<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.510> see

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
properties panel so that way I can see

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.200 
properties panel so that way I can see
all<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.230> my<00:00:46.379> tabs<00:00:46.770> here<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.250> I'm<00:00:47.850> gonna<00:00:48.059> look

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
all of my tabs here and I'm gonna look

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.690 
all of my tabs here and I'm gonna look
for<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> little<00:00:48.870> wrench<00:00:49.170> here<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.800> that's<00:00:50.399> my

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
for the little wrench here and that's my

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.229 
for the little wrench here and that's my
object<00:00:51.210> modifiers<00:00:51.809> tab<00:00:52.550> now<00:00:53.550> once<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.879> open

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
object modifiers tab now once I open

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.939 
object modifiers tab now once I open
that<00:00:54.270> up<00:00:54.570> you'll<00:00:54.809> see<00:00:54.870> well<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.350> don't<00:00:55.680> have

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
that up you'll see well I don't have

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.049 
that up you'll see well I don't have
much<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.550> here

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
much in here

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.319 
much in here
but<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.449> do<00:00:57.570> have<00:00:57.930> an<00:00:58.140> Add<00:00:58.440> modifier<00:00:58.800> button<00:00:59.670> so

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
but I do have an Add modifier button so

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.750 
but I do have an Add modifier button so
let's<00:01:00.359> click<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.620> when<00:01:02.309> we<00:01:02.340> do

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
let's click on that and when we do

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.690 
let's click on that and when we do
you'll<00:01:03.570> see<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.260> have<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:05.010> whole<00:01:05.400> lot<00:01:05.670> of

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
you'll see that we have a whole lot of

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.910 
you'll see that we have a whole lot of
different<00:01:06.240> modifiers<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.900> we<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.409> add<00:01:07.650> to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
different modifiers that we can add to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.399 
different modifiers that we can add to
our<00:01:08.100> object<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.030> if<00:01:09.990> you've<00:01:10.140> installed

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
our object and if you've installed

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.920 
our object and if you've installed
plugins<00:01:11.070> into<00:01:11.670> blender<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.180> may<00:01:12.360> see<00:01:12.420> even

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
plugins into blender you may see even

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.649 
plugins into blender you may see even
more<00:01:13.110> than<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.670> but<00:01:14.670> right<00:01:14.820> now<00:01:15.000> we<00:01:15.420> just

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
more than this but right now we just

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.390 
more than this but right now we just
want<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.990> understand<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> concept<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
want to understand the concept of a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.730 
want to understand the concept of a
modifier<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:17.939> how<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.509> works<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.470> let's<00:01:19.619> just

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
modifier and how it works so let's just

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.520 
modifier and how it works so let's just
pick<00:01:20.070> one<00:01:20.100> simple<00:01:20.850> modifier<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.540> use<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.350> just

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
pick one simple modifier and use it just

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.469 
pick one simple modifier and use it just
to<00:01:22.619> understand<00:01:23.130> how<00:01:23.220> modifiers<00:01:23.909> apply<00:01:24.420> to

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
to understand how modifiers apply to

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.359 
to understand how modifiers apply to
objects<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.200> then<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.860> move<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
objects and then we can move on to the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.670 
objects and then we can move on to the
more<00:01:26.520> complex<00:01:26.970> ones<00:01:27.270> later<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.380> let's<00:01:28.560> go

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
more complex ones later so let's go

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.280 
more complex ones later so let's go
ahead<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.890> under<00:01:29.130> deform<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.150> find<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.110> one

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
ahead and under deform and find the one

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.890 
ahead and under deform and find the one
that<00:01:31.500> says<00:01:31.740> simple<00:01:32.430> deform<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.329> let's<00:01:33.780> just

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
that says simple deform and let's just

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.840 
that says simple deform and let's just
go<00:01:34.049> ahead<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.229> left<00:01:34.439> click<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.369> as

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
go ahead and left click on that and as

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.700 
go ahead and left click on that and as
soon<00:01:36.060> as<00:01:36.150> we<00:01:36.329> do<00:01:36.540> you'll<00:01:36.780> notice<00:01:37.110> how<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.290> Box

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
soon as we do you'll notice how the Box

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.069 
soon as we do you'll notice how the Box
kind<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.280> twists<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.970> little<00:01:39.210> bit<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.630> that's

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
kind of twists a little bit and that's

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.660 
kind of twists a little bit and that's
because<00:01:40.470> that's<00:01:40.740> what<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> modifier<00:01:41.549> is

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
because that's what the modifier is

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.730 
because that's what the modifier is
doing<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.150> fact<00:01:42.299> if<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.600> can<00:01:42.689> see<00:01:42.899> here<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
doing in fact if you can see here the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.580 
doing in fact if you can see here the
simple<00:01:43.979> deform<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.970> twist<00:01:45.570> mode<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.320> we

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
simple deform is in twist mode and we

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.130 
simple deform is in twist mode and we
can<00:01:46.740> see<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.210> but<00:01:48.210> before<00:01:48.509> we<00:01:48.630> get<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.990> this

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
can see that but before we get to this

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.929 
can see that but before we get to this
part<00:01:49.470> let's<00:01:49.649> go<00:01:49.799> through<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.759> actual

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
part let's go through the actual

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.420 
part let's go through the actual
modifier<00:01:51.659> panel<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.259> see<00:01:52.530> what<00:01:53.040> sort<00:01:53.369> of

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
modifier panel and see what sort of

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.789 
modifier panel and see what sort of
options<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:54.000> have<00:01:54.240> now<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.229> first<00:01:55.560> option

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
options we have now the first option

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.280 
options we have now the first option
here<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.340> basically<00:01:56.759> just<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.240> name<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
here is basically just the name of the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.609 
here is basically just the name of the
modifier<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.070> then<00:02:00.060> here<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:01.320> have<00:02:01.350> this

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
modifier and then here we have this

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.649 
modifier and then here we have this
little<00:02:01.770> camera<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.700> basically<00:02:03.180> turns

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
little camera and that basically turns

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.080 
little camera and that basically turns
it<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.170> off<00:02:04.560> in<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.250> renderer<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:05.909> if<00:02:06.000> you

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
it on and off in the renderer so if you

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.809 
it on and off in the renderer so if you
don't<00:02:06.420> want<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.110> render<00:02:07.500> turn<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.340> off

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
don't want this to render turn that off

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.540 
don't want this to render turn that off
typically<00:02:09.330> we<00:02:09.450> keep<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.840> on<00:02:09.959> now<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> second

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
typically we keep it on now the second

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.580 
typically we keep it on now the second
one<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.790> little<00:02:12.030> eyeball<00:02:12.239> here

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
one the little eyeball here

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.759 
one the little eyeball here
that<00:02:13.769> turns<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.640> on<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.849> off<00:02:15.330> in<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.170> viewport

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
that turns it on and off in the viewport

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.920 
that turns it on and off in the viewport
so<00:02:17.310> if<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.700> want<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.000> kind<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.239> toggle<00:02:18.569> it<00:02:18.780> on

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
so if you want to kind of toggle it on

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.420 
so if you want to kind of toggle it on
and<00:02:18.989> off<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.410> see<00:02:19.440> what<00:02:19.620> effect<00:02:20.160> it's<00:02:20.370> having

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
and off to see what effect it's having

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.059 
and off to see what effect it's having
this<00:02:21.180> could<00:02:21.360> be<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.480> very<00:02:21.690> handy<00:02:22.140> button<00:02:22.379> this

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
this could be a very handy button this

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.770 
this could be a very handy button this
third<00:02:23.310> button<00:02:23.550> just<00:02:23.790> shows<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.300> modifier

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
third button just shows the modifier

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.410 
third button just shows the modifier
when<00:02:25.230> you're<00:02:25.440> in<00:02:25.620> mesh<00:02:26.010> edit<00:02:26.519> mode<00:02:26.730> right<00:02:27.360> now

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
when you're in mesh edit mode right now

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.390 
when you're in mesh edit mode right now
we're<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:27.900> object<00:02:28.440> mode<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:28.920> if<00:02:29.040> we<00:02:29.160> were<00:02:29.280> to

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
we're in object mode but if we were to

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.759 
we're in object mode but if we were to
hit<00:02:29.550> tab<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.420> can<00:02:30.569> see<00:02:30.780> how<00:02:31.019> we<00:02:31.290> can<00:02:31.440> actually

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
hit tab you can see how we can actually

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.330 
hit tab you can see how we can actually
get<00:02:32.040> into<00:02:32.370> mesh<00:02:33.120> edit<00:02:33.599> mode<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.049> now<00:02:34.920> this

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
get into mesh edit mode and now this

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.300 
get into mesh edit mode and now this
mesh<00:02:35.580> edit<00:02:35.940> mode<00:02:36.090> here<00:02:36.390> we're<00:02:36.599> seeing<00:02:36.810> the

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
mesh edit mode here we're seeing the

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.710 
mesh edit mode here we're seeing the
solid<00:02:38.310> version<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:38.940> actually<00:02:39.450> what<00:02:39.690> happens

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
solid version is actually what happens

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.080 
solid version is actually what happens
with<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.440> twist<00:02:40.739> but<00:02:41.010> we're<00:02:41.190> also<00:02:41.400> seeing<00:02:41.879> the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
with the twist but we're also seeing the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.440 
with the twist but we're also seeing the
cage<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.410> mesh<00:02:43.709> as<00:02:44.040> well<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:45.060> we<00:02:45.180> kind<00:02:45.420> of

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
cage of the mesh as well so we kind of

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.750 
cage of the mesh as well so we kind of
seen<00:02:45.690> two<00:02:45.930> objects<00:02:46.440> if<00:02:46.560> we<00:02:46.980> want<00:02:47.190> those<00:02:47.370> two<00:02:47.640> to

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
seen two objects if we want those two to

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.160 
seen two objects if we want those two to
sync<00:02:48.000> up<00:02:48.150> we're<00:02:48.329> gonna<00:02:48.510> hit<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:48.870> little

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
sync up we're gonna hit this little

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.130 
sync up we're gonna hit this little
triangle<00:02:49.620> box<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.610> that<00:02:51.299> will<00:02:51.480> go<00:02:51.630> ahead<00:02:51.660> and

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
triangle box and that will go ahead and

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.500 
triangle box and that will go ahead and
sync<00:02:52.500> them<00:02:52.560> up<00:02:52.860> now<00:02:53.579> I<00:02:53.610> really<00:02:54.120> want<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.329> stay

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
sync them up now I really want to stay

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.030 
sync them up now I really want to stay
in<00:02:54.540> object<00:02:55.200> mode<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:55.500> I'm<00:02:55.590> gonna<00:02:55.680> go<00:02:55.860> ahead<00:02:55.890> and

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
in object mode so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.300 
in object mode so I'm gonna go ahead and
hit<00:02:56.190> tab<00:02:56.579> and<00:02:57.000> go<00:02:57.299> back<00:02:57.569> into<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:58.019> now<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.069> the

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
hit tab and go back into that now to the

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.280 
hit tab and go back into that now to the
right<00:02:59.790> of<00:02:59.940> this<00:03:00.060> we<00:03:00.269> also<00:03:00.420> have<00:03:00.750> tabs<00:03:01.170> that

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
right of this we also have tabs that

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.350 
right of this we also have tabs that
move<00:03:01.560> up<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:01.980> down<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.430> what<00:03:02.879> those<00:03:03.030> do<00:03:03.329> is

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
move up and down and what those do is

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.990 
move up and down and what those do is
basically<00:03:03.840> just<00:03:03.959> rearrange<00:03:04.920> modifiers<00:03:05.730> in

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
basically just rearrange modifiers in

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.910 
basically just rearrange modifiers in
the<00:03:06.090> stack<00:03:06.390> right<00:03:07.110> now<00:03:07.290> we<00:03:07.349> only<00:03:07.620> have<00:03:07.769> one

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
the stack right now we only have one

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.920 
the stack right now we only have one
modifier<00:03:08.730> applied<00:03:08.819> but<00:03:09.269> we<00:03:09.420> actually<00:03:09.780> can

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
modifier applied but we actually can

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.229 
modifier applied but we actually can
apply<00:03:10.110> as<00:03:10.290> many<00:03:10.440> as<00:03:10.680> we<00:03:10.890> want<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.430> rearrange

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
apply as many as we want and rearrange

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.809 
apply as many as we want and rearrange
them<00:03:12.450> if<00:03:12.599> we<00:03:12.750> need<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.280> now<00:03:14.280> along<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.640> bottom

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
them if we need to now along the bottom

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.430 
them if we need to now along the bottom
here<00:03:15.000> we<00:03:15.180> have<00:03:15.299> a<00:03:15.450> couple<00:03:15.660> of<00:03:15.780> options<00:03:16.019> and<00:03:16.379> the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
here we have a couple of options and the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.370 
here we have a couple of options and the
most<00:03:16.890> important<00:03:17.310> one<00:03:17.459> here<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.910> apply<00:03:18.540> now

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
most important one here is apply now

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.440 
most important one here is apply now
what<00:03:19.590> apply<00:03:20.069> does<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.609> basically<00:03:21.060> apply

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
what apply does is basically apply

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.660 
what apply does is basically apply
whatever<00:03:21.810> we've<00:03:22.680> created<00:03:23.069> with<00:03:23.430> this

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
whatever we've created with this

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.940 
whatever we've created with this
modifier<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.510> just<00:03:24.930> apply<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.530> mesh<00:03:25.709> and

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
modifier and just apply to the mesh and

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.610 
modifier and just apply to the mesh and
get<00:03:26.190> rid<00:03:26.489> of<00:03:26.609> the<00:03:26.700> modifier<00:03:27.239> so<00:03:27.959> if<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.350> were<00:03:28.500> to

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
get rid of the modifier so if I were to

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.280 
get rid of the modifier so if I were to
hit<00:03:28.889> this<00:03:29.480> basically<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.630> modifier<00:03:31.049> goes

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
hit this basically the modifier goes

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.949 
hit this basically the modifier goes
away<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:32.280> my<00:03:32.519> options<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.209> change<00:03:33.450> anything

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
away and my options to change anything

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.009 
away and my options to change anything
goes<00:03:34.139> away<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:35.099> kind<00:03:35.280> of<00:03:35.340> freezes<00:03:36.000> my<00:03:36.690> mesh

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
goes away and it kind of freezes my mesh

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.620 
goes away and it kind of freezes my mesh
at<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.650> point<00:03:38.040> but<00:03:38.819> actually<00:03:39.180> I<00:03:39.209> want<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.540> get

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
at that point but actually I want to get

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.449 
at that point but actually I want to get
this<00:03:39.840> back<00:03:40.079> so<00:03:40.290> I'm<00:03:40.380> gonna<00:03:40.500> hit<00:03:40.650> control<00:03:41.040> Z<00:03:41.069> to

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
this back so I'm gonna hit control Z to

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.390 
this back so I'm gonna hit control Z to
bring<00:03:42.299> back<00:03:42.569> my<00:03:42.840> modifier<00:03:43.349> and<00:03:43.530> hit<00:03:43.799> an<00:03:43.919> undo

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
bring back my modifier and hit an undo

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.780 
bring back my modifier and hit an undo
and<00:03:44.790> now<00:03:45.510> let's<00:03:45.720> go<00:03:45.870> through<00:03:46.139> the<00:03:46.410> actual

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
and now let's go through the actual

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.220 
and now let's go through the actual
modifier<00:03:47.790> itself<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:48.450> this<00:03:48.540> is<00:03:48.690> again<00:03:48.959> is<00:03:49.200> a

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
modifier itself and this is again is a

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.099 
modifier itself and this is again is a
simple<00:03:49.829> deform<00:03:50.639> so<00:03:51.540> right<00:03:51.750> now<00:03:51.900> we're<00:03:52.079> in

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
simple deform so right now we're in

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.349 
simple deform so right now we're in
twist<00:03:52.919> mode<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.609> if<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.790> notice<00:03:54.090> we<00:03:54.209> have<00:03:54.329> a

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
twist mode and if you notice we have a

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.759 
twist mode and if you notice we have a
bunch<00:03:54.660> of<00:03:54.840> different<00:03:55.230> modes<00:03:55.410> we'll<00:03:55.650> go

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
bunch of different modes we'll go

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.190 
bunch of different modes we'll go
through<00:03:56.010> these<00:03:56.130> in<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.400> second<00:03:56.880> but<00:03:57.840> we<00:03:58.019> also

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
through these in a second but we also

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.750 
through these in a second but we also
have<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.590> couple<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:59.040> options<00:03:59.250> here

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
have a couple of options here

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.120 
have a couple of options here
this<00:04:00.030> particular<00:04:00.569> modifier<00:04:01.019> has<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.560> deform

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
this particular modifier has a deform

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.610 
this particular modifier has a deform
factor<00:04:02.639> which<00:04:03.150> is<00:04:03.359> how<00:04:03.599> much<00:04:03.840> are<00:04:04.019> we<00:04:04.079> twisting

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
factor which is how much are we twisting

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.370 
factor which is how much are we twisting
this<00:04:04.799> object<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:05.639> we<00:04:06.329> also<00:04:06.480> have<00:04:06.780> limits<00:04:07.200> is

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
this object and we also have limits is

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.740 
this object and we also have limits is
where<00:04:07.650> does<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:07.919> twist<00:04:08.250> start<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:09.060> where

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
where does the twist start and where

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.409 
where does the twist start and where
does<00:04:09.900> it<00:04:10.109> end<00:04:10.230> now<00:04:10.769> we<00:04:11.639> can<00:04:11.849> also<00:04:12.060> add

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
does it end now we can also add

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.360 
does it end now we can also add
additional<00:04:12.720> ones<00:04:13.260> we<00:04:13.530> can<00:04:13.739> turn<00:04:13.919> this<00:04:14.040> into<00:04:14.099> a

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
additional ones we can turn this into a

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.150 
additional ones we can turn this into a
bend<00:04:14.760> so<00:04:15.750> we<00:04:15.840> can<00:04:15.989> actually<00:04:16.139> bend<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.739> object

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
bend so we can actually bend the object

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.190 
bend so we can actually bend the object
as<00:04:17.280> much<00:04:17.489> as<00:04:17.669> we<00:04:17.789> want<00:04:18.060> we<00:04:18.329> can<00:04:18.510> taper<00:04:18.900> the

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
as much as we want we can taper the

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.949 
as much as we want we can taper the
object<00:04:19.769> we<00:04:20.519> can<00:04:20.609> also<00:04:20.789> do<00:04:21.030> squash<00:04:21.419> and<00:04:21.719> stretch

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
object we can also do squash and stretch

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.990 
object we can also do squash and stretch
so<00:04:22.380> if<00:04:22.469> I<00:04:22.530> wanted<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.830> stretch<00:04:23.190> this<00:04:23.370> object<00:04:23.880> I

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
so if I wanted to stretch this object I

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.080 
so if I wanted to stretch this object I
could<00:04:24.349> so<00:04:25.349> each<00:04:25.530> one<00:04:25.800> of<00:04:25.860> these<00:04:26.099> is<00:04:26.400> in<00:04:26.610> this

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
could so each one of these is in this

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.330 
could so each one of these is in this
simple<00:04:27.389> deform<00:04:27.810> modifier<00:04:27.990> now<00:04:28.949> let's<00:04:29.160> say<00:04:29.310> I

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
simple deform modifier now let's say I

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.670 
simple deform modifier now let's say I
wanted<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:29.669> add<00:04:29.790> a<00:04:30.150> stretch<00:04:30.540> and<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:31.320> twist

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
wanted to add a stretch and the twist

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.740 
wanted to add a stretch and the twist
well<00:04:32.250> that's<00:04:32.460> actually<00:04:32.639> pretty<00:04:33.030> easy<00:04:33.090> all<00:04:33.389> we

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
well that's actually pretty easy all we

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.860 
well that's actually pretty easy all we
have<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:34.080> do<00:04:34.199> is<00:04:34.350> add<00:04:34.650> a<00:04:34.889> second<00:04:35.490> modifier<00:04:36.060> so

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
have to do is add a second modifier so

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.689 
have to do is add a second modifier so
again<00:04:37.110> we<00:04:37.229> just<00:04:37.380> go<00:04:37.560> up<00:04:37.590> to<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.190> add<00:04:38.340> modifier

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
again we just go up to the add modifier

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.980 
again we just go up to the add modifier
pulldown<00:04:39.540> and<00:04:39.979> again<00:04:40.979> select<00:04:41.910> simple<00:04:42.330> deform

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
pulldown and again select simple deform

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.020 
pulldown and again select simple deform
and<00:04:43.639> now<00:04:44.639> we<00:04:45.510> have<00:04:45.780> stretch<00:04:46.470> and<00:04:46.860> if<00:04:47.520> we<00:04:47.669> scroll

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
and now we have stretch and if we scroll

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.750 
and now we have stretch and if we scroll
down<00:04:48.090> we<00:04:48.900> also<00:04:49.139> have<00:04:49.530> that<00:04:49.740> second<00:04:50.370> one<00:04:50.550> which

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
down we also have that second one which

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.540 
down we also have that second one which
is<00:04:50.790> called<00:04:51.180> twist<00:04:51.540> and<00:04:51.960> if<00:04:52.830> I<00:04:52.979> want<00:04:53.250> I<00:04:53.430> can

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
is called twist and if I want I can

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.730 
is called twist and if I want I can
expand<00:04:54.270> or<00:04:54.479> collapse<00:04:54.630> ease<00:04:55.080> just<00:04:55.320> by<00:04:55.500> hitting

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
expand or collapse ease just by hitting

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.140 
expand or collapse ease just by hitting
this<00:04:56.010> button<00:04:56.070> here<00:04:56.490> so<00:04:56.639> I'm<00:04:56.699> gonna<00:04:56.790> collapse

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
this button here so I'm gonna collapse

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.210 
this button here so I'm gonna collapse
that<00:04:57.419> first<00:04:57.690> modifier<00:04:58.199> now<00:04:58.860> let's<00:04:59.040> take<00:04:59.190> a

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
that first modifier now let's take a

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.550 
that first modifier now let's take a
look<00:04:59.430> at<00:04:59.520> this<00:04:59.610> twist<00:05:00.000> modifier<00:05:00.210> and<00:05:00.810> let's<00:05:01.410> go

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
look at this twist modifier and let's go

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.830 
look at this twist modifier and let's go
ahead<00:05:01.650> and<00:05:02.010> twist<00:05:02.430> so<00:05:03.120> now<00:05:03.330> what<00:05:03.630> we're<00:05:03.810> doing

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
ahead and twist so now what we're doing

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.530 
ahead and twist so now what we're doing
is<00:05:04.320> we're<00:05:04.800> actually<00:05:04.950> using<00:05:05.370> two<00:05:05.940> modifiers

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
is we're actually using two modifiers

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.230 
is we're actually using two modifiers
we're<00:05:07.229> stretching<00:05:07.740> it<00:05:08.010> in<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:08.520> first<00:05:08.790> one<00:05:09.060> and

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
we're stretching it in the first one and

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.409 
we're stretching it in the first one and
the<00:05:09.750> second<00:05:10.229> one<00:05:10.260> is<00:05:10.650> twisting<00:05:11.520> it<00:05:11.669> so<00:05:12.180> now<00:05:12.360> we

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
the second one is twisting it so now we

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.680 
the second one is twisting it so now we
have<00:05:12.870> basically<00:05:13.650> two<00:05:14.190> modifiers<00:05:14.729> affecting

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
have basically two modifiers affecting

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.659 
have basically two modifiers affecting
this<00:05:16.200> object<00:05:16.470> and<00:05:16.830> so<00:05:17.040> if<00:05:17.100> I<00:05:17.190> wanted<00:05:17.490> to<00:05:17.639> I

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
this object and so if I wanted to I

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.550 
this object and so if I wanted to I
could<00:05:18.000> still<00:05:18.270> go<00:05:18.389> back<00:05:18.570> up<00:05:18.780> to<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.080> first<00:05:19.350> one

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
could still go back up to the first one

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.279 
could still go back up to the first one
which<00:05:19.680> is<00:05:19.740> the<00:05:20.070> stretch<00:05:20.430> and<00:05:20.900> stretch<00:05:21.900> it<00:05:22.080> some

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
which is the stretch and stretch it some

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.370 
which is the stretch and stretch it some
more<00:05:22.620> add<00:05:23.160> some<00:05:23.430> limits<00:05:23.789> to<00:05:24.210> it<00:05:24.419> really<00:05:25.080> do

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
more add some limits to it really do

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.920 
more add some limits to it really do
whatever<00:05:25.620> I<00:05:25.889> want<00:05:26.310> and<00:05:26.720> everything<00:05:27.720> will

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
whatever I want and everything will

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.100 
whatever I want and everything will
interact<00:05:28.320> just<00:05:29.100> fine<00:05:29.490> now<00:05:30.360> if<00:05:30.539> I<00:05:30.660> want<00:05:30.900> I<00:05:31.050> can

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
interact just fine now if I want I can

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.920 
interact just fine now if I want I can
also<00:05:31.380> switch<00:05:31.680> these<00:05:32.280> around<00:05:32.450> by<00:05:33.450> reorganizing

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
also switch these around by reorganizing

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.320 
also switch these around by reorganizing
them<00:05:34.560> so<00:05:34.770> if<00:05:34.889> I<00:05:35.010> wanted<00:05:35.310> to<00:05:35.370> put<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.760> twist<00:05:36.090> on

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
them so if I wanted to put the twist on

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.440 
them so if I wanted to put the twist on
top<00:05:36.840> of<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.770> stretch<00:05:38.220> I<00:05:38.460> could<00:05:38.700> do<00:05:38.940> that<00:05:39.210> and

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
top of the stretch I could do that and

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.440 
top of the stretch I could do that and
now<00:05:40.110> if<00:05:40.500> I<00:05:40.650> look<00:05:40.680> here<00:05:41.070> my<00:05:41.280> twist<00:05:41.700> comes<00:05:42.060> first

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
now if I look here my twist comes first

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.279 
now if I look here my twist comes first
and<00:05:42.720> then<00:05:43.560> we<00:05:44.010> stretch<00:05:44.630> so<00:05:45.630> those<00:05:45.870> are<00:05:46.020> some<00:05:46.200> of

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
and then we stretch so those are some of

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:48.710 
and then we stretch so those are some of
the<00:05:46.349> basics<00:05:46.800> of<00:05:46.950> modifiers<00:05:47.760> and<00:05:48.090> if<00:05:48.599> you

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
the basics of modifiers and if you

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.290 
the basics of modifiers and if you
understand<00:05:49.229> this<00:05:49.440> workflow<00:05:50.190> and<00:05:50.550> as<00:05:51.030> we<00:05:51.270> use

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
understand this workflow and as we use

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.960 
understand this workflow and as we use
more<00:05:51.570> complex<00:05:52.440> modifiers<00:05:53.039> you'll<00:05:53.370> also<00:05:53.610> be

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
more complex modifiers you'll also be

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.229 
more complex modifiers you'll also be
able<00:05:54.090> to<00:05:54.300> understand<00:05:54.870> them
