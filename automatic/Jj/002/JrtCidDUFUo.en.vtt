00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.170
 my name is jeroen belzer from it 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.100
 pelserhartman company we bring building 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.260
 in the map 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.300
 we draw methane and teach people how 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.650
 you can do it yourself 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.540
 we spend the hell for our time on 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.680
 innovation in the field of 3d 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.570
 laser scanning and 3d modeling from me 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.200
 are it about what a 3D scan is now 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.720
 actually what 3d scanning content is 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.029
 Well even so know the gauge 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.279
 his opinion sledok measures through something 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.419
 it does not explain the conversion of elements 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.699
 stuck 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.710
 reality is accurately recorded 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:39.170
 in a big cloud of points call that 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.550
 a point cloud 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.160
 so we do not come ready-made 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.989
 roll out a three-dimensional model 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.589
 such a point cloud cannot be converted either 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.710
 in one go to dwg dxf or for example 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.809
 an extra set of women so often very large 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.739
 woman of maybe wants to use 303 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:00.350
 large and consists of billions of measuring points 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.489
 well what can you do or be a shit 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.569
 underneath for making 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.920
 drawings 

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:08.119
 I have a second drawing again 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.820
 make 3d drawings complex 3d models 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.049
 for 3d printing or bim models 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.549
 and it is suitable for checking 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.549
 of drawings and models 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.119
 you can also see the good visualisations 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.860
 make simulations more and shape control 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.219
 participate like three-dimensional 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.409
 deformation analyzes then compares 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:30.710
 can see different scans with each other 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.479
 whether an object has changed shape 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.700
 you make class the tensions you can whole 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.579
 create good views in which you yourself are very 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.619
 can measure well and a scanner can scan 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.500
 The data is also suitable for ortho photos 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.460
 for example for archeology 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.200
 building history for capturing 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.549
 facades you immediately have one 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.000
 a base for making a 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.340
 faÃ§ade restoration plan, for example 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.990
 nice cloud can still be more sign 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.210
 programs for example a striking one 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.030
 autocad and recap 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.270
 but soon also in the archipelago sketchup 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.880
 pro via a rhinos 3d plugin 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.530
 inventors to the word the products of 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.350
 ben three products from th 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.440
 from corpses to such a cyclone and cloudbox 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.420
 adwords in the mark plant and 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.209
 for example the packages from veva 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.040
 like pdms 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.720
 well how much scanning workflow 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.120
 how does it work now 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.040
 first we make a scam plan of course 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.930
 you first have to think carefully about why 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.800
 I will know what you scan and what 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.140
 I will do it and where will I stand 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.270
 then we will make a scan afterwards 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.370
 We have a registered point cloud with 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.350
 special software we link all 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.590
 different scan recordings together 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.209
 that provides a registered point cloud 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.610
 then your point will be able to color lead 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.110
 at least if you have a round of photos 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.810
 made with the scan from the same 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.810
 position as from which you have measured 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.870
 then you make a product that can be 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.670
 a pointcloud colored pointcloud a 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.640
 video tomorrow morning photo 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.900
 you name it there are several 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.989
 types of scanners so that is even 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.459
 attention scanning is already a container 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.019
 become understanding 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.310
 there are many different scanners for this 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.100
 different projects for 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.350
 different goals are scanners that 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.780
 can scan 5 meters on micron 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.920
 and so and scanners that can at 6 km 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.489
 scan remotely but they won't 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.750
 achieve such a high maceration 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.360
 in addition, his home garden and kitchen 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.360
 scanners and the real high-end stuff 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.280
 a short could bend you 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.299
 scanners be divided into three groups of us 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.070
 knowledge vs knowledge and white light scanners 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.870
 Different brands are known as 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.900
 faro topcom 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.350
 cover campbell regal and of course so 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.060
 knowledge of leica and znf 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.620
 which scan do you choose that is 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.019
 depending on a number of factors i 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.519
 there will be a few call the product such that 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.590
 are you going to make 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.269
 the size accurate cnn you are people you 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.130
 want to have 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.200
 the properties of the object some 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.030
 objects have a complex neat 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.020
 for example all this knowledge 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.670
 measure the dark surface well 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.890
 depending on the circumstances 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.750
 then you are inside you stand outside cree stable 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.010
 allow one to scan one 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.840
 compensator 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.850
 that compensates for movements on the other 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.370
 not distances 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.080
 so what distance did something want the 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.550
 requirements of the plant in the industry 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.480
 for example I come with some scammers 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.220
 not at all inside 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.710
 and sometimes it is mandatory to use it and 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.330
 scanner but also whole 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.800
 practical things are often important 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.570
 when choosing a scan 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.840
 for example , the scanner can be in the 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.840
 hand luggage 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.450
 briefly the benefits of the scanners 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.190
 and destination that too fast a lot 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.630
 actually takes the entire object 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.870
 home 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.610
 the market the complete and error-free recording 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.550
 it is a complete basis for 2d 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.510
 drawings 3d drawings for checking 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.670
 drawing work 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.930
 you can still easily in products 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.540
 to make 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.600
 it gives a grip on complex forms it is 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.610
 a documentation and on a zero measurement 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.890
 you can phase your work and therefore your costs 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.510
 to spread 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.630
 now as a closing as said 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.900
 we scan and modulate ourselves 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.390
 In addition, we teach other people how to use them 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.890
 being able to do it ourselves we are happy to do it 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.040
 have always been interested in 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:26.170
 interesting collaborations so far 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.300
