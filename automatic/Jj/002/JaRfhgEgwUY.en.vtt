00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
don't want to jump in yet I think that

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.770

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
time raising money in advance I think

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.749 
time raising money in advance I think
it's<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.630> also<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.619> people<00:01:59.040> are<00:01:59.189> just<00:01:59.399> sick
