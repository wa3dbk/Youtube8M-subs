 square inches the size of the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.020
 head and it's the racket that replaces 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.750
 the black and white wing what we did is 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.430
 that we combine black and white and 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.379

 of strings of 16 x 19 and weighs 300 grams 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.040
 It is ideal for playing 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.040
 who play in baseball and players 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.200
 aggressive people who like to hit pretty 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.020
 the ball and they do not go much to the ned 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.579
 For players type players 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.049

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:17.789

 the whole racket that helps the 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.250
 ropes move more liberally and 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.860
 they create a much larger switch pad 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.909
 the next online racket is the water

 18 what does this increase the 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:06.179
 ease of hitting the ball is 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.160
 quite generates quite more spin and 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.630
