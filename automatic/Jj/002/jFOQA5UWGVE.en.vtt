 i am fixing an ipad 3 but here works 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.740
 fervently we have Professor Stefano who 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.349
 the student is your name 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.260
 remember they must assis maximum here it is 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.020
 our one who is learning is 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.000
 started the course today and we are 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.310
 cariparo cell you are telling 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.189
 than an iphone 3g s 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.869
 if I don't want to put it specific 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.760
 be that I'm quite different 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.790
 which happens the hands of the series to the right 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.640
 no even if they look red with my no 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.590
 no no to the duration of a bit is not because 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.960
 the first lesson I do n't know who bet 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.940
 almost all thanks to stefano's help 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.890
 love now born precision there is the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.559
 professor then we see the results and then 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.300
 you have to mount the backpack mica lo 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.160
 leave disassembled without education 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.989
 that works is a business died 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.399
 worked how it worked hopefully 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.559
 no we were the results then 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.660
 arrived with two masters like you was 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.710
 surely you feel at ease yes yes yes 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.589
 ok 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.799
 go ahead thanks go ahead 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.290
 let's lose some secrets let's go like 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.770
 my secrets are the chapters are top 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.830
 secret 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.810
 then Austrian flies to remove this 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.240
 it is a pie phrase clash with lightings 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.060
 so there are two very small screws 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.890
 left right from those and slowly 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.689
 see that you are followed throughout the month 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.030
 individually our students 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.900
 no it is always a cross always sorry or 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.970
 senator no no all cross-shaped after 7 of 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.340
 today you are more comfortable if you want and if not 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.150
 show the no but I see it as of 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.960
 I follow 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.420
 here is one that can call by mounting the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.430
 power button maybe you are finished 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.180
 casinos that can put see by 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.970
 part 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.860
 no emotion and don't worry you do 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.800
 I realize that I'm framing you 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.410
 no I was joking that you are at home 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.630
 if two masters of my andria greenhouse a 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.300
 your house you are much quieter embè a 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.450
 This is definitely my home now 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.240
 is running a video without ipad mini 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.780
 who is next to you, however, has remained the 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.690
 close 7 open in seven precision 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.120
 here they are a scalpel to you mister and with 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.040
 the package honor and time to repair 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.330
 I repeat I'm getting tired of the connector I can 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.730
 ok 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.490
 I wanted to learn some material secrets 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.390
 I'm fine to leave them ready from 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.130
 finish in series to continue as well 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.310
 while I'm soldering this connector 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:35.300
 of the ipad 3 we go to see the school 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.790
 how the assembled and reassembled sea proceeds 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.450
 still not how it goes well 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.520
 the teacher to the patients here it is 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.959
 night we succeed in reassembling markets 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:52.260
 really hard hopefully boy one 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:55.530
 difficult this professor singing this 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.380
 go this connector we are doing 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.000
 is we are giving so much resistance to give 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.190
 this little one resists you're welding 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.380
 here expenses of resistance as nicholas 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.360
 raise a bad end we have how much 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.049
 I don't know how much from half to half mini 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.580
 however, table v2 came back but met 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.950
 v2 because we see each other pay ourselves 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.840
 immediately that in fact it is hot from those 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:21.000
 parts and that is from where he left where I am 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.130
 working we see if weak and a 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.070
 connector is touchscreen for Mr. 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.830
 lorenzo we are putting back because the 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.110
 the first part had not gone very well 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.360
 ok let's hope that now god send us 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.030
 good with green eyes blond blue 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.049
 in short, as of our side towards the 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.880
 end yes we are reassembling what it is 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.390
 reassembled where that was another thing 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.970
 all 3 freezes already almost everything but 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.920
 then we are missing only becoming 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.170
 professionals in one day because 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.380
 missing that accurate maurizi of the slide e 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:59.120
 of the display so that the customer does not 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.120
 will then have annoying gifts 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.720
 hypothetical customer will never see 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.850
 nothing to say because he says so 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.310
 clean in mind the game is up 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.350
 because its place months however is 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.270
 used is master Giuseppe the master 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.700
 you can evaluate my cleaning work 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.370
 before that concerns the mom as 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.420
 glass cleaner services at traffic lights 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.100
 it starts we start alone at 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.650
 electron microscope for de stefano 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.170
 taché here takes an apprentice things 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.850
 they did longer and more boring things 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.060
 for now what I as you do not 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.010
 remember the half hour test but there is 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.620
 always what seems perfect to me now 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.000
 now put hill under the 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.700
 giuseppe no supervision 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.520
 and to do that I saw from here but the displays 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.260
 display seriously then display it 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.950
 we reassemble and if it works see if it is 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.180
 been good 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:54.940
 if it doesn't work it was bad liga 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:59.370
 we blame the long or he knows he is 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:03.130
 learning then here it is like turin 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.050
 I admit that I am always recording it 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.850
 nothing escapes us 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.400
 here's why you should take it slow 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.680
 we would like lcd and I recommend that I have 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.110
 heard that the scarpino was done 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.870
 only now we know all the holes 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:22.840
 strongly we must put 34 ends by 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:26.350
 a part two vines from here 3pt from one 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.780
 part ii v here and a little girl that ok 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.580
 blocks this phenomenon 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.800
 after which if you go you come to see the 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.740
 end let's see if to think of today 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.169
 is promoted to ok then maximum but 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.030
 we rested or looked at them but in 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.070
 charge for now if charges had died the 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.650
 his thesis that he knew how to miss as well as 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.310
 he then beats it first words higher 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.979
 exceeded with 10 how much to give six e 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.590
 half because anyway it is but compared to 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:57.010
 all of us 66 and half were 10 10 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:59.050
 repeating myself we see ok in good condition lap 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.390
 to show us if I haven't put it yet 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.300
 the last two vines but only for scruple 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:07.419
 caramagnesi goes well on passed test 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:10.270
 before the first day we disassembled 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.919
 is completely black assembles you a 3gs 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.870
 there will clearly be a nice cleaning of 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.140
 new because we filled in now me 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.840
 I like to call for cleaning 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:25.720
 thank you maximum master and good evening 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:27.700
 this track and bay giandolfi meanwhile 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.400
 I welded the card over there too 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.960
 mine is charging my ipad 3 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.210
 thanks to all as they say in the end 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.919
 thanks to all with assist record yes 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:40.229
 they must make the maximum 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:40.229
 hello hello everyone to all
