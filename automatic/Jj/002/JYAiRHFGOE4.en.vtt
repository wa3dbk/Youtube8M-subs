00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.009
 They announce bonprix at www dirk org we want to see where we are with today 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.759
 the topic of rarer fans of the range is also enough 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:10.590
 and the rest were after 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.799
 had permission to visit 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:13.789
 Cross Road 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:17.259
 Price after recent brightly colored 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.009
 Valerie Schmalhorst 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:21.439
 Schnarr ORF 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:22.470
 us 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.679
 Nikes Ko 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.899
 However, Rauschen's was successful in scrounging quite active 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.769
 and Susan that we like to go back to Klitschko for so much 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.769
 Playing Bundesliga would give for us how many is 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.560
 that was after a year on the football stage road scared of it 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.100
 Failure does not have to reach for fear as Rainer can not cope with 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.940
 Schütterle dear woman likes 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.940
 has been 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.340
 casually held with his foot and off 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.410
 Met Jacob 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.410
 however, in third place was one to zero 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.860
 great preparation by Rainer Schüttler 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.990
 and for 17 months he was without scoring one could hardly believe it 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.880
 given this beautiful header hit Cen 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.490
 many thought the KSC would have failed only today 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.100
 but after the lead, that was at least temporarily off the table 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.040
 as it appears 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.740
 it tastes good 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.460
 together with Georg Schuster had risen high 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.940
 I suspect one alone would then have more entitled 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.120
 Werder sparing played in the Wildparkstadion 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.250
 and as little to see except in freshly washed jerseys 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.700
 thereby 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.420
 Thomas saw it yellow 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.420
 Bonn Schilling lead 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.510
 Belarus parasitize really good the first half the Flex 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.229
 second was the 33 minutes of play he why should it be different with them 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.190
 once practiced and then 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.020
 hit in the head 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.890
 Actually, the Badische Fußball-Pokal half of the day is simply not 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.550
 question 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.550
 what ACA Schroeder form 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.000
 Once again Valerie Vili Schmarotzer benefited from the fact that if 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:15.079
 hurt is still 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:18.699
 Shooting free kicks may also have her interest in him 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:22.659
 mutated sits namely is on the transfer list and that they believe something 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:27.280
 against Leipzig then there was nothing for us the only scene 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.469
 resulted 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.559
 from a Karlsruhe mistake that was as Oliver Kahn 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:35.829
 not exactly knew what should or should not but Gaal 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.899
 Finally, it does not bother to alleviate the consequences of the situation 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:42.479
 could 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:48.729
 the second half it is the only change to 30 for SID was RM 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:52.109
 thigh strain 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.899
 like the circle with 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:56.579
 just as sparkling and willing 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:57.979
 the before the change 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:00.979
 Nowotny 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:04.929
 as Rainer Schütterle 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:09.169
 Let's talk to Lubbock again 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:12.349
 Donald 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.920
 of course I would like to keep fit again proved what was in the shot 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.989
 from Valerie parasitic at best clock today she played far 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.110
 awkward out of your own defense 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.230
 Rarely was a barrel that was longer than 15 meters, which is why they are here 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.300
 Ball losses in midfield brought a meltdown 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.979
 if the goal difference would actually have been better at this point 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:38.059
 have to be 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:40.329
 drove this conversation way too fast 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.839
 in the direction of herself she stays in. Steiner then mistook him 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:47.119
 Gabriele and Hecking for Oberhof where and how it is 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:50.639
 that could not actually get worse and in fact something works 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:51.669
 Move 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.669
 then the change made a little more momentum forward 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:56.599
 we will send 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.049
 Finally there was room on the right side until then 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.049
 not seen ACCO Brands 11 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:05.829
 Heidel Steffen Heidrich 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:12.289
 and very own 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:14.909
 new score 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.409
 only two to one that was the first away goal of VfB Leipzig 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.409
 and you will see at the left edge of the picture 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:26.740
 Nowottny and Schuster would hinder each other a bit 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.259
 Steffen Heidrich 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:29.979
 one to two 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.610
 usually 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.470
 There is no need for the shots from six meters unhindered no special 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:36.360
 commendation 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.360
 but too seldom does Hamburg say Steffen Heidrich 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.689
 by Corinna Berghahn 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:45.770
 been on it 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.080
 the work obviously does not contain his day today 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.660
 No, but his best scene today was the Hessian youngster 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.660
 played so probably would have liked to know early 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.410
 Michel author of 2 4 replaced already brought Lars Schmitz for 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:06.819
 Furore Lehmann 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:09.729
 Finally, since the "King of Pop" also missed a lot to 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.939
 Example of this perfect by Thomas Schmid 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:14.910
 Rainer Schütterle everything was perfect everything worked out perfectly 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:15.960
 a little milder 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.419
 Edgar Schmitt 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:18.659
 only the degree 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:21.659
 Oberhausen 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.710
 only once Rainer Schütterle 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.060
 nice pass also Edgar Schmitt and the child had simply self-catering hut 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.059
 but we do not want to be angry 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:36.589
 Planner this season in uefa cup and also in the Bundesliga so great and 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:39.589
 scored important goals 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.009
 to have further details 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.029
 you have to do something for the tour the facts Rainer Schütterle 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:51.870
 and if nobody attacks you and you just yourself 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.930
 Price 1 that was about 7 o'clock at night, it is game minute in Karlsruhe 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.930
 wildpark-stadion 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.309
 she just has to "walk everything 

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:13.989
 but if you look at this slow motion again in peace, believe them 

00:06:13.989 --> 00:06:14.450
 me 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.170
 the European Championships were far from over, as Salzburg Tuesday slowly made an impact 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.119
 heavy legs 

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:21.779
 and then when I came again 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:24.150
 Metz Dakota until 11 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.180
 neither the connection hit 2 4 3 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.910
 He wanted to take part again, but back to Milan with a low loader 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.169
 to take 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:35.800
 So he was happy instead of in the apartment 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.909
 in Oliver Kahn's 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:40.279
 Meter room 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:41.879
 Flank Torsten crashes and then 

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:45.679
 the second three it was the 89 minute game I can give the top 

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:48.799
 it is at this score referee leader 

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:52.619
 Well, he ended the game 

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:54.120
 until 10 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.930
 graphically, losing the game itself is hard
