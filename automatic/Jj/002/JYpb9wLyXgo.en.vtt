00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:16.490
 and a can of condensed milk a can 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.860
 of evaporated pineapple milk in pieces 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.330
 It is not 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.869
 carrots I chose them great because 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.180
 It is easier to grate pse and optional 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.360
 you can add raisins but that's only if you 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.869
 you like in a bowl we are going to add the 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.869
 syrup 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.960
 of the pineapples 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.870
 condensed milk 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.420
 and evaporated milk 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.600
 and with the help of a balloon we're going to 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.600
 Mix 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.500
 once we mix the law of the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.980
 milks and the syrup we 're going to 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.809
 refrigerate 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.360
 and we will continue with the following 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.890
 steps well as a next step and maybe 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.030
 be the most complicated let's grate 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.030
 all our carrots 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.759
 well once we finish grating 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.210
 we are going to place them in a bowl 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.210
 big 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.380
 it's a little difficult to grate the 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.460
 but I think it 's the most 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.460
 complicated in this recipe 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:39.789
 now let's add the pineapple 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.789
 remaining and the nuts 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.579
 let's also bring the milk mixture 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.939
 is that we had refrigerated and we're going 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.939
 to add 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.850
 and let's mix 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.850
 all right 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.380
 once we mix it we're going to 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.620
 refrigerate for about an hour 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.690
 and will be ready to be enjoyed once 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.660
 that refrigera mos is ready to serve 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.210
 and well I 'll serve you this one 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.650
 but you can choose the way 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.780
 that you prefer to serve her and 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.090
 accompany her I hope you like this
