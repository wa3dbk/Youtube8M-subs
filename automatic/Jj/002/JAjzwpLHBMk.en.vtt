project<00:00:13.019> spark<00:00:13.590> tutorial<00:00:14.240> today's<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.509> video

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
project spark tutorial today's a video

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.810 
project spark tutorial today's a video
is<00:00:16.049> going<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.199> be<00:00:16.260> pretty<00:00:16.500> quick<00:00:16.740> as<00:00:17.070> we're

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
is going to be pretty quick as we're

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.490 
is going to be pretty quick as we're
dealing<00:00:18.090> with<00:00:18.119> wall<00:00:18.690> running<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.619> it's<00:00:20.279> not

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
dealing with wall running and it's not

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.640 
dealing with wall running and it's not
too<00:00:22.500> difficult<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:23.609> fake<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:25.199> be<00:00:25.320> honest

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
too difficult to fake it to be honest

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.189 
too difficult to fake it to be honest
and<00:00:25.859> that's<00:00:25.949> what<00:00:26.189> we're<00:00:26.310> going<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.490> be<00:00:26.519> doing

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
and that's what we're going to be doing

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.859 
and that's what we're going to be doing
you<00:00:28.199> can<00:00:28.470> go<00:00:28.769> into<00:00:28.920> like<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.429> same<00:00:30.210> detail<00:00:30.689> if

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
you can go into like in same detail if

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.299 
you can go into like in same detail if
you<00:00:30.990> want<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.289> like<00:00:31.410> actually<00:00:31.650> make<00:00:32.099> your

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
you want to like actually make your

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.580 
you want to like actually make your
character<00:00:32.520> be<00:00:32.850> able<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.210> actually<00:00:33.420> run<00:00:34.050> on<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
character be able to actually run on the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.799 
character be able to actually run on the
walls<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.130> make<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.910> look<00:00:36.120> right<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.630> you're

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
walls and make it look right so you're

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.920 
walls and make it look right so you're
using<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.320> third<00:00:37.530> person<00:00:37.950> camera<00:00:38.149> you<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.180> use

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
using a third person camera you can use

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.979 
using a third person camera you can use
things<00:00:40.590> like<00:00:40.770> changing<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> gravity<00:00:41.960> to<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
things like changing the gravity to the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.590 
things like changing the gravity to the
walls<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.680> your<00:00:43.920> character<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.600> being

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
walls that your character is being

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.690 
walls that your character is being
pushed<00:00:45.930> towards<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.190> like<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
pushed towards it and that like the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.220 
pushed towards it and that like the
character<00:00:48.030> actually<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.510> can<00:00:48.719> run<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
character actually you can run on the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.450 
character actually you can run on the
wall<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:49.739> far<00:00:50.550> as<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:51.059> making<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.570> look<00:00:51.809> like

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
wall as far as like making it look like

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.459 
wall as far as like making it look like
actual<00:00:53.460> Rahl<00:00:53.940> running<00:00:54.510> where<00:00:54.809> your<00:00:54.960> character

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
actual Rahl running where your character

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.930 
actual Rahl running where your character
is<00:00:55.530> still<00:00:55.739> upright<00:00:55.980> with<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> feet<00:00:56.640> are<00:00:56.820> on

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
is still upright with the feet are on

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.479 
is still upright with the feet are on
the<00:00:56.969> wall<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:58.350> really<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.949> don't<00:00:59.280> think

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the wall that is really I don't think

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.490 
the wall that is really I don't think
that's<00:00:59.730> going<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.480> able<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.809> happen<00:01:01.289> just

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
that's going to be able to happen just

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.390 
that's going to be able to happen just
yet<00:01:02.449> but<00:01:03.449> for<00:01:03.510> now<00:01:04.080> we're<00:01:04.650> going<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:04.979> faking

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
yet but for now we're going to be faking

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.640 
yet but for now we're going to be faking
it<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:05.790> let<00:01:06.510> me<00:01:06.570> jump<00:01:06.780> into<00:01:06.960> project<00:01:07.380> spark

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
it so let me jump into project spark

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.890 
it so let me jump into project spark
you're<00:01:07.830> really<00:01:08.070> quick<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:09.390> show<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.780> guys

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
you're really quick and show you guys

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.679 
you're really quick and show you guys

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
what i have so i still have my jump turn

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.719 
what i have so i still have my jump turn
jump<00:01:14.000> you<00:01:15.000> know<00:01:15.180> from<00:01:15.509> my<00:01:15.979> by<00:01:16.979> jumping<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.520> tort

wall<00:01:17.909> jumping<00:01:18.240> tutorial<00:01:18.750> as<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
wall jumping tutorial as like the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.810 
wall jumping tutorial as like the
mirrors<00:01:20.040> edge<00:01:20.189> feel<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.820> now<00:01:21.780> we<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:22.820> wall

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
mirrors edge feel and now we have wall

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.350 
mirrors edge feel and now we have wall
running<00:01:24.119> which<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.200> kind<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.340> basically<00:01:26.850> it

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
running which is kind of basically it

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.469 
running which is kind of basically it
just<00:01:27.390> it's<00:01:27.930> extremely<00:01:28.619> simple<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.189> we<00:01:29.340> have<00:01:29.549> on

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
just it's extremely simple so we have on

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.960 
just it's extremely simple so we have on
the<00:01:30.600> wall<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.549> basically<00:01:32.549> what<00:01:32.759> we're<00:01:32.939> doing

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the wall and basically what we're doing

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.450 
the wall and basically what we're doing
is<00:01:33.420> we're<00:01:33.689> slowing<00:01:34.200> gravity<00:01:34.740> or<00:01:35.280> we're

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
is we're slowing gravity or we're

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.300 
is we're slowing gravity or we're
reducing<00:01:36.060> gravity<00:01:36.500> when<00:01:37.500> you're<00:01:37.680> touching<00:01:38.220> a

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
reducing gravity when you're touching a

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.649 
reducing gravity when you're touching a
wall<00:01:38.549> till<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.420> go<00:01:39.840> further<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:41.479> have<00:01:42.479> more

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
wall till I go further and have more

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.660 
wall till I go further and have more
time<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.110> turn<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.890> jump<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.369> whatnot

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
time to turn and jump and whatnot

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.429 
time to turn and jump and whatnot
so<00:01:45.970> let<00:01:46.450> me<00:01:46.540> just<00:01:46.720> show<00:01:46.869> you<00:01:46.900> guys<00:01:47.110> real<00:01:47.409> quick

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
so let me just show you guys real quick

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:48.960 
so let me just show you guys real quick
I'm<00:01:47.950> not<00:01:48.100> really<00:01:48.220> going<00:01:48.369> to<00:01:48.490> do<00:01:48.549> a<00:01:48.580> step<00:01:48.850> by

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
I'm not really going to do a step by

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.570 
I'm not really going to do a step by
step<00:01:49.270> as<00:01:49.479> it's<00:01:49.750> really<00:01:50.409> simple<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:53.049> i<00:01:53.409> have<00:01:54.399> is

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
step as it's really simple so i have is

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.030 
step as it's really simple so i have is
doing<00:01:55.000> is<00:01:55.119> calling<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.689> second<00:01:56.170> page<00:01:56.380> to<00:01:56.890> show

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
doing is calling the second page to show

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.550 
doing is calling the second page to show
you<00:01:57.130> guys<00:01:57.189> here<00:01:57.580> and<00:01:57.790> I've<00:01:58.780> it<00:01:58.990> when<00:01:59.170> falling

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
you guys here and I've it when falling

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.700 
you guys here and I've it when falling
and<00:01:59.970> bumping<00:02:00.970> terrain<00:02:01.470> we're<00:02:02.470> going<00:02:02.590> to

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
and bumping terrain we're going to

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.270 
and bumping terrain we're going to
change<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.130> gravity<00:02:03.549> factor<00:02:04.470> 2.15<00:02:05.470> you<00:02:06.100> can

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
change the gravity factor 2.15 you can

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.809 
change the gravity factor 2.15 you can
change<00:02:06.549> this<00:02:06.850> depending<00:02:07.390> on<00:02:07.479> how<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:07.690> want<00:02:07.840> it

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
change this depending on how you want it

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.460 
change this depending on how you want it
obviously<00:02:09.819> it<00:02:10.060> goes<00:02:10.300> from<00:02:10.630> a<00:02:10.929> value<00:02:11.260> of<00:02:11.290> one

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
obviously it goes from a value of one

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.309 
obviously it goes from a value of one
being<00:02:12.040> normal<00:02:12.280> gravity<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:12.970> then<00:02:13.720> any<00:02:14.019> less

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
being normal gravity and then any less

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.740 
being normal gravity and then any less
than<00:02:14.350> that<00:02:14.620> would<00:02:15.010> be<00:02:15.250> less<00:02:16.030> gravity<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:16.660> then

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
than that would be less gravity and then

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.240 
than that would be less gravity and then
you<00:02:16.810> go<00:02:16.930> into<00:02:17.140> negatives<00:02:17.650> if<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:17.980> want<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.160> go

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
you go into negatives if you want to go

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.180 
you go into negatives if you want to go
to<00:02:18.310> negative<00:02:18.519> gravity<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.300> whatnot<00:02:19.680> now<00:02:20.680> what

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
to negative gravity and whatnot now what

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.040 
to negative gravity and whatnot now what
I<00:02:21.220> have<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.730> doing<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.510> playing<00:02:22.930> a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
I have you doing that and playing a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.720 
I have you doing that and playing a
sound<00:02:23.350> so<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:23.799> sounds<00:02:24.190> like<00:02:24.250> you're<00:02:24.489> still

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
sound so it sounds like you're still

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.900 
sound so it sounds like you're still
running<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.720> wall<00:02:25.900> although<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:27.610> sound

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
running the wall although the sound

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.360 
running the wall although the sound
volume<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.360> really<00:02:28.630> quiet<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.830> don't<00:02:30.190> know

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
volume is really quiet and I don't know

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.820 
volume is really quiet and I don't know
how<00:02:30.640> I'm<00:02:30.790> going<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.120> fix<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:32.040> but<00:02:33.040> for<00:02:33.430> now

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
how I'm going to fix that but for now

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.770 
how I'm going to fix that but for now
that's<00:02:35.830> just<00:02:36.100> how<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.880> then<00:02:37.600> when<00:02:37.750> we

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
that's just how it is and then when we

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.960 
that's just how it is and then when we
have<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.799> else<00:02:38.980> statement<00:02:39.130> saying<00:02:39.819> that

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
have the else statement saying that

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.090 
have the else statement saying that
whenever<00:02:40.239> we're<00:02:40.600> not<00:02:40.840> doing<00:02:41.319> this<00:02:41.560> the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
whenever we're not doing this the

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.520 
whenever we're not doing this the
gravity<00:02:42.610> equals<00:02:43.030> one<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.540> i'll<00:02:44.110> return

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
gravity equals one and i'll return

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.199 
gravity equals one and i'll return
gravity<00:02:44.890> if<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.100> don't<00:02:45.250> have<00:02:45.489> this<00:02:45.790> it's

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
gravity if you don't have this it's

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.630 
gravity if you don't have this it's
going<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.500> detect<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:47.739> doing<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.459> i'm

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
going to detect you doing that and i'm

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.729 
going to detect you doing that and i'm
just<00:02:48.730> going<00:02:48.819> to<00:02:49.030> set<00:02:49.239> your<00:02:49.360> gravity<00:02:49.750> factor<00:02:50.109> to

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
just going to set your gravity factor to

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.039 
just going to set your gravity factor to
that<00:02:50.950> forever<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:52.390> you're<00:02:52.750> going<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.930> be

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
that forever and you're going to be

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.680 
that forever and you're going to be
jumping<00:02:53.380> in<00:02:53.470> slow<00:02:53.680> motion<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:55.180> whole<00:02:55.359> rest<00:02:55.570> of

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
jumping in slow motion the whole rest of

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.479 
jumping in slow motion the whole rest of
the<00:02:55.780> game<00:02:56.160> anywho<00:02:57.160> so<00:02:58.530> guys<00:02:59.530> looks<00:03:00.070> pretty

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
the game anywho so guys looks pretty

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.140 
the game anywho so guys looks pretty
much<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:02.680> can<00:03:02.799> also<00:03:03.040> what<00:03:03.519> what<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:04.000> can

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
much it you can also what what you can

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.120 
much it you can also what what you can
do<00:03:04.299> is<00:03:04.450> you<00:03:04.570> can<00:03:04.600> push<00:03:05.109> your<00:03:05.680> character

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
do is you can push your character

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.800 
do is you can push your character
towards<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.790> wall<00:03:06.970> if<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:07.299> want<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.600> be<00:03:07.720> able

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
towards the wall if you want to be able

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.370 
towards the wall if you want to be able
to<00:03:08.109> stick<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.220> wall<00:03:09.430> for<00:03:10.390> good<00:03:10.660> until<00:03:11.049> you

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
to stick to the wall for good until you

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.110 
to stick to the wall for good until you
press<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.799> button<00:03:11.829> you<00:03:12.220> can<00:03:12.310> have<00:03:12.519> it<00:03:12.670> pushing

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
press the button you can have it pushing

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.949 
press the button you can have it pushing
your<00:03:13.239> character<00:03:13.630> to<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.019> wall<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:15.810> you<00:03:16.810> can

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
your character to the wall and you can

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.210 
your character to the wall and you can
also<00:03:17.200> try<00:03:17.859> what<00:03:18.820> I<00:03:18.850> did<00:03:19.150> as<00:03:19.480> another<00:03:19.750> one<00:03:20.220> was

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
also try what I did as another one was

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.120 
also try what I did as another one was
when<00:03:21.609> I<00:03:21.640> would<00:03:21.910> run

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
when I would run

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.820 
when I would run
and<00:03:23.940> jump<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.390> touch<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.840> wall<00:03:25.080> it<00:03:25.710> would

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
and jump and touch the wall it would

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.990 
and jump and touch the wall it would
push<00:03:26.160> me<00:03:26.400> up<00:03:26.610> forward<00:03:27.600> an<00:03:27.750> arc<00:03:28.110> so<00:03:29.100> without

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
push me up forward an arc so without

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.700 
push me up forward an arc so without
that<00:03:30.420> didn't<00:03:30.750> really<00:03:30.840> feel<00:03:31.140> right<00:03:31.440> it

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
that didn't really feel right it

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.940 
that didn't really feel right it
basically<00:03:31.860> just<00:03:32.130> threw<00:03:32.700> me<00:03:32.880> up<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.240> wall

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
basically just threw me up the wall

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.330 
basically just threw me up the wall
added<00:03:34.950> like<00:03:35.100> a<00:03:35.370> weird<00:03:35.900> weird<00:03:36.900> way<00:03:37.170> so<00:03:37.740> I<00:03:38.010> didn't

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
added like a weird weird way so I didn't

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.520 
added like a weird weird way so I didn't
really<00:03:38.370> like<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:39.000> I<00:03:39.030> found<00:03:39.330> this<00:03:39.570> way<00:03:39.870> feels

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
really like it so I found this way feels

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.810 
really like it so I found this way feels
better<00:03:40.830> in<00:03:41.100> first<00:03:42.060> person<00:03:42.270> at<00:03:42.600> least<00:03:43.100> so<00:03:44.100> yeah

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
better in first person at least so yeah

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.720 
better in first person at least so yeah
thank<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.480> guys<00:03:45.570> um<00:03:46.140> next<00:03:46.710> episode<00:03:47.250> I'll<00:03:47.580> be

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
thank you guys um next episode I'll be

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.790 
thank you guys um next episode I'll be
making<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:48.090> game<00:03:48.330> that<00:03:48.540> involves<00:03:48.870> my<00:03:49.410> while

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
making a game that involves my while

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.520 
making a game that involves my while
jumping<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.490> wall<00:03:50.700> running<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.330> maybe<00:03:52.290> even

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
jumping and wall running and maybe even

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.070 
jumping and wall running and maybe even
my<00:03:52.770> teleportation<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.850> still<00:03:54.420> want<00:03:54.630> to<00:03:54.720> figure

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
my teleportation I still want to figure

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.950 
my teleportation I still want to figure
out<00:03:55.350> how<00:03:55.590> I'm<00:03:55.740> going<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:55.980> implement<00:03:56.280> that<00:03:56.960> but

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
out how I'm going to implement that but
