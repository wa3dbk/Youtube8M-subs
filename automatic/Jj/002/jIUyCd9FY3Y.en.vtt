hello<00:00:04.810> this<00:00:05.109> is<00:00:05.170> a<00:00:05.319> video<00:00:05.500> about<00:00:05.979> teaching

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:06.700 
hello this is a video about teaching

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.879 
hello this is a video about teaching
even<00:00:07.149> finger<00:00:07.569> spacing<00:00:08.050> to<00:00:08.200> beginning<00:00:08.470> jealous

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:08.889 
even finger spacing to beginning jealous

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:10.290 
even finger spacing to beginning jealous
in<00:00:09.220> first<00:00:09.580> position

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:10.300 
in first position

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.650 
in first position
and<00:00:11.140> a<00:00:11.860> very<00:00:12.040> common<00:00:12.400> problem<00:00:12.850> that<00:00:13.030> beginning

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
and a very common problem that beginning

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.450 
and a very common problem that beginning
jealous<00:00:14.050> have<00:00:14.260> is<00:00:14.559> that<00:00:14.740> the<00:00:14.920> second<00:00:15.309> and

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.460 
jealous have is that the second and

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.490 
jealous have is that the second and
third<00:00:15.610> fingers<00:00:15.849> tend<00:00:16.840> to<00:00:16.930> be<00:00:17.050> too<00:00:17.230> close

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
third fingers tend to be too close

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.230 
third fingers tend to be too close
together<00:00:17.710> so<00:00:18.039> we<00:00:18.130> have<00:00:18.160> this<00:00:18.430> sort<00:00:18.609> of<00:00:18.730> spacing

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
together so we have this sort of spacing

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.319 
together so we have this sort of spacing
problem<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:21.039> I'm<00:00:21.189> just<00:00:21.279> gonna<00:00:21.429> try<00:00:22.060> to<00:00:22.089> get

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:22.329 
problem so I'm just gonna try to get

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:23.399 
problem so I'm just gonna try to get
that<00:00:22.449> there<00:00:22.630> so<00:00:22.839> it<00:00:22.929> looks<00:00:22.960> something<00:00:23.289> like

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:23.409 
that there so it looks something like

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:25.950 
that there so it looks something like
this<00:00:23.739> right<00:00:24.329> we<00:00:25.329> have<00:00:25.449> too<00:00:25.659> much<00:00:25.779> space

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
this right we have too much space

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.739 
this right we have too much space
between<00:00:26.529> one<00:00:26.800> and<00:00:26.829> two<00:00:27.099> and<00:00:27.999> we<00:00:28.150> have<00:00:28.329> two<00:00:28.599> and

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:28.749 
between one and two and we have two and

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:30.269 
between one and two and we have two and
three<00:00:28.929> too<00:00:29.079> close<00:00:29.289> and<00:00:29.560> three<00:00:29.710> and<00:00:29.829> four<00:00:29.890> too

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
three too close and three and four too

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.210 
three too close and three and four too
far<00:00:30.519> apart<00:00:30.819> and<00:00:31.089> one<00:00:31.710> practice<00:00:32.710> we<00:00:32.800> often<00:00:33.100> give

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
far apart and one practice we often give

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.639 
far apart and one practice we often give
students<00:00:33.640> is<00:00:33.760> to<00:00:33.790> do<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.239> SPOC<00:00:34.780> sign<00:00:35.109> right<00:00:35.469> to

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
students is to do the SPOC sign right to

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:37.439 
students is to do the SPOC sign right to
kind<00:00:35.859> of<00:00:35.980> space<00:00:36.519> out<00:00:36.730> these<00:00:37.000> two<00:00:37.180> little

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
kind of space out these two little

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:39.299 
kind of space out these two little
fingers<00:00:37.660> but<00:00:38.410> we<00:00:38.500> can<00:00:38.649> do<00:00:38.739> some<00:00:38.920> other<00:00:39.010> things

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
fingers but we can do some other things

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.880 
fingers but we can do some other things
too<00:00:39.550> to<00:00:39.699> help<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.989> first<00:00:41.199> thing<00:00:41.350> I<00:00:41.440> like<00:00:41.590> to<00:00:41.739> do

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
too to help the first thing I like to do

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.509 
too to help the first thing I like to do
is<00:00:42.219> just<00:00:42.280> practice<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.710> finger<00:00:44.980> spacings

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
is just practice the finger spacings

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.720 
is just practice the finger spacings
between<00:00:45.670> adjacent<00:00:46.120> fingers<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:48.579> I'll

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
between adjacent fingers so I'll

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.639 
between adjacent fingers so I'll
practice<00:00:49.239> the<00:00:49.390> person<00:00:49.719> of<00:00:49.809> the<00:00:49.899> second<00:00:50.289> finger

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
practice the person of the second finger

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.810 
practice the person of the second finger
and<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:53.079> have<00:00:53.230> a<00:00:53.260> little<00:00:53.410> sang<00:00:53.710> and<00:00:53.980> it's<00:00:54.579> one

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
and I have a little sang and it's one

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.270 
and I have a little sang and it's one
and<00:00:54.910> two<00:00:54.999> right<00:00:55.719> next<00:00:55.989> to<00:00:56.079> you<00:00:56.199> so<00:00:56.999> close<00:00:57.999> and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
and two right next to you so close and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.889 
and two right next to you so close and
then<00:01:00.280> I<00:01:00.370> practice<00:01:00.760> two<00:01:00.969> and<00:01:01.120> three<00:01:01.359> and<00:01:01.570> I<00:01:01.809> have

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
then I practice two and three and I have

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.399 
then I practice two and three and I have
a<00:01:01.960> little<00:01:02.079> saying<00:01:03.269> 2<00:01:04.269> min<00:01:04.300> three<00:01:04.720> a<00:01:04.930> stretch

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
a little saying 2 min three a stretch

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.420 
a little saying 2 min three a stretch
there<00:01:05.650> must<00:01:05.860> be<00:01:07.440> and<00:01:08.440> then<00:01:08.590> I<00:01:08.650> practice<00:01:09.040> three

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
there must be and then I practice three

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.020 
there must be and then I practice three
and<00:01:09.580> four<00:01:09.850> right<00:01:10.120> next<00:01:10.990> door<00:01:11.020> so<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.880> those

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
and four right next door so that those

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.240 
and four right next door so that those
are<00:01:13.060> closer<00:01:13.450> so<00:01:14.050> these<00:01:14.170> need<00:01:14.380> to<00:01:14.440> be<00:01:14.650> closer

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
are closer so these need to be closer

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.920 
are closer so these need to be closer
further<00:01:16.180> closer<00:01:16.960> so<00:01:17.740> I<00:01:17.770> start<00:01:18.130> with<00:01:18.250> those

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
further closer so I start with those

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.190 
further closer so I start with those
okay<00:01:19.960> and<00:01:20.410> related<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:21.100> that<00:01:21.990> I'd<00:01:22.990> like<00:01:23.050> to

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
okay and related to that I'd like to

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.380 
okay and related to that I'd like to
teach<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:23.710> second<00:01:24.040> finger<00:01:24.220> early<00:01:24.670> because<00:01:25.150> if

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
teach the second finger early because if

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.330 
teach the second finger early because if
we<00:01:25.510> stay<00:01:25.720> on<00:01:25.840> f-sharp<00:01:25.990> too<00:01:26.350> long<00:01:26.560> like<00:01:27.040> a<00:01:27.100> lot

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
we stay on f-sharp too long like a lot

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.640 
we stay on f-sharp too long like a lot
of<00:01:27.460> method<00:01:27.700> books<00:01:27.880> do<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:29.110> can<00:01:29.290> end<00:01:29.440> up<00:01:29.500> with

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
of method books do you can end up with

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.400 
of method books do you can end up with
this<00:01:29.770> problem<00:01:30.510> so<00:01:31.510> you<00:01:31.570> need<00:01:31.870> to<00:01:31.960> practice<00:01:32.110> the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
this problem so you need to practice the

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.500 
this problem so you need to practice the
second<00:01:32.830> finger<00:01:32.980> at<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.000> same<00:01:34.180> time<00:01:34.390> you

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
second finger at the same time you

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.660 
second finger at the same time you
practice<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.020> third<00:01:35.230> finger<00:01:35.620> so<00:01:36.340> that<00:01:36.370> you

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
practice the third finger so that you

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.960 
practice the third finger so that you
have<00:01:36.880> even<00:01:37.540> finger<00:01:37.840> spacing<00:01:38.290> now<00:01:38.410> okay<00:01:39.130> the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
have even finger spacing now okay the

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.540 
have even finger spacing now okay the
next<00:01:40.180> step<00:01:40.980> is<00:01:41.980> to<00:01:42.310> teach<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:43.450> whole<00:01:43.480> steps

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
next step is to teach the whole steps

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.940 
next step is to teach the whole steps
which<00:01:45.550> is<00:01:45.900> skipping<00:01:46.900> over<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.170> finger<00:01:47.500> so<00:01:47.830> I'll

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
which is skipping over a finger so I'll

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.350 
which is skipping over a finger so I'll
do<00:01:48.210> 1<00:01:49.210> 2<00:01:49.330> 3<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.400> saying<00:01:51.610> I<00:01:51.760> have<00:01:51.910> this<00:01:52.030> one

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
do 1 2 3 and the saying I have this one

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.530 
do 1 2 3 and the saying I have this one
and<00:01:52.510> 3<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:53.020> stretch<00:01:53.710> there<00:01:53.950> must<00:01:54.130> be<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:55.240> again

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
and 3 a stretch there must be and again

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.850 
and 3 a stretch there must be and again
if<00:01:55.690> you've<00:01:55.840> practiced<00:01:56.020> your<00:01:56.320> second<00:01:56.710> finger

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
if you've practiced your second finger

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.120 
if you've practiced your second finger
you<00:01:57.670> can<00:01:57.850> make<00:01:58.690> sure<00:01:58.720> that<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:59.290> second<00:02:00.010> finger

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
you can make sure that the second finger

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.710 
you can make sure that the second finger
has<00:02:00.370> enough<00:02:00.610> space<00:02:00.790> here<00:02:01.120> and<00:02:01.180> is<00:02:01.270> closed<00:02:01.480> here

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
has enough space here and is closed here

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.690 
has enough space here and is closed here
and<00:02:02.110> this<00:02:02.530> brings<00:02:02.740> up<00:02:02.860> another<00:02:02.950> issue<00:02:03.250> as<00:02:03.520> well

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
and this brings up another issue as well

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.240 
and this brings up another issue as well
and<00:02:04.300> that<00:02:04.450> is<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.660> think<00:02:05.050> it's<00:02:05.200> easier<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:05.890> have

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
and that is I think it's easier to have

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.609 
and that is I think it's easier to have
even<00:02:06.580> finger<00:02:06.970> spacing<00:02:07.510> with<00:02:07.930> a<00:02:07.960> slight<00:02:08.319> slant

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
even finger spacing with a slight slant

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.650 
even finger spacing with a slight slant
in<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.009> hand<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.399> little<00:02:09.429> bit<00:02:09.789> of<00:02:09.879> pronation<00:02:10.209> if

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
in the hand a little bit of pronation if

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.770 
in the hand a little bit of pronation if
your<00:02:11.140> hand<00:02:11.410> is<00:02:11.500> totally<00:02:11.710> square<00:02:12.300> it's<00:02:13.300> very

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
your hand is totally square it's very

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.710 
your hand is totally square it's very
difficult<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.380> control<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.950> distance

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
difficult to control the distance

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.400 
difficult to control the distance
between<00:02:16.200> 2<00:02:16.470> &amp;<00:02:16.650> 3<00:02:17.480> if<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.570> have<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.840> slight<00:02:19.170> slant

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
between 2 &amp; 3 if you have a slight slant

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.550 
between 2 &amp; 3 if you have a slight slant
in<00:02:19.680> your<00:02:19.800> hand<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.850> have<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:21.060> lot<00:02:22.050> of<00:02:22.080> control

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
in your hand you have a lot of control

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.060 
in your hand you have a lot of control
over<00:02:22.710> how<00:02:22.950> far<00:02:23.280> 3<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.850> from<00:02:24.060> 2<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.440> prefer<00:02:26.040> a

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
over how far 3 is from 2 so I prefer a

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.790 
over how far 3 is from 2 so I prefer a
little<00:02:26.160> bit<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.550> slant<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.120> hand

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
little bit of slant to the hand

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.090 
little bit of slant to the hand
so<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:28.830> practice<00:02:29.280> open<00:02:29.700> 1<00:02:29.910> 2<00:02:30.090> 3<00:02:30.620> 1<00:02:31.620> 2<00:02:31.650> 3<00:02:31.770> is

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
so I practice open 1 2 3 1 2 3 is

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.150 
so I practice open 1 2 3 1 2 3 is
stretched<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.520> must<00:02:32.640> be<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.420> practice<00:02:34.160> 9

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
stretched it must be that I practice 9

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.480 
stretched it must be that I practice 9
second<00:02:35.580> finger<00:02:35.880> with<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.270> student<00:02:36.630> about<00:02:36.870> to

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
second finger with the student about to

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.330 
second finger with the student about to
do<00:02:38.490> -<00:02:38.610> for<00:02:38.930> such<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:39.960> little<00:02:40.140> more<00:02:40.380> or<00:02:40.680> just<00:02:40.740> 2

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
do - for such a little more or just 2

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.860 
do - for such a little more or just 2
and<00:02:41.580> 4<00:02:41.910> stretching<00:02:42.480> along<00:02:43.970> both<00:02:44.970> ways<00:02:45.270> 1<00:02:45.930> &amp;<00:02:46.110> 3

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
and 4 stretching along both ways 1 &amp; 3

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.430 
and 4 stretching along both ways 1 &amp; 3
ok<00:02:48.870> because<00:02:49.820> in<00:02:50.820> this<00:02:50.970> position<00:02:51.240> 3<00:02:52.020> tends<00:02:52.290> to

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
ok because in this position 3 tends to

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.430 
ok because in this position 3 tends to
be<00:02:52.560> flat<00:02:52.860> making<00:02:53.790> these<00:02:53.940> two<00:02:54.180> close<00:02:54.420> -<00:02:54.720> tends

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
be flat making these two close - tends

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.800 
be flat making these two close - tends
to<00:02:55.620> be<00:02:55.740> too<00:02:55.890> high<00:02:56.100> making<00:02:56.760> those<00:02:57.060> too<00:02:57.270> close

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
to be too high making those too close

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.170 
to be too high making those too close
alright<00:02:58.800> so<00:02:58.950> we<00:02:59.040> need<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.250> practice<00:02:59.400> getting

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
alright so we need to practice getting

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.240 
alright so we need to practice getting
those<00:03:00.360> further<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.230> getting<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:01.560> down

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
those further and getting that down

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.980 
those further and getting that down
getting<00:03:02.640> 3<00:03:02.970> up<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.300> getting<00:03:03.480> 2<00:03:03.630> down

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
getting 3 up and getting 2 down

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.190 
getting 3 up and getting 2 down
ok<00:03:04.740> then<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.040> practice<00:03:05.430> 3<00:03:05.670> finger<00:03:06.000> patterns<00:03:06.420> so

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
ok then I practice 3 finger patterns so

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:15.500 
ok then I practice 3 finger patterns so
I'll<00:03:07.530> do<00:03:09.260> 4<00:03:12.290> so<00:03:13.290> 1<00:03:14.190> in<00:03:14.310> 3<00:03:14.610> stretch<00:03:15.120> there<00:03:15.360> must

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
I'll do 4 so 1 in 3 stretch there must

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.420 
I'll do 4 so 1 in 3 stretch there must
be<00:03:15.660> 3<00:03:16.260> &amp;<00:03:16.380> 4<00:03:16.560> right<00:03:16.800> next<00:03:17.100> door<00:03:17.130> then<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:17.640> go<00:03:17.820> 1<00:03:18.650> 4<00:03:19.650> 1

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
be 3 &amp; 4 right next door then I go 1 4 1

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.509 
be 3 &amp; 4 right next door then I go 1 4 1
&amp;<00:03:20.610> 2<00:03:20.959> right<00:03:21.959> next<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.320> you<00:03:22.440> -<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.010> for<00:03:23.070> scratch

&amp; 2 right next to you - and for scratch

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.180 
&amp; 2 right next to you - and for scratch
an<00:03:23.640> alarm<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:27.470> helps<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.950> finger

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
an alarm that helps the the finger

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:38.490 
an alarm that helps the the finger
spacing<00:03:29.610> quite<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:29.820> bit
