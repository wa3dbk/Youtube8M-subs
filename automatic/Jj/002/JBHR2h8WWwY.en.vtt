00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
hand what we can do is quickly play the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.310 
hand what we can do is quickly play the
notes<00:02:07.580> that<00:02:08.580> we<00:02:08.729> play<00:02:09.060> for<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.869> left-hand

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
notes that we play for the left-hand

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.070 
notes that we play for the left-hand
chord<00:02:10.590> for<00:02:11.100> the<00:02:11.130> c<00:02:11.400> major<00:02:11.610> 7th<00:02:12.090> chord<00:02:12.360> with<00:02:12.960> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
chord for the c major 7th chord with the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.250 
chord for the c major 7th chord with the
right<00:02:13.260> hand<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:13.740> before<00:02:14.160> we<00:02:14.280> play<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.760> B<00:02:15.260> we

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
right hand so before we play the B we

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.210 
right hand so before we play the B we
can<00:02:16.410> quickly<00:02:16.680> play<00:02:17.040> c<00:02:17.520> e<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.390> g<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.260> as<00:02:20.100> you

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
can quickly play c e and g and as you

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.800 
can quickly play c e and g and as you
can<00:02:20.340> see<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.760> matches<00:02:21.120> up<00:02:21.240> with<00:02:21.420> what<00:02:21.480> we're

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
can see that matches up with what we're

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.900 
can see that matches up with what we're
playing<00:02:22.050> in<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.319> left<00:02:22.620> hand<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:23.700> goes<00:02:23.880> like

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
playing in the left hand so it goes like

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.420 
playing in the left hand so it goes like
this<00:02:26.930> time

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:42.220 

I'll<00:02:31.430> do<00:02:31.550> that<00:02:31.700> again<00:02:40.360> now<00:02:41.360> here<00:02:41.690> when<00:02:41.960> we<00:02:42.080> get

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
I'll do that again now here when we get

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.710 
I'll do that again now here when we get
to<00:02:42.440> this<00:02:42.590> B<00:02:42.980> minor<00:02:43.370> seventh<00:02:43.910> chord<00:02:43.970> because

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
to this B minor seventh chord because

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.540 
to this B minor seventh chord because
we're<00:02:45.020> holding<00:02:45.410> on<00:02:45.530> this<00:02:45.800> code<00:02:46.070> for<00:02:46.280> quite<00:02:46.520> a

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
we're holding on this code for quite a

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.000 
we're holding on this code for quite a
while<00:02:46.790> what<00:02:47.510> we<00:02:47.600> can<00:02:47.720> do<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:47.930> play<00:02:48.110> each<00:02:48.440> of<00:02:48.830> the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
while what we can do is play each of the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.590 
while what we can do is play each of the
notes<00:02:50.800> separately<00:02:51.800> so<00:02:52.010> we<00:02:52.100> play<00:02:52.280> B<00:02:52.700> D<00:02:53.240> F<00:02:53.540> sharp

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
notes separately so we play B D F sharp

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:04.080 
notes separately so we play B D F sharp
B<00:02:54.350> D<00:02:54.890> F<00:02:55.370> sharp<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.970> then<00:02:56.630> we<00:02:56.780> just<00:02:56.930> continue

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:12.970 

I'll<00:03:05.090> do<00:03:05.240> it<00:03:05.330> from<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.600> beginning

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.160 

and<00:03:14.030> if<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.150> have<00:03:15.300> a<00:03:15.330> pedal<00:03:15.810> with<00:03:15.990> your

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
and if you have a pedal with your

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.500 
and if you have a pedal with your
keyboard<00:03:16.590> if<00:03:16.710> you<00:03:16.830> hold<00:03:17.130> on<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.030> pedal<00:03:18.360> as

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
keyboard if you hold on to the pedal as

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.950 
keyboard if you hold on to the pedal as
you<00:03:18.660> do<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:21.180> gives<00:03:21.300> a<00:03:21.510> really<00:03:21.810> nice

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
you do this it gives a really nice

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.790 
you do this it gives a really nice
effect

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
effect

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:34.240 
effect
so<00:03:23.490> dude<00:03:23.700> from<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.000> beginning<00:03:24.300> one<00:03:24.480> more<00:03:24.660> time

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250
