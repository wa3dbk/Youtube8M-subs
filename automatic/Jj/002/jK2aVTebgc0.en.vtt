and these three together but yeah I'm
going<00:01:18.040> to<00:01:18.100> take<00:01:18.280> this<00:01:18.430> apart<00:01:18.820> and<00:01:19.119> see<00:01:19.900> if<00:01:20.050> I

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
going to take this apart and see if I

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.930 
going to take this apart and see if I
can<00:01:20.350> make<00:01:20.530> I<00:01:20.860> mean<00:01:21.369> because<00:01:21.460> they're<00:01:21.700> actually

guy<00:01:41.170> on<00:01:42.130> a<00:01:43.170> RC<00:01:44.170> group<00:01:44.380> says<00:01:44.650> that<00:01:44.830> he<00:01:44.950> used

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
guy on a RC group says that he used

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.570 
guy on a RC group says that he used
these<00:01:45.430> to<00:01:45.729> run<00:01:45.910> a<00:01:46.740> beaver<00:01:47.740> with<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:47.920> 400<00:01:48.400> size

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
these to run a beaver with a 400 size

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.000 
these to run a beaver with a 400 size
motors<00:01:49.260> with<00:01:50.260> the<00:01:50.470> two<00:01:51.220> of<00:01:51.340> these<00:01:51.460> so<00:01:52.740> he<00:01:53.740> says

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
motors with the two of these so he says

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.899 
motors with the two of these so he says
he<00:01:54.130> gets<00:01:54.280> over<00:01:54.520> 15<00:01:54.880> minutes<00:01:55.000> flight<00:01:55.330> time<00:01:55.360> so

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
he gets over 15 minutes flight time so

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:04.160 
he gets over 15 minutes flight time so
we're<00:01:57.909> gonna<00:01:58.060> find<00:01:58.330> out

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170

one of the cells from the laptop battery
we<00:02:16.180> got<00:02:16.360> hooked<00:02:16.540> up<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.959> this<00:02:18.780> chart<00:02:19.780> here

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
we got hooked up to this chart here

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.170 
we got hooked up to this chart here
already<00:02:20.560> start<00:02:20.800> charging<00:02:21.220> in<00:02:21.340> I've<00:02:21.550> also<00:02:21.820> got

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
already start charging in I've also got

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.530 
already start charging in I've also got
a<00:02:22.209> temperature<00:02:22.630> wire<00:02:24.150> setup<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.390> can

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
a temperature wire setup so I can

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.729 
a temperature wire setup so I can
monitor<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.350> temperature<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:28.350> first<00:02:29.350> off<00:02:29.590> on

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
monitor the temperature and first off on

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:41.420 
monitor the temperature and first off on
one<00:02:29.860> charge<00:02:30.100> damping<00:02:31.680> so

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
for sure and work as a flight pack for a

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.520 
for sure and work as a flight pack for a
nitro<00:02:43.920> plane<00:02:44.219> and<00:02:44.659> slider<00:02:45.659> than<00:02:45.930> this<00:02:46.109> you

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
nitro plane and slider than this you

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:56.209 
nitro plane and slider than this you
know<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.859> mean<00:02:47.129> you<00:02:47.939> got<00:02:54.469> ninety<00:02:55.469> six<00:02:55.739> point<00:02:55.980> two

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:56.219 
know I mean you got ninety six point two

00:02:56.219 --> 00:03:08.750 
know I mean you got ninety six point two
grams<00:03:01.849> 85.7<00:03:02.849> I<00:03:06.769> mean<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:08.129> you<00:03:08.310> could<00:03:08.489> pry<00:03:08.700> or

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
grams 85.7 I mean and you could pry or

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.490 
grams 85.7 I mean and you could pry or
transmitter<00:03:09.450> off<00:03:09.629> of<00:03:09.780> just<00:03:09.930> one<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.349> these<00:03:10.439> I

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
transmitter off of just one of these I

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.759 
transmitter off of just one of these I
mean<00:03:10.799> I<00:03:10.889> would<00:03:11.040> use<00:03:11.189> two<00:03:11.459> but<00:03:12.379> one<00:03:13.379> would<00:03:13.590> run

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
mean I would use two but one would run

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.809 
mean I would use two but one would run
your<00:03:13.919> transmitter<00:03:14.400> for<00:03:14.669> a<00:03:14.909> while<00:03:16.040> but<00:03:17.040> uh<00:03:17.069> once

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
your transmitter for a while but uh once

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.520 
your transmitter for a while but uh once
it<00:03:17.939> gets<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.120> be<00:03:18.329> about<00:03:18.419> its<00:03:18.689> mid<00:03:18.900> range<00:03:19.169> it's

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
it gets to be about its mid range it's

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.409 
it gets to be about its mid range it's
going<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.709> be<00:03:19.859> down<00:03:20.159> to<00:03:20.189> like<00:03:20.489> three<00:03:20.730> some

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
going to be down to like three some

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.030 
going to be down to like three some
volts<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.079> it's<00:03:22.290> not<00:03:22.470> too<00:03:22.620> good<00:03:22.799> for<00:03:22.859> the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
volts so it's not too good for the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.530 
volts so it's not too good for the
transmitter<00:03:23.489> so<00:03:23.760> you've<00:03:23.879> got<00:03:24.090> two<00:03:24.299> of<00:03:24.329> them

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
transmitter so you've got two of them

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.129 
transmitter so you've got two of them
that<00:03:24.659> way<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.870> keep<00:03:25.049> your<00:03:25.169> voltage<00:03:25.500> higher<00:03:25.709> but

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
that way to keep your voltage higher but

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:36.979 
that way to keep your voltage higher but
yeah<00:03:34.519> okay<00:03:35.519> good<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:36.060> made<00:03:36.359> three<00:03:36.599> battery

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
yeah okay good so I made three battery

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:43.490 
yeah okay good so I made three battery
packs<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.620> 1s<00:03:38.750> with<00:03:39.750> jst<00:03:40.319> connector<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:41.659> 2's<00:03:42.659> on<00:03:43.439> a

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
packs a 1s with jst connector a 2's on a

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.050 
packs a 1s with jst connector a 2's on a
Deans<00:03:43.769> connector<00:03:43.919> that's<00:03:44.310> actually<00:03:44.669> charging

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
Deans connector that's actually charging

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.149 
Deans connector that's actually charging
right<00:03:45.209> now<00:03:45.359> and<00:03:45.840> a<00:03:46.799> 3s<00:03:47.760> on<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.569> Deans<00:03:49.019> connector

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
right now and a 3s on a Deans connector

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.770 
right now and a 3s on a Deans connector
now<00:03:50.159> I<00:03:50.190> actually<00:03:50.489> have<00:03:50.699> this<00:03:50.970> on<00:03:51.150> my<00:03:51.180> next<00:03:51.629> star

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
problems at all I held it and ran it for

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.800 
problems at all I held it and ran it for
about<00:04:02.280> two<00:04:02.549> minutes<00:04:02.729> and<00:04:03.030> check<00:04:03.359> the<00:04:03.479> battery

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
about two minutes and check the battery

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.460 
about two minutes and check the battery
they<00:04:03.989> didn't<00:04:04.199> getting<00:04:04.409> warm<00:04:04.620> or<00:04:04.799> nothing<00:04:06.470> I'm

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
they didn't getting warm or nothing I'm

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.719 
they didn't getting warm or nothing I'm
sure<00:04:07.709> it'll<00:04:08.310> work

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:08.729 
sure it'll work

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:10.610 
sure it'll work
this<00:04:09.239> battery<00:04:09.659> don't<00:04:09.989> want<00:04:10.229> it<00:04:10.290> too<00:04:10.439> much

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
this battery don't want it too much

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.009 
this battery don't want it too much
because<00:04:10.799> I<00:04:10.949> haven't<00:04:11.099> charged<00:04:11.639> it<00:04:11.849> yet<00:04:12.060> I'm

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
because I haven't charged it yet I'm

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.869 
because I haven't charged it yet I'm
just<00:04:13.229> going<00:04:13.409> off<00:04:13.530> of<00:04:13.590> that<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:14.430> back<00:04:14.669> the

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
just going off of that the back the

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.759 
just going off of that the back the
voltage<00:04:15.209> that<00:04:15.389> it<00:04:15.540> had<00:04:15.840> when<00:04:16.259> I<00:04:16.289> took<00:04:16.409> it<00:04:16.620> out

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
voltage that it had when I took it out

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.490 
voltage that it had when I took it out
of<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.979> battery<00:04:19.979> pack<00:04:20.250> for<00:04:20.579> the<00:04:20.699> laptop

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
of the the battery pack for the laptop

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:29.500 
of the the battery pack for the laptop
but<00:04:22.500> I<00:04:22.740> mean

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:46.970 

I<00:04:30.610> want<00:04:31.610> to<00:04:31.670> fly<00:04:31.910> off<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.090> rafter<00:04:32.570> here

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.030 

okay<00:04:47.980> guys<00:04:48.220> here<00:04:48.490> it<00:04:48.580> is<00:04:49.170> the<00:04:50.170> 3<00:04:50.470> s<00:04:50.590> battery

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
okay guys here it is the 3 s battery

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.650 
okay guys here it is the 3 s battery
just<00:04:51.400> finished<00:04:51.760> charge<00:04:52.000> and<00:04:52.180> I<00:04:52.240> haven't<00:04:52.480> tried

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
just finished charge and I haven't tried

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.870 
just finished charge and I haven't tried
it<00:04:52.720> yet<00:04:52.900> so<00:04:53.290> you're<00:04:54.220> seeing<00:04:54.490> what<00:04:54.640> I'm<00:04:54.850> seeing

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
it yet so you're seeing what I'm seeing

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.620 
it yet so you're seeing what I'm seeing
so<00:04:56.610> that<00:04:57.610> will<00:04:57.790> say<00:04:57.970> this<00:04:58.090> battery<00:04:58.420> took

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
so that will say this battery took

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.130 
so that will say this battery took
forever<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.140> chart<00:05:00.180> but<00:05:01.180> uh<00:05:01.240> let<00:05:01.810> me<00:05:01.870> go<00:05:02.050> ahead

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
forever the chart but uh let me go ahead

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.780 
forever the chart but uh let me go ahead
and<00:05:02.230> plug<00:05:02.530> this<00:05:02.560> in<00:05:02.920> one-handed<00:05:03.490> it's<00:05:03.640> going

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
and plug this in one-handed it's going

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:10.830 
and plug this in one-handed it's going
to<00:05:03.850> take<00:05:04.000> me<00:05:04.120> a<00:05:04.240> second<00:05:09.210> so<00:05:10.210> I<00:05:10.240> probably<00:05:10.570> should

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
to take me a second so I probably should

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.170 
to take me a second so I probably should
check<00:05:11.080> the<00:05:11.340> surface<00:05:12.340> voltage<00:05:12.940> of<00:05:13.060> this

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
check the surface voltage of this

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.060 
check the surface voltage of this
battery<00:05:13.570> before<00:05:13.720> working<00:05:14.110> in<00:05:14.230> my<00:05:14.470> plane<00:05:14.770> but

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
battery before working in my plane but

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.480 
battery before working in my plane but
you<00:05:15.250> know<00:05:15.460> what<00:05:16.050> the<00:05:17.050> charger<00:05:17.650> because<00:05:18.310> it

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
you know what the charger because it

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.870 
you know what the charger because it
wasn't<00:05:18.790> too<00:05:18.910> high<00:05:20.040> okay<00:05:23.430> like<00:05:24.430> I<00:05:24.520> just<00:05:24.550> things

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
wasn't too high okay like I just things

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.490 
wasn't too high okay like I just things
got<00:05:25.060> to<00:05:25.180> have<00:05:25.300> like<00:05:25.510> the<00:05:25.780> trim<00:05:26.110> all<00:05:26.320> the<00:05:26.350> way

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
got to have like the trim all the way

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:38.210 
got to have like the trim all the way
down<00:05:26.740> to<00:05:26.950> set<00:05:27.480> yeah<00:05:28.800> okay<00:05:29.800> oh<00:05:31.140> here<00:05:32.140> goes<00:05:36.090> oh

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
down to set yeah okay oh here goes oh

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.520 
down to set yeah okay oh here goes oh
goodness<00:05:39.220> or<00:05:39.610> I<00:05:39.730> can<00:05:39.970> throttle<00:05:40.720> it<00:05:40.840> and<00:05:41.050> can

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
goodness or I can throttle it and can

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:48.530 
goodness or I can throttle it and can
hold<00:05:41.980> it<00:05:42.190> at<00:05:42.280> the<00:05:42.400> same<00:05:42.580> time<00:05:42.640> so<00:05:45.870> here<00:05:46.870> we<00:05:46.960> go

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
hold it at the same time so here we go

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:56.640 
hold it at the same time so here we go
transmitter<00:05:49.540> over<00:05:54.810> no<00:05:55.810> don't<00:05:56.410> have<00:05:56.530> the

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
transmitter over no don't have the

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:07.700 
transmitter over no don't have the
current

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.530 

well<00:06:08.130> I<00:06:08.220> just<00:06:08.250> doesn't<00:06:08.820> mean<00:06:09.000> that<00:06:09.210> it's<00:06:09.360> bad

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
well I just doesn't mean that it's bad

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.800 
well I just doesn't mean that it's bad
it<00:06:10.470> just<00:06:10.560> means<00:06:10.830> that<00:06:11.340> I<00:06:11.670> can<00:06:12.240> use<00:06:12.270> it<00:06:12.540> for<00:06:12.570> this

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
it just means that I can use it for this

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:22.450 
it just means that I can use it for this
I<00:06:17.060> don't<00:06:18.060> know<00:06:18.150> I'll<00:06:18.810> figure<00:06:18.990> something<00:06:19.410> out

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:34.980 

maybe<00:06:24.590> 3<00:06:25.590> s<00:06:25.710> 2<00:06:26.010> P
