large condensers one over over the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.200 
large condensers one over over the
shoulder<00:00:19.770> would<00:00:19.890> be<00:00:20.070> more<00:00:20.279> authentic<00:00:20.730> but

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
shoulder would be more authentic but

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.179 
shoulder would be more authentic but
that<00:00:21.570> can<00:00:21.779> be<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> real<00:00:22.199> problem<00:00:22.470> sometimes

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189

that can be a real problem sometimes
with<00:00:23.340> drummers<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.060> I'll<00:00:24.180> usually<00:00:24.330> shoot<00:00:24.779> out

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
Tom's you don't want to get too low make

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.480 
Tom's you don't want to get too low make
sure<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> diaphragm<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.960> facing<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.009> snare

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
sure the diaphragm is facing the snare

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.420 
sure the diaphragm is facing the snare
don't<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:18.720> set<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.140> there<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:20.070> know<00:01:20.189> these

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
don't just set it there you know these

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.410 
don't just set it there you know these
are<00:01:20.640> all<00:01:20.840> cordially<00:01:21.890> microphones<00:01:22.890> by<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.159> way

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
are all cordially microphones by the way

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.690 
are all cordially microphones by the way
centered<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> snare<00:01:25.280> now<00:01:26.280> those<00:01:26.520> are

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
centered on the snare now those are

so<00:01:30.060> we're<00:01:30.150> going<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.299> make<00:01:30.420> an<00:01:30.540> isosceles

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
so we're going to make an isosceles

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.429 
so we're going to make an isosceles
triangle<00:01:32.030> it's<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.119> mathematical<00:01:33.840> formula

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
triangle it's a mathematical formula

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.990 
triangle it's a mathematical formula
it's<00:01:34.650> going<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.860> help<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:35.340> your<00:01:35.460> phasing

you can compress those and join it with

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.650 
you can compress those and join it with
a<00:02:14.510> straight<00:02:15.140> signal<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:16.040> get<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.190> real<00:02:16.580> big<00:02:17.120> fat
