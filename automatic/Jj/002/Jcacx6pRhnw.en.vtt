with the pucks and test Evette right so
this<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.269> what<00:00:30.570> they<00:00:30.630> look<00:00:30.779> like<00:00:30.810> with<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
this is what they look like with the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.450 
this is what they look like with the
lights<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.410> they<00:00:31.590> don't<00:00:31.740> look<00:00:31.800> too<00:00:31.859> bright<00:00:32.219> but

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
lights on they don't look too bright but

lights on they don't look too bright but
then<00:00:32.610> with<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.759> lights<00:00:32.940> off<00:00:33.120> they're<00:00:33.600> just

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
then with the lights off they're just

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.400

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.780 
one is very bright and then the red one
is<00:00:38.940> just<00:00:39.180> ridiculously<00:00:40.079> bright<00:00:40.460> as<00:00:41.460> far<00:00:41.670> as

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
is just ridiculously bright as far as

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.459 
is just ridiculously bright as far as
how<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:41.969> pucks<00:00:42.300> feel<00:00:42.600> for<00:00:42.930> stickhandling

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
how the pucks feel for stickhandling

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.889 
how the pucks feel for stickhandling
they<00:00:43.649> feel<00:00:43.860> just<00:00:44.340> like<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.550> regular<00:00:44.730> puck

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
they feel just like a regular puck

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.020 
they feel just like a regular puck
it's<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> same<00:00:47.010> weight<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.730> exact<00:00:48.000> same

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
it's the same weight it's the exact same

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.350 
it's the same weight it's the exact same
size<00:00:48.680> for<00:00:49.680> shooting<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.460> only<00:00:50.730> difference<00:00:51.180> is

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
size for shooting the only difference is

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.569 
size for shooting the only difference is
right<00:00:52.260> there<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.680> can<00:00:52.829> see<00:00:53.010> they're<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> little

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
right there you can see they're a little

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.660 
right there you can see they're a little
bit<00:00:53.820> more<00:00:53.850> bouncy<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:55.320> not<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.739> lot<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.340> it's

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
bit more bouncy it's not a lot but it's

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.639 
bit more bouncy it's not a lot but it's
just<00:00:56.789> if<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.969> hit<00:00:57.180> something<00:00:57.570> or<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.559> know

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
just if you hit something or if you know

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.080 
just if you hit something or if you know
it's<00:00:58.800> moving<00:00:58.949> at<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> fast<00:00:59.430> pace<00:00:59.550> it'll<00:00:59.910> bounce

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
it's moving at a fast pace it'll bounce

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.220 
it's moving at a fast pace it'll bounce
a<00:01:00.270> little<00:01:00.420> bit<00:01:00.510> more<00:01:00.660> than<00:01:00.780> regular<00:01:00.899> puck

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
a little bit more than regular puck

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.330 
a little bit more than regular puck
that's<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.530> only<00:01:01.680> thing<00:01:01.829> you'll<00:01:01.920> notice

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
really easy to track and I'm using a

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.600 
really easy to track and I'm using a
super<00:01:10.409> shooter<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:10.979> returning<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> puck

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610
