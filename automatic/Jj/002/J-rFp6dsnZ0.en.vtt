car when I got them I just never
replaced<00:04:43.400> them<00:04:43.580> with<00:04:43.610> OEM<00:04:44.060> these<00:04:44.870> are<00:04:45.110> the

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
replaced them with OEM these are the

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.440 
replaced them with OEM these are the
original<00:04:45.800> seats<00:04:46.070> that<00:04:46.580> were<00:04:46.729> in<00:04:46.850> the<00:04:46.970> car<00:04:47.180> you

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
original seats that were in the car you

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.089 
original seats that were in the car you
can<00:04:47.479> see<00:04:47.600> they're<00:04:47.900> in<00:04:48.020> very<00:04:48.260> good<00:04:49.100> condition

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
can see they're in very good condition

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:53.620 
can see they're in very good condition
the<00:04:52.099> only<00:04:52.250> bad<00:04:52.430> part<00:04:52.460> is<00:04:52.880> that<00:04:53.030> speaker<00:04:53.390> cover

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
the only bad part is that speaker cover

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.610 
the only bad part is that speaker cover
has<00:04:53.840> coming<00:04:54.050> off<00:04:54.260> and

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
it is and I'm going to fix it my torque

actually<00:05:17.870> what<00:05:17.990> attaches<00:05:18.440> to<00:05:18.650> it<00:05:19.990> as<00:05:20.990> you<00:05:21.050> can

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
actually what attaches to it as you can

see the paint line is right here from
the<00:05:24.800> paint<00:05:25.010> job<00:05:25.250> I<00:05:25.520> had<00:05:25.820> this<00:05:26.000> shot<00:05:26.300> at<00:05:26.660> a<00:05:27.260> Mako

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
the paint job I had this shot at a Mako

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.590 
the paint job I had this shot at a Mako
in<00:05:28.100> hatboro<00:05:28.760> Pennsylvania<00:05:30.880> this<00:05:31.880> car<00:05:32.210> the<00:05:32.570> I

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
in hatboro Pennsylvania this car the I

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.070 
in hatboro Pennsylvania this car the I
wrought<00:05:33.050> iron<00:05:33.320> II<00:05:33.590> and<00:05:33.740> this<00:05:33.919> is<00:05:34.100> that<00:05:35.080> right

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
wrought iron II and this is that right

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.170 
wrought iron II and this is that right
after<00:05:36.260> the<00:05:36.500> car<00:05:36.710> was<00:05:36.740> painted<00:05:37.639> three<00:05:37.970> days

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
after the car was painted three days

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.800 
after the car was painted three days
later<00:05:38.479> I<00:05:38.630> got<00:05:38.870> rear-ended<00:05:40.419> this<00:05:41.419> pretty

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
later I got rear-ended this pretty

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.180 
later I got rear-ended this pretty
severe<00:05:42.320> it<00:05:42.919> was<00:05:42.979> enough<00:05:43.430> to<00:05:44.800> tweak<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:45.979> frame

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
severe it was enough to tweak the frame

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.210 
severe it was enough to tweak the frame
of<00:05:46.400> it<00:05:46.750> as<00:05:47.750> you<00:05:47.930> can<00:05:48.020> see<00:05:48.199> how<00:05:48.350> close<00:05:48.710> that<00:05:49.160> is

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
of it as you can see how close that is

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.820 
of it as you can see how close that is
there<00:05:49.669> and<00:05:49.970> if<00:05:50.120> you<00:05:50.240> follow<00:05:50.510> it<00:05:50.660> over<00:05:50.990> to<00:05:51.740> the

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
there and if you follow it over to the

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.460 
there and if you follow it over to the
other<00:05:51.979> side<00:05:52.660> you<00:05:53.660> can<00:05:53.690> see<00:05:53.840> that<00:05:54.050> it's<00:05:54.380> a

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
other side you can see that it's a

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.029 
other side you can see that it's a
little<00:05:54.680> gap<00:05:55.270> the<00:05:56.270> deck<00:05:56.449> lid<00:05:56.690> needs<00:05:57.650> an

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 
little gap the deck lid needs an

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:00.520 
little gap the deck lid needs an
adjustment<00:05:58.580> and<00:05:59.389> it'll<00:05:59.960> come<00:06:00.139> right<00:06:00.200> up

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
adjustment and it'll come right up

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.279 
adjustment and it'll come right up
because<00:06:00.650> um<00:06:01.130> if<00:06:01.580> you<00:06:01.789> see<00:06:01.970> here<00:06:02.210> it's<00:06:02.419> you<00:06:03.169> can

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
because um if you see here it's you can

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:06.159 
because um if you see here it's you can
see<00:06:03.470> my<00:06:03.620> finger<00:06:03.979> drop<00:06:04.250> off<00:06:04.490> so<00:06:05.000> it<00:06:05.720> just<00:06:05.960> needs

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
see my finger drop off so it just needs

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:09.430 
see my finger drop off so it just needs
to<00:06:06.380> have<00:06:06.500> the<00:06:06.680> deck<00:06:06.860> lid<00:06:07.039> pulled<00:06:07.370> back<00:06:08.440> and

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
to have the deck lid pulled back and

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.430 
to have the deck lid pulled back and
then<00:06:09.620> everything<00:06:10.039> will<00:06:10.160> be<00:06:10.250> fine<00:06:10.460> but<00:06:11.440> after

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
then everything will be fine but after

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.629 
then everything will be fine but after
the<00:06:12.830> car<00:06:13.010> was<00:06:13.840> hit<00:06:14.840> what<00:06:15.169> I<00:06:15.200> opted<00:06:15.650> to<00:06:15.680> reshoot

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 
the car was hit what I opted to reshoot

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:19.659 
the car was hit what I opted to reshoot
the<00:06:16.849> car<00:06:17.030> again<00:06:17.770> so<00:06:18.770> that's<00:06:19.099> where<00:06:19.280> it<00:06:19.370> got<00:06:19.520> the

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
the car again so that's where it got the

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.060 
the car again so that's where it got the
heavier<00:06:19.940> base<00:06:20.300> coat<00:06:20.570> clear<00:06:20.750> coat<00:06:20.870> finish<00:06:21.470> and

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
heavier base coat clear coat finish and

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:27.279 
heavier base coat clear coat finish and
the<00:06:23.060> only<00:06:23.210> other<00:06:23.419> the<00:06:23.930> only<00:06:24.110> hiccup<00:06:24.860> that<00:06:26.289> it

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:27.289 
the only other the only hiccup that it

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:30.480 
the only other the only hiccup that it
had<00:06:27.590> from<00:06:28.190> that<00:06:28.430> was<00:06:28.760> it<00:06:29.419> had<00:06:29.599> a<00:06:29.630> paint<00:06:30.020> run

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
had from that was it had a paint run

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.150 
had from that was it had a paint run
right<00:06:31.490> here

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
right here

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.240 
right here
so<00:06:34.330> unfortunately<00:06:35.330> not<00:06:36.229> much<00:06:36.440> you<00:06:36.949> can<00:06:37.099> do<00:06:37.220> a

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
so unfortunately not much you can do a

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.659 
so unfortunately not much you can do a
lot<00:06:37.460> of<00:06:37.490> it<00:06:37.669> you<00:06:37.760> can<00:06:37.880> see<00:06:38.030> the<00:06:38.180> run<00:06:38.419> and<00:06:39.669> you

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:40.669 
lot of it you can see the run and you

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:42.820 
lot of it you can see the run and you
know<00:06:41.660> I<00:06:41.690> mean<00:06:41.870> it<00:06:42.020> could<00:06:42.169> have<00:06:42.199> been<00:06:42.289> fix<00:06:42.680> we

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
know I mean it could have been fix we

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.170 
know I mean it could have been fix we
could<00:06:43.010> have<00:06:43.099> reshot<00:06:43.400> the<00:06:43.430> bumper<00:06:43.880> but<00:06:44.060> then

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
could have reshot the bumper but then

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.540 
could have reshot the bumper but then
we're<00:06:44.330> back<00:06:44.479> to<00:06:44.539> square<00:06:44.690> one<00:06:45.110> on<00:06:45.260> how<00:06:45.500> it<00:06:45.710> would

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
we're back to square one on how it would

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.350 
we're back to square one on how it would
have<00:06:46.699> looked<00:06:48.610> alright<00:06:49.610> so<00:06:49.849> let's<00:06:50.030> open<00:06:50.120> the

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
have looked alright so let's open the

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.479 
have looked alright so let's open the
hood
