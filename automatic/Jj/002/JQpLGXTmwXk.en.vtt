 This is a little different for protecting an anus 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.820

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:34.190

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:52.200
 First of all this day 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:58.040
 First of all this key 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.040
 Let's go out and say love and play love 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.800

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.729
 Well this guy 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.729
 As we stab here 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.010
 I think that going to the 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.220
 I feel like this 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.220
 so 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.700
 Eccho 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.230
 My head is a little big 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.100
 Ne 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.280
 Yes 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:28.770
 The 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:32.509
 I 'm sorry I bought last time last time 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.509
 Something of the last time 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:42.200
 Is that that last time 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:44.200
 I guess's gonna to enjoy even the most lottery did not buy people 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.480
 Let's compare a little 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.660
 This is the previous one 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.180
 Thing 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:55.250
 And here is 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:58.620
 It as this time of the flame or composition thing is with roughly 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:03.479
 I think that some colors are lighter 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:06.810
 Oh, I feel that the same thing is the same when I look completely from the side 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:11.850
 I 'm looking at it, but I think it's my woman after all 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:17.040
 Eyes I'm kinda here towards the previous Gachotto friendly name but here is a little Kiritsu 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:18.749
 And I know a little bit I know I'm a little bit more new 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.930
 It is new important here 

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:25.360
 Yes 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:27.060
 It's a little different, even if you say that hairstyles are almost together 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.040
 I feel like b 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.910
 Almost together 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:35.910
 Most Ishi' 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:40.260
 It Jan' something not it all together 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:43.860
 Now try a little bit now and in terms of quality 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:46.069
 Koch also newer a bit of tacker 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.069
 Boo 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.710
 Is it alright 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.420
 I wonder what about 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:55.440
 Disagreeable 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:59.820
 Quality still is ne older of Koch 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:01.510
 Kill is a bit of a quality you like this, but the quality is 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:05.560
 Here is a little 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:08.620
 It is higher, and it moves as 600 yen is discovered here . 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.169
 I think that is probably the difference 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.639
 somehow 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:16.599
 There seems to be one more 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:21.210
 Child of another one is also part of this is already reflected in 

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:21.210
 This jaguar gon is original kan
