1990s about where people who are coming
forth<00:00:08.750> with<00:00:09.049> memories<00:00:10.040> of<00:00:10.070> childhood<00:00:10.280> sexual

abuse recovering repressed memories or
were<00:00:14.240> they<00:00:14.449> creating<00:00:15.170> false<00:00:15.410> memories<00:00:15.860> and<00:00:16.060> I

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
were they creating false memories and I

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
were they creating false memories and I
you<00:00:17.300> know<00:00:17.330> I<00:00:17.420> think<00:00:17.539> our<00:00:17.840> current

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
you know I think our current

you know I think our current
understanding<00:00:18.289> on<00:00:19.039> this<00:00:19.190> is<00:00:19.429> is<00:00:19.789> that<00:00:20.240> it<00:00:20.660> was

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:20.839 
understanding on this is is that it was

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:22.540 
understanding on this is is that it was
a<00:00:20.869> little<00:00:21.140> bit<00:00:21.349> of<00:00:21.470> both<00:00:21.679> but<00:00:22.009> there<00:00:22.490> were

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
a little bit of both but there were

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.269 
a little bit of both but there were
certain<00:00:22.820> Oh<00:00:22.880> certainly<00:00:23.419> a<00:00:23.660> lot<00:00:23.839> of<00:00:23.990> false

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
certain Oh certainly a lot of false

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.460 
certain Oh certainly a lot of false
memory<00:00:25.279> creation<00:00:25.820> going<00:00:26.359> on<00:00:26.660> that<00:00:27.080> a<00:00:27.109> lot<00:00:27.410> of

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
memory creation going on that a lot of

few years that a bunch of us have been
doing<00:00:51.230> on<00:00:51.410> the<00:00:51.800> relationship<00:00:52.370> between<00:00:52.519> memory

and imagination that that's really about

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.310 
and imagination that that's really about
the<00:00:55.550> last<00:00:55.820> thing<00:00:56.090> you<00:00:56.210> would<00:00:56.329> ever<00:00:56.480> will<00:00:56.690> want

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
to do in searching for memories just

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.360 
to do in searching for memories just
give<00:01:00.019> someone<00:01:00.350> free<00:01:00.829> range<00:01:01.039> of<00:01:01.250> their

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
and they were it became also competitive

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.430 
and they were it became also competitive
thing<00:01:59.180> because<00:01:59.330> that's<00:01:59.510> what<00:01:59.720> does<00:01:59.930> story<00:02:00.260> for

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
thing because that's what does story for

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.710 
thing because that's what does story for
several<00:02:01.250> weeks<00:02:01.280> I<00:02:01.730> went<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:01.970> several<00:02:02.210> therapy

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
several weeks I went to several therapy

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.050 
several weeks I went to several therapy
sessions<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.680> merciless<00:02:04.580> became

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
sessions the merciless became

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.780 
sessions the merciless became
competitive<00:02:05.480> with<00:02:05.840> each<00:02:05.930> other

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
competitive with each other

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.510 
competitive with each other
it<00:02:07.540> was<00:02:07.720> it<00:02:07.870> was<00:02:08.140> extra<00:02:08.530> practice<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:09.040> lot<00:02:09.340> of

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
it was it was extra practice a lot of

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.890 
it was it was extra practice a lot of
times<00:02:09.700> I<00:02:09.850> think<00:02:09.910> therapy<00:02:10.630> can<00:02:11.590> overdo<00:02:12.070> it<00:02:12.100> and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
times I think therapy can overdo it and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.510 
times I think therapy can overdo it and
certainly<00:02:13.900> with<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.320> sexual<00:02:14.620> abuse<00:02:14.740> case<00:02:15.130> yes

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
certainly with the sexual abuse case yes

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.510 
certainly with the sexual abuse case yes
I<00:02:15.790> think<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:16.210> yes<00:02:16.890> these<00:02:17.890> memories<00:02:18.310> can<00:02:18.490> be

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
I think that yes these memories can be

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.790 
I think that yes these memories can be
encouraged<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:20.380> know<00:02:20.470> it's<00:02:20.620> interesting

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
encouraged and you know it's interesting

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.420 
encouraged and you know it's interesting
that<00:02:21.690> looking<00:02:22.690> back<00:02:22.720> on<00:02:22.960> some<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.770> therapy

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
that looking back on some of the therapy

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.120 
that looking back on some of the therapy
from<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.760> 90s<00:02:25.240> one<00:02:25.840> one<00:02:26.320> of<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.530> things<00:02:26.800> very

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
from the 90s one one of the things very

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.800 
from the 90s one one of the things very
relevant<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.610> our<00:02:27.670> conversation<00:02:27.880> today<00:02:28.510> that

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
relevant to our conversation today that

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.830 
relevant to our conversation today that
at<00:02:28.990> least<00:02:29.170> some<00:02:29.290> therapists<00:02:30.570> encouraged<00:02:31.570> in

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
at least some therapists encouraged in

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.800 
at least some therapists encouraged in
the<00:02:32.590> search<00:02:32.920> for<00:02:33.450> memories<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:34.690> they

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
the search for memories that they

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.420 
the search for memories that they
thought<00:02:34.990> were<00:02:35.200> repressed<00:02:35.530> with<00:02:35.770> reviewing

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
thought were repressed with reviewing

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.090 
thought were repressed with reviewing
old<00:02:36.700> photographs<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:38.380> that<00:02:38.590> gets<00:02:38.800> back

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
old photographs and so that gets back

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.820 
old photographs and so that gets back
into<00:02:39.400> our<00:02:39.730> earlier<00:02:40.570> discussion<00:02:41.170> yet<00:02:41.320> they<00:02:41.500> can

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
into our earlier discussion yet they can

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.540 
into our earlier discussion yet they can
act<00:02:42.070> as<00:02:42.220> retrieval<00:02:42.820> cues<00:02:43.090> sometimes<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:44.550> help

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
act as retrieval cues sometimes to help

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
act as retrieval cues sometimes to help
you<00:02:45.670> recall<00:02:46.209> something<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:47.459> that<00:02:48.570> actually

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
you recall something that that actually

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.150 
you recall something that that actually
happened<00:02:49.900> that<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.050> don't<00:02:50.200> remember<00:02:50.440> but<00:02:50.860> as

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
happened that you don't remember but as

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.330 
happened that you don't remember but as
we<00:02:51.430> saw<00:02:51.640> in<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:51.970> slime<00:02:52.560> experiment<00:02:53.560> just<00:02:54.160> the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
we saw in the slime experiment just the

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.340 
we saw in the slime experiment just the
presence<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:55.030> photograph<00:02:55.570> for<00:02:55.780> reasons<00:02:56.170> we

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
presence of a photograph for reasons we

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.320 
presence of a photograph for reasons we
don't<00:02:56.380> really<00:02:56.980> understand<00:02:57.520> can<00:02:57.760> because<00:02:58.209> it

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
don't really understand can because it

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.880 
don't really understand can because it
wasn't<00:02:58.660> even<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.930> photograph<00:02:59.380> of<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.650> firm

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
wasn't even a photograph of the firm

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.740 
wasn't even a photograph of the firm
that's<00:03:00.640> right<00:03:00.850> it<00:03:00.940> wasn't<00:03:01.090> even<00:03:01.270> a<00:03:01.390> photograph

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
that's right it wasn't even a photograph

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.600 
that's right it wasn't even a photograph
of<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.989> Slimers<00:03:02.260> up<00:03:02.590> just<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:02.980> photograph<00:03:03.430> that

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
of the Slimers up just a photograph that

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.760 
of the Slimers up just a photograph that
related<00:03:04.300> to<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.540> context<00:03:05.260> that<00:03:05.290> somehow<00:03:05.739> it

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
related to the context that somehow it

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.949 
related to the context that somehow it
liberated<00:03:08.770> these<00:03:08.980> people<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.820> feel<00:03:10.390> as<00:03:10.750> well

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
liberated these people to feel as well

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.900 
liberated these people to feel as well
can<00:03:11.290> you<00:03:11.380> can<00:03:11.560> you<00:03:11.620> imagine<00:03:11.860> what<00:03:12.130> suggestive

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
can you can you imagine what suggestive

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.270 
can you can you imagine what suggestive
therapy<00:03:13.390> exactly<00:03:14.230> especially<00:03:14.650> if<00:03:15.160> it

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
therapy exactly especially if it

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.750 
therapy exactly especially if it
involves<00:03:15.700> physical<00:03:16.420> touching<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:18.160> know<00:03:18.310> for

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
involves physical touching you know for

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.550 
involves physical touching you know for
children<00:03:19.180> yes<00:03:20.010> so<00:03:21.010> I<00:03:21.489> think<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.600> photography

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
children yes so I think the photography

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.250 
children yes so I think the photography
is<00:03:23.680> relevant<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.190> that<00:03:24.549> that<00:03:25.260> contentious

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
is relevant to that that contentious

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.810 
is relevant to that that contentious
issue<00:03:26.440> which<00:03:26.739> thankfully<00:03:27.100> now<00:03:27.400> has<00:03:27.580> kind<00:03:27.790> of

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
issue which thankfully now has kind of

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.060 
issue which thankfully now has kind of
died<00:03:28.030> down
