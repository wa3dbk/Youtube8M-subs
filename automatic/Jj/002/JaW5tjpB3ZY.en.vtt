 our spring edition of in fesche 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:13.230
 today we are looking for the best 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.600
 incidental to the world namely jewelry 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.760
 Our guest today is in fashion 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.980
 lifestyle and accessories of course 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.079
 absolute full professional model and 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.310
 presenter for welcome here rebecca 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.019
 what role does the jewelry play in 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.789
 your life is just the outfit and 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.230
 then the jewelry or vice versa so me 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.539
 find jewelry has often been very 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.460
 revalue and one says so even when 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.750
 summer girls best friends and find 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.399
 just like accessories and jewelry 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.710
 belong to a woman you feel 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.810
 in it well and especially if she is now yes 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.340
 I like that summer too 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.390
 very much because it is so fresh 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.400
 how is it with you at home? 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.870
 Do you drag jewelery everywhere because you 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.340
 have also much travel you have there 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.140
 maybe an orderly giant jewelry 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.820
 Regal you have much at all is around 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.830
 just what was really there that was nice 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.990
 Everything arranged I had such a nice box 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.060
 with such a small corner in it and then 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.010
 sometime when I started 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.900
 can somehow pack everything in such a way 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.250
 a bag in and now one 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.480
 a little knot everything sometimes 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.549
 a bit difficult, we are so 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.580
 dressed a bit pastel because 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.920
 that is in fashion in any case 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.080
 fashion picture exactly and in terms of trends 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.140
 The jewelry looks similar so I 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.610
 would say very light and floret 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.979
 butterflies it is so style 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.750
 Daisies can still grow like that 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.820
 from before so I do not love you 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.380
 I always have to think about it that way 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.570
 such a nice feeling you wear it 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.040
 like and it just looks really great 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.570
 out and therefore still has his 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.800
 lightness to the beautiful too 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.930
 combine as I have here for me 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.130
 for example, two rings on top of each other and 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.140
 I think it just will not be too much 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.119
 So you can also carry several things 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.119
 here on the bracelet you can see that too 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.800
 you combine great and that's it 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.020
 just to be faithful to every one 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.210
 fall a trend theme which topics otherwise 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.500
 are still in the full thrust and the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.440
 spring of the sky alike 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.180
 and your personal heart story 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.509
 In terms of jewelry , we save ourselves for 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.100
 to be the conclusion to her dear 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.940
 by my side is now beating expert 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.740
 haider al 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.509
 what if that must-have for now 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.330
 This season in terms of jewelry 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.950
 this early there are three what booklet 1 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.690
 Of that, things are a lot of glitter anyway 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.860
 bright colors and on the other 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.870
 side and the trend is already 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.280
 that has been enforced for some time 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.800
 The materials are gold and silver 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.150
 mix with each other like coal 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.010
 beautiful combination result in brand 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.520
 unbelievably portable is the second big one 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.390
 trend 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.540
 this is about bracelets here helps 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.459
 and in that case there are several fine ones 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.650
 bracelets together one already 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.900
 but give a bit of a romantic look 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.000
 also very cool come on that is young 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.290
 it is fresh and it distracts 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.400
 Attention, of course, then out 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.200
 wrist work only massive 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.090
 gold and solid sterling silver and 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.830
 then with stones that will be together 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.480
 combined and hand made and that 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.040
 makes the charm on the value of 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.440
 Product from the third trend we 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.120
 So if I'm allowed to say so 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.040
 I thought earlier that's too much 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.959
 year chain earrings and rings 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.430
 but that is actually a trend now 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.140
 that is absolutely in it and you see 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.239
 also many caner schmitt so one 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.790
 a little bit winter with it 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.260
 of course, also brings that modern that 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.340
 you make a bigger order 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.720
 even if you are just a bit 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.010
 would like to make it more elegant and chic 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.299
 you can get an incredibly nice picture 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.030
 can achieve this very much 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.640
 feel good and also very complete 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.349
 he tells stories in general 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.879
 a lot more for you in the company 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.140
 more and now it will be a lot 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.390
 much more stories are told 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.260
 i would like to train employees and we 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.180
 this year will be our store network 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.560
 double and that means we buy 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.200
 many new employees are in total 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.150
 more than 400 and my job is natural 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.650
 these stories are also shared by these employees 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.750
 to tell about the product one 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.939
 a saleswoman at hannover maybe 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.409
 that's also her dream job, my love rebecca 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:45.629

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.129
 how do you know that earlier I have so 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.319

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.819

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.230

 the butterfly variant in Leipzig 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.019
 quite as much better yet 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:15.660
 so much color is inside too 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.380
 or here as a small letter envelope with 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.380
 the heart 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.010
 the return is a serious case 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.889
 beautiful 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.270
 we give away but probably is 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.010
 There is also a ring in your life 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.389
 to do with the man in my life 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.800
 has or how do you come from? 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.740
 So I have my engagement ring here 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.570
 I was very close to my heart but me 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.160
 must say so in general already can 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.449
 you are so beautiful give away 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.979
 always with such a special moment 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.630
 connected is indeed a real one 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.520
 glamor-girl are also on the way a lot 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.000
 and there of course blink blinks 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.930
 give big euro 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.100
 even if somehow on the red 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.620
 carpet you have to go there 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.120
 Take off a bit and he has to be there too 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.190
 bit radiant next to the dress 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.230
 that's a bit more 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.700
 I think I am here now 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.580
 also for example two chains 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.720
 it is now combined with each other 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.820
 of course, nowhere where I am now 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.930
 during the day a cocktail dress with two 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.580
 chains would run around 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.840
 but if you run out piece by evening 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.760
 I want you can arrange that too 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.470
 I think so synonymous to everyone 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.030
 case, we are the jewelry expired 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.860
 a piece of jewelry that still knew 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.800
 At some point beware that the wedding ring away 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.090
