 they will enter with coins or bills the 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.239
 drivers will not have to collect the 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.609
 money the income will be made with a 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.440
 smart card that can be used 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.620
 in the different types of transport 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.800
 buses and transmilenio additionally the 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.230
 stp will divide the city into 13 zones what 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.160
 that will allow better mobility within 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.160
 her 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.619
 Hey, let me explain, I told you that I 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.600
 good tale story as he says 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.940
 today there is the integrated system of 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.820
 public transport and I'm easy to use 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.740
 what I 'm going to explain 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.360
 accompany me friends to understand the 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.479
 integrated public transport system 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.190
 The first step is to learn to enter the 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.350
 system there are currently three 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.780
 cards for entering the system 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.970
 the red card the blue card and the 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.009
 green card and red card 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.650
 Blue card only allows the 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.810
 entry to phase 1 and 2 of the system 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.149
 while their green card 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.780
 allow entry only to the phase 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:43.270
 3 hey pilot you forget additionally 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.729
 smart cards are recharged 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.770
 with money and not with trips of this 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.899
 way any balance you have the 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.940
 you can recover and reuse with the 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.070
 next recharge and if the card does not 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.940
 has balance the system will not hold it 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.550
 so in this way you can recharge it in 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.460
 serious you always trimming melo everything already 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.100
 I told you is my presentation the cards 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.080
 in the future they will be obligatory for the 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.869
 entrance the trunk busses of the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.060
 system please do not forget it besides 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.580
 the charge is made in the environment of passing the 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.890
 ie turnstile are valid to the 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.600
 entrance there are special rates in 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.610
 'valley hours' preferential rates 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.350
 for people in condition or 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.840
 disability situation and for the 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.660
 Elderly 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.910
 in those you are absolutely right but for 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.340
 Where are you taking us? I think it's going to make us 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.890
 lose do not go back to the trunk 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.930
 26th street until providing the gold is 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.640
 It is necessary to change at the moment 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.860
 We were born in the station is avenue 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.660
 jimÃ©nez and third millennium and really 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:49.049
 there will be more seasons and what laziness 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.900
 look at that row so long that there is no 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.090
 let's get there never that end not 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.790
 it's so long if you respect the ranks 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.860
 you'll see how you can move super fast 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.470
 keep in mind that the system 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.019
 it works if we remember to let it out 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.599
 first is to enter faster all 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.430
 ordered we are part of the system are 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.170
 much needed culture norms 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.540
 citizen to enter the system 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.000
 in this way we will collaborate so that the 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.950
 service is agile and efficient with 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.530
 respect for the yellow line leaves 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.750
 close the doors of the stations 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.129
 always enter through the official entrance 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.900
 allow to leave first and circulate 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.450
 always on the right all of us 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.549
 we will mobilize much better inside the bus 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.810
 you find some red chairs and some 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.580
 blue chairs 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.930
 the blue chips are a priority for 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.180
 the people in condition of 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.130

 red are like for you and for me 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.959
 yes pilot're absolutely right 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.260
 you should always give the chair to people 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:51.180
 in situation or condition of disability 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.819
 pregnant women and people of the 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.050
 senior citizens do not have to do 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:01.110
 asleep or the crazy ones is simply 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:03.810
 citizen culture the s &amp; p integrates buses 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.870
 by the trunk feeder routes the 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.989
 urban bus the complementary bus and the 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.140

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.700
 Tenth race if we all collaborate will be 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.790
 much simpler about the system 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.470
