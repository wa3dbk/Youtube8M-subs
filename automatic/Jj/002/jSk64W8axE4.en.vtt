00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
now I will try to sandwich the five of

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.900 
now I will try to sandwich the five of
spades<00:00:49.359> in<00:00:49.780> between<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.260> two<00:00:50.469> jokers<00:00:50.980> like<00:00:51.640> so

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
spades in between the two jokers like so

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.299 
spades in between the two jokers like so
but<00:00:52.510> this<00:00:52.929> way<00:00:53.170> to<00:00:53.230> sandwich<00:00:53.769> the<00:00:53.890> count<00:00:54.129> would

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
but this way to sandwich the count would

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.790 
but this way to sandwich the count would
be<00:00:54.429> too<00:00:54.609> easy<00:00:54.640> so<00:00:55.300> I<00:00:55.690> will<00:00:56.079> try<00:00:56.320> to<00:00:56.350> sandwich

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
be too easy so I will try to sandwich

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.560 
be too easy so I will try to sandwich
the<00:00:56.920> card<00:00:57.190> in<00:00:57.399> between<00:00:57.699> the<00:00:57.760> two<00:00:57.910> jokers<00:00:58.329> in<00:00:58.510> a

different<00:00:58.899> way<00:00:59.050> so<00:00:59.739> first<00:00:59.949> of<00:01:00.070> all<00:01:00.160> I'm<00:01:00.280> going

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
different way so first of all I'm going

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.060 
different way so first of all I'm going
to<00:01:00.929> place<00:01:01.929> the<00:01:02.109> five<00:01:02.320> of<00:01:02.499> spades<00:01:02.620> in<00:01:02.980> the

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
because this forecasts are facing up

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.160 
because this forecasts are facing up

into all the cows are facing down so
there<00:03:08.769> is<00:03:08.860> going<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.160> be<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.340> little<00:03:10.060> gap

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
there is going to be a little gap

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.810 
there is going to be a little gap
because<00:03:11.019> of<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.290> band<00:03:11.500> of<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.739> cats<00:03:11.980> so<00:03:12.580> just
