be doing all day today and what I've
already<00:00:34.710> started<00:00:34.950> doing<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:36.090> pull<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
already started doing I just pull the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
already started doing I just pull the
weeds<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.140> leave<00:00:37.320> them<00:00:37.440> right<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.770> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
weeds and I leave them right on the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.229 
weeds and I leave them right on the
ground<00:00:38.040> as<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> mulch<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.640> they<00:00:38.760> do<00:00:38.820> they<00:00:39.120> have

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
ground as a mulch and they do they have

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.880 
ground as a mulch and they do they have
so<00:00:39.450> many<00:00:39.510> benefits<00:00:40.050> as<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> mulch<00:00:40.440> rather<00:00:40.710> than

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
so many benefits as a mulch rather than

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.590 
so many benefits as a mulch rather than
taking<00:00:41.160> them<00:00:41.309> away<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.790> they<00:00:42.180> disappear

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
taking them away and they disappear

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.360 
taking them away and they disappear
within<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.899> couple<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.500> weeks<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.890> just<00:00:43.950> become

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
within a couple of weeks and just become

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.279 
within a couple of weeks and just become
part<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.940> soil<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.809> i'll<00:00:45.930> be<00:00:46.020> doing<00:00:46.110> that

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
part of the soil so i'll be doing that

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.930 
part of the soil so i'll be doing that
today<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.710> then<00:00:46.800> i'll<00:00:46.860> be<00:00:46.950> fertilizing<00:00:47.489> for

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
today and then i'll be fertilizing for

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.819 
today and then i'll be fertilizing for
fertilizing<00:00:48.329> i<00:00:48.600> use<00:00:48.960> my<00:00:49.170> hose<00:00:49.410> end<00:00:49.620> sprayer

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
fertilizing i use my hose end sprayer

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.770 
fertilizing i use my hose end sprayer
which<00:00:50.430> i<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.700> just<00:00:50.820> attach<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.239> hose<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.480> it

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
which i can just attach a hose to it

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.360 
which i can just attach a hose to it
makes<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.170> really<00:00:52.350> easy<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.860> fertilize<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
makes it really easy to fertilize the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.279 
makes it really easy to fertilize the
whole<00:00:53.520> garden<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.000> as<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.719> guys<00:00:54.750> know<00:00:54.899> if<00:00:55.199> you

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
whole garden and as you guys know if you

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.260 
whole garden and as you guys know if you
follow<00:00:55.590> me<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.579> few<00:00:56.789> products<00:00:57.180> I

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
follow me I have a few products I

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.270 
follow me I have a few products I
regularly<00:00:57.480> use<00:00:57.930> for<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.500> effective

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
regularly use for that so effective

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.790 
regularly use for that so effective
microorganisms<00:00:59.399> or<00:01:00.359> SCD<00:01:00.989> probiotics<00:01:01.710> which

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
microorganisms or SCD probiotics which

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.680 
microorganisms or SCD probiotics which
is<00:01:02.039> like<00:01:02.160> bringing<00:01:02.609> these<00:01:03.210> beneficial

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
is like bringing these beneficial

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.810 
is like bringing these beneficial
microorganisms<00:01:03.989> into<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> garden<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.100> along

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
microorganisms into the garden and along

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.109 
microorganisms into the garden and along
with<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.090> some<00:01:06.890> more<00:01:07.890> nutrition<00:01:08.760> like<00:01:08.939> more

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
with that some more nutrition like more

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.750 
with that some more nutrition like more
fertilizers<00:01:09.810> such<00:01:10.049> as<00:01:10.560> liquid<00:01:10.920> seaweed<00:01:11.400> and

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
fertilizers such as liquid seaweed and

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.850 
fertilizers such as liquid seaweed and
very<00:01:12.240> concentrated<00:01:12.630> ocean<00:01:13.290> water<00:01:13.500> and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
very concentrated ocean water and

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.039 
very concentrated ocean water and
molasses<00:01:14.790> goes<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.150> here<00:01:15.360> too<00:01:15.540> because<00:01:15.840> it

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
molasses goes in here too because it

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.160 
molasses goes in here too because it
feeds<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.759> microorganisms<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.020> makes<00:01:19.020> them

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
feeds the microorganisms and makes them

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.780 
feeds the microorganisms and makes them
happy<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:19.590> I'll<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.189> spraying<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.549> today
