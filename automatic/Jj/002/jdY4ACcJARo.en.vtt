00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.279
 the piano is one of my favorite instruments we are going to perform a pianist 

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:14.669
 he listed the following material a roller a wood stick from side one 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:20.119
 Modeling palette and plasticine black white red yellow breaks if it starts 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.220
 with a large piece of pink plasticine 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.849
 to model the body of the seated pianist follows the form that shows you in 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.500
 the screen warning well the surface prepares two bars of the same color and 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.320
 flat a little one of the ends to make the hands attached to the body 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.140
 joining the arms on the sides of the body 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.240
 but he has them on his back and he goes through all the joints with his fingers 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.550
 modeling palette make three cuts in each hand and round the fingers a 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.220
 little bit 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.780
 another small belly of the same color will help you make the nose use two 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.770
 white discs and two less points to make the eyes 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.220
 use a good piece of black plasticine and flattened a bit with the roller with the 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.280
 modeling palette trims a rectangle iquique the plasticine that you have left over 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.880
 follow the same procedure to make a larger square 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.680
 check that the rectangle and the square measure the same of the arch and nail 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.520
 in the middle of the square the end-to-end stick sticks into the 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.010
 black rectangle and review the joints with your fingers so you do not see 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.750
 together 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.670
 Now you can lift the piano and check that it is stable using two black bars and 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.720
 cut them with the modeling palette at the necessary height 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.890
 left under the keyboard of the piano to kick and remember to hoist 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.450
 the unions 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.630
 Use the white plasticine to prepare flattened bars and place them in 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.090
 fimo to form the piano keys 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.190
 Repeat the same thing with some smaller black chips and placed between the 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.960
 white keys prepares a white square and to the channel or with the roller 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.920
 cut out with the palette a rectangle little gallo in the middle half open 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.380
 again and perales some black lines to make the score 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.820
 with a black rectangle we will make its support a these pieces on the piano and 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.310
 uses four black bars or a rectangle of the same color to form 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.190
 the stool 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.280
 Even a red rectangle, make small fences with the pallet and place 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.080
 in the crossing two yellow balls to make the cushion of the stool if you can 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.160
 expose the pianist plays and the music starts playing
