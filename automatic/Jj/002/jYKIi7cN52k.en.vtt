00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:21.960
 and greet everyone knows skyrock 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.090
 how are things better today 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.180
 for a new sniper gameplay and 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.770
 this time mw3 to msr and so bah 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.969
 I do not have two scam faults yet 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.520
 again because I am 

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:34.170
 always sick and I can tell you that 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.850
 I do not necessarily have the mouth of the job 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.649
 in any case I really have a 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.640
 this is for the head of the sick more 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.600
 did about a week ago that I'm 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.879
 sick there I start to be a little 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.129
 tired so automatically that's it 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.179
 not really very presentable so I'm 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.489
 am saying i do not want to do any faith 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:48.480
 calm and but I had done this part 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.649
 live so I'll explain a little 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.179
 little for the little anecdote how that 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.129
 happened that part because at 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:55.140
 start i'm going to do a live 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.249
 exactly where I made a live with 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.179
 three sizes scary so I had used 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:01.109
 the she 118 the n 50 and the msr and on the 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.510
 first two parts I had so 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.220
 use it 118 and the sr and there 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.220
 had this guy there I 'm going to kill the cage 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.740
 i started that broke my balls 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.980
 but really break the balls super 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.090
 every time already and I see in assault 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.350
 that's why I play in assault 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.760
 because every time I played in 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.530
 Corsican call to specialists and each 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.820
 times he says stuck on his chopper and 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.800
 everything and that's thanks to that he was coming 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.090
 to distance me no I 'm listening to you I 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.100
 will play we associate I will try to 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.540
 put it to your own game is 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.650
 finally, that's really good 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.970
 well spent you'll see that the 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.440
 distance that I put was still 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.720
 crazy enough at the end of the match 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.280
 and so here it was really fooled me 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.330
 the balls I say I want to win it I 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.370
 want my revenge I'll put you the 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.170
 misery and that's why my goal is why 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.060
 I did not look at the layout just because 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.560
 that low as I am a little bit 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.000
 sick the live 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.670
 there are times it was I can you 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.330
 guarantee a little flat if not 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.370
 to say really boring 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.530
 merlin and I said to myself here is watching 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.750
 finally watch or listen at the same time 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.460
 anyway she yves where I'm talking 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.250
 not much is a little annoying 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.600
 it did not interest me too much 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.640
 that and I thought it was going to be 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.440
 a little bit boring so in the end I 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.910
 decided not to keep the live is from 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.590
 just keep that part there you are 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.550
 telling a little bit of anecdotes and I 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.620
 will tell you that I was really 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.090
 happy in the end because every time 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.500
 first part i was ahead i 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.240
 begins to learn the front on the 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.850
 score and as long as with saint tite 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.230
 95 forgiveness for the for fuckers it's 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.640
 not because they play at 6.95 that 's okay 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.590
 you let that happen to me too you're here 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.180
 you 95 but it's just because he has 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.950
 shit that says so had the balloons 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.000
 it's true that sometimes I managed the 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.410
 following a little bit easy 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.240
 I buy big words you can 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.220
 easily but you can imagine 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.630
 that it's not serious at all it's 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.459
 I 'm not going I 'm not going to say it's 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.200
 friendly since it's a lot of friends but 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.350
 you understand what I mean and 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.790
 well he farted me the excessive costs 95 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.410
 and I was there I never took the 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.180
 vence and each time and unlock his 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.370
 helicopter while the helicopter a double 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.510
 3.7 to big daub it's no he 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.000
 you will see that I will unlock it 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.290
 I believe twice 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.489
 I do not know if he did a single one that he 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.489
 finally have I tell myself about this 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.930
 part there I would have been in 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.420
 specialist I would surely have to win 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.290
 the same way except that actually 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.180
 it's something I forget 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.070
 really because after having ghost 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.400
 after with their satcom or I do not know 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.110
 what their placebo species of drones 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.850
 who finally gives you absolutely nothing 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.530
 it's true that I forget the effectiveness of the 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.750
 drone to know where is that all 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.860
 half locates thanks to that and especially in 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.110
 general melee is still enough 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.459
 violent so I think it's me too 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.110
 helped a lot to know where is that 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.150
 the enemy located to get to take a 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.290
 little bit advanced and finally a little bit 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.030
 of advanced one can already see that I am at 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.630
 1100 points and the second one ie 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.920
 the asshole at the tipp 95 asshole because 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.720
 that he just pissed me off 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.890
 it pissed me off and twice it's me 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.480
 passed in front of the nose but it's so 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.130
 annoying I mean when you're here you 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.680
 are you're almost to win you had to 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.540
 two they win and the guy he's you 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.720
 double but I mean a bit of 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.370
 curly hair I feel 1450 1450 and 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.920
 the guy eat that's the double it's 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.030
 so raging and so halal blow 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.610
 advance that I put was still 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.959
 Phenomenal enough and for that I found 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.790
 this gameplay finally been interesting 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.900
 that I did not want to keep live and that 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.450
 I wanted to explain a little bit of that because 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.310
 that I 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.050
 you guarantee that you would be asleep 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.459
 it was so boring but I 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.250
 almost falling asleep playing and 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.239
 it's true that it's not easy seen as 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.650
 am sick is that often times 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.459
 I have small hot flashes and 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.349
 where I feel like I have the 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.299
 menopause it is frankly unpleasant 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.320
 but in any case I thought he was 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.760
 interesting because I put them 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.440
 still we can say a sacred 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.229
 rust in the face because I put them 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.330
 a pretty phenomenal advance when you 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.250
 got to do 30 he's the second 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.600
 is there that says it maximum one can 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.400
 to say that there is still a challenge 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.950
 filled with a small update on demand 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.020
 with this msr which is frankly my 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.910
 favorite sniper on mw3 and anyway 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.800
 one of the snipers at the legendary call 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.880
 of duty which is really super great 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.530
 effective and so much fun 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.720
 in any case I hope you liked 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.040
 this gameplay there sorry if there is no faith 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.790
 range for my voice that it's true that 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.070
 I'm a little sick 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.360
 again anyway I hope that 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.620
 you liked it do not hesitate to leave a 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.880
 comment give your opinion all this in 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.840
 below the video a little green thumb 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.190
 also it's nice it's the 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.540
 reward for my part I leave you 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.830
 I wish an excellent day that 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.910
 of happiness that she is good thing and I 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.910
