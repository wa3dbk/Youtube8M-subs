then<00:00:00.709> first<00:00:01.709> we<00:00:02.220> have<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.520> mark<00:00:02.790> see<00:00:03.799> anywhere

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
then first we have to mark see anywhere

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.990 
then first we have to mark see anywhere
on<00:00:05.009> this<00:00:05.190> line<00:00:05.390> I'll<00:00:06.390> mark<00:00:06.779> this<00:00:07.350> as<00:00:07.589> C<00:00:08.000> then

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
on this line I'll mark this as C then

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.390 
on this line I'll mark this as C then
first<00:00:09.750> we<00:00:09.960> have<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.230> take<00:00:10.410> this<00:00:10.620> distance<00:00:10.920> and

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
first we have to take this distance and

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.230 
first we have to take this distance and
Here<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.450> am<00:00:12.480> getting<00:00:13.049> here<00:00:13.380> as<00:00:13.620> 22mm<00:00:14.670> so<00:00:15.389> same

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
Here I am getting here as 22mm so same

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.189 
Here I am getting here as 22mm so same
cd1<00:00:18.240> distance<00:00:18.600> we<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.960> take<00:00:19.140> C<00:00:21.199> cd1

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
cd1 distance we have to take C cd1

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.300 
cd1 distance we have to take C cd1
distance<00:00:22.560> will<00:00:22.710> be<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:24.170> 22mm<00:00:26.570> so<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.869> will<00:00:28.050> be

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
distance will be a 22mm so this will be

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.269 
distance will be a 22mm so this will be
D<00:00:29.310> 1<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.730> will<00:00:29.820> draw<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.720> locals<00:00:31.230> line<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:32.070> can

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
D 1 I will draw a locals line you can

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.930 
D 1 I will draw a locals line you can
see<00:00:32.460> locals<00:00:33.030> line<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.440> parallel<00:00:34.440> line<00:00:34.649> 2<00:00:34.940> XY

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
see locals line is a parallel line 2 XY

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.760 
see locals line is a parallel line 2 XY
line<00:00:41.059> you<00:00:42.059> can<00:00:42.300> draw<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.629> parallel<00:00:43.079> line<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.290> X

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
line you can draw a parallel line to X

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.520 
line you can draw a parallel line to X
for<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.100> then<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.210> have<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.660> take<00:00:46.200> this

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
for that then I have to take this

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.580 
for that then I have to take this
distance<00:00:46.829> or<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:48.000> can<00:00:48.210> take<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.230> divider

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
distance or you can take in a divider

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:58.580 
distance or you can take in a divider
you<00:00:50.250> can<00:00:50.430> take<00:00:50.750> DC<00:00:51.750> distance<00:00:55.670> you<00:00:57.379> can<00:00:58.379> take

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
you can take DC distance you can take

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.750 
you can take DC distance you can take
this<00:00:58.859> distance<00:00:59.340> C<00:01:00.120> will<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> same<00:01:00.719> point

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
this distance C will be the same point

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:09.200 
this distance C will be the same point
you<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:05.420> you<00:01:06.420> can<00:01:06.659> cut<00:01:06.960> on

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
you can you can cut on

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:19.060 
you can you can cut on
this<00:01:10.020> line<00:01:12.409> then<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:14.010> can<00:01:14.040> extend<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:17.630> this

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
this line then we can extend here this

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.940 
this line then we can extend here this
will<00:01:20.070> get<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:21.590> ptang

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
will get this as ptang

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.410 
will get this as ptang
so<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.700> will<00:01:23.940> be<00:01:25.070> beta<00:01:26.070> angle<00:01:26.390> we<00:01:27.390> are

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
so this will be beta angle we are

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.950 
so this will be beta angle we are
getting<00:01:28.040> we<00:01:29.040> will<00:01:29.159> get<00:01:29.399> this<00:01:29.640> as<00:01:29.700> 65<00:01:30.659> degree

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
getting we will get this as 65 degree

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.100 
getting we will get this as 65 degree
and<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:33.140> inclined<00:01:34.140> at<00:01:34.490> 40<00:01:35.490> degree<00:01:35.790> -<00:01:36.110> we

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
and this is inclined at 40 degree - we

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:46.060 
and this is inclined at 40 degree - we
can<00:01:37.290> measure<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:38.030> will<00:01:39.030> get<00:01:39.360> as<00:01:44.420> 65<00:01:45.420> degree

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
can measure this will get as 65 degree

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.180 
can measure this will get as 65 degree
then<00:01:47.750> we<00:01:48.750> have<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.140> transfer<00:01:49.740> all<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
then we have to transfer all the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.669 
then we have to transfer all the
distance<00:01:50.550> you<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.850> see<00:01:50.929> CD<00:01:51.929> is<00:01:52.110> perpendicular

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
distance you can see CD is perpendicular

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.210 
distance you can see CD is perpendicular
to<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.250> B<00:01:53.929> you<00:01:54.929> can<00:01:55.140> draw<00:01:55.410> a<00:01:55.530> perpendicular<00:01:55.920> line

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
to a B you can draw a perpendicular line

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.149 
to a B you can draw a perpendicular line
here<00:01:59.570> we<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.750> draw<00:02:00.929> a<00:02:01.050> perpendicular<00:02:01.409> line<00:02:01.710> to

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
here we can draw a perpendicular line to

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.029 
here we can draw a perpendicular line to
this<00:02:03.950> thin<00:02:04.950> line<00:02:05.750> then<00:02:06.750> we<00:02:07.380> can<00:02:07.560> take<00:02:07.740> this

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
this thin line then we can take this

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.229 
this thin line then we can take this
distance<00:02:08.340> from<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.539> divider<00:02:10.850> you<00:02:11.850> can<00:02:12.060> take

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
distance from the divider you can take

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:19.220 
distance from the divider you can take
this<00:02:12.630> distance<00:02:12.930> here<00:02:14.780> in<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:16.200> divider<00:02:18.230> can

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
this distance here in the divider can

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.460 
this distance here in the divider can
cut<00:02:19.530> here<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:21.780> can<00:02:21.989> cut<00:02:22.860> on

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.800 

then<00:02:28.090> we<00:02:29.090> can<00:02:29.300> write<00:02:29.510> here<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:31.150> then<00:02:32.150> this<00:02:32.600> will

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
then we can write here a then this will

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:40.170 
then we can write here a then this will
be<00:02:32.930> B<00:02:34.570> we<00:02:35.570> can<00:02:35.780> draw<00:02:36.050> a<00:02:37.330> line<00:02:38.330> here<00:02:38.780> with<00:02:39.290> thick

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
be B we can draw a line here with thick

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.830 
be B we can draw a line here with thick
ABC<00:02:41.180> will<00:02:41.510> be<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.720> triangle<00:02:43.060> here<00:02:44.060> we<00:02:44.810> are

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
ABC will be a triangle here we are

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.900 
ABC will be a triangle here we are
placing<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.770> same<00:02:46.490> triangle<00:02:46.910> in<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:48.670> what<00:02:49.670> we

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
placing the same triangle in the what we

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.440 
placing the same triangle in the what we
can<00:02:50.210> see<00:02:50.420> in<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.750> second<00:02:51.410> top<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.190> say<00:02:52.880> we<00:02:53.420> are

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
can see in the second top you say we are

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.590 
can see in the second top you say we are
tilting<00:02:53.930> like<00:02:54.320> this<00:02:54.560> from<00:02:55.340> this<00:02:55.580> we<00:02:56.120> can<00:02:56.330> draw

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
tilting like this from this we can draw

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.740 
tilting like this from this we can draw
a<00:02:56.780> vertical<00:02:57.530> projection<00:02:57.980> lines<00:02:58.459> from<00:02:58.940> C<00:02:59.240> will

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
a vertical projection lines from C will

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.800 
a vertical projection lines from C will
draw<00:02:59.990> vertical<00:03:00.590> projection<00:03:01.040> lines<00:03:04.000> from<00:03:05.000> C

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
draw vertical projection lines from C

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.730 
draw vertical projection lines from C
dash<00:03:06.050> will<00:03:06.770> draw<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.040> horizontal<00:03:08.740> projection

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
dash will draw a horizontal projection

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:18.040 
dash will draw a horizontal projection
lines<00:03:13.030> line<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:15.020> this<00:03:15.350> will<00:03:15.650> be<00:03:15.830> C<00:03:16.670> dash<00:03:17.050> then

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
lines line so this will be C dash then

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.070 
lines line so this will be C dash then
from<00:03:18.500> here<00:03:18.860> we<00:03:19.760> can<00:03:19.940> draw<00:03:20.120> a<00:03:21.550> vertical

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
from here we can draw a vertical

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.839 
from here we can draw a vertical
projection<00:03:24.080> line

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:34.660 

that<00:03:28.849> will<00:03:29.060> be<00:03:29.209> a<00:03:30.159> -<00:03:31.629> then<00:03:32.799> from<00:03:33.799> this<00:03:34.010> also<00:03:34.370> we

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
that will be a - then from this also we

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.390 
that will be a - then from this also we
can<00:03:34.849> draw<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:35.299> vertical<00:03:36.019> projection<00:03:36.799> lines

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
can draw a vertical projection lines

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.940 
can draw a vertical projection lines
that<00:03:38.239> will<00:03:38.450> be<00:03:38.920> B<00:03:39.920> -<00:03:40.159> we<00:03:40.790> can<00:03:40.970> connect<00:03:41.390> with<00:03:41.629> a<00:03:42.440> -

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
that will be B - we can connect with a -

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:59.170 
that will be B - we can connect with a -

- B - and do - - C - and see - - a - and

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.699 
- B - and do - - C - and see - - a - and
you<00:04:00.079> can<00:04:00.290> make<00:04:00.560> this<00:04:00.799> as<00:04:01.040> thick<00:04:01.849> line<00:04:02.530> what<00:04:03.530> we

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
you can make this as thick line what we

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.110 
you can make this as thick line what we
are<00:04:03.829> done<00:04:04.010> in<00:04:04.190> this<00:04:04.430> problem<00:04:04.700> we<00:04:05.269> took<00:04:05.510> this<00:04:06.260> as

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
are done in this problem we took this as

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.140 
are done in this problem we took this as
25mm<00:04:08.150> with<00:04:09.019> one<00:04:09.290> of<00:04:09.379> its<00:04:09.530> edges<00:04:09.829> we<00:04:10.819> can<00:04:10.849> show

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
25mm with one of its edges we can show

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.569 
25mm with one of its edges we can show
the<00:04:11.329> dimension<00:04:11.840> like<00:04:12.019> yo<00:04:12.500> on<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:13.160> left<00:04:13.340> hand

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
the dimension like yo on the left hand

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:20.590 
the dimension like yo on the left hand
side<00:04:13.790> with<00:04:14.799> 25mm<00:04:16.600> then<00:04:17.600> we<00:04:18.019> are<00:04:18.609> drew<00:04:19.609> this<00:04:19.940> the

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
side with 25mm then we are drew this the

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.650 
side with 25mm then we are drew this the
front<00:04:20.900> view<00:04:21.109> line<00:04:21.350> then<00:04:22.130> it<00:04:22.400> is<00:04:22.460> inclined<00:04:23.449> at

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
front view line then it is inclined at

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.790 
front view line then it is inclined at
45<00:04:24.020> degree<00:04:24.770> -<00:04:24.919> HP<00:04:25.310> they<00:04:25.460> are<00:04:25.550> given<00:04:26.470> then<00:04:27.470> we

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
45 degree - HP they are given then we

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.969 
45 degree - HP they are given then we
have<00:04:27.979> to<00:04:28.100> draw<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.539> second<00:04:29.539> top<00:04:29.780> you<00:04:29.990> then

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
have to draw the second top you then

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.629 
have to draw the second top you then
same<00:04:31.760> thing<00:04:32.120> you<00:04:32.599> have<00:04:32.630> to<00:04:32.930> tilt<00:04:33.470> with<00:04:34.370> this

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
same thing you have to tilt with this

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.180 
same thing you have to tilt with this
beta<00:04:35.150> angle<00:04:35.389> we<00:04:35.930> are<00:04:35.960> getting<00:04:36.410> beta<00:04:36.710> angle<00:04:36.919> as

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
beta angle we are getting beta angle as

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.150 
beta angle we are getting beta angle as
65<00:04:38.000> degree<00:04:38.270> in<00:04:38.720> this<00:04:39.050> case<00:04:39.289> first<00:04:39.710> we<00:04:39.830> have<00:04:40.070> to

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
65 degree in this case first we have to

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.510 
65 degree in this case first we have to
take<00:04:40.280> 40<00:04:40.789> degree<00:04:41.090> -<00:04:41.240> HP<00:04:41.780> align<00:04:42.229> then<00:04:43.039> we<00:04:43.310> have

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
take 40 degree - HP align then we have

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.330 
take 40 degree - HP align then we have
to<00:04:43.639> take<00:04:43.789> CD<00:04:44.360> one<00:04:44.599> distance<00:04:45.020> and<00:04:45.200> you<00:04:45.830> can<00:04:45.860> cut

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
to take CD one distance and you can cut

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:53.140 
to take CD one distance and you can cut
on<00:04:46.580> that<00:04:47.300> this<00:04:48.200> will<00:04:48.410> be<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:48.590> locus<00:04:49.400> of<00:04:51.010> D<00:04:52.150> then

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
on that this will be a locus of D then

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.010 
on that this will be a locus of D then
we<00:04:53.930> can<00:04:54.110> take<00:04:54.349> C<00:04:54.770> D<00:04:55.400> distance<00:04:55.639> and<00:04:56.120> you<00:04:56.570> can<00:04:56.780> cut

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
we can take C D distance and you can cut

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.580 
we can take C D distance and you can cut
on<00:04:57.260> that<00:04:57.560> line<00:04:57.800> then<00:04:58.639> we<00:04:59.000> have<00:04:59.210> to<00:04:59.360> place<00:04:59.630> this

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
on that line then we have to place this

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.400 
on that line then we have to place this
triangle<00:05:01.190> with<00:05:01.430> respect<00:05:01.880> to<00:05:02.000> this<00:05:02.720> second

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
triangle with respect to this second

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.430 
triangle with respect to this second
apparent<00:05:04.400> angle<00:05:04.970> then<00:05:05.539> from<00:05:05.870> that<00:05:06.020> we<00:05:06.260> can

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
apparent angle then from that we can

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.159 
apparent angle then from that we can
draw<00:05:06.650> vertical<00:05:06.830> projection<00:05:07.250> lines<00:05:07.760> then<00:05:08.750> from

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
draw vertical projection lines then from

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:10.839 
draw vertical projection lines then from
this<00:05:09.380> we<00:05:09.650> can<00:05:09.800> draw<00:05:09.950> horizontal<00:05:10.250> production

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:10.849 
this we can draw horizontal production

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.540 
this we can draw horizontal production
lines<00:05:11.090> then<00:05:11.720> we<00:05:11.750> will<00:05:12.050> get<00:05:12.229> the<00:05:12.440> final<00:05:12.800> thank

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
lines then we will get the final thank

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.010 
lines then we will get the final thank
you

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.080
