my<00:04:41.100> best<00:04:41.310> advice<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:42.030> figure<00:04:42.390> out<00:04:42.510> if<00:04:42.600> it

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
my best advice to figure out if it

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.270 
my best advice to figure out if it
flakes<00:04:42.900> or<00:04:43.140> not<00:04:43.290> is<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.560> just<00:04:43.740> give<00:04:43.890> yourself<00:04:44.220> a

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
flakes or not is to just give yourself a

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.310 
flakes or not is to just give yourself a
little<00:04:44.310> spray<00:04:44.760> back<00:04:45.000> here<00:04:45.390> and<00:04:45.540> then<00:04:46.080> tease<00:04:46.290> a

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
little spray back here and then tease a

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.570 
little spray back here and then tease a
little<00:04:46.440> bit<00:04:46.680> under<00:04:46.920> there<00:04:47.070> and<00:04:47.220> then<00:04:47.310> that<00:04:47.460> way

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
little bit under there and then that way

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.160 
little bit under there and then that way
if<00:04:47.760> you're<00:04:47.910> flaky<00:04:48.150> you<00:04:48.330> can<00:04:48.540> just<00:04:48.720> kind<00:04:49.140> of

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
if you're flaky you can just kind of

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.600 
if you're flaky you can just kind of
hide<00:04:49.350> it<00:04:49.530> and<00:04:49.680> nobody<00:04:50.010> will<00:04:50.130> see<00:04:50.310> it<00:04:50.340> because

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
hide it and nobody will see it because

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.240 
hide it and nobody will see it because
the<00:04:50.820> worst<00:04:51.090> is<00:04:51.390> when<00:04:51.540> you<00:04:51.660> have<00:04:51.840> a<00:04:52.250> forehead
