00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
battle instead of just being okay with

battle instead of just being okay with
choke<00:01:43.979> points<00:01:44.369> they<00:01:44.670> are<00:01:44.700> minimized<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
choke points they are minimized on the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.539 
choke points they are minimized on the
battlefield<00:01:46.320> while<00:01:46.530> they<00:01:46.680> are<00:01:46.799> not<00:01:46.950> gone<00:01:47.250> it

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
battlefield while they are not gone it

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.280 
battlefield while they are not gone it
still<00:01:47.909> happens<00:01:48.329> but<00:01:48.630> they<00:01:48.750> are<00:01:48.869> minimized

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
still happens but they are minimized

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.230 
still happens but they are minimized
because<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:50.220> grenades<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.880> are<00:01:51.000> allowed<00:01:51.210> to

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
because the grenades you are allowed to

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.899 
because the grenades you are allowed to
use<00:01:51.540> are<00:01:51.810> either<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.770> flashbangs<00:01:53.430> which<00:01:53.670> not

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
use are either the flashbangs which not

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.670 
use are either the flashbangs which not
all<00:01:53.939> servers<00:01:54.360> allow<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.290> possibly

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
all servers allow you to but possibly

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.100 
all servers allow you to but possibly
smoke<00:01:56.640> grenades<00:01:56.969> which<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.360> what<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.600> always

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
smoke grenades which is what I always

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.959 
smoke grenades which is what I always
use<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.439> get<00:01:58.619> three<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.040> them<00:01:59.250> when<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.640> spawn

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
use you get three of them when you spawn

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.270 
use you get three of them when you spawn
that's<00:02:00.270> quite<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> lot<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.020> then<00:02:01.619> also<00:02:01.950> you

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
that's quite a lot and then also you

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.590 
that's quite a lot and then also you
could<00:02:02.460> use<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.820> flares<00:02:03.060> which<00:02:03.329> are<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> little

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
could use the flares which are a little

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.930 
could use the flares which are a little
trollee<00:02:03.899> but<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.829> each<00:02:05.100> their

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
trollee but to each their

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.420 
trollee but to each their
own<00:02:06.030> anyways<00:02:06.930> combining<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:07.980> pistols

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.100 
own anyways combining the pistols
getting<00:02:08.729> minimal<00:02:09.090> one-hit<00:02:09.450> kills<00:02:09.660> sometimes

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
getting minimal one-hit kills sometimes

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.720 
getting minimal one-hit kills sometimes
it<00:02:10.380> would<00:02:10.590> happen<00:02:10.800> if<00:02:11.040> using<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.340> magnum<00:02:11.670> you

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
it would happen if using a magnum you

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.600 
it would happen if using a magnum you
get<00:02:11.850> shot<00:02:12.060> net<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.840> entirely<00:02:13.200> possible

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
get shot net that is entirely possible

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.850 
get shot net that is entirely possible
taking<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:15.030> less<00:02:15.480> explosives<00:02:16.290> everywhere<00:02:16.740> on

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
taking the less explosives everywhere on

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.620 
taking the less explosives everywhere on
the<00:02:16.950> map<00:02:17.130> because<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.760> restrictions<00:02:18.060> on

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
the map because of the restrictions on

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.480 
the map because of the restrictions on
what<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.840> can<00:02:18.900> use<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.650> smoke<00:02:19.920> grenades<00:02:20.280> and

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
what you can use the smoke grenades and

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.910 
what you can use the smoke grenades and
the<00:02:21.240> fact<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.570> battlefield<00:02:22.050> 4<00:02:22.440> maps<00:02:22.620> have

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
the fact that battlefield 4 maps have

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.100 
the fact that battlefield 4 maps have
more<00:02:23.190> flank<00:02:23.580> routes<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.090> just<00:02:24.330> in<00:02:24.510> general<00:02:24.540> in

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
more flank routes and just in general in

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.200 
more flank routes and just in general in
my<00:02:25.260> opinion<00:02:25.560> are<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:25.890> lot<00:02:26.370> less<00:02:26.520> choke<00:02:26.820> point<00:02:27.150> II

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
my opinion are a lot less choke point II

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.360 
my opinion are a lot less choke point II
than<00:02:27.360> they<00:02:27.480> were<00:02:27.540> in<00:02:27.660> battlefield<00:02:28.350> 3<00:02:28.410> mix<00:02:29.190> all

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
than they were in battlefield 3 mix all

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.580 
than they were in battlefield 3 mix all
three<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.730> those<00:02:29.880> together<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.600> choke<00:02:31.110> points

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
is there's minimal rage just seems

people are happier on pistol only
servers<00:02:38.610> there's<00:02:39.210> less<00:02:39.540> things<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.050> could

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
servers there's less things that could

be considered a quote-unquote Opie and

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.300 
be considered a quote-unquote Opie and
unbalanced<00:02:42.540> overall<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:43.710> just<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:43.980> lot<00:02:44.100> more

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310

wondering<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.690> how<00:02:49.170> do<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.380> find<00:02:49.800> these

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
wondering is how do you find these

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.520 
wondering is how do you find these
servers<00:02:50.600> basically<00:02:51.600> if<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:51.870> go<00:02:52.020> on<00:02:52.290> to

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
servers basically if you go on to

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.560 
servers basically if you go on to
Battlelog<00:02:53.010> find<00:02:53.610> your<00:02:53.730> server<00:02:53.970> browser<00:02:54.180> go

to do is make sure your filters aren't a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.900 
to do is make sure your filters aren't a

was playing a lot of tablet commander
for<00:03:07.350> some<00:03:07.500> reason<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.190> don't<00:03:08.700> know<00:03:08.850> it<00:03:09.780> was<00:03:09.900> fun

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
for some reason I don't know it was fun

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.810 
for some reason I don't know it was fun
though<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.500> pretty<00:03:10.770> much<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:11.160> just<00:03:11.370> have<00:03:11.640> mine

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
though so pretty much I just have mine

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.400 
though so pretty much I just have mine
on<00:03:11.850> normal<00:03:12.330> North<00:03:12.630> America<00:03:13.080> that's<00:03:13.260> because

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
on normal North America that's because

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.960 
on normal North America that's because
it's<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.830> know<00:03:13.860> where<00:03:14.190> i<00:03:14.220> want<00:03:14.400> my<00:03:14.580> server<00:03:14.820> to

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
it's you know where i want my server to

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.290 
it's you know where i want my server to
be<00:03:15.090> type<00:03:15.660> in<00:03:15.810> pistol<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.440> hit<00:03:16.680> enter

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
be type in pistol and hit enter

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.910 
be type in pistol and hit enter
basically<00:03:18.300> you<00:03:18.570> will<00:03:18.660> find<00:03:19.050> a<00:03:19.200> whole<00:03:19.440> bunch<00:03:19.770> of

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
basically you will find a whole bunch of

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.620
