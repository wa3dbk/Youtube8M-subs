00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.089
 hello to everyone I'm betty and 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.640
 welcome once again to my channel today 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:10.210
 I bring you the winner of the fifth challenge 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.190
 48 hours in whites 2 he is wild and 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.070
 the truth that has surprised me quite 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.039
 because I did not expect at all 37 casualties 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.640
 in this challenge that was she I remember the 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:24.279
 200% life with the silencer and one 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.989
 You already knew that there was a minimum 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.630
 two shots to kill an enemy and 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:31.300
 maximum three and the truth that has 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.360
 surprised because I was 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.330
 trying and I got the measure of this from 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.120
 25 and hurrying and the truth that for 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.520
 get out 37 have had to try 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.980
 quite and good has been clear victor 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.700
 because then the other messages the 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.400
 true that none exceeded 34 if I 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.800
 I'm wrong and he's done 37 since it's a 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.930
 barbarity and I tell you that if you have 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.760
 tested you will know the difficulty of this 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.490
 challenge and the total of casualties that is 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.680
 awesome and good 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.059
 that I roll up I go to the mess that you already know 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.610

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.900

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.470
 check out 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.450

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.400

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.020
