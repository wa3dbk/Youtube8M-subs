you<00:02:11.530> want<00:02:11.769> wha<00:02:12.250> what<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.000> recommend<00:02:13.299> is<00:02:13.630> if<00:02:13.690> you

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
you want wha what I recommend is if you

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.300 
you want wha what I recommend is if you
are<00:02:13.959> using<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.290> TV<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.709> you're<00:02:14.799> sitting<00:02:14.980> close

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
are using a TV and you're sitting close

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
are using a TV and you're sitting close
switch<00:02:16.269> it<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.420> 720p<00:02:17.110> instead<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.709> 1080p

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
switch it to 720p instead of 1080p

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.110 
switch it to 720p instead of 1080p
because<00:02:19.330> on<00:02:19.750> 720<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:21.010> looks<00:02:21.280> bigger<00:02:21.670> but<00:02:22.000> it's

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
because on 720 it looks bigger but it's

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.600 
because on 720 it looks bigger but it's
kind<00:02:22.569> of<00:02:22.630> easier<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:22.989> see<00:02:23.200> when<00:02:23.950> it's<00:02:24.099> on<00:02:24.190> 1080

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
kind of easier to see when it's on 1080

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.280 
kind of easier to see when it's on 1080
it<00:02:24.819> some<00:02:25.380> tin<00:02:26.380> it<00:02:26.680> looks<00:02:27.250> better<00:02:27.370> for<00:02:28.290> further

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
it some tin it looks better for further

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.949 
it some tin it looks better for further
away<00:02:29.500> from<00:02:29.829> a<00:02:30.250> distance<00:02:30.670> so<00:02:31.480> depending<00:02:31.870> on
