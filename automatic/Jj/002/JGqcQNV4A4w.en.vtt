and<00:03:30.220> I<00:03:30.430> would<00:03:30.549> also<00:03:30.730> recommend<00:03:31.000> of<00:03:31.480> getting

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
and I would also recommend of getting

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.780 
and I would also recommend of getting
side<00:03:32.290> bangs<00:03:32.530> because<00:03:32.829> if<00:03:33.160> you<00:03:33.250> have<00:03:33.400> a<00:03:33.430> rounder

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
side bangs because if you have a rounder

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.610 
side bangs because if you have a rounder
square<00:03:34.030> face<00:03:34.420> it<00:03:34.660> helps<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:35.019> have<00:03:35.110> a<00:03:35.170> diagonal

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
square face it helps to have a diagonal

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.970 
square face it helps to have a diagonal
line<00:03:36.010> kind<00:03:36.459> of<00:03:36.549> cut<00:03:36.700> up<00:03:36.730> your<00:03:36.970> face<00:03:37.739> not<00:03:38.739> cut<00:03:38.950> up
