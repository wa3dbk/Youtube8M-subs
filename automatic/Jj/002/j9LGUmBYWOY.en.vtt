00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.450
 do you have 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.820
 very good guys and good girls from 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.050
 spa top today I bring you two repetitions 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.060
 that two different players have made 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.800
 of the clan that I'm sure you're going to 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.470
 appear at least at least 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.939
 interesting and fun the first me 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.700
 I think it's the one we're most waiting for 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.560
 all is an attack with the new troop 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.939
 they have taken out in the lowered 1 he knows the 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.160
 hound water and prefer to 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.290
 memorames call it the slump there what 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.150
 you already have that in Spain we have a 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.820
 player that good yes he had had 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.220
 elixir went up the store and then with 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.170
 gems because it accelerated not the 9 days that 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.790
 takes and there you see has released one for each 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.350
 a newspaper we have three and has released one 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.870
 rage because they have daily and another here 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.160
 that in a few balloons then I 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.600
 I think the attack could have been done 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.059
 better could have been done better in the 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.920
 sense that the the slump these of 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.480
 level 1 you also notice that good here 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.489
 has a lot of life is clear but not 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.710
 those of level 3 that we saw in the video 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.030
 of chef putt and they do not hold much and 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.920
 that is the anti-heroes not even a 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.259
 excessive level 5 good no no is 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.830
 bad level for a town hall 8 but 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:14.200
 they are not yet at the maximum then well I 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.780
 I consider that this attack has not been 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.400
 to use let's say the abajÃ³n and very soon 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.200
 very late 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.970
 look for a midpoint or loose them and 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.620
 then he starts releasing balloons or 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.120
 dragons that in this case has preferred 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.800
 clean the village with balloons and then 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.800
 drop dragons and heroes already for 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.690
 secure one hundred percent or loose ones 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.420
 balloons that we say distract a bit to 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.160
 the defenses or tombs some antiaircraft 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.900
 with a rage of three or four balloons not 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.820
 you take off let's say the air defenses 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.520
 more powerful and then yes you loose 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.650
 the lava hong and the rest of balloons or 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.630
 dragons or henchmen or whatever they wear 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.820
 wave and the idea yes or yes yes i 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.190
 Slavic homes carry aerial troops but 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.200
 as I say is a troop that has just 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.790
 come out that everyone will create their own 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.010
 attack strategies with this troop 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.660
 Some would prefer to release it first 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.250
 line there will be those who prefer to release it 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.810
 shortly after I believe that his 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.700
 It would be like I already told you to let go 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.100
 a few balloons with some rage or 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.810
 the queens or some hero or the castle 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.310
 whatever it is with the aim of destroying 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.990
 12 aerial anti-aircraft are worth very much 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.690
 with the queen herself can be 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.160
 try or if good in this case for 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.980
 example is released a rage is released 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.870
 34 balloons and we made sure they knocked down a 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.810
 antiaircraft valiso you can do with two or 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.840
 with three better yet and once taken 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.110
 let's go what's the downside worth the side 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.970
 where the newspaper is standing or 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.770
 the santiagos that remain standing and so 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.810
 that you make all defenses 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.459
 they're going to distract you there but the down 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.110
 they survive because then they dare 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.459
 instantly you have to release the rest 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.620
 of troops with a mega attack drop it 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.940
 with him and then you release super fast the 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.370
 magicians so they do not found you what you put 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.380
 well here the same so that you do not 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.970
 hound wracking lava and you make sure 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.000
 that if they do not kill you and you destroy the 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.110
 santiagos they are at defensive doors 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.299
 defenses that are hardly going to 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.850
 get to kill them then then and 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.410
 if your troops will finish cleaning the 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.090
 village in this case round has not done 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.920
 Well, well, this one is practicing 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.569
 like everyone when we unlock them 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.220
 at least I still do not have but good handle 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.290
 with 100% and has taken a loot then 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.319
 reasonable at least with the swear 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.390
 he almost recovered the investment in this 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.519
 troop well second attack that I'm going to 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.860
 teach and last all andrew witches 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.620
 in addition witches of level 2 or witches to 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.330
 maximum 20 witch attack there to spend 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.910
 dark took out but good to see that he has 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.720
 touched the court already with 2500 of dark 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.350
 what 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.720
 it is not even far I think that this army 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.430
 of witches is worth more than six thousand two ass 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.690
 but hey he took a third that is already 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.640
 something and it would also be a good reason to 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.290
 have fairly full mines and the 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.570
 hell important to be in a single 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.570
 objective therefore do not involve any 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.280
 problem when attacking with witches 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.900
 because of one in a skeleton they are not going to 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.790
 do nothing and if you look in place of 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.950
 freeze hell freezes the 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.140
 crossbows great decision because the 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.960
 crossbow that yes that quickly then they go 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.060
 killing the skeleton almost that 12 by 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.320
 second easily ok me in a 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.120
 beginning is watching the repetition I say 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.590
 everything is as pinion as a bomb 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.600
 giant under study everything but 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.140
 it really is the dynamics of an attack 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.170
 with witches 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.180
 what happens that they release there what is 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.980
 stops skeletons and a bomb who 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.750
 I said those to kill but with much 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.690
 they kill two witches and automatically 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.430
 they generate such amount of 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.739
 decrees that you are already seeing 61% 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.630
 has knocked down a hell two crossbows and 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.640
 the town hall and 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.040
 well, it does not have anything that can 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.230
 clog it or not there is no 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.210
 mortar is no tower of magicians 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.310
 to the best that some giant bomb by 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.290
 there may be but since it hurts 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.880
 as much hell if snag 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.230
 the queen but good you are already seeing that 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.840
 he is perfectly entertaining with 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.970
 the skeletons so well a village 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.470
 what you will say is not that it has a low wall 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.210
 but is that it is the least if you have 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.670
 realized here Andrew is going loose a 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.010
 jump bone andrew knew that by wearing it 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.270
 all witches could not take we broke the 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.510
 because then it would no longer be an army 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.400
 only of witches there you have it web and if 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.690
 seven magicians valero if we take when leaving 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.560
 of the castle next to tosar remains 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.080
 perfect 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.510
 20 witches in the queen and the spells there 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.070
 you have seen two jumps, that is, 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.450
 equal the level of the iguana wall the level 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.070
 of the defenses is not bad one of the 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.540
 two hell is at 2 and then the 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.090
 anger because the reverse is super important 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.790
 I consider myself at least with an army of 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.170
 witches because we are going here to a small group 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.210
 below and a small group above 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.460
 rage the two groups and make a 30 or 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.110
 40% issue of 20 30 seconds so 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.280
 nothing very much thank you both for 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.020
 the repetitions I hope that I have 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.329
 liked the video and see you in the 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.329
 next 

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.329
 subscribe 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.420
 i 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.270
 A) Yes
