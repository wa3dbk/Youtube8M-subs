00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
probably think about a little

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.000 
differently than I did you know even
maybe<00:03:02.540> five<00:03:02.840> years<00:03:03.110> ago<00:03:03.319> just<00:03:03.350> from<00:03:03.920> the

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
maybe five years ago just from the

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.110 
maybe five years ago just from the

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
standpoint that the board's been

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.020 
standpoint that the board's been
expanded<00:03:05.720> so<00:03:06.380> I<00:03:06.410> think<00:03:06.680> it's<00:03:06.799> important<00:03:07.250> for
