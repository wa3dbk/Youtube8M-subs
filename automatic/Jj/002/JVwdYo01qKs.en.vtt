bottom<00:01:44.450> black<00:01:45.450> lotuses<00:01:45.930> having<00:01:46.409> issues<00:01:46.860> but

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
bottom black lotuses having issues but

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.550 
bottom black lotuses having issues but
this<00:01:47.939> particular<00:01:48.090> one<00:01:48.600> actually<00:01:48.899> if<00:01:49.380> you

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
this particular one actually if you

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.160 
this particular one actually if you
measure<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.220> correctly<00:01:50.640> it's<00:01:51.420> pretty<00:01:51.780> close

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
measure it correctly it's pretty close

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.340 
measure it correctly it's pretty close
and<00:01:52.740> through<00:01:52.979> our<00:01:53.009> 60<00:01:53.520> 48<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.420> top<00:01:55.170> to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
and through our 60 48 on the top to

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.190 
and through our 60 48 on the top to
bottom<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.460> it'll<00:01:56.670> actually<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.689> PSA

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
bottom so it'll actually in a PSA

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.389 
bottom so it'll actually in a PSA
grading<00:01:58.590> scale<00:01:59.600> you<00:02:00.600> will<00:02:00.719> actually<00:02:01.399> that

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
grading scale you will actually that

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.700 
grading scale you will actually that
actually<00:02:02.490> qualifies<00:02:03.090> for<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.390> PSA<00:02:03.930> 10<00:02:04.200> gem<00:02:04.500> int

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
actually qualifies for a PSA 10 gem int

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.609 
actually qualifies for a PSA 10 gem int
so<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.490> car<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.729> actually<00:02:05.939> 0.5<00:02:06.810> away<00:02:07.200> from

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
so this car is actually 0.5 away from

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.910 
so this car is actually 0.5 away from

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
simply you know not only is that the the

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.980 
simply you know not only is that the the
rarest<00:05:04.300> of<00:05:04.420> all<00:05:06.210> lotuses<00:05:07.210> but<00:05:07.540> I<00:05:07.810> believe<00:05:08.940> it's

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
rarest of all lotuses but I believe it's

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.230 
rarest of all lotuses but I believe it's
it<00:05:10.990> was<00:05:11.050> the<00:05:11.200> only<00:05:11.320> one<00:05:11.650> to<00:05:12.550> all<00:05:12.670> receive<00:05:13.030> all

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
it was the only one to all receive all

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.690 
it was the only one to all receive all
9.5<00:05:13.990> subgrades<00:05:14.590> except<00:05:15.040> I<00:05:15.130> think<00:05:15.160> we<00:05:15.400> created

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
9.5 subgrades except I think we created

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.560 
9.5 subgrades except I think we created
another<00:05:15.790> one<00:05:16.030> this<00:05:17.020> year<00:05:17.470> so<00:05:18.210> there's<00:05:19.210> one

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
another one this year so there's one

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.660 
another one this year so there's one
more<00:05:19.600> of<00:05:19.930> those<00:05:20.080> out<00:05:20.380> there<00:05:20.440> and<00:05:20.920> it's<00:05:21.460> sold

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
more of those out there and it's sold

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.820 
more of those out there and it's sold
for<00:05:21.730> twenty<00:05:22.120> five<00:05:22.270> thousand<00:05:22.840> last<00:05:23.020> year<00:05:23.320> so<00:05:23.620> I

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
for twenty five thousand last year so I

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.490 
for twenty five thousand last year so I
believe<00:05:24.670> the<00:05:24.850> evaluations<00:05:25.570> probably<00:05:26.380> a

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
believe the evaluations probably a

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.140 
believe the evaluations probably a
little<00:05:26.620> bit<00:05:26.800> higher<00:05:26.920> now<00:05:26.980> because<00:05:27.640> it's

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
little bit higher now because it's

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.460 
little bit higher now because it's
getting<00:05:28.360> more<00:05:28.600> and<00:05:28.690> more<00:05:28.750> rare<00:05:29.020> to<00:05:29.050> finest
