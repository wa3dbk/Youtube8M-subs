 liberators by certain criteria 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:35.030
 I admired a lot and already when when I was born 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:39.939
 when I was right I had nothing to do 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.939
 with the bar I did not know the bar 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.329
 there are many people who teach many things 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.990
 that maybe it 's mounted on a bus or 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.600
 peeled who travel from mule to mule 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.329
 because they respect very much one 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.479
 they drive well in the cars they try 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.220
 to do what you tell them if you 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.080
 they understand the sense of not harming the 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.230
 car the vehicle 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.230
 all right 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.750
 my parents died in an accident of 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.959
 road traffic 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.510
 they were run over by a person 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.670
 what is 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.920
 in drunkenness died in January 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.430
 my mom died on January 25 in dad 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.430
 the 28th 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.689
 when my parents died 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.120
 they do not advise that they leave to abandon 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.250
 what it is to travel by national that I already 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.459
 dedicate other things that I no longer had 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.430
 nothing to see and obviously then made of 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.530
 all all kinds of actions of those 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.829
 because what is simply my 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.189
 happiness and that is what motivates me to 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:01.799
 try to somehow camouflage the 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.810
 pain that I feel when having a loss 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.590
 as painful as it was to lose my 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.550
 dads in a week 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.550
 do not 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:23.680
 let's say for the 24 of 2004 of month 4 the 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.720
 day 4 if that day a companion in 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.540
 we offered on the normal bus and 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.640
 We go through the municipality of Puerto Boyacá 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.420
 and the bus turned around and we turned and 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.400
 pitifully that pelao passed away and the 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.350
 pelao was the last one we rode to the 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.790
 I ride the bus because 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.719
 all the buses had already started 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.950
 They gave me the mountain and the pelao 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.950
 unfortunately he died 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.659
 the most important thing is that one travel and 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.580
 come from the nation to the tc champion 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:01.620
 some explain something that always one 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.040
 takes to memory and to remember it 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.260
 here 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.209
 when they arrive they are enfiestados and 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.920
 singing and happy do not care if 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.810
 you lose lived in them who is the 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.880
 team where national home go the 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.259
 international key is always going to 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.959
 have people and they are not going to see a little bit 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:22.910
 there are a lot of people and most of 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.590
 people are travelers and all that 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.509
 so that's why it's because where I'm going 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.539
 I worry nationally that holy day 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:28.539

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.420
 and 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.900
 the methods team 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.910
