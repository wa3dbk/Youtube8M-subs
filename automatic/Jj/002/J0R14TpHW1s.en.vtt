doesn't work okay let's try a ps1 game
maybe<00:02:45.269> that<00:02:45.569> will<00:02:45.720> work<00:02:46.489> we<00:02:47.489> want<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.730> play<00:02:47.819> for

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
maybe that will work we want to play for

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:55.000 
maybe that will work we want to play for
ps1<00:02:50.750> let's<00:02:51.750> play<00:02:52.019> crash<00:02:52.440> three<00:02:53.060> okay

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
ps1 let's play crash three okay

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.110 
ps1 let's play crash three okay
and<00:02:56.060> yet<00:02:57.060> there's<00:02:57.299> a<00:02:57.500> ps2<00:02:58.500> memory<00:02:59.190> card<00:02:59.730> thing

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
and yet there's a ps2 memory card thing

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.680 
and yet there's a ps2 memory card thing
on<00:03:00.420> here<00:03:01.340> create<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.370> memory<00:03:02.670> card<00:03:02.940> for<00:03:03.120> ps2<00:03:03.269> on

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690

you that doesn't make sense

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.460 
you that doesn't make sense
let's<00:03:05.040> try<00:03:05.250> ps1<00:03:05.849> oh<00:03:08.870> what's<00:03:09.870> this

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
let's try ps1 oh what's this

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:18.640 
let's try ps1 oh what's this
but<00:03:11.100> uh<00:03:11.310> uh<00:03:12.440> what's<00:03:13.440> this

just so fake how that happened now I
have<00:04:52.169> a<00:04:52.350> memory<00:04:52.560> card<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:52.889> can<00:04:53.039> set<00:04:53.220> it<00:04:53.310> up<00:04:53.430> to

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
have a memory card you can set it up to

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.760 
have a memory card you can set it up to
I<00:04:53.940> have<00:04:54.300> a<00:04:54.330> data<00:04:54.570> transfer<00:04:54.870> for<00:04:55.320> it<00:04:55.440> which

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
I have a data transfer for it which

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.980 
I have a data transfer for it which
means<00:04:55.919> I<00:04:56.070> have<00:04:56.160> a<00:04:56.220> USB<00:04:56.669> that<00:04:56.789> does<00:04:57.000> that<00:04:57.180> check

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
means I have a USB that does that check

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:05.650 
means I have a USB that does that check
the<00:04:58.139> disk<00:04:58.400> see<00:04:59.400> it<00:05:00.300> is<00:05:02.660> crash<00:05:03.660> I<00:05:04.440> look<00:05:05.099> at<00:05:05.220> that

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
the disk see it is crash I look at that

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.980 
the disk see it is crash I look at that
that<00:05:06.660> reflects<00:05:07.139> my<00:05:07.530> head<00:05:08.720> so<00:05:09.720> it<00:05:10.050> does<00:05:10.320> work

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
that reflects my head so it does work

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.279 
that reflects my head so it does work
for<00:05:12.990> ps1<00:05:13.380> only<00:05:13.830> but<00:05:14.460> these<00:05:14.639> don't<00:05:14.970> work<00:05:15.289> these
