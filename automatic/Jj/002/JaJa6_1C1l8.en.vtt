the<00:01:49.979> new<00:01:50.130> style<00:01:50.399> scruffy<00:01:50.790> over<00:01:50.939> here<00:01:51.149> however

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the new style scruffy over here however

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.139 
the new style scruffy over here however
because<00:01:52.290> um<00:01:52.530> his<00:01:53.130> face<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.670> pretty<00:01:53.970> darn

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
because um his face is pretty darn

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.639 
because um his face is pretty darn
accurate<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.689> TV<00:01:54.960> series<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.439> think

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
accurate to the TV series and I think

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.289 
accurate to the TV series and I think
that's<00:01:55.799> what<00:01:55.950> learning<00:01:56.100> curve<00:01:56.430> was<00:01:56.969> aiming

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
that's what learning curve was aiming

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.780 
that's what learning curve was aiming
for<00:01:57.329> when<00:01:57.719> they<00:01:57.950> re<00:01:58.950> released<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.399> scruffy

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
for when they re released the scruffy

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.550 
for when they re released the scruffy
because<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.420> old<00:02:00.570> style<00:02:00.810> scruffy<00:02:01.170> was<00:02:01.290> sold

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
because the old style scruffy was sold

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.679 
because the old style scruffy was sold
for<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> number<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.790> years<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.240> then<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.450> course

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
for a number of years and then of course

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.050 
for a number of years and then of course
it<00:02:03.780> was<00:02:03.899> retired<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.590> then<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.890> 2006<00:02:05.549> learning

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
it was retired and then in 2006 learning

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.410 
it was retired and then in 2006 learning
curve<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.509> hey<00:02:06.840> let's<00:02:08.420> re-release

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
curve is like hey let's re-release

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.690 
curve is like hey let's re-release
scruffy<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:09.959> make<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> millions<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.400> dollars

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
scruffy and make a millions of dollars

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.720 
scruffy and make a millions of dollars
off<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.300> everybody

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
off of it and everybody

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.360 
off of it and everybody
like<00:02:12.790> okay<00:02:13.150> cuz<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.480> means<00:02:13.659> more<00:02:13.840> money<00:02:14.050> and

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
like okay cuz that means more money and

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.309 
like okay cuz that means more money and
so<00:02:15.370> this<00:02:15.519> is<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.760> rerelease<00:02:16.180> version<00:02:16.569> even

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
so this is the rerelease version even

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.199 
so this is the rerelease version even
though<00:02:17.409> it<00:02:17.680> was<00:02:17.769> specifically<00:02:18.220> we<00:02:18.879> released

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
though it was specifically we released

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.860 
though it was specifically we released
for<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:20.040> 2006<00:02:21.040> but<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.360> mean<00:02:23.099> you<00:02:24.099> know<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.870> have

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
for a 2006 but I mean you know I have

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.720

one<00:02:26.110> in<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.319> package<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.709> says<00:02:26.980> 2010<00:02:27.610> on<00:02:27.700> the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
one in the package that says 2010 on the

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.460 
one in the package that says 2010 on the
package<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:28.150> with<00:02:28.450> learning<00:02:28.750> curve<00:02:28.959> dates<00:02:29.260> are

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
package so with learning curve dates are

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.720 
package so with learning curve dates are
unpredictable

this<00:02:31.330> scruffy<00:02:31.750> one<00:02:31.959> of<00:02:32.049> the<00:02:32.110> biggest<00:02:32.440> flaws<00:02:32.560> I

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
this scruffy one of the biggest flaws I

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.490 
this scruffy one of the biggest flaws I
think<00:02:33.280> is<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:34.540> orange<00:02:34.810> wheels<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.230> orange<00:02:35.410> we

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
think is the orange wheels the orange we

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.780 
think is the orange wheels the orange we
also<00:02:35.620> have<00:02:35.769> nothing<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.280> do<00:02:36.400> it's<00:02:36.549> kind<00:02:36.760> of

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
also have nothing to do it's kind of

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.630 
also have nothing to do it's kind of
like<00:02:36.910> Rheneas<00:02:37.540> with<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.620> gray<00:02:38.829> wheels<00:02:39.129> I<00:02:39.489> mean

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
like Rheneas with the gray wheels I mean

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.030 
like Rheneas with the gray wheels I mean
it's<00:02:39.790> just<00:02:39.849> ridiculous

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
it's just ridiculous

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.259 
it's just ridiculous
and<00:02:42.040> then<00:02:42.159> of<00:02:42.250> course<00:02:42.310> with<00:02:42.730> all<00:02:42.760> these<00:02:43.000> new

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
and then of course with all these new

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.650 
and then of course with all these new
lines<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:43.720> got<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.280> blast<00:02:45.390> magnetic<00:02:46.390> thing

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
lines you got the blast magnetic thing

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.460 
lines you got the blast magnetic thing
here<00:02:47.230> that's<00:02:47.760> I<00:02:48.760> don't<00:02:49.150> know<00:02:49.269> but<00:02:50.079> anyway<00:02:50.319> look

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
here that's I don't know but anyway look

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.619 
here that's I don't know but anyway look
at<00:02:50.650> review<00:02:50.950> continue<00:02:51.400> so<00:02:51.579> my<00:02:52.299> old<00:02:52.450> stuff

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
at review continue so my old stuff

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.479 
at review continue so my old stuff
scruffy<00:02:52.989> obviously<00:02:53.319> has<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.500> lot<00:02:53.620> more<00:02:54.099> wear<00:02:54.459> on

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
scruffy obviously has a lot more wear on

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.220 
scruffy obviously has a lot more wear on
it<00:02:54.819> than<00:02:55.000> this<00:02:55.120> one<00:02:55.359> because<00:02:55.660> I<00:02:55.840> use<00:02:55.959> this<00:02:56.079> one

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
it than this one because I use this one

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.630 
it than this one because I use this one
of<00:02:56.349> my<00:02:56.410> series<00:02:56.769> and<00:02:56.890> I<00:02:56.920> use<00:02:57.069> it<00:02:57.190> as<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.400> kid

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
of my series and I use it as a kid

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.550 
of my series and I use it as a kid
surprisingly<00:03:00.640> I<00:03:00.790> think<00:03:01.299> this<00:03:01.930> scruffy<00:03:02.379> is

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
surprisingly I think this scruffy is

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.410 
surprisingly I think this scruffy is
just<00:03:02.859> more<00:03:03.310> accurate<00:03:03.730> than<00:03:03.879> that<00:03:03.910> scruffy<00:03:04.390> the

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
just more accurate than that scruffy the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.759 
just more accurate than that scruffy the
only<00:03:04.690> thing<00:03:04.840> I<00:03:04.930> like<00:03:05.049> about<00:03:05.079> the<00:03:05.349> scruffy<00:03:05.680> is

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
only thing I like about the scruffy is

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.740 
only thing I like about the scruffy is
the<00:03:05.920> face<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:06.519> then<00:03:07.239> again<00:03:07.450> I<00:03:07.480> don't<00:03:07.599> really

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
the face and then again I don't really

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.080 
the face and then again I don't really
like<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.140> face<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.500> much<00:03:08.739> so<00:03:08.980> I<00:03:09.250> think<00:03:09.670> this

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
like the face that much so I think this

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.849 
like the face that much so I think this
old<00:03:10.299> style<00:03:10.480> scruffy<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:10.959> more<00:03:11.200> accurate<00:03:11.709> when

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
old style scruffy is more accurate when

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.259 
old style scruffy is more accurate when
it<00:03:11.920> comes<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.340> that<00:03:12.569> um<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:15.790> know<00:03:15.910> obviously

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
it comes to that um you know obviously

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.550 
it comes to that um you know obviously
this<00:03:16.480> new<00:03:16.720> style<00:03:16.930> scruffy<00:03:17.169> has<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.380> orange

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
this new style scruffy has the orange

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.559 
this new style scruffy has the orange
wheels<00:03:17.769> to<00:03:17.950> which<00:03:18.099> to<00:03:18.280> me<00:03:18.400> makes<00:03:18.519> no<00:03:18.910> sense<00:03:19.239> why

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
wheels to which to me makes no sense why

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:20.990 
wheels to which to me makes no sense why
do<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.780> put<00:03:19.959> orange<00:03:20.230> wheels<00:03:20.470> on<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.650> truck

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
do you put orange wheels on the truck

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.789 
do you put orange wheels on the truck
the<00:03:22.000> paint<00:03:22.269> colors<00:03:22.599> a<00:03:22.630> little<00:03:22.989> bit<00:03:23.169> different

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
the paint colors a little bit different

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.789 
the paint colors a little bit different
just<00:03:23.980> a<00:03:24.430> lighter<00:03:25.000> tone<00:03:25.329> of<00:03:25.540> gray<00:03:25.780> for<00:03:26.139> the<00:03:26.169> for

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
just a lighter tone of gray for the for

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.110 
just a lighter tone of gray for the for
the<00:03:26.859> new<00:03:26.980> style<00:03:27.220> scruffy<00:03:27.579> I'll<00:03:27.700> pull<00:03:27.910> them<00:03:27.970> up

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
the new style scruffy I'll pull them up

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.729 
the new style scruffy I'll pull them up
like<00:03:28.269> this<00:03:28.480> they<00:03:28.780> kind<00:03:28.959> of<00:03:29.079> look<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.260> same<00:03:29.380> but

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
like this they kind of look the same but

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.490 
like this they kind of look the same but
this<00:03:29.889> those<00:03:30.400> -<00:03:30.639> scruffy<00:03:31.349> definitely<00:03:32.349> has<00:03:32.470> a
