00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.860
 hello 'youtube' friends today I bring you an analysis to the latest game of 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.810
 sonic that is is the sonic sonic or that what I go sonic generations is 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.769
 a videogame of platforms in development of the series are investigated 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.939
 is currently being produced by sega and its launch is planned in 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.220
 2011 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the birth of sonic 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.359
 will be available on the xbox 360 pc playstation 3 platforms and one version 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.760
 exclusive for nintendo 3ds 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.760
 the argument is about a very different unknown enemy and that in 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.490
 principle has little to do with the doctor herman shows up and causes the 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.400
 appearance of time holes forcing sonic to travel back in the 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.090
 time and causing a temporary distortion in the process that of placing 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.360
 that past world 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.950
 as a result sonic will meet his sonic 20 years ago classic 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.060
 both must collaborate to defeat the mysterious enemy and repair this 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.740
 disturbance in time 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.980
 however the doctor is will also keep plans for the two injured and 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.350
 will ally together with his ancestor the robotniknik doctor his same being of yesteryear 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.400
 while at the same time they are allied with villains from the three different eras 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.140
 As for the gameplay for the desktop consoles the game presents 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.680
 levels based on 20 years of sonic history going through three eras 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.350
 the era of mega drive the era of ancasti the current modern era 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.960
 as for the nintendo 3ds version the levels will be based on the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.130
 stages two of the hera mega drive mixed with the edar en boí advance and 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.469
 also the two commas 5 since the more modern era of nds 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.000
 Each level can be played by the two versions of classic sonic sonic 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.780
 classics or neither wanted nor modern modern sonic that will be the only characters 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.130

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.720
 both sonic will be playable on all levels but everyone will take their own 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:53.409
 route 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.659
 for high definition consoles the classic sonic levels will have 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.439
 a strictly two-dimensional gameplay presenting a control 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.220
 similar to the classic megadrive titles and movements of that era 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.460
 as the spin attack makes them look good 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.240
 sony modern however who on levels with sections in 3d and two commas 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.870
 five of them similar to recent titles like sonic unleashed and sonic 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.400
 colors 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.629
 and it will count skills like him or mine tac attack drone and the sonic 2 that 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.049
 boosted / accelerated the phases of the game as well as the final bosses 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.300
 of phase will be inspired in the whole history of video games of sonic 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.169
 appeared in the main consoles of desktop 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:35.519
 those considered as videogames canon leaving aside the consoles of 8 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.659
 bits and thorns 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.529
 being entirely recreated and with musical themes remixed and restored 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:46.119
 so far the only confirmed levels and final heads have been grimly 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:48.469

 ps3 xbox 360 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.790
 the heads of the grin id and kate sites have not yet been confirmed 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.879
 the only confirmed has been vicar 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.459
 boss of the unt base in the version of the 3ds but something that is worth noting is that 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.670
 in citi escape with classic sonic in the gameplay you see a sign that says 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.780
 chaos inés pérez 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.930
 2 perfect osses bat for revenge that translated is chaos in space 2 chaos 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.580
 perfect has returned for revenge I dared that sega will be telling us hidden to mind 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.590
 what chaos will come back 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.389
 there is still time to know how to hold it 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.540
 good, let's continue 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.199
 it has not been confirmed if there will be more characters 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:50.239
 but the ones we obviously will see for sure are metal sonic the ix useless 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.089
 shadow and me good at least my would like to see them xd would also be 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:58.799
 well they will add forgotten characters from old consoles like 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.969
 metal meets I went to korn michetti radi i over siones of characters 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:07.889
 current my final verdict and five-star ratings of five 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.089
 because then many sonic fans simply love the idea of ​​going back to 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:16.359
 play with the sonic that we all know and love as well as levels and themes 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.479
 restored from this one so I recommend them a lot especially to the 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.469
 followers of the sonic saga 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:26.429
 good friends here finished my analysis since it is a very new game and not 

00:04:26.429 --> 00:04:30.520

00:04:30.519 --> 00:04:34.509
