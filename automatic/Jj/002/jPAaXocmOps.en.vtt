00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
application is running so I'm just going

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.529 
application is running so I'm just going
to<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.399> closing<00:00:59.640> each<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.059> every<00:01:00.239> application

that<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.930> running<00:01:01.170> here<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:02.670> keep<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
that is running here and to keep the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.870 
that is running here and to keep the
test<00:01:03.690> simple<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.619> know<00:01:04.739> kind<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.159> great

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
test simple and you know kind of great

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.570 
test simple and you know kind of great
and<00:01:06.740> now<00:01:07.740> I'm<00:01:07.830> going<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.100> running<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
and now I'm going to be running the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.820 
and now I'm going to be running the
speed<00:01:08.820> test<00:01:09.180> application<00:01:09.780> for<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.470> iPhone

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
speed test application for the iPhone

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.010 
speed test application for the iPhone
and<00:01:11.070> let's<00:01:11.580> take<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.850> look<00:01:12.060> at<00:01:12.240> what<00:01:12.270> speed<00:01:12.750> to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
and let's take a look at what speed to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.490 
and let's take a look at what speed to
water<00:01:13.200> pond<00:01:13.380> has<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.680> offer<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.159> us<00:01:18.409> so<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
water pond has to offer for us so the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.399 
water pond has to offer for us so the
latency<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.130> pretty<00:01:20.369> good<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.880> 143<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.869> you

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
latency is pretty good it's 143 and you

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.080 
latency is pretty good it's 143 and you
know<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> speeds<00:01:22.920> are<00:01:23.189> pretty<00:01:23.430> much<00:01:23.580> higher

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
know the speeds are pretty much higher

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.080 
know the speeds are pretty much higher
than<00:01:24.479> every<00:01:25.320> carrier<00:01:25.530> out<00:01:25.830> there<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.430> gives<00:01:26.820> up

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
than every carrier out there it gives up

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.929 
than every carrier out there it gives up
real<00:01:27.390> good<00:01:27.420> speed<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.049> 3.9<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.950> even<00:01:29.400> for<00:01:29.700> as

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
real good speed of 3.9 and even for as

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.069 
real good speed of 3.9 and even for as
you<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.180> see<00:01:30.329> here<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.930> highest

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
you can see here this is the highest

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.350 
you can see here this is the highest
internet<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:31.950> get<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.460> our<00:01:32.610> 3G<00:01:33.000> service

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
internet you can get on our 3G service

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.810 
internet you can get on our 3G service
in<00:01:33.570> India<00:01:33.810> as<00:01:34.170> far<00:01:34.409> as<00:01:34.530> I'm<00:01:34.680> concerned<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:35.460> any

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820

in India as far as I'm concerned on any
carrier<00:01:36.119> possible<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.049> even<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.770> upload

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
carrier possible and even the upload

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.100 
carrier possible and even the upload
speeds<00:01:38.400> are<00:01:38.549> pretty<00:01:38.790> much<00:01:38.909> great<00:01:39.240> they<00:01:39.750> have

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
speeds are pretty much great they have

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.840 
speeds are pretty much great they have
you<00:01:40.259> know<00:01:40.290> sometimes<00:01:40.890> go<00:01:41.100> up<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.340> two<00:01:41.520> points

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
you know sometimes go up to two points

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.190 
you know sometimes go up to two points
something<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.210> make<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> bits<00:01:42.540> per<00:01:42.720> second<00:01:43.079> and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
something to make a bits per second and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.649 
something to make a bits per second and
these<00:01:43.799> are<00:01:44.159> pretty<00:01:44.430> much<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.790> know<00:01:44.820> great

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
these are pretty much you know great

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.139 
these are pretty much you know great
speeds<00:01:46.229> if<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.710> are<00:01:46.890> looking<00:01:47.220> for<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.610> nice<00:01:47.970> or
