won't be using for this task here is a
standard<00:00:26.850> bench<00:00:27.029> grinder<00:00:27.390> now<00:00:27.570> if<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.779> may

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
standard bench grinder now if you may

standard bench grinder now if you may
notice<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.770> a<00:00:28.890> rather<00:00:29.040> large

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
notice here this is a rather large

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.040 
notice here this is a rather large
chisel<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.030> can<00:00:30.180> see<00:00:30.360> when<00:00:30.630> just<00:00:30.810> holding

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
chisel and you can see when just holding

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.840 
chisel and you can see when just holding
it<00:00:31.080> up<00:00:31.200> to<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.350> wheel<00:00:31.500> here<00:00:31.770> it's<00:00:32.520> almost

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
it up to the wheel here it's almost

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.330 
it up to the wheel here it's almost
exactly<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.780> same<00:00:34.020> width<00:00:34.260> as<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.470> wheel<00:00:34.800> but

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
exactly the same width as the wheel but

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.710 
exactly the same width as the wheel but
what<00:00:35.550> we'll<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.820> doing<00:00:35.940> here<00:00:36.360> for<00:00:36.600> this

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
what we'll be doing here for this

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.689 
what we'll be doing here for this
procedure<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.350> when<00:00:38.190> sharpening<00:00:38.460> these

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
procedure is when sharpening these

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.750 
procedure is when sharpening these
chisel<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.180> always<00:00:39.420> want<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.690> maintain<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.760> 60

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
chisel you always want to maintain a 60

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
degree angle towards the tip here now

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.160

that<00:00:44.070> ensures<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.760> tip<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.420> durable<00:00:45.989> but

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
that ensures that the tip is durable but

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.020 
that ensures that the tip is durable but
it's<00:00:46.409> also<00:00:46.710> sharp<00:00:47.040> enough<00:00:47.309> where<00:00:47.580> it<00:00:47.729> is<00:00:47.850> going

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
it's also sharp enough where it is going

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.719 
it's also sharp enough where it is going
to<00:00:48.089> be<00:00:48.570> able<00:00:48.659> to<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.050> job<00:00:49.400> now<00:00:50.400> if<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.580> go

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729 
to be able to do the job now if you go

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:52.549 
to be able to do the job now if you go
any<00:00:51.420> more<00:00:51.570> sharper<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.140> tip<00:00:52.320> what<00:00:52.440> can

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
any more sharper of a tip what can

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.899 
any more sharper of a tip what can
happen<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:53.040> wear<00:00:53.220> out<00:00:53.309> over<00:00:53.339> time<00:00:53.670> won't

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
happen this can wear out over time won't

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.340 
happen this can wear out over time won't
be<00:00:54.000> as<00:00:54.089> durable<00:00:54.300> now<00:00:54.960> if<00:00:55.019> you<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.199> any

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
be as durable now if you go any

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.710 
be as durable now if you go any
shallower<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.830> a<00:00:55.920> tip<00:00:56.150> obviously<00:00:57.150> it<00:00:57.390> won't<00:00:57.510> do

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
shallower of a tip obviously it won't do

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.600 
shallower of a tip obviously it won't do
its<00:00:57.870> job<00:00:58.049> either

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
its job either

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.979 
its job either
now<00:00:59.610> when<00:00:59.970> sharpening<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.479> here<00:01:00.659> we<00:01:00.780> want<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
now when sharpening this here we want to

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.630 
now when sharpening this here we want to
use<00:01:01.170> one<00:01:01.650> hand<00:01:01.860> on<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.040> front<00:01:02.159> side<00:01:02.430> here<00:01:02.460> just

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
use one hand on the front side here just

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.770 
use one hand on the front side here just
to<00:01:02.850> hold<00:01:02.970> in<00:01:03.120> place<00:01:03.150> and<00:01:03.479> what<00:01:03.570> we'll<00:01:03.659> do<00:01:03.750> is

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
to hold in place and what we'll do is

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.119 
to hold in place and what we'll do is
we'll<00:01:03.960> move<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.199> back<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.589> forth<00:01:04.650> because

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
we'll move it back and forth because

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.430 
we'll move it back and forth because
that<00:01:05.370> ensures<00:01:05.640> even<00:01:06.030> where<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:07.020> wheel<00:01:07.200> and

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
that ensures even where on the wheel and

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.830 
that ensures even where on the wheel and
it<00:01:08.250> also<00:01:08.400> ensures<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:08.880> we<00:01:09.270> don't<00:01:09.299> have<00:01:09.659> any

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
it also ensures that we don't have any

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.960 
it also ensures that we don't have any
edges<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.770> outside<00:01:11.130> here<00:01:11.340> even<00:01:11.610> if<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.820> do

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
edges on the outside here even if we do

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.180 
edges on the outside here even if we do
try<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.270> shut<00:01:12.540> eye<00:01:12.780> ball<00:01:13.530> out<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.920> Center

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
try to shut eye ball out here to Center

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.920 
try to shut eye ball out here to Center
it<00:01:14.310> up<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.850> doesn't<00:01:15.180> guarantee<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.810> we'll

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
it up that doesn't guarantee it so we'll

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.300 
it up that doesn't guarantee it so we'll
just<00:01:16.049> move<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.320> back<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.619> forth<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> ensure

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
just move it back and forth to ensure

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.310 
just move it back and forth to ensure
that<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.940> surface<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.510> nicely<00:01:18.750> ground<00:01:19.080> down

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
that the surface is nicely ground down

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.120 
that the surface is nicely ground down
and<00:01:19.880> again<00:01:20.880> I'll<00:01:21.270> also<00:01:21.600> have<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.950> hand<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and again I'll also have a hand on the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.370 
and again I'll also have a hand on the
backside<00:01:23.310> here<00:01:23.580> just<00:01:23.940> to<00:01:24.090> control<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.960> angle

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
backside here just to control that angle

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.810 
backside here just to control that angle
there<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.770> when<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:25.920> am<00:01:26.100> moving<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.490> back<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
there so when I am moving it back and

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.910 
there so when I am moving it back and
forth<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.690> does<00:01:27.960> ensure<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.410> I<00:01:28.470> am<00:01:28.620> doing<00:01:28.770> a

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
forth it does ensure that I am doing a

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:55.600 
forth it does ensure that I am doing a
proper

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.280 

well<00:01:56.240> when<00:01:56.390> I<00:01:56.480> was<00:01:56.570> sharpening<00:01:56.900> this<00:01:57.020> I<00:01:57.170> was

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
well when I was sharpening this I was

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.780 
well when I was sharpening this I was
also<00:01:57.590> going<00:01:57.740> on<00:01:57.950> angles<00:01:58.310> such<00:01:58.460> as<00:01:58.610> this

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
also going on angles such as this

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.060 
also going on angles such as this
towards<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.720> wheel<00:01:59.930> what<00:02:00.560> this<00:02:00.710> does<00:02:00.890> is<00:02:01.010> this

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
towards the wheel what this does is this

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.710 
towards the wheel what this does is this
pulls<00:02:01.400> the<00:02:01.520> material<00:02:01.970> away<00:02:02.180> from<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.540> chisel

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
pulls the material away from the chisel

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.690 
pulls the material away from the chisel
tip<00:02:03.050> so<00:02:03.230> it<00:02:03.320> doesn't<00:02:03.530> give<00:02:03.620> us<00:02:03.740> a<00:02:03.860> falsify<00:02:04.400> tip

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
tip so it doesn't give us a falsify tip

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.400 
tip so it doesn't give us a falsify tip
now<00:02:05.240> you<00:02:05.300> want<00:02:05.480> to<00:02:05.570> ensure<00:02:05.840> that<00:02:06.020> tip<00:02:06.230> is

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
now you want to ensure that tip is

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.750 
now you want to ensure that tip is
centered<00:02:06.800> up<00:02:06.920> you're<00:02:07.070> just<00:02:07.100> continuing<00:02:07.730> to

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
centered up you're just continuing to

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.150 
centered up you're just continuing to
flip<00:02:08.060> it<00:02:08.180> around<00:02:08.240> every<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:08.899> often<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.500> ensure

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
flip it around every so often to ensure

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.920 
flip it around every so often to ensure
everything<00:02:10.460> is<00:02:10.729> done<00:02:10.790> correctly<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.630> once

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
everything is done correctly and once

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.120 
everything is done correctly and once
you've<00:02:12.080> done<00:02:12.350> you<00:02:12.560> should<00:02:12.590> be<00:02:12.800> left<00:02:12.950> with<00:02:13.010> a

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
you've done you should be left with a

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.090 
you've done you should be left with a
final<00:02:13.430> product<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:13.820> looks<00:02:14.030> like<00:02:14.300> this<00:02:15.100> so

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
final product that looks like this so

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.230 
final product that looks like this so
this<00:02:16.160> concludes<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.610> rest<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.850> my<00:02:16.910> tutorial
