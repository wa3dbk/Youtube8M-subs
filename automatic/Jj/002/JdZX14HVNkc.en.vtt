00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hi my name is Idar I am the author of the site 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.410
 million guitar point ru 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.480
 In this video I want to tell you about 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.269
 such important skills as mine 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.109
 inviting and jamming strings and also 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.130
 I will show what is the difference but first why 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.080
 it needs to be done so an invitation 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.060
 It is necessary as if you do not 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.330
 will invite strings especially 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.810
 the basic ones that are the thickest 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.020
 your game may have a lot 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.969
 various unnecessary sounds that are not 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.160
 recommended 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.899
 so it's important to learn how to play with 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.710
 an invitation to filter this 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.770
 most not needed for stunning help 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.350
 bring into your game 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.410
 a different sound from what you 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.160
 usually play and if you play heavy 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.949
 styles that also without killing you in any way 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.620
 don't get along well let's first on 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.250
 close-up, I will explain to you how to 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.280
 invite country and so mute 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.780
 to execute the invitation first 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.850
 put your hand on bliss bliss is something 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.150
 where the strings come from 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.740
 here she is catching 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.350
 hand on the breeze and look 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.350
 a place that is too light 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.619
 bite the strings but without doing so 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.509
 sound 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.509
 absolutely deaf for example 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:42.600
 it is correct it when the thick do not carry the soul 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:45.570
 not a completely different sound of pain 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.119
 deaf so place your hand closer to 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:58.200
 to the base of the prince himself about this 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:02:02.880
 range and start playing playing 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.179
 simple chords muffling too 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.920
 important as when presenting a chord 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.890
 there may be extra sounds that 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.060
 undesirable playing with an invitation you 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:18.380
 rid yourself of these unnecessary overtones 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:22.230
 so now stunned filth they are made 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.480
 also, but you need to put your hand in a bit 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.110
 farther if earlier we cooked at the very 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.269
 the grounds 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.260
 now need to take somewhere closer 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.450
 hand pickups a little further from 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.790
 shave that is about here in this 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.900
 position 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.900
 power hand and play 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.989
 the sound of pain is deaf and its sound is not very 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.870
 long 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:57.349
 At first, most likely you will be uncomfortable 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.680
 understand where muffling where muffling what 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:04.150
 why and why, why just pay 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.430
 this time and look for the difference between 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.310
 invitation to not jamming sounds when 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.069
 mute should be heard but when 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.280
 this must have led the hours a little 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:25.459
 so that sli was not heard unnecessary background 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:30.470
 sounds play look and find 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:34.640
 this difference and then proceed to 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.430
 muffled by name how to muffle you without 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.180
 problems understand how to eat but 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.720
 this needs some time if 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.840
 you took 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.889
 electric guitar in the hands of the recently 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.139
 First of all, I recommend you 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:54.169
 understand how to mute these very incentives 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:58.099
 so as in for future development this 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:04:01.220
 very very important look and give 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.769
 about half an hour and you will understand how 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.340
 need to invite strings and after 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.650
 always keep this nuance it's great 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.430
 help filter your game from sand 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.440
 that is, dirty and unnecessary unnecessary teeth 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.650
 which should not receive when your 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.440
 the game if you hi hurt a little 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.349
 string and string while not 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.669
 exceed the arm and that and the screech will carry 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:30.680
 across the room or hall and well it will be 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.580
 sound not very good but if you with 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.080
 The moment you will invite then this cant 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.979
 pretty quickly fades out and quite 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:43.220
 perhaps no one will even notice him 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:45.410
 probably better that no one noticed 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.689
 so start to master the muffling 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.199
 and it will help you in 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:54.469
 still think all the stuff gu here 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:56.439
 extremely simple and straightforward and you immediately 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:05:01.659
 can put it into practice 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:01.659
 so I finish this lesson for now
