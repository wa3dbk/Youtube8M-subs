00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
you can see it's really smooth and you

00:00:35.849 --> 00:00:35.859 
it really has like a sense of isolation

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:37.950 
it really has like a sense of isolation
it<00:00:36.429> also<00:00:36.579> has<00:00:36.789> a<00:00:36.820> crossover<00:00:37.149> point<00:00:37.390> back<00:00:37.749> there

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
it also has a crossover point back there

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.349 
it also has a crossover point back there
which<00:00:38.140> I<00:00:38.289> love<00:00:38.530> and<00:00:38.769> then<00:00:39.489> a<00:00:39.550> smooth<00:00:39.879> descent

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:40.359 
which I love and then a smooth descent

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.479 
which I love and then a smooth descent
here<00:00:40.600> and<00:00:40.870> a<00:00:41.019> nice<00:00:41.230> curve<00:00:41.589> downwards<00:00:42.190> and<00:00:42.399> then

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
here and a nice curve downwards and then

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.819 
here and a nice curve downwards and then
a<00:00:42.519> 180<00:00:42.940> turn<00:00:43.239> which<00:00:43.989> will<00:00:44.109> be<00:00:44.230> really<00:00:44.499> good<00:00:44.649> for

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
a 180 turn which will be really good for

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.139 
a 180 turn which will be really good for
competitive<00:00:45.370> play<00:00:45.489> because<00:00:45.969> of<00:00:45.999> the

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
competitive play because of the

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.239 
competitive play because of the
collisions<00:00:46.659> it's<00:00:47.379> definitely<00:00:47.769> just<00:00:47.890> going<00:00:48.190> to

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:48.249 
collisions it's definitely just going to

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:49.860 
collisions it's definitely just going to
be<00:00:48.339> an<00:00:48.399> awesome<00:00:48.969> map<00:00:49.149> to<00:00:49.329> race<00:00:49.479> with<00:00:49.600> a<00:00:49.659> lot<00:00:49.809> of

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
smooth and it's got some aesthetics like

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.709 
smooth and it's got some aesthetics like
you<00:00:59.499> have<00:00:59.739> this<00:01:00.579> shield<00:01:01.059> altar<00:01:01.329> in<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:01.539> lap

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719

and then you coming back up here and up

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.500 
and then you coming back up here and up
here<00:01:05.770> you'll<00:01:06.100> see<00:01:06.310> like<00:01:06.460> a<00:01:06.490> rail<00:01:06.940> to<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.210> right

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
here you'll see like a rail to the right

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.030 
here you'll see like a rail to the right
and<00:01:07.720> I<00:01:07.780> don't<00:01:07.840> think<00:01:08.170> I<00:01:08.230> realized<00:01:08.500> that<00:01:08.800> that's

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
and I don't think I realized that that's

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.920 
and I don't think I realized that that's
meant<00:01:09.370> for<00:01:09.520> a<00:01:09.640> barrel<00:01:10.000> rolling<00:01:10.240> too<00:01:10.750> little

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
meant for a barrel rolling too little

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.430 
meant for a barrel rolling too little
third<00:01:11.320> lap<00:01:12.510> yeah<00:01:13.510> into<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:13.840> third<00:01:14.050> lap<00:01:14.230> and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
third lap yeah into the third lap and

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.690 
third lap yeah into the third lap and
here<00:01:14.710> you<00:01:14.830> hit<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.010> ground<00:01:15.250> you<00:01:15.490> hit<00:01:15.610> the

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
here you hit the ground you hit the

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.890 
here you hit the ground you hit the
ground<00:01:15.880> they're<00:01:16.030> really<00:01:16.360> hard<00:01:16.540> on<00:01:16.690> this

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
ground they're really hard on this

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.300 
ground they're really hard on this
basically<00:01:17.500> unless<00:01:17.770> you<00:01:17.890> go<00:01:18.010> on<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.160> barrel

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
basically unless you go on the barrel

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.060 
basically unless you go on the barrel
roll<00:01:18.640> which<00:01:19.360> is<00:01:19.390> quite<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:19.840> downfall<00:01:20.320> but<00:01:20.500> it

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
roll which is quite a downfall but it

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.250 
roll which is quite a downfall but it
reads<00:01:21.460> does<00:01:21.910> not<00:01:22.090> make<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.360> map<00:01:22.510> any<00:01:22.750> less

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
reads does not make the map any less

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.470 
reads does not make the map any less
awesome<00:01:23.710> it's<00:01:24.220> a<00:01:24.340> really<00:01:24.730> really<00:01:24.820> good<00:01:25.120> short

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
awesome it's a really really good short

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.890 
awesome it's a really really good short
map<00:01:25.690> because<00:01:25.990> my<00:01:26.290> smooth<00:01:26.590> stairs<00:01:26.920> there<00:01:27.250> I

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
map because my smooth stairs there I

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.600 
map because my smooth stairs there I
really<00:01:28.900> cannot<00:01:29.200> do<00:01:29.590> this<00:01:29.740> map<00:01:29.950> justice<00:01:30.400> in<00:01:30.520> the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
really cannot do this map justice in the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.480 
really cannot do this map justice in the
small<00:01:30.820> time<00:01:31.030> of<00:01:31.210> three<00:01:31.450> laps<00:01:31.690> and<00:01:31.930> in<00:01:32.920> my<00:01:33.460> er

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
small time of three laps and in my er

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.970 
small time of three laps and in my er
one<00:01:33.820> of<00:01:33.940> my<00:01:34.030> upcoming<00:01:34.210> episodes<00:01:34.930> I<00:01:35.260> actually

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
one of my upcoming episodes I actually

one of my upcoming episodes I actually
slowed<00:01:36.220> down<00:01:36.430> and<00:01:36.670> like<00:01:36.790> take<00:01:37.180> a<00:01:37.210> minute<00:01:37.540> it's

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
slowed down and like take a minute it's

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.510 
slowed down and like take a minute it's
look<00:01:37.810> at<00:01:37.870> the<00:01:37.990> aesthetics<00:01:38.500> but<00:01:38.650> unfortunately

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520
