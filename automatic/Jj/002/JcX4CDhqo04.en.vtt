first from the block of topics about

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.290 
first from the block of topics about
errors<00:00:18.080> and<00:00:18.290> mistakes<00:00:18.380> in<00:00:18.830> running<00:00:19.160> in<00:00:20.000> post

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
errors and mistakes in running in post

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.540 
errors and mistakes in running in post
method<00:00:20.800> we<00:00:21.800> defined<00:00:22.250> error<00:00:23.090> and<00:00:23.480> mistake

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
method we defined error and mistake

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.819 
method we defined error and mistake
anything<00:00:25.550> what<00:00:25.849> deviates<00:00:26.750> from<00:00:27.050> the<00:00:27.529> polls

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:27.829 
anything what deviates from the polls

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.569 
anything what deviates from the polls
and<00:00:28.250> polls<00:00:28.550> is<00:00:29.149> our<00:00:29.450> standard<00:00:30.130> this<00:00:31.130> is<00:00:31.279> how

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
and polls is our standard this is how

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.120 
and polls is our standard this is how
mistakes<00:00:32.239> and<00:00:32.480> errors<00:00:32.660> defined<00:00:33.170> deviation

mistakes and errors defined deviation

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.549 
mistakes and errors defined deviation
from<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.460> standard<00:00:34.489> and<00:00:35.360> we<00:00:35.570> using<00:00:35.960> suppose

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
from the standard and we using suppose

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.970 
from the standard and we using suppose
as<00:00:37.430> a<00:00:38.350> standard<00:00:39.350> for<00:00:40.300> define<00:00:41.300> how<00:00:42.230> big<00:00:42.620> error

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
as a standard for define how big error

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.770 
as a standard for define how big error
and<00:00:43.460> what<00:00:44.120> kind<00:00:44.420> of<00:00:44.540> error<00:00:44.900> is<00:00:45.500> it<00:00:45.770> so<00:00:46.780> suppose

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
and what kind of error is it so suppose

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.740 
and what kind of error is it so suppose
I<00:00:48.580> would<00:00:49.580> like<00:00:49.700> to<00:00:49.850> demonstrate<00:00:50.030> this<00:00:50.420> for<00:00:50.630> you

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
I would like to demonstrate this for you

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.160 
I would like to demonstrate this for you
the<00:00:51.140> pulse<00:00:51.440> is<00:00:52.100> a<00:00:52.190> standard<00:00:52.930> anything<00:00:53.930> will

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
the pulse is a standard anything will

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.190 
the pulse is a standard anything will
deviate<00:00:54.590> from<00:00:54.880> this<00:00:55.880> position<00:00:56.120> when<00:00:56.720> you<00:00:56.930> on

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
deviate from this position when you on

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.060 
deviate from this position when you on
the<00:00:57.320> ground<00:00:57.560> is<00:00:58.490> error<00:00:59.030> and<00:00:59.590> there<00:01:00.590> are<00:01:00.680> time

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
the ground is error and there are time

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.940 
the ground is error and there are time
space<00:01:01.730> and<00:01:02.200> efforts<00:01:03.220> errors<00:01:05.409> space<00:01:06.409> errors<00:01:06.770> it

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
space and efforts errors space errors it

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.300 
space and efforts errors space errors it
would<00:01:07.280> be<00:01:07.430> like<00:01:07.610> there<00:01:07.960> if<00:01:08.960> you<00:01:09.829> land

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.180 

if<00:01:13.310> you<00:01:13.490> land<00:01:13.730> on<00:01:13.910> the<00:01:14.090> hill<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:15.380> you're

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
if you land on the hill and you're

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.210 
if you land on the hill and you're
staying<00:01:16.520> in<00:01:16.730> this<00:01:16.850> position<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:18.710> first<00:01:18.950> thing

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
staying in this position the first thing

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.300 
staying in this position the first thing
what<00:01:19.460> will<00:01:19.670> happen<00:01:20.120> that<00:01:20.150> you<00:01:20.420> could<00:01:20.570> not<00:01:21.310> fall

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
what will happen that you could not fall

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.370 
what will happen that you could not fall
in<00:01:22.700> I<00:01:23.330> don't<00:01:23.390> get<00:01:23.660> a<00:01:23.690> straight<00:01:23.900> for<00:01:24.140> you<00:01:24.230> this

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
in I don't get a straight for you this

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.880 
in I don't get a straight for you this
is<00:01:24.650> very<00:01:24.830> simple<00:01:25.400> thing<00:01:25.870> which<00:01:26.870> covered<00:01:27.380> up<00:01:27.530> by

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
is very simple thing which covered up by

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.590 
is very simple thing which covered up by
momentum<00:01:28.220> of<00:01:28.550> the<00:01:28.640> body<00:01:28.760> delivering<00:01:29.450> you

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
momentum of the body delivering you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.160 
momentum of the body delivering you
forward<00:01:30.290> but<00:01:31.130> if<00:01:31.580> there<00:01:32.090> is<00:01:32.240> no<00:01:32.420> momentum<00:01:32.750> you

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
forward but if there is no momentum you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.470 
forward but if there is no momentum you
understand<00:01:33.650> that<00:01:34.190> you<00:01:34.400> cannot<00:01:34.700> fall<00:01:35.000> forward

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
understand that you cannot fall forward

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.710 
understand that you cannot fall forward
so<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.860> main<00:01:37.100> thing<00:01:37.490> came<00:01:37.790> to<00:01:38.300> be<00:01:38.480> in<00:01:38.630> a

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
so the main thing came to be in a

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.560 
so the main thing came to be in a
position<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.410> solve<00:01:39.620> anything<00:01:40.610> what<00:01:41.030> deviate

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
position to solve anything what deviate

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.250 
position to solve anything what deviate
you<00:01:42.320> from<00:01:42.400> the<00:01:43.400> ability<00:01:43.910> to<00:01:43.940> fall<00:01:44.330> is<00:01:44.690> mistake

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
you from the ability to fall is mistake

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.620 
you from the ability to fall is mistake
it<00:01:45.770> could<00:01:46.040> be<00:01:46.250> just<00:01:46.880> like<00:01:47.270> their<00:01:47.600> position<00:01:48.229> or

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
it could be just like their position or

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.430 
it could be just like their position or
just<00:01:50.630> like<00:01:51.530> their<00:01:51.830> left<00:01:52.700> position<00:01:53.200> it's<00:01:54.200> all

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
just like their left position it's all

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.730 
just like their left position it's all
deviation<00:01:55.100> from<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:55.580> poles<00:01:55.930> because<00:01:56.930> a<00:01:57.170> game

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
deviation from the poles because a game

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.300 
deviation from the poles because a game
to<00:01:57.979> fall<00:01:58.940> you<00:01:59.420> have<00:01:59.690> to<00:01:59.900> bring<00:02:00.140> your<00:02:00.380> foot<00:02:00.710> here

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
to fall you have to bring your foot here

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.330 
to fall you have to bring your foot here
under<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:01.940> body<00:02:02.150> and<00:02:02.420> then<00:02:02.630> on<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:02.930> floor<00:02:03.340> if

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
under the body and then on the floor if

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.330 
under the body and then on the floor if
you<00:02:04.660> then<00:02:06.130> came<00:02:07.130> here<00:02:07.640> in<00:02:08.450> your<00:02:08.899> laid<00:02:09.709> with<00:02:10.160> the

you then came here in your laid with the
pole<00:02:11.830> then<00:02:12.830> another<00:02:13.760> error<00:02:14.390> happened
