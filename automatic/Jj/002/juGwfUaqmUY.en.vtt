 table and I had to do so how many 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:13.070
 filming attempts because I have the 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.870
 cell phone I throw in my cell phone 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.169
 in the enamel arena to do this 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.169

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.900
 Y 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.970
 I have better hair because you have to 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.120
 magically after the last time that I 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.930
 I will make for publicly fixed rhone 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.790
 well the help was pathetic tired with 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.620
 dark circles said ball now at least 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.089
 then the mascara for this video 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.430
 little lip asks this this card me 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:53.100
 He sent a lot of products so that I 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.739
 I tried my head to see if they could 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.329
 help so be cool then 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.780

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.780
 they send this I go I work I go to 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.539
 make as a cover a testing of 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.899
 How about so for now 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:12.869
 giving me giving applying type almost 4 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.840
 I do not know if I five times I'm not 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.310
 putting caps that well you to simple 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.100
 view does not seem to have many 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.950
 changes but I can tell you that my 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.320
 skin is that you're never telling me anything 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.899
 super type everything what the 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.030
 nutrients that he is giving so the 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.280
 truth that comes quite well I 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.950
 It is happy because it has been not as 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.200
 it's so porous 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.840
 I will have to continue giving giving 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.659
 because of course I put myself four times, I did not 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:48.030
 I will continue to make the report now 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:50.520
 see what wave look laughed 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.670
 it's working now it was also asked 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.260
 skeptical as I said because now 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.740
 same I'm getting that I put it to the 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:02.280
 shampoo that I come using this that is to say that 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.290
 this is not really much and I'm 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.390
 being three times a week that this 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.899
 rinse cream is the pp 'la caixa' adds 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.899
 two tips 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.700
 Well, I put this on 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.220
 I think this is what most will 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.950
 Usually complex like half an hour apart 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.680
 so that he sucks well yet that he has 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.300
 for a kingdom with this one that is also 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.020
 all everything 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.630
 it comes as sucking sucking and 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.160
 feeding poor hair so now 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.100
 well next week green does not go to 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.530
 the step hairdresser make this color 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.660
 I do not know what I'm going to do but 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.440
 I will also be fine with hair and 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.450
 I will continue using the treatment this 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.640
 but that works so it was not 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.020
 worried because the hair is 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.590
 has been responding well 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.959
 I'm going to try and like two months three 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.880
 months I think it's a prudential time 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.040
 to do the test impost and power 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.730
 evaluate really but it's good 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.580
 directed I read future the truth that already 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.850
 began to change in the changes and apart 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.660
 is that I started the round tonight and kind 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.660
 2 for a micro 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.560
 and well I'm going to keep you informed 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.350
 that is done as it is evolving by 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.220
 now nothing good so we will continue with 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.220
 the testing chao
