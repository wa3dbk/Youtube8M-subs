right here well you are Chevron's that
launch<00:02:13.660> triangles<00:02:14.440> toward<00:02:14.860> they<00:02:15.610> are<00:02:15.700> not

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880

launch triangles toward they are not
actually<00:02:16.450> circles<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:17.170> will<00:02:17.590> not<00:02:17.709> reveal<00:02:17.980> how

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
actually circles I will not reveal how

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.190 
actually circles I will not reveal how
many<00:02:18.250> sides<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:19.270> is<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.420> polygon<00:02:19.840> with<00:02:20.050> many

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
many sides that is a polygon with many

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.850 
many sides that is a polygon with many
sides<00:02:20.819> in<00:02:21.819> 4k<00:02:22.360> resolution<00:02:22.569> you<00:02:23.290> can<00:02:23.319> probably

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
sides in 4k resolution you can probably

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.860 
sides in 4k resolution you can probably
see<00:02:24.220> it<00:02:24.340> much<00:02:24.489> better<00:02:24.670> this<00:02:24.940> is<00:02:25.000> only<00:02:25.209> 1080p

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
see it much better this is only 1080p

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.360 
see it much better this is only 1080p
though<00:02:26.050> I<00:02:26.290> don't<00:02:26.739> know<00:02:26.830> if<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:26.950> can<00:02:27.099> count<00:02:27.220> the

though I don't know if you can count the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.780 
though I don't know if you can count the

open your brain up so in video ball what

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.440 
open your brain up so in video ball what
can<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:44.950> new<00:02:45.250> player<00:02:45.489> expect<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.120> experience

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
can a new player expect to experience

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.360 
can a new player expect to experience
because<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:46.959> lot<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.170> people<00:02:47.319> hearing<00:02:48.100> about<00:02:48.250> it

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
because a lot of people hearing about it

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.470 
because a lot of people hearing about it
now<00:02:48.489> we're<00:02:48.700> gonna<00:02:48.760> check<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.150> out<00:02:49.239> and<00:02:49.390> play

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
now we're gonna check it out and play

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.850 
now we're gonna check it out and play
for<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.750> first<00:02:49.900> time<00:02:50.110> what<00:02:50.350> can<00:02:50.500> they<00:02:50.650> expect

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
for the first time what can they expect

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.340 
for the first time what can they expect
to<00:02:51.400> have<00:02:51.610> for<00:02:51.910> a<00:02:51.940> time<00:02:52.120> so<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.840> idea<00:02:53.140> of<00:02:53.200> the

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
to have for a time so the idea of the

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.820 
to have for a time so the idea of the
game<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:53.799> is<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.010> real<00:02:54.280> time<00:02:54.540> strategy

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
game is that it is a real time strategy

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.800 
game is that it is a real time strategy
shooting<00:02:56.830> sports<00:02:57.370> game<00:02:57.670> so<00:02:58.239> there's<00:02:58.480> as<00:02:58.599> much

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
shooting sports game so there's as much

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.110 
shooting sports game so there's as much
like<00:02:59.349> I<00:02:59.620> mean<00:02:59.950> this<00:03:00.069> sounds<00:03:00.340> like<00:03:00.519> I'm<00:03:00.760> kind<00:03:01.030> of

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
like I mean this sounds like I'm kind of

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.759 
like I mean this sounds like I'm kind of
being<00:03:01.299> a<00:03:01.390> jerk<00:03:01.420> by<00:03:01.870> like<00:03:02.080> putting<00:03:02.380> it<00:03:02.440> into<00:03:02.560> too

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
being a jerk by like putting it into too

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.680 
being a jerk by like putting it into too
many<00:03:02.920> words<00:03:03.099> but<00:03:03.430> there<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:03.940> as<00:03:04.120> much<00:03:04.299> strategy

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
many words but there is as much strategy

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.229 
many words but there is as much strategy
as<00:03:05.170> there<00:03:05.410> is<00:03:05.590> shooting<00:03:06.099> and<00:03:06.310> there<00:03:06.940> is<00:03:07.060> as

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
as there is shooting and there is as

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.479 
as there is shooting and there is as
much<00:03:07.360> sports<00:03:07.840> as<00:03:08.140> there<00:03:08.410> is<00:03:08.560> strategy<00:03:09.010> and

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
much sports as there is strategy and

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.470 
much sports as there is strategy and
shooting<00:03:10.000> so<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:12.459> original<00:03:12.670> idea<00:03:12.970> for<00:03:13.390> this

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
shooting so the original idea for this

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.620 
shooting so the original idea for this
was<00:03:13.720> I<00:03:13.930> wanted<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.290> make<00:03:14.380> a<00:03:14.709> Starcraft<00:03:15.519> a<00:03:16.000> game

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
was I wanted to make a Starcraft a game

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.750 
was I wanted to make a Starcraft a game
as<00:03:16.780> deep<00:03:17.049> as<00:03:17.230> Starcraft<00:03:17.829> that<00:03:18.070> used<00:03:18.280> only<00:03:18.400> one

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
as deep as Starcraft that used only one

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.810 
as deep as Starcraft that used only one
button<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.769> all<00:03:20.769> of<00:03:21.010> my<00:03:21.100> ideas<00:03:21.459> were<00:03:21.579> really

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
button and all of my ideas were really

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.660 
button and all of my ideas were really
bad<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.540> there<00:03:22.780> were<00:03:22.959> it's<00:03:23.530> just<00:03:23.890> like<00:03:24.040> kind

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
bad and there were it's just like kind

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.160 
bad and there were it's just like kind
of<00:03:24.730> like<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.030> field<00:03:25.329> is<00:03:25.510> like<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.660> pinball

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
of like the field is like a pinball

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.479 
of like the field is like a pinball
machine<00:03:26.560> where<00:03:26.590> you're<00:03:26.890> holding<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.250> button

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
machine where you're holding a button

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:28.979 
machine where you're holding a button
and<00:03:27.579> there's<00:03:27.700> like<00:03:27.819> flippers<00:03:28.269> and<00:03:28.450> you<00:03:28.780> want

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
and there's like flippers and you want

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.270 
and there's like flippers and you want
you<00:03:29.109> hold<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.380> button<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:29.650> your<00:03:29.769> thing<00:03:29.920> spins

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
you hold the button and your thing spins

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.590 
you hold the button and your thing spins
around<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:30.760> you<00:03:30.819> let<00:03:30.970> go<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.150> release<00:03:31.450> the

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
around and you let go to release the

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.690 
around and you let go to release the
unit<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.079> I<00:03:32.500> made<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:32.980> bunch<00:03:33.160> of<00:03:33.280> weird<00:03:33.519> little

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
unit and I made a bunch of weird little

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.550 
unit and I made a bunch of weird little
real-time<00:03:34.060> strategy<00:03:34.359> prototypes<00:03:35.200> like<00:03:35.350> that

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
real-time strategy prototypes like that

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.280 
real-time strategy prototypes like that
but<00:03:35.799> uh<00:03:35.829> this<00:03:36.579> is<00:03:36.730> definitely<00:03:37.140> absolutely<00:03:38.140> not

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
but uh this is definitely absolutely not

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.770 
but uh this is definitely absolutely not
that<00:03:38.319> and<00:03:38.769> me<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.489> Bennet<00:03:40.030> fadi<00:03:40.299> made<00:03:40.630> them

because<00:04:41.080> you're<00:04:41.410> playing<00:04:41.560> video<00:04:41.860> ball<00:04:42.250> at<00:04:42.490> the

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
because you're playing video ball at the

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.100 
because you're playing video ball at the
end<00:04:42.730> of<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:42.910> day<00:04:43.060> you're<00:04:43.690> still<00:04:43.960> playing

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
end of the day you're still playing

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.460 
end of the day you're still playing
video<00:04:44.320> ball<00:04:44.650> yeah<00:04:45.540> so<00:04:46.540> there's<00:04:46.870> again<00:04:47.110> there's

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
video ball yeah so there's again there's

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.810 
video ball yeah so there's again there's
there's<00:04:47.740> this<00:04:47.860> strategy<00:04:48.340> think<00:04:48.550> of<00:04:48.669> these

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
there's this strategy think of these

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.090 
there's this strategy think of these
triangles<00:04:49.120> you're<00:04:49.630> launching<00:04:49.870> as<00:04:50.260> like<00:04:50.590> your

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
triangles you're launching as like your

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.400 
triangles you're launching as like your
units<00:04:51.639> right<00:04:52.270> so<00:04:52.450> you're<00:04:52.600> like<00:04:52.720> sending<00:04:53.229> out<00:04:53.350> a

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
units right so you're like sending out a

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.190 
units right so you're like sending out a
unit<00:04:54.060> imagine<00:04:55.060> that<00:04:55.210> this<00:04:55.330> game<00:04:55.570> started<00:04:55.900> out

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
unit imagine that this game started out

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.190 
unit imagine that this game started out
16<00:04:56.800> times<00:04:57.160> slower<00:04:57.729> than<00:04:57.880> it<00:04:58.240> is<00:04:58.360> now<00:04:58.630> which

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
16 times slower than it is now which

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.850 
16 times slower than it is now which
maybe<00:04:59.740> it<00:04:59.950> did<00:05:00.160> you<00:05:00.639> know<00:05:00.760> perhaps<00:05:01.030> it<00:05:01.419> did<00:05:01.860> but

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
maybe it did you know perhaps it did but

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.770 
maybe it did you know perhaps it did but
uh<00:05:02.889> and<00:05:03.280> you<00:05:03.580> just<00:05:03.729> kept<00:05:03.940> cranking<00:05:04.270> it<00:05:04.540> up<00:05:04.630> you

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
uh and you just kept cranking it up you

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.820 
uh and you just kept cranking it up you
know<00:05:04.870> that's<00:05:05.020> what<00:05:05.139> they<00:05:05.229> did<00:05:05.290> the<00:05:05.470> demons

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
know that's what they did the demons

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.860 
know that's what they did the demons
souls<00:05:06.100> it<00:05:06.700> was<00:05:06.820> originally<00:05:07.330> like<00:05:07.479> underwater

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
souls it was originally like underwater

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.290 
souls it was originally like underwater
and<00:05:08.169> they<00:05:08.229> just<00:05:08.410> kept<00:05:08.590> speeding<00:05:09.040> it<00:05:09.130> up<00:05:09.300> was

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
and they just kept speeding it up was

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.840 
and they just kept speeding it up was
originally<00:05:10.690> like<00:05:10.780> a<00:05:10.870> Kingsfield<00:05:11.440> game<00:05:11.680> so<00:05:12.130> so

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
originally like a Kingsfield game so so

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.330 
originally like a Kingsfield game so so
to<00:05:12.910> sum<00:05:13.270> up<00:05:13.300> on<00:05:13.540> video<00:05:13.810> ball<00:05:14.340> strategy

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
to sum up on video ball strategy

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.390 
to sum up on video ball strategy
creating<00:05:16.300> your<00:05:16.600> soldiers<00:05:17.169> who<00:05:17.500> are<00:05:17.530> your<00:05:18.130> ball

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400
