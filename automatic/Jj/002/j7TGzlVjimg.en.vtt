to<00:02:57.290> have<00:02:57.440> now<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.880> cons<00:02:59.770> not<00:03:00.770> really<00:03:01.250> any

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
to have now the cons not really any

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.850 
to have now the cons not really any
major<00:03:01.610> cons<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.180> only<00:03:02.330> one<00:03:02.480> that<00:03:02.630> I<00:03:02.720> do<00:03:03.440> have

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
major cons the only one that I do have

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.610 
major cons the only one that I do have
with<00:03:04.130> it<00:03:04.310> is<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.970> AC<00:03:05.330> adapter<00:03:05.959> sometimes<00:03:06.410> has

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
with it is the AC adapter sometimes has

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.759 
with it is the AC adapter sometimes has
a<00:03:06.650> tendency<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.400> slide<00:03:07.850> out<00:03:08.270> and<00:03:08.769> therefore

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
a tendency to slide out and therefore

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.460 
a tendency to slide out and therefore
causing<00:03:10.459> a<00:03:10.519> loss<00:03:10.670> of<00:03:10.910> power<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.450> pedal<00:03:11.870> I

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
causing a loss of power to the pedal I

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.310 
causing a loss of power to the pedal I
don't<00:03:12.950> know<00:03:13.160> that<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:14.030> AC<00:03:14.180> adapter<00:03:14.630> has<00:03:14.870> built

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
don't know that the AC adapter has built

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.660 
don't know that the AC adapter has built
for<00:03:15.530> this<00:03:15.620> powe<00:03:15.800> maybe<00:03:16.190> you<00:03:16.310> have<00:03:16.400> something

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
for this powe maybe you have something

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.210 
for this powe maybe you have something
different<00:03:16.850> it<00:03:17.300> might<00:03:17.660> fit<00:03:18.050> and<00:03:18.320> stay<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.010> bit

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
different it might fit and stay a bit

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.370 
different it might fit and stay a bit
more<00:03:19.370> secure<00:03:19.760> or<00:03:19.940> fusing<00:03:20.690> it<00:03:20.810> a<00:03:20.900> pedal<00:03:21.170> board

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
more secure or fusing it a pedal board

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.020 
more secure or fusing it a pedal board
it<00:03:21.709> might<00:03:21.950> not<00:03:22.100> be<00:03:22.220> an<00:03:22.310> issue<00:03:22.459> at<00:03:22.670> all<00:03:22.790> but

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
it might not be an issue at all but

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.010 
it might not be an issue at all but
that's<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.239> only<00:03:23.330> thing<00:03:23.450> I<00:03:23.810> observed
