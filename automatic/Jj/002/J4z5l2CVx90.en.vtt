00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
getting that wire fix like our last step

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.870 
getting that wire fix like our last step
was<00:02:43.880> um<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:45.410> want<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.680> get<00:02:45.830> this<00:02:46.070> wire<00:02:46.640> right

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
was um you want to get this wire right

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.040 
was um you want to get this wire right
here<00:02:46.940> this<00:02:47.269> yellow<00:02:47.540> wire<00:02:48.010> it's<00:02:49.010> very<00:02:49.130> small

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
here this yellow wire it's very small

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.870 
here this yellow wire it's very small
semi<00:02:51.050> easy<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.500> remove<00:02:51.709> I<00:02:52.010> believe<00:02:52.280> I<00:02:52.400> can<00:02:52.430> move

semi easy to remove I believe I can move

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.370 
semi easy to remove I believe I can move
it<00:02:52.970> without<00:02:53.120> pausing<00:02:53.480> camera<00:02:54.019> there<00:02:54.140> we<00:02:54.230> go

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
it without pausing camera there we go

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.670 
it without pausing camera there we go

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
everything is unplugged I believe this

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.280 
everything is unplugged I believe this
part<00:03:09.650> comes<00:03:10.100> up<00:03:10.310> first<00:03:10.750> so<00:03:11.750> we're<00:03:12.079> going<00:03:12.200> to

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
part comes up first so we're going to

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.289 
part comes up first so we're going to
kind<00:03:12.440> of<00:03:12.560> edge<00:03:13.130> it<00:03:13.340> out<00:03:13.489> here<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:13.940> make<00:03:14.269> sure

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
kind of edge it out here and make sure

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.270 
kind of edge it out here and make sure
that<00:03:14.660> this<00:03:14.810> wire<00:03:15.079> is<00:03:15.110> ready<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:15.799> least<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.190> be

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
that this wire is ready and least to be

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.509 
that this wire is ready and least to be
able<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.610> be<00:03:16.970> taken<00:03:17.360> out<00:03:17.680> so<00:03:18.680> here<00:03:18.860> we<00:03:18.980> go<00:03:19.010> I'm

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
then that is removed the power drive

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.130 
then that is removed the power drive
okay<00:03:30.680> after<00:03:31.280> that<00:03:31.459> we've<00:03:32.090> got<00:03:32.299> this<00:03:32.570> it's<00:03:32.989> very

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
okay after that we've got this it's very

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.630 
easy to remove it's very big as a matter
of<00:03:35.570> fact<00:03:35.660> on<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.079> front<00:03:36.500> where<00:03:36.799> the<00:03:36.829> xbox<00:03:37.400> sign

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
of fact on the front where the xbox sign

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.699 
of fact on the front where the xbox sign
is<00:03:37.850> right<00:03:38.120> here<00:03:38.390> and<00:03:38.570> actually<00:03:39.109> grab<00:03:39.470> that

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
is right here and actually grab that

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.560 
is right here and actually grab that
lift<00:03:40.430> it<00:03:40.579> right<00:03:40.609> up<00:03:40.910> out<00:03:41.150> of<00:03:41.180> there<00:03:41.420> like<00:03:41.600> that

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
lift it right up out of there like that

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.690 
lift it right up out of there like that
so<00:03:44.570> it<00:03:44.900> may<00:03:45.620> be<00:03:45.650> kind<00:03:46.010> of<00:03:46.070> wrapped<00:03:46.250> on<00:03:46.519> this

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
so it may be kind of wrapped on this

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.729 
so it may be kind of wrapped on this
cord<00:03:46.970> just<00:03:47.120> a<00:03:47.269> little<00:03:47.540> bit<00:03:47.660> this<00:03:48.140> gray<00:03:48.440> cord

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739
