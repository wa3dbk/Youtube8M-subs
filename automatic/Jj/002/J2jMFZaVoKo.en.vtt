axial piece of kit software can be a bit

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.080 
axial piece of kit software can be a bit
questionable<00:00:25.800> but<00:00:26.100> it's<00:00:26.279> got<00:00:26.580> everything<00:00:26.970> you

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
questionable but it's got everything you

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.590 
questionable but it's got everything you
need<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.560> four<00:00:28.560> channels<00:00:29.240> unload<00:00:30.240> the

need on it four channels unload the
unload<00:00:31.500> vca<00:00:31.920> filters<00:00:32.750> very<00:00:33.750> handy<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.800> for

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
unload vca filters very handy so for

and of course headphones on it q so this

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.709

ease of tractor and sort of the
flexibility<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.310> ableton<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:24.840> key<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.380> is

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
flexibility of ableton so key to this is

i'm<00:01:26.159> intending<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.670> use<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.869> apc40<00:01:29.030> not

i'm intending to use the apc40 not
really<00:01:30.479> kind<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.950> obvious<00:01:31.950> how<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.310> go<00:01:32.610> about

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
really kind of obvious how you go about

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.740 
really kind of obvious how you go about
setting<00:01:33.119> up<00:01:33.330> this<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:35.009> zone<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.659> so<00:01:36.659> the

setting up this and the zone for so the
way<00:01:36.869> I've<00:01:36.990> wired<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.409> through<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:38.659> this<00:01:39.659> in

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
way I've wired it through is this in

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.210 
way I've wired it through is this in
life<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.579> set<00:01:42.320> every<00:01:43.320> tribe<00:01:43.560> goes<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.799> master

to<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.869> bit<00:02:10.019> easier<00:02:10.310> also<00:02:11.310> means<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.760> can

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
to just a bit easier also means you can

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.640 
to just a bit easier also means you can
