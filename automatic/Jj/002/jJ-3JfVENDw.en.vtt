00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
through the ground and kind of dissed

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.400 
through the ground and kind of dissed
you<00:02:47.819> up<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:49.170> then<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:51.690> just<00:02:51.900> got<00:02:52.050> flying

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
through the air and you'll see in a

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.479 
through the air and you'll see in a
moment<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:56.220> have<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:56.670> land<00:02:56.910> on<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:59.120> green

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
moment you have to land on the green

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.990 
moment you have to land on the green
part<00:03:02.489> of<00:03:02.670> thee<00:03:02.970> O<00:03:03.470> code<00:03:04.470> myself<00:03:04.829> again<00:03:05.070> if<00:03:05.400> you

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
part of thee O code myself again if you

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.650 
part of thee O code myself again if you
land<00:03:06.239> on<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.510> green<00:03:06.720> part<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:08.660> platform
