00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.030
 MMM 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:13.359
 hello how am I with sumeria and I bring a game of bet concretely the 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.789
 game of weapons I imagine that everyone more or less already know him esperón well 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.869
 was delayed by a hundred given care taken care of behind deaths of the 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.989
 coecillo let's go over some basic things of this type of games that 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.539
 they are hilarious 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.470
 why I have a problem with the weapon game is that I am given 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.710
 very good at the beginning 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.590
 but he managed to flee deflating in this particular game see ten notes 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.899
 first weapons I make them 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.819
 effectively with a single death sentence is half the first one we 

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:42.949
 now passes to olympic cougar and to the head 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.100
 mt 5 submachine guns assault rifles two separate I'm very good but then 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.979
 came amy super mega archenemy that is reiterated and I'm stuck to 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:56.229
 the explosives for pasta suffers piece that task a lot of anger because I 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.249
 I think it's good for me to come up with this start at the same time that I'm still killing 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:04.239
 easy I think I think I'm good or where I want to contribute more 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:04.989
 money 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.500
 but he killed the games out always 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.640
 and disappointed locomotive nortes this game but I will tell you that there will be 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.950
 suspension now and only in the forum of 8 the n the n 14 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.770
 in front of the end the rookie cuts two wounded very very simple and good we're going to 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.509
 explain a little ccoo-to this of the betting games 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.509
 you decide with two short points of this you bet can be days 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.609
 can be thousand coupons in 10 thousand 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:35.619
 depending on how crazy you are and good that money is what the graveyard 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.659
 the participants if you get first you get 30 if there is second try of office 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.780
 made chairs third you take 12 or the proportion mirrors thousand pesos 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.200
 1200 by this procedure 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.970
 and if there were any of the last three, you do not get 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.050
 The good thing about this is that it does not affect your statistics or your victories 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.130
 had low death relation his accuracy nothing nothing of this just for 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.300
 hang out to learn he recommended it a lot to learn to 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.080
 use cameras percent different weapons and such and basically to 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.960
 have a good time, because here the machine gun was already killed by M60 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.280
 easily loyal table there is no but no god in eternal that I'm not given anything 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.899
 all right 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:16.539
 have one no I will not be able to vote next to the head of the rest of ages 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.189
 consumer this you see 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:20.769
 Velásquez learned 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.069
 they were there half the total rush I say destiny to the head the first to 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.489
 see if I get another equal and see if I'm going to win the game not because I was wearing a 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.629
 an advantage, but obviously not obviously it will not be 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.249
 It cost a lot to the one that was well targeted 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:40.239
 he died at the hands of another person 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.450
 recognized relationship was very very very wrong the issue of is to put his and very slow 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.830
 he said that killing the flight is a drama is a drama 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.150
 I like to think that I do it to give emotion to the games but the network 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.940
 the network here you say that I am very bad since nothing because your duty were 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.850
 eternal comebacks said that it is very good to learn just because I 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.359
 I dare never went to party as sneijder 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.430
 the whole game because I'm very bad hurt the team I'm frustrated 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.409
 citizens and a good way to learn 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.749
 before two shots in a row of 10 thousand my surprise because I thought that bonus 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:16.150
 before using them the angel of death after that of the two flanks that 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.649
 do they have changed with the last country for a rpg 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:23.319
 which then does not seem bad to me because the angel also the rpg I do not see it 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.829
 previously never and so a rabbit or weapons of 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.899
 you force yourself a little use it 

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:31.870
 until fatal by the way we fall very badly breath 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.870
 finally there he he the law and he 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.330
 the home seems to be bad too dramatic 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.050
 I like a lot of time it always comes out look at this system fabian oaks 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.350
 umap open and and it should be easy to kill with the explosives but I'm given 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.350
 bad here and there and there goes second in sucre goes first 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.919
 and good since they have put the rtg does not displease me is not bad 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.209
 I think it seems a good option here you have a law killed 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.669
 now the crossbow that in theory is quite easy but but the label 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:06.559
 emi publishing I almost give it here v and almost gave it this a span until the 

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:11.199
 right with his time there and playing cat and mouse and I get a thousand 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:12.940
 months of the arias when stabbed 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.220
 two or more deaths but the miles site to the other and kondo miles a gift that to 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.720
 times 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.820
 knock back a weapon which is a bitch especially if you've got 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.249
 my case leave snipers behind 

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:29.249
 and working and going backwards is not the worst thing that can happen to you from the 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:32.819
 north these games for me are funniest most of you 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:37.149
 sure you have already played and you know it well and such but it operates or not those that do not 

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:39.490
 you have done daring because you do not miss anything 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.370
 literally practically 10 points with two nothing 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.530
 iy is from another raisin very well you learn a lot I think that improvements 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.720
 there you have to go to Lopez because you can not change 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.530
 and well we got to the final stretch I said I would not disclose how the thing was going 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.449
 here I go first 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.289
 and good draw that nail the ballistic knife to win 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.380
 but as you will have deduced then neither 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.740
 little I'm good at the ballistic knife the temple in being here 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.160
 trying luck from afar I know I'm tied with 8 that is also 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.100
 with the ballistic knife because he has killed me with the colaba and this one so 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.599
 So much is there so good 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:18.339
 the end is coming I will try it I will try to kill whoever if killed 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:19.099
 won 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:20.340
 and there 2011 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.340
 you did still shot I'll win tomorrow yes yes 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:30.769
 I did not accept and the kid who was about to win did hit right in the 

00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:33.260
 At the same time I thought I had won but not 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:39.120
 the hotel is second a pity it was a shame 20 10 the other made 20 14 and a 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.480
 stabbing the phenomenon can those the betting game 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.290
 my name but it is also examples of other different ways within the 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.669
 bet but this is one of my favorites but think the spill this 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.310
 departure and I'll be back soon 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.660
 see you later
