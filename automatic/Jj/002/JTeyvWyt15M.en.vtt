really blame the credit crunch for an

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.800 
really blame the credit crunch for an
increase<00:01:56.550> in<00:01:56.580> rudeness<00:01:56.879> I<00:01:57.119> mean<00:01:57.269> I<00:01:57.360> remember

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
increase in rudeness I mean I remember

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.869 
increase in rudeness I mean I remember
during<00:01:57.959> the<00:01:58.170> 80s<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.769> soon<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.129> be<00:01:59.160> you<00:01:59.789> know

00:01:59.869 --> 00:01:59.879 
during the 80s is soon to be you know

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:01.910 
during the 80s is soon to be you know
lots<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.539> people<00:02:00.840> only<00:02:01.080> lots<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.679> money<00:02:01.860> and

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
lots of people only lots of money and

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.559 
lots of people only lots of money and
that<00:02:02.129> was<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.489> reason<00:02:02.519> they<00:02:02.940> were<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.300> rude

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
that was the reason they were so rude

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:04.999 
that was the reason they were so rude
cuz<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.810> didn't<00:02:04.019> care<00:02:04.170> about<00:02:04.200> honking<00:02:04.830> yeah

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
cuz I didn't care about honking yeah

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.550 
cuz I didn't care about honking yeah
yeah<00:02:05.310> no<00:02:05.519> I<00:02:05.550> think<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:06.780> take-home<00:02:07.319> message

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
yeah no I think the take-home message

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.100 
yeah no I think the take-home message
from<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> making<00:02:08.670> slap-happy<00:02:09.090> programs<00:02:09.780> was

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
from the making slap-happy programs was

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.350 
from the making slap-happy programs was
that<00:02:10.379> happiness<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.580> not<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:11.940> much<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.180> matter

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
that happiness is not so much a matter

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.509 
that happiness is not so much a matter
of<00:02:12.810> what<00:02:12.989> happens<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:13.950> what's<00:02:14.190> going<00:02:14.400> on

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
of what happens to you what's going on

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.309 
of what happens to you what's going on
around<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:15.030> it's<00:02:15.209> much<00:02:15.599> more<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.050> do<00:02:16.200> with

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
around you it's much more to do with

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.949 
around you it's much more to do with
your<00:02:16.470> own<00:02:16.709> attitude<00:02:17.670> towards<00:02:18.180> things<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.870> if

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
your own attitude towards things and if

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.660 
your own attitude towards things and if
you<00:02:19.019> take<00:02:19.170> things<00:02:19.319> like<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.709> economic<00:02:20.220> crisis

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
you take things like the economic crisis

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.830 
you take things like the economic crisis
is<00:02:20.760> very<00:02:20.970> interesting<00:02:21.330> if<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.450> look<00:02:21.540> for

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
is very interesting if you look for

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.170 
is very interesting if you look for
example<00:02:21.900> at<00:02:22.349> East<00:02:22.500> Germany<00:02:23.040> now<00:02:23.790> in<00:02:23.940> East

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
example at East Germany now in East

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.290 
example at East Germany now in East
Germany<00:02:24.500> unified<00:02:25.500> with<00:02:25.890> West<00:02:26.099> Germany<00:02:26.640> living

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
Germany unified with West Germany living

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.050 
Germany unified with West Germany living
standards<00:02:27.840> went<00:02:28.019> up<00:02:28.459> dramatically<00:02:29.459> but

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
standards went up dramatically but

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.979 
standards went up dramatically but
happiness<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.720> level<00:02:30.989> among<00:02:31.500> humans<00:02:32.129> dropped

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
happiness to level among humans dropped

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.270 
happiness to level among humans dropped
largely<00:02:33.989> because<00:02:34.379> they<00:02:34.530> were<00:02:34.590> then<00:02:34.800> comparing

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
largely because they were then comparing

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.550 
largely because they were then comparing
themselves<00:02:35.580> with<00:02:36.120> West<00:02:36.360> Germans<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.379> of

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
themselves with West Germans and of

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.660 
themselves with West Germans and of
course<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.769> West<00:02:37.920> gem<00:02:38.099> is<00:02:38.250> still<00:02:38.430> had<00:02:38.640> a

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
course the West gem is still had a

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.100 
course the West gem is still had a
slight<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.150> think<00:02:39.599> that<00:02:39.720> rather<00:02:39.989> than

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
slight I think that rather than

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.420 
slight I think that rather than
comparing<00:02:40.500> themselves<00:02:40.709> with<00:02:40.980> our<00:02:41.099> Eastern

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
comparing themselves with our Eastern

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.059 
comparing themselves with our Eastern
Europeans<00:02:41.909> so<00:02:42.690> happiness<00:02:43.680> it's<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.890> very

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
Europeans so happiness it's a very

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.610 
Europeans so happiness it's a very
curious<00:02:44.340> issue<00:02:44.940> it's<00:02:45.480> very<00:02:45.810> relative<00:02:46.319> it

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
curious issue it's very relative it

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.280 
curious issue it's very relative it
depends<00:02:46.980> on<00:02:47.069> who<00:02:47.190> you're<00:02:47.310> comparing

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
depends on who you're comparing

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.670 
depends on who you're comparing
for<00:02:48.890> example<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.760> certainly<00:02:50.120> there's<00:02:50.329> no

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
for example and certainly there's no

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.920 
for example and certainly there's no

that the relationship between money and

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.699 
that the relationship between money and

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
happiness is a complex one but if you

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.459 
happiness is a complex one but if you
