the<00:03:10.610> pout<00:03:10.879> the<00:03:11.360> power<00:03:11.569> is<00:03:11.750> a<00:03:11.810> bit<00:03:11.989> too<00:03:12.170> linear

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
the pout the power is a bit too linear

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.580 
the pout the power is a bit too linear
it's<00:03:12.769> powerful<00:03:13.220> but<00:03:14.050> see<00:03:15.050> this<00:03:15.290> is<00:03:15.349> the<00:03:15.500> thing

it's powerful but see this is the thing
you<00:03:15.830> know<00:03:16.069> you<00:03:17.060> can<00:03:17.209> get<00:03:17.330> a<00:03:17.360> really<00:03:17.780> powerful

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
you know you can get a really powerful

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.869 
you know you can get a really powerful
motorcycle<00:03:18.769> and<00:03:18.950> if<00:03:19.099> the<00:03:19.190> power<00:03:19.400> is<00:03:19.610> really

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
motorcycle and if the power is really

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.910 
motorcycle and if the power is really
linear<00:03:20.510> like<00:03:20.930> really<00:03:21.140> great<00:03:21.379> like<00:03:21.530> it's<00:03:21.680> like

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
linear like really great like it's like

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.860 
linear like really great like it's like
the<00:03:22.069> power<00:03:22.660> line<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:24.769> power<00:03:25.010> line<00:03:25.459> of<00:03:25.870> like

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
the power line the power line of like

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.660 
the power line the power line of like
the<00:03:26.989> horsepower<00:03:27.470> on<00:03:27.739> it<00:03:27.769> like<00:03:28.099> the<00:03:28.220> torque<00:03:28.519> if

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
the horsepower on it like the torque if

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.839 
the horsepower on it like the torque if
you<00:03:28.760> chart<00:03:29.120> it<00:03:29.269> out<00:03:29.420> if<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:30.170> power<00:03:30.349> is<00:03:30.500> really

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
you chart it out if the power is really

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.970 
you chart it out if the power is really
smoothly<00:03:31.849> rising<00:03:32.780> it<00:03:33.470> doesn't<00:03:33.680> matter<00:03:33.739> how

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
smoothly rising it doesn't matter how

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.199 
smoothly rising it doesn't matter how
powerful<00:03:34.190> it<00:03:34.610> is<00:03:34.640> it's<00:03:35.030> not<00:03:35.269> going<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.510> feel

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
powerful it is it's not going to feel

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.610 
powerful it is it's not going to feel
let<00:03:38.209> all<00:03:38.420> that<00:03:38.599> powerful<00:03:38.959> because<00:03:39.319> it's<00:03:39.500> such

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
let all that powerful because it's such

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.830 
let all that powerful because it's such

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
a gradual build even though it's even

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.839 
a gradual build even though it's even
though<00:03:41.930> you're<00:03:42.230> going<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.650> like<00:03:42.849> extreme

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
though you're going to like extreme

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.220 
though you're going to like extreme
amounts<00:03:44.329> of<00:03:45.880> torque<00:03:46.880> or<00:03:47.150> like<00:03:47.360> G<00:03:47.599> forces<00:03:47.959> or

amounts of torque or like G forces or
whatever<00:03:48.500> right<00:03:48.799> it's<00:03:49.700> just

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
whatever right it's just

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.679 
whatever right it's just
but<00:03:52.080> you<00:03:52.170> could<00:03:52.319> have<00:03:52.409> a<00:03:52.530> bike<00:03:52.709> with<00:03:53.069> less

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:53.689 
but you could have a bike with less

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:57.920 
but you could have a bike with less
power<00:03:54.689> but<00:03:55.230> it<00:03:56.129> hits<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:56.579> more<00:03:56.909> suddenly<00:03:57.750> more

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
power but it hits you more suddenly more

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.009 
power but it hits you more suddenly more
harshly<00:03:58.400> like<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.610> v-max<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.780> know<00:04:00.900> the

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
harshly like the v-max you know the

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.229 
harshly like the v-max you know the
b-max<00:04:01.409> it<00:04:01.650> has<00:04:01.799> power<00:04:02.340> kicks<00:04:02.670> in<00:04:02.790> at<00:04:02.909> a<00:04:03.000> certain

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
b-max it has power kicks in at a certain

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.420 
b-max it has power kicks in at a certain
point<00:04:03.540> where<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.349> like<00:04:04.530> there's<00:04:05.129> a<00:04:05.220> certain

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
point where it like there's a certain

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.339 
point where it like there's a certain
rpm<00:04:05.760> I<00:04:06.390> think<00:04:06.720> it's<00:04:06.840> like<00:04:06.930> around<00:04:07.019> eight

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
rpm I think it's like around eight

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.030 
rpm I think it's like around eight
thousand<00:04:07.799> or<00:04:07.890> so<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:09.739> where<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.829> pike

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
thousand or so and where the pike

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.000 
thousand or so and where the pike
switches<00:04:11.489> from<00:04:11.579> two<00:04:11.819> carburetors<00:04:12.209> 24<00:04:12.930> or<00:04:13.379> it's

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
switches from two carburetors 24 or it's

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.279 
switches from two carburetors 24 or it's
like<00:04:14.190> it's<00:04:14.909> equivalent<00:04:15.239> of<00:04:15.569> its<00:04:15.750> got<00:04:15.900> like<00:04:16.019> all

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
like it's equivalent of its got like all

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.580 
like it's equivalent of its got like all
rights<00:04:17.039> got<00:04:17.190> like<00:04:17.630> two<00:04:18.630> sets<00:04:18.870> of<00:04:18.989> jets<00:04:19.289> for

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
rights got like two sets of jets for

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.140 
rights got like two sets of jets for
each<00:04:19.650> carburetor<00:04:20.250> it's<00:04:20.579> got<00:04:20.729> like<00:04:20.850> smaller

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
each carburetor it's got like smaller

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.300 
each carburetor it's got like smaller
jets<00:04:21.539> for<00:04:21.780> like<00:04:21.930> under<00:04:22.139> 8,000<00:04:22.770> rpm<00:04:23.100> and<00:04:23.130> then

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
jets for like under 8,000 rpm and then

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.129 
jets for like under 8,000 rpm and then
when<00:04:23.400> you<00:04:23.460> hit<00:04:23.639> 8,000<00:04:24.120> rpm<00:04:24.449> there's<00:04:24.690> an<00:04:24.750> extra

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
when you hit 8,000 rpm there's an extra

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.980 
when you hit 8,000 rpm there's an extra
set<00:04:25.350> of<00:04:25.880> carbureted<00:04:26.880> jets<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.389> kick<00:04:27.600> in<00:04:27.780> and

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
set of carbureted jets that kick in and

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.770 
set of carbureted jets that kick in and
shoot<00:04:28.770> more<00:04:28.979> fuel<00:04:29.430> into<00:04:29.639> the<00:04:29.669> engine<00:04:29.729> and<00:04:30.630> then

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
shoot more fuel into the engine and then

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.300 
shoot more fuel into the engine and then
it<00:04:30.900> like<00:04:31.050> it<00:04:31.440> hits<00:04:31.650> you<00:04:31.770> like<00:04:31.800> a<00:04:31.949> kick<00:04:32.160> in<00:04:32.190> the

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
it like it hits you like a kick in the

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.760 
it like it hits you like a kick in the
chest<00:04:32.639> hear<00:04:33.479> anything<00:04:33.630> like<00:04:34.350> that's<00:04:34.530> that's

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
chest hear anything like that's that's

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.020 
chest hear anything like that's that's
not<00:04:34.860> that<00:04:35.190> but<00:04:35.310> that's<00:04:35.490> one<00:04:35.669> of<00:04:35.729> the<00:04:35.820> reasons

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
not that but that's one of the reasons

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.060 
not that but that's one of the reasons
why<00:04:36.120> that<00:04:36.240> bike<00:04:36.449> was<00:04:36.660> raved<00:04:37.350> about<00:04:37.560> you<00:04:37.949> know

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
why that bike was raved about you know

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.980 
why that bike was raved about you know
but<00:04:38.699> um<00:04:39.000> but<00:04:41.000> power<00:04:42.000> like<00:04:42.330> that<00:04:42.360> is<00:04:42.720> also

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
but um but power like that is also

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.450 
but um but power like that is also
somewhat<00:04:43.260> unsafe<00:04:43.710> because<00:04:44.010> you<00:04:44.220> don't<00:04:44.340> want

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
somewhat unsafe because you don't want

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.370 
somewhat unsafe because you don't want
to<00:04:44.520> be<00:04:44.610> taking<00:04:44.940> a<00:04:45.030> corner<00:04:45.539> or<00:04:45.810> something<00:04:45.990> and

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
to be taking a corner or something and

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.020 
to be taking a corner or something and
all<00:04:46.500> of<00:04:46.560> a<00:04:46.620> sudden<00:04:46.919> you<00:04:47.039> see<00:04:47.220> your<00:04:47.669> bike<00:04:47.820> goes

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
all of a sudden you see your bike goes

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.060 
all of a sudden you see your bike goes
from<00:04:48.180> like<00:04:48.389> four<00:04:48.660> carburetors<00:04:49.080> 28<00:04:49.620> you<00:04:49.979> know

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
from like four carburetors 28 you know

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.590 
from like four carburetors 28 you know
what<00:04:50.160> I<00:04:50.190> mean<00:04:50.220> you<00:04:50.789> all<00:04:50.940> these<00:04:51.090> extra<00:04:51.300> Jets

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
what I mean you all these extra Jets

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.240 
what I mean you all these extra Jets
kick<00:04:51.840> in<00:04:51.990> right<00:04:52.169> when<00:04:52.440> you're<00:04:52.590> like<00:04:52.800> taking<00:04:53.190> a

corner and you're going around a curve
or<00:04:54.960> something<00:04:55.260> else<00:04:55.440> in<00:04:55.620> Sector<00:04:55.860> power<00:04:56.070> kicks

motorcycle<00:05:49.060> you<00:05:49.720> just<00:05:50.169> got<00:05:50.320> to<00:05:50.350> have<00:05:50.560> the<00:05:50.770> you

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
motorcycle you just got to have the you

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.800 
motorcycle you just got to have the you
just<00:05:51.580> you<00:05:51.699> just<00:05:51.760> kind<00:05:52.060> of<00:05:52.090> need<00:05:52.240> to<00:05:52.330> kind<00:05:52.660> of<00:05:52.690> a

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
just you just kind of need to kind of a

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.000 
just you just kind of need to kind of a
spike<00:05:53.350> in<00:05:53.560> the<00:05:54.370> power<00:05:54.639> curve<00:05:55.680> you<00:05:56.680> know<00:05:56.800> if

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
spike in the power curve you know if

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.290 
spike in the power curve you know if
it's<00:05:57.160> a<00:05:57.220> bit<00:05:57.370> too<00:05:57.550> linear<00:05:57.760> it<00:05:57.970> doesn't<00:05:58.180> matter

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
it's a bit too linear it doesn't matter

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.510 
it's a bit too linear it doesn't matter
how<00:05:58.570> high<00:05:58.840> the<00:05:58.900> power<00:05:59.169> goes<00:05:59.500> you're<00:06:00.280> not<00:06:00.370> going

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
how high the power goes you're not going

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.350 
how high the power goes you're not going
to<00:06:00.580> feel<00:06:00.699> it<00:06:00.850> because<00:06:00.940> it's<00:06:01.120> a<00:06:01.389> gradual<00:06:01.780> build

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
to feel it because it's a gradual build

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.700 
to feel it because it's a gradual build
the<00:06:04.360> ways<00:06:04.510> around<00:06:04.690> that<00:06:04.990> you<00:06:05.410> can<00:06:05.560> like

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
the ways around that you can like

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.640 
the ways around that you can like
feather<00:06:05.979> the<00:06:06.160> clutch<00:06:06.370> and<00:06:06.400> whatnot<00:06:07.000> you<00:06:07.389> know

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
feather the clutch and whatnot you know

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.390 
feather the clutch and whatnot you know
so<00:06:08.650> it's<00:06:08.680> still

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.040 

I'll<00:06:12.400> tell<00:06:12.610> you<00:06:12.700> though<00:06:12.880> when<00:06:13.450> I<00:06:13.480> go<00:06:13.630> back<00:06:13.810> onto

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
I'll tell you though when I go back onto

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.830 
I'll tell you though when I go back onto
my<00:06:14.139> ninja<00:06:15.030> for<00:06:16.030> the<00:06:16.120> first<00:06:16.300> little<00:06:16.570> while

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
my ninja for the first little while

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.600 
my ninja for the first little while
it'll<00:06:17.200> it<00:06:17.590> will<00:06:17.800> feel<00:06:18.160> gutless<00:06:19.230> because<00:06:20.230> I'm

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
it'll it will feel gutless because I'm

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.220 
it'll it will feel gutless because I'm
gotten<00:06:21.610> used<00:06:21.940> to<00:06:22.060> riding<00:06:22.240> this<00:06:22.480> even<00:06:23.110> though<00:06:23.200> I

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
gotten used to riding this even though I

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.540 
gotten used to riding this even though I
won't<00:06:23.440> be<00:06:23.530> around<00:06:23.590> us<00:06:23.830> ashore<00:06:24.070> time<00:06:24.310> I've

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
won't be around us ashore time I've

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.650 
won't be around us ashore time I've
still<00:06:25.050> got<00:06:26.050> a<00:06:26.080> feel<00:06:26.410> for<00:06:26.710> its<00:06:26.860> power<00:06:27.540> you<00:06:28.540> know

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
still got a feel for its power you know

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.590 
still got a feel for its power you know
because<00:06:29.880> when<00:06:30.880> you<00:06:30.970> get<00:06:31.090> when<00:06:31.240> you<00:06:31.300> move<00:06:31.419> to<00:06:31.570> a

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
because when you get when you move to a

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.030 
because when you get when you move to a
more<00:06:31.630> powerful<00:06:31.930> bike<00:06:32.320> you<00:06:32.500> only<00:06:32.620> feel<00:06:32.889> the

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040 
more powerful bike you only feel the

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.430 
more powerful bike you only feel the
power<00:06:33.220> for<00:06:33.940> like<00:06:34.060> a<00:06:34.090> day<00:06:34.300> or<00:06:34.660> two<00:06:34.840> that's<00:06:35.260> it

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
power for like a day or two that's it

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.290 
power for like a day or two that's it
and<00:06:35.919> then<00:06:36.100> and<00:06:36.550> then<00:06:36.610> you<00:06:36.820> don't<00:06:36.970> feel<00:06:37.090> it<00:06:37.120> as

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
and then and then you don't feel it as

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.379 
and then and then you don't feel it as
much<00:06:37.450> because<00:06:37.570> your<00:06:37.840> body<00:06:38.790> you<00:06:39.790> know<00:06:39.910> like<00:06:40.240> the

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:40.389 
much because your body you know like the

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:41.970 
much because your body you know like the
first<00:06:40.600> time<00:06:40.810> you<00:06:40.870> gunned<00:06:41.139> it<00:06:41.169> your<00:06:41.470> head<00:06:41.650> flips

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:41.980 
first time you gunned it your head flips

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.310 
first time you gunned it your head flips
back<00:06:42.220> from<00:06:42.639> the<00:06:42.730> power<00:06:42.990> but<00:06:43.990> it's<00:06:44.110> not<00:06:44.200> going

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:44.320 
back from the power but it's not going

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.659 
back from the power but it's not going
to<00:06:44.410> flip<00:06:44.560> back<00:06:44.710> every<00:06:45.040> time<00:06:45.220> doesn't<00:06:45.610> matter

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:45.669 
to flip back every time doesn't matter

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:47.909 
to flip back every time doesn't matter
how<00:06:45.910> powerful<00:06:46.120> the<00:06:46.390> bike<00:06:46.540> is<00:06:46.750> your<00:06:47.500> next<00:06:47.770> going

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 
how powerful the bike is your next going

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:50.730 
how powerful the bike is your next going
to<00:06:47.980> brace<00:06:48.250> for<00:06:48.550> it<00:06:49.140> so<00:06:50.140> the<00:06:50.230> first<00:06:50.380> couple<00:06:50.710> of

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
to brace for it so the first couple of

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.080 
to brace for it so the first couple of
times<00:06:50.830> you<00:06:51.040> got<00:06:51.280> it<00:06:51.430> yeah<00:06:51.640> you're<00:06:51.790> like<00:06:51.880> whoa

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
times you got it yeah you're like whoa

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.420 
times you got it yeah you're like whoa
its<00:06:52.450> powerful<00:06:52.840> but<00:06:53.380> then<00:06:53.500> after<00:06:53.740> that<00:06:53.860> doesn't

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.430 
its powerful but then after that doesn't

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.770 
its powerful but then after that doesn't
matter<00:06:54.520> how<00:06:54.610> much<00:06:54.820> you<00:06:54.940> gonna<00:06:55.090> your<00:06:55.570> heads<00:06:55.720> not

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:55.780 
matter how much you gonna your heads not

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.550 
matter how much you gonna your heads not
going<00:06:56.050> to<00:06:56.110> go<00:06:56.169> back<00:06:56.350> because<00:06:56.590> your<00:06:56.830> body

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 
going to go back because your body

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.510 
going to go back because your body
automatically<00:06:59.560> that's<00:07:00.100> something<00:07:00.430> that's

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
automatically that's something that's

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.340 
automatically that's something that's
the<00:07:00.669> key<00:07:00.850> word<00:07:00.880> there<00:07:01.060> compensates<00:07:02.020> for<00:07:02.140> it

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:02.350 
the key word there compensates for it

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.110 
the key word there compensates for it
even<00:07:02.650> if<00:07:02.830> you<00:07:02.890> try<00:07:03.100> to<00:07:03.130> relax<00:07:03.490> and<00:07:03.760> try<00:07:03.910> to<00:07:03.940> let

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120 
even if you try to relax and try to let

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.100 
even if you try to relax and try to let
your<00:07:04.210> head<00:07:04.300> get<00:07:04.390> your<00:07:04.450> body<00:07:04.690> will<00:07:04.930> just

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110 
your head get your body will just

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.110 
your head get your body will just
automatically<00:07:05.710> you<00:07:06.490> know<00:07:06.669> what's<00:07:06.970> going<00:07:07.060> to

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 
automatically you know what's going to

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.060 
automatically you know what's going to
happen<00:07:07.210> it's<00:07:08.110> amazing<00:07:08.350> how<00:07:08.590> you<00:07:08.800> can

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070 
happen it's amazing how you can

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.650 
happen it's amazing how you can
automatically<00:07:09.610> compensate<00:07:10.270> for<00:07:10.450> things<00:07:10.570> like

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:10.660 
automatically compensate for things like

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.310 
automatically compensate for things like
that

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:12.320 
that

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.350 
that
so<00:07:12.950> when<00:07:13.100> I<00:07:13.130> go<00:07:13.280> back<00:07:13.430> to<00:07:13.490> my<00:07:13.670> motorcycle

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 
so when I go back to my motorcycle

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.820 
so when I go back to my motorcycle
what's<00:07:14.450> going<00:07:14.600> to<00:07:14.690> happen<00:07:14.990> is<00:07:15.110> my<00:07:15.380> body<00:07:15.590> is

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:15.830 
what's going to happen is my body is

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.620 
what's going to happen is my body is
going<00:07:15.950> to<00:07:16.010> overcompensate<00:07:16.880> I'm<00:07:17.360> going<00:07:17.540> to

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:17.630 
going to overcompensate I'm going to

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.810 
going to overcompensate I'm going to
twist<00:07:17.810> the<00:07:17.990> throttle<00:07:18.140> on<00:07:18.500> my<00:07:18.650> ninja<00:07:19.100> and<00:07:19.430> my

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:19.820 
twist the throttle on my ninja and my

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.130 
twist the throttle on my ninja and my
body<00:07:20.030> is<00:07:20.150> going<00:07:20.240> to<00:07:20.300> like<00:07:20.480> tense<00:07:20.750> up<00:07:20.990> and

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.140 
body is going to like tense up and

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.900 
body is going to like tense up and
nothing's<00:07:21.980> going<00:07:22.160> to<00:07:22.190> happen<00:07:22.250> because<00:07:22.730> i'll

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:22.910 
nothing's going to happen because i'll

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.940 
nothing's going to happen because i'll
be<00:07:23.090> over<00:07:23.420> tensing<00:07:24.080> you<00:07:24.410> know<00:07:24.500> and<00:07:24.710> then<00:07:24.800> it'll

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:24.950 
be over tensing you know and then it'll

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.590 
be over tensing you know and then it'll
feel<00:07:25.250> like<00:07:25.280> my<00:07:25.730> body<00:07:25.940> will<00:07:26.090> actually<00:07:26.360> be<00:07:26.450> like

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:26.600 
feel like my body will actually be like
