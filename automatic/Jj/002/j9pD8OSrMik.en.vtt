00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.510
 data or student pass and all that 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.299
 people that I had already added and I did not 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.710
 I was challenging a pokÃ©mon a pokemon battle 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.830
 sorry 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:02.290
 What I have done has been to erase it 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.409
 of the friend code 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.870
 but temporarily, then that's it 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.599
 I say, hey, look, I've already done the 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.769
 pokemon battles can you get back to 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.959
 send your codes to accept 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.290
 and that is to have everything organized 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:20.019
 in 3ds also of just having people 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.690
 that has challenged me to go fighting little to 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:29.660
 little with him and that nobody stays yes 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:31.670
 without the challenge and well you understand me the 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.980
 thing is that is not because I do not want you 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.930
 have or nothing simply is that when 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.770
 I 'm done with all the people who have 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:43.120
 sent battles and so on 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:46.160
 then already then it is admit again 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.300
 and well the rules that this does not 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.780
 explain in the previous video and that is 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:57.200
 the pokemon is individual battles of 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.230
 level 100 and you can not take any 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.940
 legendary that's the only yes rule that 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.540
 I put no legendary if not with 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:09.530
 pokemon type monkey type in times 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.770
 normal not without being legendary 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.920
 and that they are of level 100 and that therefore 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:19.489
 just when you see me connected to me 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.139
 re taiz with those standards and I will accept you 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.280
 when it is accepted and we start to fight it is 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:27.290
 that I'm recording so I notice everything 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.450
 that only one game will be played 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.180
 each person is not worth of script that 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.990
 before I lost I want again to repeat 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.780
 I've won or I know anything 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.950
 I'm just going to share at least for 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:46.180
 record with each one once 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.890
 and well basically that's what I wanted 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.170

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.920

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.530
 depends what success you have and 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.770
 Well, this is going to be the first 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:09.500
 round if I see that when I finish the first 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.470

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.500
 have liked this video 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:28.490
 I can really feel it because of my voice 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.850
 snore and I'm going to try to heal that and 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.660
 take care of me as best as possible so as not to 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.450
 come back as soon as possible because I have 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.800
 very much desire if I had thought 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.750
 if it is that in the calendar that I have 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.760
 here in my notebook I already had everything 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.190
 aimed to start from him from 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.150
 Yesterday 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:48.520
 and I could not so really apologize 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.140
 but I already seriously want to go back like that 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.440
 when I remove this hoarseness 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.820

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.260
 soon I will not continue 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.780
 forcing because he gave me that every time 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.010
 I speak more worse it puts me so I hope 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.730
 that you liked and until the next 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.730
