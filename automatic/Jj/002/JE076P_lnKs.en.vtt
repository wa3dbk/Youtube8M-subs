before<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.250> get<00:00:38.430> into<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.660> know<00:00:39.780> how<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.170> make

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
before we get into you know how to make

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.240 
before we get into you know how to make
you<00:00:41.310> know<00:00:41.340> sauerkraut<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.060> kimchi<00:00:42.500> I<00:00:43.500> want<00:00:44.130> to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
you know sauerkraut and kimchi I want to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.150 
you know sauerkraut and kimchi I want to
address<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:45.060> larger<00:00:45.540> question<00:00:45.860> what<00:00:46.860> is

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
address a larger question what is

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.060 
address a larger question what is
fermentation<00:00:48.060> anyway<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.530> why<00:00:49.770> should

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
fermentation anyway and and why should

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.940 
fermentation anyway and and why should
we<00:00:50.190> care<00:00:50.370> about<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:52.470> know<00:00:52.590> broadly

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
we care about it so you know broadly

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.790 
we care about it so you know broadly
speaking<00:00:54.140> fermentation<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.470> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
speaking fermentation is the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.210 
speaking fermentation is the
transformative<00:00:56.790> action<00:00:57.630> of<00:00:58.220> microorganisms

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
transformative action of microorganisms

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.780 
transformative action of microorganisms
the<00:00:59.970> number<00:01:00.360> one<00:01:00.630> reason<00:01:01.230> why<00:01:01.260> people<00:01:01.790> ferment

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
the number one reason why people ferment

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.680 
the number one reason why people ferment
food<00:01:03.150> is<00:01:03.630> to<00:01:04.440> preserve<00:01:05.190> it<00:01:05.690> specifically

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
food is to preserve it specifically

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.430 
food is to preserve it specifically
acids<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.650> alcohol<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.270> think<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:09.990> bio

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
acids and alcohol we can think of as bio

acids and alcohol we can think of as bio
preservatives<00:01:11.430> they're<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.820> products<00:01:12.510> of

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
preservatives they're the products of

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.710 
preservatives they're the products of
biological<00:01:13.010> processes<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.970> enable<00:01:15.240> foods

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
biological processes that enable foods

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.280 
biological processes that enable foods
to<00:01:16.050> be<00:01:16.200> preserved<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.920> be<00:01:17.130> more<00:01:17.400> stable<00:01:18.290> I'm

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
to be preserved to be more stable I'm

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.200 
to be preserved to be more stable I'm
constantly<00:01:19.770> trying<00:01:20.010> to<00:01:20.070> think<00:01:20.369> about<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
constantly trying to think about the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.530 
constantly trying to think about the
context<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.930> food<00:01:22.200> before<00:01:22.970> everybody<00:01:23.970> had<00:01:24.240> a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
context of food before everybody had a

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.690 
context of food before everybody had a
fermentation<00:01:25.260> slowing<00:01:26.070> machine<00:01:26.400> I'll<00:01:26.550> bet

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
fermentation slowing machine I'll bet

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.240 
fermentation slowing machine I'll bet
that<00:01:26.729> everybody<00:01:27.300> in<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.410> room<00:01:28.710> has

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
that everybody in this in this room has

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.430 
that everybody in this in this room has
a<00:01:29.280> fermentation<00:01:29.910> slowing<00:01:30.660> machine<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.290> their

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
a fermentation slowing machine in their

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.780 
a fermentation slowing machine in their
kitchen<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.010> that's<00:01:32.070> that's<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.490> refrigerator

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
kitchen and that's that's a refrigerator

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.210 
kitchen and that's that's a refrigerator
that's<00:01:33.270> really<00:01:33.509> what<00:01:33.660> a<00:01:33.690> refrigerator<00:01:34.220> does

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
that's really what a refrigerator does

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.150 
that's really what a refrigerator does
is<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.910> slows<00:01:36.119> down<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:37.200> microbial

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
is it slows down the microbial

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.060 
is it slows down the microbial
transformation<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.119> your<00:01:39.300> food<00:01:39.540> with<00:01:40.530> Kaffir

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
transformation of your food with Kaffir

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.050 
transformation of your food with Kaffir
nothing<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:43.610> just<00:01:44.610> put<00:01:44.910> a

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
nothing like that you just just put a

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.500 
nothing like that you just just put a
couple<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.660> spoonfuls<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.850> grains<00:01:47.850> into<00:01:48.330> a

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
couple of spoonfuls of the grains into a

it on your counter for 24-48 some people

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.980 
it on your counter for 24-48 some people
would<00:02:01.950> say<00:02:02.130> 72<00:02:02.850> hours<00:02:03.240> depends<00:02:03.870> you<00:02:03.930> know

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
would say 72 hours depends you know

acids accumulate over time it just

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.530 
acids accumulate over time it just
depends<00:02:06.900> how<00:02:07.050> sharp<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.950> like<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.310> flavor

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
depends how sharp you like the flavor

depends how sharp you like the flavor
just<00:02:09.540> leave<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.869> on<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.500> counter<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.100> couple

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
just leave it on the counter a couple

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.670 
just leave it on the counter a couple
times<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.300> period<00:02:12.600> give<00:02:13.350> it<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.500> little

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
times in that period give it a little

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.000 
times in that period give it a little
shake<00:02:14.010> just<00:02:14.670> move<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.090> around<00:02:15.440> think<00:02:16.440> about<00:02:16.709> me

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
shake just move it around think about me

air but there's always a surface there's
always<00:03:00.550> you<00:03:01.450> know<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:02.129> place<00:03:03.129> where<00:03:04.440> where

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
always you know a place where where

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.320 
always you know a place where where
where<00:03:05.769> the<00:03:06.190> liquid<00:03:06.489> that<00:03:06.790> you're<00:03:06.879> protecting

where the liquid that you're protecting

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.890 
where the liquid that you're protecting
the<00:03:07.420> vegetables<00:03:07.900> under<00:03:08.319> meets<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.580> air<00:03:09.900> so

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
the vegetables under meets the air so

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.039 
the vegetables under meets the air so
this<00:03:11.140> is<00:03:11.349> a<00:03:11.379> very<00:03:11.620> cleverly<00:03:12.160> engineered

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
this is a very cleverly engineered

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.780 
this is a very cleverly engineered
solution<00:03:14.049> that<00:03:14.950> you<00:03:15.069> know<00:03:15.160> that<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:15.519> surface

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
solution that you know that that surface

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.180 
solution that you know that that surface
is<00:03:16.269> a<00:03:16.330> place<00:03:16.720> where<00:03:16.989> molds<00:03:17.470> can<00:03:17.530> happen<00:03:18.040> and

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
is a place where molds can happen and

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.680 
is a place where molds can happen and
I'll<00:03:18.250> bet<00:03:18.459> that<00:03:18.489> when<00:03:18.819> we<00:03:18.940> get<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.299> the<00:03:19.420> Q&amp;A

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
I'll bet that when we get to the Q&amp;A

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.780 
I'll bet that when we get to the Q&amp;A
part<00:03:20.140> of<00:03:20.290> this<00:03:20.440> a<00:03:20.709> lot<00:03:21.340> of<00:03:21.370> people's<00:03:21.730> questions

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
part of this a lot of people's questions

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.509 
part of this a lot of people's questions
might<00:03:22.540> be<00:03:22.569> about<00:03:23.079> surface<00:03:23.680> moles<00:03:24.010> because

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
might be about surface moles because

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.699 
might be about surface moles because
that's<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.880> number<00:03:25.030> one<00:03:25.480> problem<00:03:26.440> that

know just people have always had to

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.150 
know just people have always had to
contend<00:03:32.170> with<00:03:32.260> when<00:03:32.620> they<00:03:32.709> deal<00:03:32.890> with<00:03:33.040> this

and<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.790> know<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.780> molds<00:03:35.200> that<00:03:35.349> grow<00:03:35.530> on

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
and you know the the molds that grow on

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.130 
and you know the the molds that grow on
the<00:03:35.739> surface<00:03:36.250> you<00:03:36.700> skim<00:03:37.090> them<00:03:37.269> away<00:03:37.569> and<00:03:37.930> your

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
sauerkraut is still edible you don't

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.850 
sauerkraut is still edible you don't
need<00:03:39.879> to<00:03:40.000> worry<00:03:40.209> about<00:03:40.299> that<00:03:40.660> you<00:03:41.290> fill<00:03:41.530> up<00:03:41.680> the

put it down somewhere and press down or

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.300 
put it down somewhere and press down or
you<00:03:49.299> can<00:03:49.420> use<00:03:49.540> a<00:03:49.569> nice<00:03:49.810> tool<00:03:50.170> like<00:03:50.410> this<00:03:50.709> and

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
you can use a nice tool like this and

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.129 
you can use a nice tool like this and
really<00:03:52.090> get<00:03:52.329> it<00:03:52.450> so<00:03:55.739> everyone<00:03:56.739> get<00:03:56.859> an<00:03:56.920> idea<00:03:57.220> of

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
really get it so everyone get an idea of

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.479 
really get it so everyone get an idea of
what<00:03:59.139> I<00:03:59.170> mean<00:03:59.410> when<00:03:59.470> I'm<00:03:59.709> when<00:04:00.190> I<00:04:00.220> say

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
what I mean when I'm when I say

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.599 
what I mean when I'm when I say

of ways the the first change is is what

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.460 
of ways the the first change is is what
I<00:04:10.599> call<00:04:11.069> pre-digestion<00:04:12.069> the<00:04:12.880> fermentation

and our digestive tracts and I think
that<00:04:24.430> I<00:04:24.460> think<00:04:24.760> that<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.150> food<00:04:25.389> that<00:04:25.419> really
