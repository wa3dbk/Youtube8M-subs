00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.840
 Hey, youtube people, I 'm benfiquista. 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.410
 and today I'm going to bring you a gameplay 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.870
 of the zombie and tsunami game is a new game 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.120
 relatively common to say so 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.309
 but he is very good and has lots of 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.759
 quality a lot of people liked it was 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.619
 updated how to know this was for the 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.289
 christmas person only ever updated 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.839
 monthly it has been updated is at one 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.630
 game very good to see that many people play 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:35.440
 initially you can see that he 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:38.269
 brings a semblance of an even good 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.090
 initially when I found the game 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.920
 I found it very bad at first but then 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.010
 I saw him and him because he is very 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.190
 good you see mr weak graphics 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.199
 appearance is very do not work on 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.820
 graphics and for me graphics against much 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.530
 but it's a game that in the beginning 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.499
 It really is kind of boring at the beginning of the phase. 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.559
 But then when you're already playing alone 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:05.239
 take the faults here, come on, it's okay 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:14.720
 fun, it's very good, same for you 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:16.880
 see the car does not have 18 pass and is good 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.100
 When you get used to teeth 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.070
 looks online so you 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.450
 takes some upgrades which is very good 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.910
 game to get better 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.130
 I really like this game very much 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.330
 developers even succeeded in 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.520
 your proposal 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:40.510
 You see, there we go, I got a power. 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:43.510
 pop now the ninja solve the deal 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.510
 blog 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.820
 I liked it a lot. 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:01.720
 ready now and already on top ninja 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.720
 I can not do everything I want 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.759
 then when you get to have several one 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.340
 bis 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:15.400
 the game becomes more difficult and challenging and 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.870
 then it starts to be really difficult. 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.360
 Which one is better why you can get it? 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.120
 a tsunami that comes out killing everything is 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.940
 very good indeed and you accumulate a lot 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.489
 money but can make upgrades 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.870
 Let's make a brief comment 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.959
 this game has a great variation of 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.640
 colors of taaz colors are pretty cool in the 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.569
 Case s four years in other 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.090
 gadgets 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.940
 the screen does not fail to fail the game has a 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.830
 nice proposal that takes brains and the 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.380
 complete missions is completing now 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.100
 plus a certain amount of brains 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:52.510
 you can improve on trophy serve you 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.070
 saw if in the trophy you can 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.320
 You 're going to have the mission complete. 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.110
 things in the game and completing missions 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:04.820
 and less money and market you can 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.109
 buy is what the things of the day 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.470
 missions you can buy 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:12.850
 unlock with money hat or cap 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.700
 You said you called your club. 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.100

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:24.350

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:26.870
 here I teach a thousand that you can take 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:31.730
 for the money she generated from the real 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:35.540
 grana buff a pay to improve the game 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.880
 the changes that the game had with the 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.579
 Christmas 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.890
 basically no only the snow 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.519
 falls from the sky and the scenery behind that is 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.040
 snow 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.750
 Other than that, it's all personal.
