able to print the colors on top and then

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.020 
able to print the colors on top and then
run<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.299> garment<00:01:43.720> through<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.990> conveyor<00:01:44.320> and

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
run the garment through the conveyor and

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.929 
run the garment through the conveyor and
in<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.180> oven<00:01:46.360> it<00:01:46.780> should<00:01:46.840> dry<00:01:47.799> I<00:01:48.130> mean<00:01:48.670> it

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
in the oven it should dry I mean it

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.030 
in the oven it should dry I mean it
should<00:01:49.180> discharge<00:01:49.420> all<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.049> way<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:50.439> the

should discharge all the way and the

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.480 
should discharge all the way and the
colors<00:01:51.430> should<00:01:51.760> look<00:01:52.060> just<00:01:52.360> as<00:01:52.510> vibrant

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.060
