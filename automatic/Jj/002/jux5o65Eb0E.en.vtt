00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 in 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.260
 hello to you this Sunday's trick 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.390
 will be to optimize performance 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.369
 wifi from your laptop 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.800
 I'll explain if you have a computer 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.380
 notebook and you noticed that 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.329
 the wireless wi fi only 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.009
 reactivates more after a sleep 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.320
 the problem is certainly due to 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.200
 power consumption settings 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.760
 when this one is on battery then 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.130
 to conserve power and 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.780
 optimal performance of your connection 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.610
 with windows 7 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.440
 just change the settings of 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.810
 consumption of the machine when that 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.190
 it is on battery then to optimize 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.690
 the wifi performance of your 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.000
 laptop 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.940
 here's how to do would unroll the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.160

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.300
 who is currently ticking and click 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.220
 on the link modify the parameters of the 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.420
 fashion 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.800
 then click on the link 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.940
 change power settings 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.580
 have it here in the options box

 open source spotted is 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.790
 unwound the parameters section of the 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.930
 wireless cards then economy mode

 click on the current link of the 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.180
 heading on battery as savings 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.600
 average energy 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.330
 in our example unrolled now the 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.520
 menu by clicking on the small arrow and 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.970
